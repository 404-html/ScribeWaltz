1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Three two one</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Bam would live.</v>

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>We got up early as a motherfucker,</v>

4
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:08.844
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.803
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

6
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It's 10:00 AM it.</v>

7
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Didn't we do one at like 4:00 AM before?</v>

8
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>We didn't want that 5:00 AM for it.</v>

9
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Was it for,</v>

10
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>it was a a is a England card,</v>

11
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Was it something [inaudible] or something?</v>

13
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Congo and might've been,</v>

14
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>it might've been China,</v>

15
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:26.491
<v Speaker 1>but China.</v>

16
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what time is in Africa right now?</v>

17
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.783
<v Speaker 1>Is it yesterday?</v>

18
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's there.</v>

19
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Is it Wednesday now?</v>

20
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely 1960</v>

21
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I forgot he knocked out Whitaker.</v>

22
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at Wonderboy stop and Whitaker.</v>

23
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

24
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

25
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

26
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>that's 70 yeah,</v>

27
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>but that was,</v>

28
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Whitaker was diminished man.</v>

29
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Getting down to one 70 it was a fucking battle for him.</v>

30
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you look at Wonderboy w what he's accomplished?</v>

31
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>It's so impressive.</v>

32
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>All the indicators would point that Wonderboy should win this fight,</v>

33
00:00:58.651 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

34
00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

35
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the fence man.</v>

36
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I think till really is a bad,</v>

38
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>bad man.</v>

39
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>

40
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>But he did come up real short on the way in,</v>

41
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>which really bums me out.</v>

42
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Now I had heard that his pregnant girlfriend is in,</v>

43
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>this is what everyone's saying is in the hospital and that she's had some</v>

44
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>serious issues and he's been going back and forth to the hospital and he hasn't,</v>

45
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>we just didn't have a chance to cut the weight.</v>

46
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

47
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people claim you know that.</v>

48
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what the,</v>

49
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:31.411
<v Speaker 1>what the issue was.</v>

50
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that drama is never good.</v>

51
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Especially your first main card,</v>

52
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>main event in your hometown against Wonderboy.</v>

53
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>There's enough pressure as it is.</v>

54
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>the cowboy five was big pressure fight,</v>

56
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:44.170
<v Speaker 1>but he rose to the occasion was it,</v>

57
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.731
<v Speaker 1>was it,</v>

58
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>cause we didn't know who he was really.</v>

59
00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>You haven't,</v>

60
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>this is opportunity for sure,</v>

61
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>but you're fighting a smaller guy.</v>

62
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>It's cowboy,</v>

63
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:50.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>so he goes forward and does work.</v>

65
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like,</v>

66
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

67
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been guys who have blown up before,</v>

68
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>but the hype on a till and I'm all up on his dick,</v>

69
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.051
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

70
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton of hype on it.</v>

71
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>If you went into this one,</v>

72
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>it's off to the races.</v>

73
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.981
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

74
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but he's fucking four and a half pounds over championship weight.</v>

75
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>That is a lot.</v>

76
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.811
<v Speaker 1>That's not a little,</v>

77
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>

78
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>It's such an advantage to,</v>

79
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>fighters that have missed weight are undefeated this year.</v>

81
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>When they feel fight,</v>

82
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.363
<v Speaker 1>they're undefeated.</v>

83
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

84
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a big advantage.</v>

85
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that was one cheating.</v>

86
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>It is a fun if you do it on purpose for sure.</v>

87
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I think what's interesting with Wonderboy did,</v>

88
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>he said you've got to weigh one 88 the next day type move.</v>

89
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Just kills them are big boy.</v>

90
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>It kills a really big boy.</v>

92
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

93
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.801
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

94
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever advantage that he got from not cutting that extra three pounds,</v>

95
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

96
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>And now he's a three and a half pounds.</v>

97
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Now he's lost a little bit of it.</v>

98
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:40.914
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's,</v>

99
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>if you're Wonderboy though,</v>

100
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you want to drag this into later rounds,</v>

101
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna come out aggressive.</v>

103
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:45.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

104
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>he said some drama,</v>

105
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>cutting weight and he had this cut more weight to maintain it the day,</v>

106
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.271
<v Speaker 1>the day of.</v>

107
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.030
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

108
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>it's all fascinating,</v>

109
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

110
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>So fascinating.</v>

111
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>We're going to find out a lot.</v>

112
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.241
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is too,</v>

113
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>the styles,</v>

114
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>like what Wonderboy does</v>

115
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>is a kicking distance.</v>

116
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Like if you watch like the exchanges that he's at,</v>

117
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 2>he moves real good at the waist,</v>

118
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:08.291
<v Speaker 2>like a snake,</v>

119
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>like back and forth,</v>

120
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 2>but he wants to keep you not even at Moitai taking distance.</v>

121
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 2>He keeps you at karate kick in distance,</v>

122
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 2>far sideways at very far,</v>

123
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>far stuff to reach.</v>

124
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Dan's got to close that gap and closing that gap is when wonder boys the most</v>

125
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and if you see some of his training footage,</v>

126
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>he seems to be concentrating on blitzing in and lent and countering and</v>

127
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.300
<v Speaker 2>sidestepping and countering door.</v>

128
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 2>If you look at Wonderboy as history,</v>

129
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 2>whenever we fight the aggressive dudes,</v>

130
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 2>they get fucked up.</v>

131
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

132
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:40.610
<v Speaker 2>that's like that Scott,</v>

133
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.970
<v Speaker 2>who wants to start?</v>

134
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're on and that's what till wants to do.</v>

135
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

136
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>that's very interesting.</v>

137
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling him that if nothing in the slight would surprise me and list down</v>

138
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.030
<v Speaker 2>until just goes out there and just just no respect merchant.</v>

139
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that would surprise me.</v>

140
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 2>But if till does win strap a fucking rocket ship that boys back cause in other</v>

141
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Bisping's retired UK need to face,</v>

142
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 2>that's him that he's the fucking guy man.</v>

143
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.971
<v Speaker 2>Even if he loses,</v>

144
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 2>he could still be that he's 25 years old.</v>

145
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

146
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 2>but not to that extent.</v>

147
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.980
<v Speaker 2>You know like you beat Wonderboy and knock out Wonderboy.</v>

148
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.823
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking,</v>

149
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean you tell him,</v>

150
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

151
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 2>he's a super talented striker though.</v>

152
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 2>What he did to cowboy.</v>

153
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just impressive.</v>

154
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 2>It was like complete domination.</v>

155
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.993
<v Speaker 2>Demoralized,</v>

156
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 2>just controlled the range.</v>

157
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 2>He controlled every single aspect of the exchange is cowboy got like one good</v>

158
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 2>knee off at one point in time,</v>

159
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 2>but that was in one good right hand to the body.</v>

160
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I rewatched the fight the other day just to kind of get amped up.</v>

161
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Impressive.</v>

162
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.471
<v Speaker 2>Oh my.</v>

163
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 2>He obliterated them.</v>

164
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing too about till I think get so much hype is a lot of guys talk</v>

188
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.083
<v Speaker 2>This card.</v>

189
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.960

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.751
<v Speaker 2>You were in,</v>

195
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know who we're going to have Gunnar Nelson on the card though.</v>

196
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 2>He's going to announce it on the car.</v>

197
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.681
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

198
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:21.251
<v Speaker 2>he got hurt.</v>

199
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 2>But you don't have Gunnar Nelson.</v>

200
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:22.631
<v Speaker 2>Neil Magna,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

203
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 2>It's so great fight.</v>

204
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 2>They were going to do Gunnar Nelson until,</v>

205
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason they decided to go with Wonderboy.</v>

206
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.291
<v Speaker 2>Jason Knight.</v>

207

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.371
<v Speaker 2>Connie.</v>

226
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:42.850

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

229
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.421
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

230
00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:44.640
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

231
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

232
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.431
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

233
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>he lives in Finland,</v>

234
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.381
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

235
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>what is his background?</v>

236
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.833
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

237
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 2>he's a really good wrestler who also has wild ass strikes mouth.</v>

238
00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

239
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Super five for your boy.</v>

240
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

241
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

242
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Lila magnae who's Neil and magnified now for Wonderboy though there's not,</v>

243
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 2>there's not a ton of upside.</v>

244
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he took it to be honest.</v>

245
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

246
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a good matchup for him.</v>

247
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

248
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.601
<v Speaker 2>it's you're,</v>

249
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>you're in dangerous territory,</v>

250
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:16.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

251
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting the number nine guy.</v>

252
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 2>You ranked number one,</v>

253
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 2>he missed his weight.</v>

254
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 2>He's huge.</v>

255
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.393
<v Speaker 2>Like there's just,</v>

256
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I feel like all the pressure's off Wonderboy right now,</v>

257
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 2>especially after he missed the weight.</v>

258
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.803
<v Speaker 2>But I just,</v>

259
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>if you're Wonderboy and even if you starch till,</v>

260
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 2>they're not giving you a title shot until Woodley loses that strap.</v>

261
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy is not fighting for a title 14 two and one for wonder.</v>

262
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:38.181
<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>

263
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>You got to remember the only loss was to Tyron Woodley and then two,</v>

264
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm Matt Brown.</v>

265
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Those two fights and one draw with Woodley.</v>

266
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.493
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

267
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 2>That's why couldn't you fight with the again,</v>

268
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.213
<v Speaker 2>they fought.</v>

269
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the,</v>

270
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's asking.</v>

271
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.861
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

272
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:55.281
<v Speaker 2>he's saying,</v>

273
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 2>why don't I get a shot at the interim title?</v>

274
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 2>How are you giving the interim title to Colby Covington who only beat Damien</v>

275
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.131
<v Speaker 2>Maia,</v>

276
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 2>who's 40 years old who's clearly past his prime.</v>

277
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.101
<v Speaker 2>How was,</v>

278
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.070
<v Speaker 2>how was that good enough to get him a shot at the interim title?</v>

279
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 2>And I talked a lot of shit.</v>

280
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

281
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

282
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 2>there you go basically yet.</v>

283
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 2>But it goes along with the same time.</v>

284
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

285
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 2>It goes a long way this day and age,</v>

286
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time with Rda,</v>

287
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

288
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing Colby and he favors send them down to,</v>

289
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

290
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

291
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 2>It's in Chicago.</v>

292
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Chicago to fight RDA,</v>

293
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

294
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Colby style,</v>

295
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the worst matchup for him.</v>

296
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 2>He's a heavy underdog,</v>

297
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.671
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

298
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:28.891
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

299
00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:29.724
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping,</v>

300
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.441
<v Speaker 2>not hoping,</v>

301
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I think what their plan would be,</v>

302
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Rda wins that fights Woodley,</v>

303
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 2>which is tough matchup for Woodley and the Rda were able to beat Woodley.</v>

304
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Then you have Wonderboy slipping or Colby wins and then you got mad shit talking</v>

305
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 2>with him and Woodley and it gets very interesting.</v>

306
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Get super intellect that fight.</v>

307
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 2>It's going to fire me and Tyron Colby has done or dog in every one of those</v>

308
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:52.844
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

309
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 2>But Rda Woodley,</v>

310
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:54.861
<v Speaker 2>you got a barn,</v>

311
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 2>burn your hands.</v>

312
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 2>That's a great matchup.</v>

313
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

314
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:57.771
<v Speaker 2>Rda.</v>

315
00:07:57.771 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Woodley's very interesting because,</v>

316
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 2>because as much as as they,</v>

317
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I love woodland.</v>

319
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I think his style is ridiculous.</v>

320
00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna be tough to beat.</v>

321
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.241
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

322
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I think they want some bit of turnover in their ugly.</v>

323
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what they want.</v>

324
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:09.704
<v Speaker 2>Some turnover.</v>

325
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.760
<v Speaker 2>What is RDA going to do with two Woodley and mean he can't,</v>

326
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to ever take him down.</v>

327
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.510
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

328
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 2>He's the only thing he's got striking,</v>

329
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 2>striking and his movements good.</v>

330
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.270
<v Speaker 2>And if it does go to the ground and his kicks,</v>

331
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.080
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough one to beat for anybody.</v>

332
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Even as striking,</v>

333
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 2>even RDA striking Woodley has,</v>

334
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll put you to sleep instantly.</v>

335
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Striking what Lee has more power.</v>

336
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Rda has better fundamentals,</v>

337
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I would say as far as putting it more type.</v>

338
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.601
<v Speaker 2>Run it together.</v>

339
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Kids with the high speed,</v>

340
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:38.260
<v Speaker 2>the power and the explosives.</v>

341
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn nightmare.</v>

342
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.960
<v Speaker 2>It's still the favorite in the fight.</v>

343
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to the ground.</v>

344
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 2>He wants it to.</v>

345
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Woodley just got through shoulder surgery.</v>

346
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.200
<v Speaker 2>He just got his Labor repaired,</v>

347
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 2>which is not the worst shoulder surgery and he does that mean exactly.</v>

348
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Stapled the Labor on labor from now the labor.</v>

349
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

350
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

351
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>he had some sort of a tear in it that it,</v>

352
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>that fucked up in the Damien Maia fight like insulin.</v>

353
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>They stitch it back together again,</v>

354
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 1>but he's gone through crazy PRP and all kinds of other shit now.</v>

355
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:10.971
<v Speaker 1>He put up a video of him hitting mitts and it's only been about three months</v>

356
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:13.240
<v Speaker 1>since the surgery and he's hitting me.</v>

357
00:09:13.241 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

358
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's an old video though.</v>

359
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.584
<v Speaker 1>He's sneaky.</v>

360
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

361
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>he put up this video,</v>

362
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.940
<v Speaker 1>he's a free him doe.</v>

363
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.401
<v Speaker 1>He might,</v>

364
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>he might be doing and we definitely got some injections.</v>

365
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about all the different things that he's going to do as far as</v>

366
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:26.950
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

367
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Speaker 1>he came on the podcast just a few weeks after shoulder surgery and he was moving</v>

368
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 1>around normal and moving his hands around normal.</v>

369
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 1>But it really depends entirely on how bad the s the big one is.</v>

370
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 1>The bicep tendon,</v>

371
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 1>when the bicep tendon gets torn off the muscle off the bone,</v>

372
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>and then they have to put it back in,</v>

373
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 1>stapled down everywhere.</v>

374
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.481
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to,</v>

375
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 1>it does work right now.</v>

376
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Now does not for pitchers if you're a pitcher and that shit goes south.</v>

377
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Not yet your dignity done,</v>

378
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but for a fighter.</v>

379
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

380
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be a problem for fighters,</v>

381
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.551
<v Speaker 1>but I bet Woodley.</v>

382
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 1>So you got RDA,</v>

383
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Colby.</v>

384
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 1>So the obviously the winner that will fight Woodley end of the year.</v>

385
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Will it be back into the year?</v>

386
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

387
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

388
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.990
<v Speaker 1>It could very well be on the December 31st card.</v>

389
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

390
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one.</v>

391
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Huge Guide.</v>

392
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

394
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:13.290

395
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:13.801
<v Speaker 1>la,</v>

396
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 1>but that's not going to happen soon.</v>

397
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

398
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.520

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

426
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of Struggle Street right now.</v>

427
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Not nearly as good.</v>

428
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>August 4th car car's not nearly as good as it was going to be.</v>

429
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

430
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>it was going to be a barn burner.</v>

431
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.720
<v Speaker 1>But in Congress,</v>

432
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.970

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

435
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of time.</v>

436
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Not because they have some time though.</v>

437
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:12.841
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

438

00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 2>does that cm punk Jackson stuff bother you Joe?</v>

00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Are you used to it now bothers me.</v>

498
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.103
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

499
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind him fighting.</v>

500
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:44.560
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great that he's fighting it and then you'll see that he's testing</v>

501
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:45.490
<v Speaker 2>himself in the UFC.</v>

502
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Even if they wanted to do in the UFC,</v>

503
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 2>have him on the F,</v>

504
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 2>you know the prelims.</v>

505
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Put them on fs one,</v>

506
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

507
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:52.923
<v Speaker 2>make it,</v>

508
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

509
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 2>making it a um,</v>

510
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.900
<v Speaker 2>a fight pass thing.</v>

511
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I think his contract one allowed that.</v>

512
00:12:57.791 --> 00:12:59.860
<v Speaker 2>I think if it's guns or pay per view,</v>

513
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I would assume if you're seeing Punky,</v>

514
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 2>have that big of a draw.</v>

515
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he was,</v>

516
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.503
<v Speaker 2>is he still,</v>

517
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 2>do you think how many people are going to buy that paper view to watch him</v>

518
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>

519
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.831
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

520
00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:09.664
<v Speaker 2>That first one,</v>

521
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:10.831
<v Speaker 2>that first one.</v>

522
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 2>You got his ass whipped so bad.</v>

523
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 2>How is the WWE like raging or is it?</v>

524
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.030
<v Speaker 2>That's why people are actually going,</v>

525
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 2>so just that raw and the raw sewage,</v>

526
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 2>which Fox has now,</v>

527
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 2>which in a lot of people I don't think they realize.</v>

528
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Fox decided to go with the WWE instead of the UFC.</v>

529
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:30.131
<v Speaker 2>They turned down the,</v>

530
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 2>you'll see and went with Doug Dob and now they have the raw sewage,</v>

531
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 2>which gets like three something million viewers every time they it.</v>

532
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.590

533
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.653
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I always bet on dudes were Harry backs.</v>

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.541

658
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:38.711
<v Speaker 5>Ucla Guy.</v>

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.470
<v Speaker 5>They do that for basketball.</v>

667
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.260
<v Speaker 5>Like some CTE and basketball</v>

668
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.840
<v Speaker 5>players that have had some problems really ramp it like the NFL obviously,</v>

669
00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:58.510
<v Speaker 5>but they get in trouble and they don't want to be liable just like the NFL.</v>

670
00:16:58.511 --> 00:16:59.344
<v Speaker 5>They get.</v>

671
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

672
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.103
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

673
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.021
<v Speaker 2>Crazy though.</v>

674
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:03.840

676
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.580
<v Speaker 2>they're the last people you'd think that would be putting people on the bench.</v>

677
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

678
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.121
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

679
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:09.080
<v Speaker 2>So she came seven.</v>

680
00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:12.080
<v Speaker 2>So what's going on with shit ESPN deal like when does that start?</v>

681
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

682
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.130
<v Speaker 2>So you have C's gonna be on ESPN?</v>

683
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

684
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:16.401
<v Speaker 2>No more fox.</v>

685
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:17.440
<v Speaker 2>No more fast done.</v>

686
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:18.501
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

687
00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:20.170
<v Speaker 2>it finishes the end of this year.</v>

688
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.700
<v Speaker 2>The Fox and ESPN,</v>

689
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:23.630
<v Speaker 2>we're going to split it,</v>

690
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

691
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

692
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:27.080
<v Speaker 2>And then fuck didn't want to pay like the premium by,</v>

693
00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:27.861
<v Speaker 2>I think it's better,</v>

694
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

695
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a home run for the UFC man to land at ESPN.</v>

696
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.020
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

697
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:32.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

698
00:17:32.371 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 2>it's as serious as it gets as far as major sports.</v>

699
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.500
<v Speaker 2>It's on one network when it,</v>

700
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.820
<v Speaker 2>and also with ESPN,</v>

701
00:17:37.821 --> 00:17:38.960
<v Speaker 2>two of ESPN plus,</v>

702
00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 2>which we'll get some fight nights and you have regular ESPN,</v>

703
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:42.680
<v Speaker 2>ESPN two with Fox.</v>

704
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Not that they didn't do a great job,</v>

705
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:46.670
<v Speaker 2>but it was off FXX fs to it.</v>

706
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.421
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck,</v>

707
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:47.981
<v Speaker 2>where is it,</v>

708
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:48.450
<v Speaker 2>where is it?</v>

709
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 2>And announce on UFC fight pass and out to here.</v>

710
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.363
<v Speaker 2>And it was just,</v>

711
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 2>I think ESPN can learn from the mistakes from Fox and just make it that much</v>

712
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

713
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right about that because there's been some times that I thought I</v>

714
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 2>had my DVR set,</v>

715
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.360
<v Speaker 2>but then I get home and it was on fs one I'm like mother fucker or sometimes be</v>

716
00:18:04.361 --> 00:18:05.300
<v Speaker 2>like my bed or it's,</v>

717
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like my bat NASCAR's playing,</v>

718
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:08.920
<v Speaker 2>so go to FX x times.</v>

719
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Well fuck man.</v>

720
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Wears that hat or a baseball game goes long and you've got to go to fs two.</v>

721
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

722
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I to find it.</v>

723
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.270
<v Speaker 2>672 my,</v>

724
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 2>my only concern on ESPN is because ESPN,</v>

725
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Aussie has the NFL has MBA.</v>

726
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.863
<v Speaker 2>How much,</v>

727
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 2>how much focus do you even put on the UFC?</v>

728
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 2>You know like we don't want to be the side chick because they're made to the</v>

729
00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:30.271
<v Speaker 2>NBA.</v>

730
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:30.690

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of questions.</v>

755
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.143
<v Speaker 2>Yours first</v>

756
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.320

757
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.253
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.243
<v Speaker 2>I'm flock.</v>

759
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>SPN learn from my mistakes.</v>

760
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.223
<v Speaker 2>Get a translator.</v>

761
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 2>It's sometimes it's like you think it'd be a good idea to have somebody out,</v>

762
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:17.490
<v Speaker 2>but if you had them on like,</v>

763
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.383
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

764
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 2>how long could you talk to them?</v>

765
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.530
<v Speaker 2>I know what it'd be for the showtime below the TV show.</v>

766
00:19:23.531 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's only six minutes segment.</v>

767
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:26.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

768
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:27.700
<v Speaker 2>When you've had a,</v>

769
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.920
<v Speaker 2>you've had cyborg gone but you've had around with her boyfriend or boyfriend</v>

770
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.510
<v Speaker 2>translates so well no,</v>

771
00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 2>her English is pretty good.</v>

772
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:37.090
<v Speaker 2>But if there's ever issues so like take over,</v>

773
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

774
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 2>like she'll explain it and then it's a little,</v>

775
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:39.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to like,</v>

776
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

777
00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

778
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 2>And then told her to take over,</v>

779
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 2>but it works great.</v>

780
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:44.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

781
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:45.511
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

782
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:46.021
<v Speaker 2>You know when,</v>

783
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:46.771
<v Speaker 2>when I had a year,</v>

784
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 2>well we're on,</v>

785
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it was the best because Joey was translating for Yo el and so Joe it was dre was</v>

786
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:54.600
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

787
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.160
<v Speaker 2>So fucking hard gig though.</v>

788
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Translate and translate nightmare.</v>

789
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't shut up.</v>

790
00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Joined do it for all the fun.</v>

791
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:00.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean Eddie,</v>

792
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 2>you speak Spanish.</v>

793
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 2>You know how hard it is.</v>

794
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.590
<v Speaker 2>I barely speak Spanish.</v>

795
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 2>You speak enough to talk to people.</v>

796
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.833
<v Speaker 2>We keep it light.</v>

797
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

798
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Soon as we get deep,</v>

799
00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm lost Iranian,</v>

800
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 2>they start real flowing fast.</v>

801
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.121
<v Speaker 2>My grandma,</v>

802
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:15.954
<v Speaker 2>when she started,</v>

803
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I was the first of the grandkids to lose Spanish and uh,</v>

804
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.950
<v Speaker 2>felt really shameful because of that.</v>

805
00:20:22.951 --> 00:20:23.581
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

806
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:23.940
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

807
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.570
<v Speaker 2>it was rare.</v>

808
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 2>It was really embarrassing hanging out with my grandmother and she's going off</v>

809
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

810
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what she's saying.</v>

811
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I gotta look it over to my aunts.</v>

812
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

813
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:33.030
<v Speaker 2>what did she just say?</v>

814
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

815
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.461
<v Speaker 2>very embarrassed.</v>

816
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It's tough when you have a translator because you don't get in that flow.</v>

817
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:39.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

818
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:39.640
<v Speaker 2>when you're a pot,</v>

819
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:39.910
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

820
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 2>there's a flow and you're like kind of connecting,</v>

821
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.570
<v Speaker 2>going back and forth.</v>

822
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:42.910
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

823
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 2>if there's a translator,</v>

824
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:46.080
<v Speaker 2>just the chemistry is not there.</v>

825
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

826
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that fun kind of flow.</v>

827
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.671
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

828
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 2>but the one thing that is good though,</v>

829
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

830
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 2>what I find is that it allows you more time to think about what you're going to</v>

831
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:55.020
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

832
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

833
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.900
<v Speaker 2>you heard them damn stewards.</v>

834
00:20:58.901 --> 00:20:59.734
<v Speaker 2>10 off.</v>

835
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:00.281
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

836
00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 2>spicy coming back.</v>

837
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.280
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

838
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.500
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes when I have too much time to think about the question,</v>

839
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

840
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

841
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

842
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 2>it's not as fun.</v>

843
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not as good sometimes organic.</v>

844
00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Then I feel like,</v>

845
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

846
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.100
<v Speaker 2>like I worked for ESPN or something.</v>

847
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I know exactly what you talking about and I don't want to be that.</v>

848
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

849
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:15.731
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

850
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:16.031
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

851
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:16.301
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

852
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:16.601
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

853
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:19.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the hard part of like having these conversations with people,</v>

854
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:23.440
<v Speaker 2>is it keeping them conversations and not turning them into some corny ass</v>

855
00:21:23.441 --> 00:21:24.280
<v Speaker 2>fucking interview.</v>

856
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.740
<v Speaker 2>The worst.</v>

857
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.703
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing worse,</v>

858
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you have to do that if you,</v>

859
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:28.470
<v Speaker 2>if you can't,</v>

860
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.220
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes I feel myself was still,</v>

861
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:31.790
<v Speaker 2>she was so shit.</v>

862
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 2>You got hurt.</v>

863
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn.</v>

864
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.383
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

865
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.980
<v Speaker 2>That Stuart was an underdog to in this damn hit him with some bombs.</v>

866
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 2>England coming and strung.</v>

867
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

868
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.001
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

869
00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:46.781
<v Speaker 2>I've watched those,</v>

870
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

871
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:47.621
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>

872
00:21:47.621 --> 00:21:47.721
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>standard interviews now where,</v>

874
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:50.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 2>there's no connection between the person talking and the other person answering</v>

876
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 2>the questions and there's so gross.</v>

877
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:58.840

00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you went on tonight show and you do a four minute segment.</v>

901
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.363
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to,</v>

902
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 2>you literally promoting whatever movie or the standup your special coming out,</v>

903
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 2>but that's all you're doing is promoting and trying to get people to buy that.</v>

904
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.080
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

905
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.861
<v Speaker 2>that's not real,</v>

906

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

907

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

909
00:22:28.621 --> 00:22:28.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

910
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:29.764
<v Speaker 2>we're talking like this.</v>

911
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.551
<v Speaker 2>If we film this,</v>

912
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:33.230
<v Speaker 2>people can be a fan of you then buy whatever you can be into or whenever you're</v>

913
00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:33.810
<v Speaker 2>pitching.</v>

914
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a much better way to go.</v>

915
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.370
<v Speaker 2>There's no time limit.</v>

916
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no restrictions.</v>

917
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.140
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that you never get,</v>

918
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 2>there's no other place for that.</v>

919
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Like even Howard stern would do interviews with people.</v>

920
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:45.310
<v Speaker 2>He would get people to say a lot of shit.</v>

921
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 2>He had a agenda.</v>

924
00:22:47.861 --> 00:22:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Howard stern had an agenda.</v>

925
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:49.901
<v Speaker 2>Typically.</v>

00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:50.734
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

927
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Dirt out of your fucking yeah,</v>

928
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.041
<v Speaker 2>that was an agenda.</v>

929
00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:55.874
<v Speaker 2>It's the agenda though.</v>

930
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.351
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't,</v>

931
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't just having a conversation with you.</v>

932
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 2>He calls himself the dentist.</v>

933
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

934
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:01.523

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.100

936
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Does he have nice to see a dentist?</v>

937
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>We'll hope he has bad teeth.</v>

938
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 2>He knocks.</v>

939
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 2>He pulls people's teeth out.</v>

940
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the coolest one.</v>

1025
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Those who signed</v>

1026
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:28.243
<v Speaker 1>hunters.</v>

1027
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that Netflix documentary where they use Jack Russell</v>

1028
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:32.000
<v Speaker 1>terrorist to get rats?</v>

1029
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.870
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1030
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:33.081
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>

1031
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to watch</v>

1032
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.180
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

1033
00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.371
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1034
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:37.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1035
00:25:37.461 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1036
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.001
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1037
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:38.811
<v Speaker 1>The the doc.</v>

1038
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:42.160
<v Speaker 1>The all on how fucked up rats are and how many have got you.</v>

1039
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.730
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that dude?</v>

1040
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It will free Jack Russells to go after raps.</v>

1041
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Jack Russells are so aggressive.</v>

1043
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Little terriers.</v>

1044
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.080
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why they're so aggressive is because they're,</v>

1045
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.110
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly chasing after these fucking rats.</v>

1046
00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:57.921
<v Speaker 1>When they get them,</v>

1047
00:25:57.921 --> 00:25:59.210
<v Speaker 1>they tear these rats apart,</v>

1048
00:25:59.211 --> 00:25:59.341
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1049
00:25:59.341 --> 00:26:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I look at that damn dude.</v>

1050
00:26:00.651 --> 00:26:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Those are some Bushley dogs.</v>

1051
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:03.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a mix.</v>

1052
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 1>The Jamie that this is from the movies are,</v>

1053
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.070
<v Speaker 1>but these are some of them.</v>

1054
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:10.250
<v Speaker 1>These are all part Jack Russell terriers in particular.</v>

1055
00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:12.500
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why they're so small and so aggressive,</v>

1056
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.170
<v Speaker 1>they would go into holes and go after rats.</v>

1057
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.911
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1058
00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:17.030
<v Speaker 1>look at the blood on the back.</v>

1059
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck are they of Michael Vick?</v>

1060
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:20.091
<v Speaker 1>Video,</v>

1061
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:20.924
<v Speaker 1>dark place.</v>

1062
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.160
<v Speaker 1>But this documentary will freak you the fuck out.</v>

1063
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 1>There's more rats than there are people in New York City.</v>

1064
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's 30 million or 60 million rats or some shit.</v>

1065
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] saying they have like all sorts of diseases that everything that can</v>

1066
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:35.954
<v Speaker 1>kill you,</v>

1067
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 1>they have all kinds of deadly shit.</v>

1068
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 1>You just don't get it because most people don't get bit by rats and they're</v>

1069
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:41.480
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

1070
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 1>But we need rats though,</v>

1071
00:26:42.711 --> 00:26:42.921
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1072
00:26:42.921 --> 00:26:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

1073
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 1>They eat the trash.</v>

1074
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.903
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

1075
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:45.191
<v Speaker 5>Do not,</v>

1076
00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:45.751
<v Speaker 5>can't we just,</v>

1077
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:47.210
<v Speaker 5>do they eat the trash can?</v>

1078
00:26:47.211 --> 00:26:47.320
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1079
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 5>We just can't just breathe rats and you throw them in the dump and just have</v>

1080
00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:51.061
<v Speaker 5>them eat.</v>

1081
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:51.894
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they look like,</v>

1082
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they like fucking milk.</v>

1083
00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:54.591

<v Speaker 5>that's pretty heady.</v>

1086
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 5>Bravos get a rat reading service releases.</v>

1087
00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:06.170
<v Speaker 5>When the cans did you see drastic rat?</v>

1088
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:06.691
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1089
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 5>but now we've got to get rid of the rat shit.</v>

1090
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.840
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck dude.</v>

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 5>Use it as fertilizer.</v>

1093
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 5>That can't be good for the dogs.</v>

1094
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 5>Mami Minoa boom,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the twister so much.</v>

1129
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 5>I hated that shit cause I just sounds pretty homosexual.</v>

1130
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.060
<v Speaker 5>The twister because Higgin and John Jack would always call me that because of</v>

1131
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:18.500
<v Speaker 5>the guilty.</v>

1132
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.370
<v Speaker 5>They called the rustlers guilty and the twister,</v>

1133
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.340
<v Speaker 5>and I asked her,</v>

1143
00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:35.110
<v Speaker 5>I kept calling and twister and it started,</v>

1144
00:28:35.111 --> 00:28:35.770
<v Speaker 5>it started,</v>

1145
00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 5>it started sounding good when I'd compete and people would start yelling at</v>

1146
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 5>Twitter.</v>

1147
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.411

1152
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.290

1153
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.060
<v Speaker 5>the twister and the yellow dots and the ground.</v>

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.910
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

1155
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:49.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 5>You should get a tattoo that says El Toronado.</v>

1157
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.340
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1158
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.750
<v Speaker 5>Fucking never stop sticking right now.</v>

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.790
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm going to call it that.</v>

1160
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.280
<v Speaker 5>That's way better than the twister.</v>

1161
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 5>That's a great word.</v>

1162
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:02.703
<v Speaker 5>Sounds,</v>

1163
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.990
<v Speaker 5>sounds dangerous</v>

1164
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:06.871
<v Speaker 5>this summer.</v>

1165
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:08.670
<v Speaker 5>Toronado there you go.</v>

1166
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.830
<v Speaker 5>That would be a great license plate if you could fit all those words torn on.</v>

1167
00:29:12.831 --> 00:29:13.664
<v Speaker 5>Tornado,</v>

1168

<v Speaker 1>fanny pack game draw.</v>

1228
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Fanny pack.</v>

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Great points.</v>

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I would uh,</v>

1232
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I would do that.</v>

1233
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.830
<v Speaker 1>George and I,</v>

1234
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.663
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1235
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 1>we went over the front leg side kick first,</v>

1236
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:13.620
<v Speaker 1>which is like the most important part.</v>

1237
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.650
<v Speaker 1>That attorney sidekick.</v>

1238
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Once you get the front leg side kick down,</v>

1239
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you understand how that works.</v>

1240
00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Then you turn and then it's basically you're turning and then throwing the front</v>

1241
00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:22.391
<v Speaker 1>leg side kick.</v>

1242
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:24.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just got like an extra push to it.</v>

1243
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 1>But most people do the front,</v>

1244
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:27.250
<v Speaker 1>like psychic rom there needs to low,</v>

1245
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.211
<v Speaker 1>it needs to low.</v>

1246
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 1>You lose all the power.</v>

1247
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Crazy shit.</v>

1248
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.110

1249
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:35.230

1250
00:31:35.231 --> 00:31:39.760

1251
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 1>winner of Conor.</v>

1252
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:40.960

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.880
<v Speaker 1>he started doing this.</v>

1254
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.130
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1255
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

1256
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 1>This is what Wonderboy does.</v>

1257
00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1258
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

1259
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 1>That sideways stance is hard to fuck with man.</v>

1260
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I used to spar with this guy named Larry Jones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>black dude,</v>

1270
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.340
<v Speaker 1>John [inaudible] was a beast that could easily be a Chinese dude.</v>

1271
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:12.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:32:12.581 --> 00:32:13.240

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:13.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1274

00:32:21.751 --> 00:32:23.560
<v Speaker 1>That guy hit me so hard.</v>

1280
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I saw him flat and a lot of people with that too.</v>

1281
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1282
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.800
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

1283
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:30.850
<v Speaker 1>my friend Larry Jones,</v>

1284
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I was too short,</v>

1285
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:32.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1286
00:32:32.891 --> 00:32:33.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm five,</v>

1287
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 1>eight when I would spar with him,</v>

1288
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:36.440
<v Speaker 1>my legs were normal leg,</v>

1289
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:37.620
<v Speaker 1>he was six,</v>

1290
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>two and I just could not get past that front</v>

1291
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.290
<v Speaker 5>leg side kick night man.</v>

1292
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.200
<v Speaker 5>That frontline psychic is so hard and they can just move around with you.</v>

1293
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 5>It's basically like a jab and they can move around with you.</v>

1294
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:48.891
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1295
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:49.250
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1296
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.083
<v Speaker 5>and they're safe.</v>

1297
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:50.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1298
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.880
<v Speaker 5>You try and get an angle trying to get an angle on them.</v>

1299
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:58.150
<v Speaker 5>There's actually a thing on hinge Zos Instagram the other day we had a photo of</v>

1300
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.590

<v Speaker 5>for Valley Tuto.</v>

1302
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1303
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.860

1304
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 5>you never lost your base.</v>

1305
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 5>Like if you throw a roundhouse kick,</v>

1306
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 5>you throw the kid,</v>

1308
00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:12.230
<v Speaker 5>you reset it.</v>

1309
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 5>He was kind of throwing like a front push kick sidekick.</v>

1310
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.290
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1311
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:15.770
<v Speaker 5>And he would,</v>

1312
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 5>out of all the Gracies,</v>

1313
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 5>it looked like Hixon through it with the most power because the hoist would</v>

1314
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:21.090
<v Speaker 5>throw.</v>

1315
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.190
<v Speaker 5>But it didn't look powerful.</v>

1316
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:23.024
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1317
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.160
<v Speaker 5>but when you watch soccer,</v>

1318
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 5>Robert too,</v>

1319
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.390
<v Speaker 5>when it was at the coliseum,</v>

1320
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 5>but that's a forgotten fight.</v>

1321
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.820
<v Speaker 5>People Watch how hoist would be on his back.</v>

1322
00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.520
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1323
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.180
<v Speaker 5>in sac,</v>

1324
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 5>rob was standing over him and he was like,</v>

1325
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:35.000
<v Speaker 5>purgatory.</v>

1326
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.620
<v Speaker 5>Sakharova standing hoists,</v>

1327
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 5>throw side kicks off his back.</v>

1328
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 5>Dude Harney Dude,</v>

1329
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.530
<v Speaker 5>better than anybody I've ever seen.</v>

1330
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.740
<v Speaker 5>He's on his side and he was throwing some serious side kicks off his back little</v>

1331
00:33:46.741 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 5>soccer and fucking up soc Robbins needs.</v>

1332
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:54.190
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen anybody remember Hixon did that to finicky when Funai got Hixon</v>

1333
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:58.040
<v Speaker 5>down for knocky broke Hickson's orbital people forget like that w that was</v>

1334
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.370
<v Speaker 5>Hickson's greatest victory because for Nakia was the guy that when people were</v>

1335
00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:01.611
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

1336
00:34:01.611 --> 00:34:02.444
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1337
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 5>he's such a good grappler,</v>

1338
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 5>if he went to the ground with Hixon,</v>

1339
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:05.211
<v Speaker 5>he could,</v>

1340
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 5>he could actually hang with Hixon.</v>

1341
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.900
<v Speaker 5>But he cracked,</v>

1342
00:34:07.901 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 5>hits him with a big right hand,</v>

1343
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 5>hurt him,</v>

1344
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 5>fucked up as I broke his orbital and they went to the ground.</v>

1345
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:17.810
<v Speaker 5>And as we knock you standing over Hixson Hixson fucked his knees up.</v>

1346
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.330
<v Speaker 5>He fucked his Nisa with side kicks off of his back.</v>

1347
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.680
<v Speaker 5>That's huge.</v>

1348
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.281
<v Speaker 5>Huge.</v>

1349
00:34:22.281 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 5>And no one practices that shit.</v>

1350
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.630
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1351
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.960
<v Speaker 5>no practice.</v>

1352
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.890
<v Speaker 5>Hanzo,</v>

1353
00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:29.203
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1354
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.530
<v Speaker 5>would practice up kicks specifically just just in case he was in that purgatory</v>

1355
00:34:33.531 --> 00:34:34.610
<v Speaker 5>position where he got boom,</v>

1356
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 5>it worked against old leg talk.</v>

1357
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:37.311
<v Speaker 5>Tara,</v>

1358
00:34:37.311 --> 00:34:38.144
<v Speaker 5>remember that?</v>

1359
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.300
<v Speaker 5>That was the first upkick versus Appkit Kale.</v>

1360
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.490
<v Speaker 5>And I think it was either,</v>

1361
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.170
<v Speaker 5>I think Merola Bustamonte did it to Jerry Bolander or it was either Fabio's</v>

1362
00:34:48.171 --> 00:34:48.680
<v Speaker 5>years yelled at,</v>

1363
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.490
<v Speaker 5>but Bolando or Bustamante to Belinda up kick boom.</v>

1364
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.150
<v Speaker 5>Took 'em out.</v>

1365
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:53.780
<v Speaker 5>Bam.</v>

1366
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1367
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.591
<v Speaker 5>love Kickstarter.</v>

1368
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:56.480
<v Speaker 5>Now legal and combat Jujitsu.</v>

1369
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 5>Their legal,</v>

1370
00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.610
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1371
00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.980
<v Speaker 5>called little shit.</v>

1372
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.000
<v Speaker 5>How hard was that to get?</v>

1373
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1374
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.440
<v Speaker 5>you know what an amateur MMA upp kicks or illegal gay guard.</v>

1375
00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:06.631
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1376
00:35:06.631 --> 00:35:07.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm Sassy.</v>

1377
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.740
<v Speaker 5>Amateur MMA UPP kicks your legal,</v>

1378
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.710
<v Speaker 5>we added them to combat you just because guys are getting too comfortable in</v>

1379
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:13.544
<v Speaker 5>purgatory,</v>

1380
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 5>just standing over guys.</v>

1381
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want to go into anybody's guard that could kill the show.</v>

1382
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.890
<v Speaker 5>So now with the threat,</v>

1383
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.720
<v Speaker 5>it's really easy to deal with uptake.</v>

1384
00:35:20.721 --> 00:35:22.940
<v Speaker 5>So all they gotta do is just get to their knees and start passing.</v>

1385
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.710
<v Speaker 5>You gotta engage.</v>

1386
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 5>Just engage if all you get,</v>

1388
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:30.100
<v Speaker 5>because you rarely see up kicks in Nma rarely because they're so easy to deal</v>

1389
00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:30.920
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

1390
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 5>But the threat of them will keep you,</v>

1391
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.680
<v Speaker 5>I'll either away from purgatory or get on your knees and,</v>

1392
00:35:37.681 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1393
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 2>commenced to passing.</v>

1394
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's all about.</v>

1395
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.150
<v Speaker 2>You about to say Musashi Gray.</v>

1396
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:42.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1397
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:43.460
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out jocker right.</v>

1398
00:35:43.461 --> 00:35:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Where that triangle choke though.</v>

1399
00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.690
<v Speaker 2>You fell into a triangle.</v>

1400
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:46.980
<v Speaker 2>There's been probably,</v>

1401
00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I would say see Roy McDonald door like seven total up kicks it history,</v>

1402
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:52.380
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1403
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.083
<v Speaker 2>Adding,</v>

1404
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 2>we're not adding up kicks to combat Jujitsu to increase chaos.</v>

1405
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 2>We're adding it to increase the ground.</v>

1406
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

1407
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1408
00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Just says,</v>

1409
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.260
<v Speaker 2>don't stand over the guidance.</v>

1410
00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.483
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

1411
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:04.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1412
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:04.651
<v Speaker 2>let's get to that.</v>

1413
00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>

1414
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Super Smart.</v>

1415
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1416
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1417
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I Love Combat Jujitsu.</v>

1418
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I love the rule set.</v>

1419
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I love what it does.</v>

1420
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Speaker 2>It opens up,</v>

1421
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:11.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1422

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.470
<v Speaker 2>the reality aspect.</v>

1424
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand that you can't just do certain things.</v>

1425
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:17.580
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get smacked in the face hard.</v>

1426
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.110
<v Speaker 2>It keeps your Jujitsu honest.</v>

1427
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:19.650
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1428
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't get too crazy,</v>

1429

1431
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:24.324
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1432

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:36.611
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1600
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:37.750
<v Speaker 2>you just ride through it even.</v>

1601
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1602
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:39.730
<v Speaker 2>People were like to chose fanny pack and like,</v>

1603
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:40.564
<v Speaker 2>I know man,</v>

1604

<v Speaker 2>this shit on saw the shit out of him.</v>

1605
00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm always out of stock.</v>

1606
00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:48.620
<v Speaker 2>My boy wants one bad hire.</v>

1607
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I made.com we were at Disneyland.</v>

1608
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Are we close to MMA and the Olympics?</v>

1609
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1610
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah we are.</v>

1611
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1612
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.960
<v Speaker 2>They're working on it.</v>

1613
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1614
00:40:56.081 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to imagine that.</v>

1615
00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Well it would be,</v>

1616
00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine.</v>

1617
00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.270
<v Speaker 2>It would be amazing now with Russia,</v>

1618
00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:04.020
<v Speaker 2>just when all the belts are they,</v>

1619
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.571
<v Speaker 2>what about,</v>

1620
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 2>we had some seconds man.</v>

1621
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Fucking situation.</v>

1622
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean Russia would be tough man.</v>

1623
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Woe and it really depends entirely drug testing.</v>

1624
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.290
<v Speaker 2>But they'll figure it out.</v>

1625
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean Russians when it comes,</v>

1626
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1627
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:18.130
<v Speaker 2>box and combat sports.</v>

1628
00:41:18.131 --> 00:41:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Russia is really pretty fucking good with Dagestan be considered Russia.</v>

1629
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.940
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is though is what I was putting it under the same banner.</v>

1630
00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1631
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.261
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

1632
00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 2>what would happen is if it did become huge in the Olympics,</v>

1633
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.420
<v Speaker 2>then people would realize like,</v>

1634
00:41:31.421 --> 00:41:36.410
<v Speaker 2>you know how guys like Floyd Mayweather and also many different professional</v>

1635
00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 2>boxers got their start as a Olympic gold medalist and then went on to become</v>

1636
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.680
<v Speaker 2>these huge superstars in boxing.</v>

1637
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Loma Chanko is another good example.</v>

1638
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.630
<v Speaker 2>When you have like a real great amateur background,</v>

1639
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 2>people get super amped up for go pro Andre Ward.</v>

1640
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1641
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:51.921
<v Speaker 2>Anthony.</v>

1642
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Joshua.</v>

1643
00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.253
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1644
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.720
<v Speaker 2>You get super amped up about seeing those guys go pro in America.</v>

1645
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a little different though,</v>

1646
00:41:57.621 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 2>for the reason when it comes to boxing.</v>

1647
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1648
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Because we talked the other can.</v>

1649
00:42:01.131 --> 00:42:05.390
<v Speaker 2>We used to with Mark Breland member of those days with a Tyrrell pigs.</v>

1650
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 2>We used to love it.</v>

1651
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.020
<v Speaker 2>We used to love it when a guy was a Olympic gold metal.</v>

1652
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:09.854
<v Speaker 2>Pernell Whitaker,</v>

1653
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 2>you know Ray Mercer?</v>

1654
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1655
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Let Andre Ward though.</v>

1656
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:14.031
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>

1657
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:14.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1658
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:15.820
<v Speaker 2>and he looked in this leg lock</v>

1659
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Giante Walter has a bronze medal.</v>

1660
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:22.600
<v Speaker 2>This was Shane and he started sad moods or boxing like toilet.</v>

1661
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1662
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Anytime he hit them double outside [inaudible] and MMA,</v>

1663
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:28.340
<v Speaker 2>they're risky.</v>

1664
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 2>What such a weird position to find yourself in.</v>

1665
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 2>If a guy can punch in the face and again it goes back to your combat Jujitsu,</v>

1666
00:42:33.411 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 2>all Monta.</v>

1667
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1668
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.790
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to your combat Jujitsu.</v>

1669
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 2>You understand what positions are like super dangerous cause there's positions</v>

1670
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:44.861
<v Speaker 2>that guys regularly practice in Jujitsu that will get you fucked up if a guy can</v>

1671
00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:45.794
<v Speaker 2>punch you in the face.</v>

1672
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1673
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.480
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's all about.</v>

1674
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Combat Jujitsu is such a good idea.</v>

1675
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Thank you man.</v>

1676
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.950
<v Speaker 2>And so and is going well,</v>

1677
00:42:51.951 --> 00:42:52.784
<v Speaker 2>right Eddie,</v>

1678
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:54.700
<v Speaker 2>before he accepted,</v>

1679
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.370
<v Speaker 2>does it,</v>

1680
00:42:55.370 --> 00:43:00.370
<v Speaker 2>does the UFC being acquired by ESPN affect the fight pass in smash cars?</v>

1681
00:43:01.701 --> 00:43:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to continue with the fight pass?</v>

1682
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh hell yeah.</v>

1683
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.143
<v Speaker 2>Hell are you sure?</v>

1684
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.410
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>

1685
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.860
<v Speaker 2>the president of fight pass when that deal went through,</v>

1686
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:10.990
<v Speaker 2>emailed me personally,</v>

1687
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:11.903
<v Speaker 2>let me know.</v>

1688
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:12.261
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1689
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:12.920
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1690
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1691
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.990
<v Speaker 2>this deal has nothing to look at this game over.</v>

1692
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 2>So body triangle,</v>

1693
00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.751
<v Speaker 2>each deep,</v>

1694
00:43:19.751 --> 00:43:20.180
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

1695
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:20.601
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

1696
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:21.170
<v Speaker 2>deep hat.</v>

1697
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Can you hang in there for 40 seconds?</v>

1698
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:23.421
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1699
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:23.901
<v Speaker 2>Sign though.</v>

1700
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:24.734
<v Speaker 2>He's in trouble.</v>

1701
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:25.790
<v Speaker 2>He's got a,</v>

1702
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.190
<v Speaker 2>he's got and he's tapping into about the tap?</v>

1703
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:28.491
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1704
00:43:28.491 --> 00:43:29.324
<v Speaker 2>it's on the chin.</v>

1705
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh he's out.</v>

1706
00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:31.881
<v Speaker 2>What's broke?</v>

1707
00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 2>His jaw.</v>

1708
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:33.121
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

1709
00:43:33.121 --> 00:43:33.954
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1710
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:35.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what they said.</v>

1711
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Your boy problem you'd have to worry about is now that people don't have to</v>

1712
00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:40.460
<v Speaker 2>subscribe to ESPN.</v>

1713
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Plus you get the full ESPN experience.</v>

1714
00:43:43.161 --> 00:43:43.551
<v Speaker 2>Now they're,</v>

1715
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:46.310
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay for that and fight paths.</v>

1716
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.203
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>

1717
00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:48.383
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

1718
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:52.320
<v Speaker 2>So fipass doesn't really change it or they're not getting rid of bypass at all?</v>

1719
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't like getting rid of as far as it grows and could be an issue.</v>

1720
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 2>I think the fan base stays.</v>

1721
00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:57.080
<v Speaker 2>How does that work though?</v>

1722
00:43:57.081 --> 00:43:59.180
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna stream some fights still on fight pass.</v>

1723
00:43:59.240 --> 00:43:59.850
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1724
00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1725
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.153
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1726
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean ESPN is going to take all that content?</v>

1727
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Cause cause you have,</v>

1728
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:11.300
<v Speaker 2>right cause now ESPN plus and ESPN platforms can have 30 fights than ESPN is</v>

1729
00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:12.800
<v Speaker 2>going to have 12 paper use at least.</v>

1730
00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 2>So we have 42 fights a year now.</v>

1731
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>

1732
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:16.401
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't be wrong.</v>

1733
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:17.001
<v Speaker 2>Jamie car,</v>

1734
00:44:17.001 --> 00:44:17.834
<v Speaker 2>if I'm wrong,</v>

1735
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.430
<v Speaker 2>there's no fight pass card.</v>

1736
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:20.264
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1737
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.140
<v Speaker 2>I think he's just gonna be a database for stuff like Eddie's old school fight</v>

1738
00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Speaker 2>libraries and then you know,</v>

1739
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what took her show.</v>

1740
00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:27.850
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1741
00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:29.540
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it's going to grow.</v>

1742
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to continue.</v>

1743
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.090
<v Speaker 2>It's doing and stuff like Eddie's</v>

1744
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:32.701
<v Speaker 5>might grow,</v>

1745
00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 5>but people are mean honestly more ESPN plus packaging.</v>

1746
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Tough sell because I love it.</v>

1747
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I think five passes.</v>

1748
00:44:40.781 --> 00:44:41.141
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

1749
00:44:41.141 --> 00:44:44.170
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to just go old school and watch a bunch of great old fights is</v>

1750
00:44:44.171 --> 00:44:46.360
<v Speaker 1>the best format on the planet earth.</v>

1751
00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're a hardcore fan,</v>

1752
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:48.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're a hardcore fan.</v>

1753
00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.830
<v Speaker 1>But I liked the fact that we would have the prelims,</v>

1754
00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.660
<v Speaker 1>some fights that you couldn't see anywhere else,</v>

1755
00:44:52.661 --> 00:44:55.810
<v Speaker 1>but fight pass and then they would have certain fight pass cards.</v>

1756
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Well you wouldn't,</v>

1757
00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.670
<v Speaker 1>how many times did we watch?</v>

1758
00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Do fight companions?</v>

1759
00:44:58.871 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1760
00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.940
<v Speaker 5>with the entire car.</v>

1761
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.190
<v Speaker 5>But now you can do it on these two up.</v>

1762
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:02.063
<v Speaker 5>Look at that shit.</v>

1763
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.690
<v Speaker 5>That is nothing.</v>

1764
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.350
<v Speaker 5>I can do it on ESPN plus Joe.</v>

1765
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1766
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:05.330
<v Speaker 5>could be.</v>

1767
00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:06.163
<v Speaker 5>Could be.</v>

1768
00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:07.930
<v Speaker 5>Plus is that okay?</v>

1769
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.833
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

1770
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 5>For another thing online,</v>

1771
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.000
<v Speaker 5>it's digital.</v>

1772
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:12.834
<v Speaker 5>Espn pluses,</v>

1773
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:13.883
<v Speaker 5>digital APP.</v>

1774
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:14.730
<v Speaker 5>Eddie,</v>

1775
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:14.930
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1776
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 5>What could he same is get out of this.</v>

1777
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.090
<v Speaker 5>What can you do to get out of this?</v>

1778
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:18.924
<v Speaker 5>Eddie?</v>

1779
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 5>He's got appeal that arm off his neck</v>

1780
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:24.690
<v Speaker 5>too late at this point,</v>

1781
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:25.010
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1782
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1783
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 5>get an answer to that spot.</v>

1784
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:28.783
<v Speaker 5>A couple of things.</v>

1785
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.990
<v Speaker 5>You got to protect your neck obviously,</v>

1786
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.350
<v Speaker 5>and then he's got to get up to the leg press position where he could get up on</v>

1787
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:34.591
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1788
00:45:34.591 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 5>it's just doing a leg press,</v>

1789
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:39.930
<v Speaker 5>pushing back that it relieves some of the pressure and then eventually get over</v>

1790
00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:44.190
<v Speaker 5>to the side of the [inaudible] triangle and try to break that shit apart.</v>

1791
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:44.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1792
00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 5>You gotta break those body is a part to move fast to prevent them from happening</v>

1793
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:49.231
<v Speaker 5>in the first place.</v>

1794
00:45:49.231 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 5>You've got to be soon as someone takes your back.</v>

1795
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:54.510
<v Speaker 5>First thing is don't let it get too deep and by two deep,</v>

1796
00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 5>that means body trying,</v>

1797
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.131
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1798
00:45:56.131 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 5>don't let that shit happen.</v>

1799
00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:57.961
<v Speaker 5>What were you gonna say,</v>

1800
00:45:57.961 --> 00:45:58.794
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>

1801
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.593
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1802
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.280
<v Speaker 5>the ESPN deals us only,</v>

1803
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:02.880
<v Speaker 5>it says,</v>

1804
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.970
<v Speaker 5>so that'd be for us broadcast only at five past is still for the rest of the</v>

1805
00:46:05.971 --> 00:46:06.500
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1806
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.333
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

1807
00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 5>That'd be the big difference.</v>

1808
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.081
<v Speaker 5>Globally.</v>

1809
00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:10.890
<v Speaker 5>They assured me,</v>

1810
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:11.671
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even ask.</v>

1811
00:46:11.671 --> 00:46:12.001
<v Speaker 5>They just said,</v>

1812
00:46:12.001 --> 00:46:12.300
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1813
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.133
<v Speaker 5>don't even trip.</v>

1814
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:13.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1815
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:13.951
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

1816
00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:14.784
<v Speaker 5>They sent me,</v>

1817
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.200
<v Speaker 5>they sent me an email saying,</v>

1818
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.220
<v Speaker 5>don't worry about it.</v>

1819
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.880
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1820
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.380
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1821
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:18.581
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1822
00:46:18.581 --> 00:46:20.300
<v Speaker 5>we're not getting rid of Ebi.</v>

1823
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:20.700
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1824
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 5>we'd love you.</v>

1825
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:21.930
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1826
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:22.280
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1827
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:22.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1828
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:23.970
<v Speaker 5>don't even trip.</v>

1829
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.301
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1830
00:46:24.301 --> 00:46:24.590
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1831
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:25.030
<v Speaker 5>Raise,</v>

1832
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.680
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1833
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.630
<v Speaker 5>did and so that means,</v>

1834
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:30.870
<v Speaker 5>and so in America it's just going to affect fight pass in the UFC.</v>

1835
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:31.640
<v Speaker 5>Everyone else,</v>

<v Speaker 5>They get it for free.</v>

1841
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:40.291

00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:53.180
<v Speaker 2>It's 27 seasons deed.</v>

1886
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a tired format.</v>

1887
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:54.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1888
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's just over and no more,</v>

1889
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 2>no stars come from anymore.</v>

1890
00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:57.491
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1891
00:47:57.491 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 2>What's it called out?</v>

1892
00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Your series is great.</v>

1893
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Contender series is good.</v>

1894
00:48:00.071 --> 00:48:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Sean O'malley came from Greg Hardy fighting on there.</v>

1895
00:48:03.211 --> 00:48:03.690
<v Speaker 2>You got some.</v>

1896
00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Who is that guy that knocked out?</v>

1897
00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Thiago Alves didn't he come from there as well?</v>

1898
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm I wrong about that.</v>

1899
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

1900
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 2>The biggest one is Sean O'malley,</v>

1901
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:15.460
<v Speaker 2>but then you're going to have a homeboy.</v>

1902
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Why am I forgetting his name?</v>

1903
00:48:16.451 --> 00:48:16.991
<v Speaker 2>Sorry Dude.</v>

1904
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:17.670
<v Speaker 2>The guy with the,</v>

1905
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 2>the with the arm.</v>

1906
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

1907
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:19.901
<v Speaker 2>Nick.</v>

1908
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:20.111
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1909
00:48:20.111 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Nick Newell is finally Fight Win Streak.</v>

1910
00:48:22.391 --> 00:48:23.224
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1911
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Nick knew it was going to beat the shit.</v>

1912
00:48:26.061 --> 00:48:26.851
<v Speaker 2>These people on the contender,</v>

1913
00:48:26.851 --> 00:48:28.120
<v Speaker 2>so he should not be on there.</v>

1914
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't think so?</v>

1915
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:29.501
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1916
00:48:29.501 --> 00:48:29.770
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1917
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.180
<v Speaker 2>What'd you take you for a world title?</v>

1918
00:48:31.181 --> 00:48:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Again?</v>

1919
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Just engaging,</v>

1920
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's good to get him exposure.</v>

1921
00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Let people know how good it is.</v>

1922
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess it depends how many people are watching.</v>

1923
00:48:37.961 --> 00:48:38.794
<v Speaker 2>Contender shoes.</v>

1924
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 2>You got some real potential talent out there.</v>

1925
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the real thing about what's interesting about the contender series is</v>

1926
00:48:45.011 --> 00:48:47.860
<v Speaker 2>now people you'd never heard of are very good.</v>

1927
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:48.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1928
00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 2>how many people do we know that are just guys in the gym?</v>

1929
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:51.731
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1930
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:52.001
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1931
00:48:52.001 --> 00:48:54.850
<v Speaker 2>that guy's fucking good and they've never bought a break.</v>

1932
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.000
<v Speaker 2>They never fought or they've had one amateur fight or something like that.</v>

1933
00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:01.420
<v Speaker 2>But you realize like when you see them roll with like really good guys,</v>

1934
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:02.254
<v Speaker 2>like Holy Shit,</v>

1935
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.580
<v Speaker 2>this guy's like just a hair below a worldclass level.</v>

1936
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 2>There's so many guys like that because it's one of those doors.</v>

1937
00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:10.781
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1938
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:10.841
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1939
00:49:10.841 --> 00:49:10.971
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1940
00:49:10.971 --> 00:49:11.804
<v Speaker 2>And that's not what I'm saying.</v>

1941
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:16.000
<v Speaker 2>He has the potential to face one of those guys in the contender series.</v>

1942
00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1943
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.680
<v Speaker 2>I almost think it,</v>

1944
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.000
<v Speaker 2>it's it.</v>

1945
00:49:19.001 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 2>That's the opposite of what they should be doing.</v>

1946
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Because I found my young dude,</v>

1947
00:49:21.761 --> 00:49:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get my break in and I'm on the contender seas and he'd give me</v>

1948
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:27.640
<v Speaker 2>nick news 17 five to 17 in one,</v>

1949
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1950
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

1951
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I find a young guy in this coming from guy who had three fights?</v>

1952
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.101
<v Speaker 2>Roy Nelson,</v>

1953
00:49:33.101 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>the finale.</v>

1954
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:34.300
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1955
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:34.541
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1956
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:35.470
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to blow up?</v>

1957
00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotta fight.</v>

1958
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.541
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1959
00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:41.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they're fighting the UFC world champion.</v>

1960
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:41.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1961
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.503
<v Speaker 2>you gotta,</v>

1962
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.290
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go in there and are finding that concentration saying,</v>

1963
00:49:47.291 --> 00:49:47.921
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

1964
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:49.300
<v Speaker 2>It should be a lower crossover.</v>

1965
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:49.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1966
00:49:49.511 --> 00:49:50.380
<v Speaker 2>For someone there can be like,</v>

1967
00:49:50.381 --> 00:49:50.591
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1968
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:51.251
<v Speaker 2>I get fucking,</v>

1969
00:49:51.251 --> 00:49:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I draw Nick Newell.</v>

1970
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Sean O'malley was fighting,</v>

1971
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:54.641
<v Speaker 2>guys have his same,</v>

1972
00:49:54.641 --> 00:49:56.890
<v Speaker 2>similar blew it up just knocking dudes out.</v>

1973
00:49:56.891 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Now he's a stop out.</v>

1974
00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'll be like one or two fights and then they'll get nick in the UFC.</v>

1975
00:50:00.981 --> 00:50:01.601
<v Speaker 2>It should be one.</v>

1976
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:02.450
<v Speaker 2>So they're familiar with and then,</v>

1977
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.793
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1978
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:05.140
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1979
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.451
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1980
00:50:05.451 --> 00:50:06.520
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna be tough man.</v>

1981
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:06.990
<v Speaker 2>If he,</v>

1982
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.201
<v Speaker 2>if he,</v>

1983
00:50:07.201 --> 00:50:09.880
<v Speaker 2>if he gets into that division can be tough to beat a lot of,</v>

1984
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 2>it's an inspiring story too.</v>

1985
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1986
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:11.950
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1987
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I would market the shit out with that man.</v>

1988
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1989
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.520
<v Speaker 2>I think they're worried that if he gets head kick,</v>

1990
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:17.560
<v Speaker 2>which he's never been knocked out from the head kick,</v>

1991
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 2>they're worried with his arm.</v>

1992
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:20.170
<v Speaker 2>If you can't defend it,</v>

1993
00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:21.610
<v Speaker 2>he gets brutally knocked out.</v>

1994
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1995
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:22.690
<v Speaker 2>How would you,</v>

1996
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:25.180
<v Speaker 2>how can you put that guy on TV where you got to realize too,</v>

1997
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 2>think about how much your arm weighs.</v>

1998
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:27.943
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1999
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

2000
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.410
<v Speaker 1>mean it's not an advantage by any stretch of the imagination,</v>

2001
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of him is bigger and heavier.</v>

2002
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2003
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

2004
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:34.700
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2005
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.533
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

2006
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.170

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2032
00:51:06.381 --> 00:51:07.220

2033
00:51:07.221 --> 00:51:07.371

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:15.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big of an event.</v>

2039
00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:16.550
<v Speaker 1>There was a rep,</v>

2040
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:17.241
<v Speaker 1>there's a wrestler,</v>

2041
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:18.074
<v Speaker 1>world champion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But Jason,</v>

2045
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I fell on some tough times.</v>

2046
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:25.370
<v Speaker 1>He started off super hot and then lost his last two.</v>

2047
00:51:25.371 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Who did he fight?</v>

2048
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:26.381
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2049
00:51:26.381 --> 00:51:27.500
<v Speaker 1>he stepped way.</v>

2050
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Laura's law.</v>

<v Speaker 1>His world title contender.</v>

2055
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:37.723
<v Speaker 1>No one wants</v>

2056
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.010
<v Speaker 1>going to fucking monster all across the board.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2058
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.230

2064
00:51:50.231 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 1>He lost a Mowgli.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out by Lama,</v>

2069
00:51:55.681 --> 00:52:00.681
<v Speaker 1>so then he comes back and he lost a Mowgli this all the time of the night.</v>

2070
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.731
<v Speaker 1>This is a tough fight,</v>

2071
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:02.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2072
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.720

2073
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:06.620

<v Speaker 1>He's dangerous.</v>

2077
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo Lamas.</v>

2095
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.050
<v Speaker 1>His Dad is like a Cuban exile.</v>

<v Speaker 1>His Dad left Cuba and his dad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He speaks perfect English and Spanish too.</v>

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2104
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I know Ricardo does.</v>

2105
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I get to talk to him.</v>

2106
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to fuck with him before his fight.</v>

2107
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:43.521
<v Speaker 1>He's got a big fight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that is very interesting.</v>

2111
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:50.660

2112
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:52.610

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:55.871
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2117
00:52:55.871 --> 00:52:56.451
<v Speaker 1>Like tough.</v>

2118
00:52:56.451 --> 00:52:57.830
<v Speaker 1>What's the latest with Jon Jones?</v>

2119
00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.693
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

2120
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:59.271
<v Speaker 1>Dude?</v>

2121
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew.</v>

2122
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.190
<v Speaker 1>He's still,</v>

2123
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.320
<v Speaker 1>he's still waiting to see what exactly suspension is,</v>

2124
00:53:03.321 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 1>but where does he's gonna fight,</v>

2125
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:07.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2126
00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.090
<v Speaker 1>fairly soon.</v>

2127
00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

2128
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I route so hard for that dude.</v>

2129
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Me Too man.</v>

2130
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.103
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>

2131
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's a beast to Badmouth.</v>

2132
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:14.960
<v Speaker 1>He scan I think in,</v>

2133
00:53:14.961 --> 00:53:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I think in his heart he's a very good guy.</v>

2134
00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I was getting to,</v>

2135
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2136
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I really do mean he's,</v>

2137
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.120
<v Speaker 1>he does fucked up things and he makes mistakes.</v>

2138
00:53:23.121 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 1>But I think John in his heart is a very good guy.</v>

2139
00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I really</v>

2140
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.251
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2141
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I just think he just makes poor choices and he's wild and you know,</v>

2142
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:29.891
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2143
00:53:29.891 --> 00:53:32.640
<v Speaker 2>and one of the reasons why we love him is that wildness.</v>

2144
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.151
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>

2145
00:53:33.151 --> 00:53:33.571
<v Speaker 2>He's wild.</v>

2146
00:53:33.571 --> 00:53:33.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2147
00:53:33.721 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that he hurts people,</v>

2148
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.000
<v Speaker 2>but he is,</v>

2149
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it's typically when guys act like that,</v>

2150
00:53:37.811 --> 00:53:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I usually ride them off like fuck that dude.</v>

2151
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:40.194
<v Speaker 2>But with him,</v>

2152
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:41.640
<v Speaker 2>he's so talented.</v>

2153
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I literally think he's the best of all time to raise the octagon.</v>

2154
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I want to see him back and I think comes back at heavyweight.</v>

2155
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I think he beats the brakes off.</v>

2156
00:53:49.201 --> 00:53:49.561
<v Speaker 2>Brock.</v>

2157
00:53:49.561 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 2>I think he's come back fight is Brock.</v>

2158
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:54.940
<v Speaker 2>And then he fights for the heavyweight title against the winter of steepy DC.</v>

2159
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:55.973
<v Speaker 2>DC doesn't,</v>

2160
00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2161
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:57.330
<v Speaker 2>that would be amazing.</v>

2162
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.420
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would do that with ESPN.</v>

2163
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.131
<v Speaker 2>You liked this deal.</v>

2164
00:54:02.131 --> 00:54:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Here's two at 19</v>

2165
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:12.000
<v Speaker 2>did I had the weirdest dream that um,</v>

2166
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2167
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.670
<v Speaker 2>that I had shorts on with no underwear and are jerked off in my car.</v>

2168
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

2169
00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I came all over myself and I couldn't figure out what to do.</v>

2170
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:25.350
<v Speaker 2>And then I had to go and meet some friends and I was outside the door.</v>

2171
00:54:25.351 --> 00:54:27.600
<v Speaker 2>And so for some reason Kyle Kingsbury was in there,</v>

2172
00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:28.600
<v Speaker 2>can get good.</v>

2173
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.513
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

2174
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2175
00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:32.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm covered with my own TJ's and I don't have any underwear,</v>

2176
00:54:32.761 --> 00:54:33.950
<v Speaker 2>and I just had my shorts on like,</v>

2177
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.040
<v Speaker 2>and then I woke up going,</v>

2178
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:37.440
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is wrong with a wet dream though?</v>

2179
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2180
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:38.731
<v Speaker 2>really not.</v>

2181
00:54:38.731 --> 00:54:38.871
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2182
00:54:38.871 --> 00:54:41.110
<v Speaker 2>You busted in new drill is the weirdest dream.</v>

2183
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Never had a dream job to my car.</v>

2184
00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Which car was it though?</v>

2185
00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:47.334
<v Speaker 2>This is a big</v>

2186
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:49.000
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

2187
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:49.833
<v Speaker 2>Was it Joe?</v>

2188
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:50.843
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2189
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he had a dream or you draw a jack?</v>

2190
00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I've met June when I'm having sex.</v>

2191
00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I of course it's my bed before it's like,</v>

2192
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

2193
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:01.141
<v Speaker 2>You had a dream?</v>

2194
00:55:01.141 --> 00:55:04.050
<v Speaker 2>He had sex and you actually busted up my wet dream.</v>

2195
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Eddie.</v>

2196
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I had those where a myth real.</v>

2197
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I had to figure out I was going to meet some people and apparently didn't have</v>

2198
00:55:10.351 --> 00:55:10.891
<v Speaker 2>any underwear on.</v>

2199
00:55:10.891 --> 00:55:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a shirt on and I had,</v>

2200
00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2201
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I had to crack the door up and I'm like,</v>

2202
00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:14.911
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2203
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:15.744
<v Speaker 2>I got a problem.</v>

2204
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.621
<v Speaker 2>You've got to help me up.</v>

2205
00:55:16.621 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 2>And then I woke up going,</v>

2206
00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:19.380
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck kind of thought is that.</v>

2207
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.420
<v Speaker 2>It's coming from.</v>

2208
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:22.051
<v Speaker 2>It's rare.</v>

2209
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I remember my dreams.</v>

2210
00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:23.501
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2211
00:55:23.501 --> 00:55:24.181
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember yours?</v>

2212
00:55:24.181 --> 00:55:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Just writ.</v>

2213
00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 2>I remember my last mine last night,</v>

2214
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I was walking around,</v>

2215
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.710
<v Speaker 2>I was backstage at Bella [inaudible].</v>

2216
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 2>I was going to fight someone I can't remember and I was like,</v>

2217
00:55:31.141 --> 00:55:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this.</v>

2218
00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like pleading to,</v>

2219
00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it.</v>

2220
00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fucking ready man.</v>

2221
00:55:36.511 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do that.</v>

2222
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't need this.</v>

2223
00:55:38.131 --> 00:55:38.401
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2224
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.590
<v Speaker 2>are you going to go out there?</v>

2225
00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2226
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.880
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2227
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing.</v>

2228
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Speaker 2>That's like one of them.</v>

2229
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I got to go back to high school and graduate thing.</v>

2230
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Now we have those dreams,</v>

2231
00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.253
<v Speaker 2>tires,</v>

2232
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

2233
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:54.450
<v Speaker 2>You can never remember your your locker combination for your locker.</v>

2234
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2235
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.070
<v Speaker 2>how do I open this motherfucker?</v>

2236
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:56.671
<v Speaker 2>My dream,</v>

2237
00:55:56.671 --> 00:55:58.110
<v Speaker 2>my nightmares were credits.</v>

2238
00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:58.973
<v Speaker 2>I was too,</v>

2239
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 2>too many credits shy of graduating high school and they were making me go back</v>

2240
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:03.354
<v Speaker 2>another year.</v>

2241
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.283
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

2242
00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:05.373
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2243
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:06.151
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

2244
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:08.040
<v Speaker 2>But you remember like when you,</v>

2245
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:11.120
<v Speaker 2>when you were in high school there was always that one dude that somehow or</v>

2246
00:56:11.121 --> 00:56:14.060
<v Speaker 2>another fucked up and had to repeat senior year too.</v>

2247
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So he's 18 everybody else has 17 is fucking dude is in high schools.</v>

2248
00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:20.220
<v Speaker 2>The jeep wrangler sad,</v>

2249
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.510
<v Speaker 2>he's sad,</v>

2250
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.910
<v Speaker 2>he's got losing a year of his workout for</v>

2251
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 5>I have this recurring nightmare that I don't think it's a post to be a nightmare</v>

2252
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 5>I think is supposed to be a great dream.</v>

2253
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 5>But it always turns into a nightmare because like when I used to Dj at Strip</v>

2254
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:33.280
<v Speaker 5>clubs,</v>

2255
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.420
<v Speaker 5>I had a good time.</v>

2256
00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:35.590
<v Speaker 5>It was always fun.</v>

2257
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.390
<v Speaker 5>And then I dream about it.</v>

2258
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.380
<v Speaker 5>I dream about it.</v>

2259
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:38.970
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

2260
00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:42.790
<v Speaker 5>the problem is to be a strip club Dj,</v>

2261
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:43.750
<v Speaker 5>you got to,</v>

2262
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 5>you got to know your cds and the girls that are going up and you're matching up</v>

2263
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 5>the songs with the girls,</v>

2264
00:56:48.161 --> 00:56:48.990
<v Speaker 5>you gotta be sharp.</v>

2265
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:50.250
<v Speaker 5>They all want those different songs.</v>

2266
00:56:50.251 --> 00:56:50.801
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2267
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:51.700
<v Speaker 5>So in my dream,</v>

2268
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:53.470
<v Speaker 5>I think it's supposed to be a great train,</v>

2269
00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 5>but I can never read the cds and the managers get mad at me.</v>

2270
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:57.631
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2271
00:56:57.631 --> 00:56:57.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2272
00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 5>what girls on stage?</v>

2273
00:56:58.961 --> 00:56:59.520
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

2274
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.353
<v Speaker 5>I'm going.</v>

2275
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.290
<v Speaker 5>And the only CD that I remember,</v>

2276
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:06.370
<v Speaker 5>the only one is the crystal method because that was my go to CD.</v>

2277
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:07.540
<v Speaker 5>No other cds.</v>

2278
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:07.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2279
00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:08.051
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2280
00:57:08.051 --> 00:57:10.270
<v Speaker 5>I could always pull that one out as your default.</v>

2281
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2282
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 5>Cause you know you got to change the song every two minutes and 45 seconds</v>

2283
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:17.590
<v Speaker 5>because every song means money for the club.</v>

2284
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.730
<v Speaker 5>They're all getting lap dances.</v>

2285
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.600
<v Speaker 5>So if you let a song go three and a half before the manager get on your ass,</v>

2286
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.291
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

2287
00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:24.680
<v Speaker 5>It's three and a half minutes full.</v>

2288
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:25.750
<v Speaker 5>It's very stressful.</v>

2289
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:26.584
<v Speaker 5>So if there's a girl,</v>

2290
00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:31.000
<v Speaker 5>a gross bust about to go on stage and 15 seconds before she goes on stage,</v>

2291
00:57:31.001 --> 00:57:31.540
<v Speaker 5>she goes,</v>

2292
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:32.111
<v Speaker 5>skip me.</v>

2293
00:57:32.111 --> 00:57:33.850
<v Speaker 5>I got a lap dance and we're fucked up.</v>

2294
00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:34.121
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2295
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:34.780
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>

2296
00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.520
<v Speaker 5>I got 15 seconds to find a replacement and to,</v>

2297
00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:38.750
<v Speaker 5>to change the mood of this.</v>

2298
00:57:38.751 --> 00:57:39.550
<v Speaker 5>I got a plan.</v>

2299
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:41.860
<v Speaker 5>So in my dream I'm having a fucking nightmare.</v>

2300
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:42.131
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2301
00:57:42.131 --> 00:57:45.370
<v Speaker 5>I can't see the girl on stage and I can't see my sister.</v>

2302
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2303
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.671
<v Speaker 5>it's a total nine.</v>

2304
00:57:47.671 --> 00:57:47.861
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2305
00:57:47.861 --> 00:57:48.251
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2306
00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:49.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna get fired.</v>

2307
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 5>What am I going to do now?</v>

2308
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 5>I never figured in my dream ever do.</v>

2309
00:57:53.471 --> 00:57:56.260
<v Speaker 5>I realize that I make money teaching Jujitsu.</v>

2310
00:57:56.261 --> 00:57:56.950
<v Speaker 5>Never.</v>

2311
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:59.590
<v Speaker 5>It's always I lose my job by what am I going to do now?</v>

2312
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:00.371
<v Speaker 5>And then I wake up,</v>

2313
00:58:00.371 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Three screens in here.</v>

2462
01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 2>This is like a God damn sports bar.</v>

2463
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're at buffalo wild wings minus the wings.</v>

2464
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.990
<v Speaker 2>This is a very,</v>

2465
01:02:05.991 --> 01:02:09.830
<v Speaker 2>very interesting fight and 80 [inaudible] has been talking crazy shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh dude was going so hard in the paint.</v>

2468
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:12.651
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2469
01:02:12.651 --> 01:02:15.590
<v Speaker 2>this is a long trip for you to come just for one round to get knocked out.</v>

2470
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:16.970
<v Speaker 2>She's going super hard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he lives in Finland.</v>

2476
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>

2477
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>At least he did for a while.</v>

2478
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:27.323
<v Speaker 1>I don't know he,</v>

2479
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>they used to call him Mister Finland I think.</v>

2480
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2481
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:30.691
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2482
01:02:30.691 --> 01:02:30.961
<v Speaker 1>Nights.</v>

2483
01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>The underdog here.</v>

2484
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean he kind of has to be after those two losses in a row,</v>

2486
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>but our mayor Connie was a guy who burst on the scene a few years back and you</v>

2487
01:02:43.841 --> 01:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2488
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:46.750
<v Speaker 1>was really promising but we haven't yet.</v>

2489
01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.400
<v Speaker 1>People don't talk about it much.</v>

2490
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:49.543
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

2491
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.493
<v Speaker 1>They will feel,</v>

2492
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:52.390
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

2493
01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:52.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2494
01:02:52.961 --> 01:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>jump on him.</v>

2495
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2496
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.170
<v Speaker 1>that Pete Guard America.</v>

2497
01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.190
<v Speaker 1>This isn't what he wants.</v>

2498
01:02:57.191 --> 01:03:00.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get in these scrambles in the straight up cock fight with your</v>

2499
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>with nightmare pulled guard quit.</v>

2500
01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Tommy walked to them and stash it to look at that.</v>

2501
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Please don't do that.</v>

2502
01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>He's controlling his biceps and talking shit to him.</v>

2503
01:03:09.221 --> 01:03:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Hit.</v>

2504
01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that though.</v>

2505
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:10.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2506
01:03:10.961 --> 01:03:15.961
<v Speaker 1>good posture and he did a good job at avoiding any kind of guard attacks.</v>

2507
01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:16.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2508
01:03:16.421 --> 01:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>The way he did that by planting down those biceps,</v>

2509
01:03:19.031 --> 01:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>a very small slice of control and then he postured up at the Mirman time broke</v>

2510
01:03:22.481 --> 01:03:23.314
<v Speaker 1>through those legs.</v>

2511
01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing his homework and he's telling him that too.</v>

2512
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you ain't getting shit off on me.</v>

2513
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's snake tattoo hanging over his shoulders.</v>

2514
01:03:29.441 --> 01:03:30.274
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2515
01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Mandy to the main stage.</v>

2516
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.431
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2517
01:03:33.431 --> 01:03:34.264
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar.</v>

2518
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:41.323
<v Speaker 1>Just talking.</v>

2519
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:42.650
<v Speaker 1>He got hurt.</v>

2520
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>He got hurt and get a motion.</v>

2521
01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Heard jabs or,</v>

2522
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2523
01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:46.520
<v Speaker 1>touching him.</v>

2524
01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.480
<v Speaker 1>He was having a problem with that.</v>

2525
01:03:47.481 --> 01:03:48.111
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2526
01:03:48.111 --> 01:03:50.030
<v Speaker 1>He has a lot of scar tissue on his face.</v>

2527
01:03:50.031 --> 01:03:53.270
<v Speaker 1>If you look at his face like she looks like a great whites knows it's fucking,</v>

2528
01:03:53.271 --> 01:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>it's just all sorts of shit all over as well.</v>

2529
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:56.060
<v Speaker 1>That style,</v>

2530
01:03:56.061 --> 01:03:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean that crazy bulldog style doesn't really work these days,</v>

2531
01:03:59.301 --> 01:03:59.541
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2532
01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Once you get to upper echelon level,</v>

2533
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it works until you,</v>

2534
01:04:02.651 --> 01:04:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you can't take a shot anymore because your face just gets smashed in too much.</v>

2535
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.001
<v Speaker 1>Then when you get,</v>

2536
01:04:08.001 --> 01:04:09.050
<v Speaker 1>the technicians are like,</v>

2542
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:12.861
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do.</v>

2543
01:04:12.861 --> 01:04:13.694
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2544
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:14.810

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.210
<v Speaker 1>He's mock.</v>

2547
01:04:17.211 --> 01:04:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Juan just keeps looking for that right hook counter and he's doing it real nice.</v>

2548
01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I like what he's doing.</v>

2549
01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I like his jab to Oh,</v>

2551
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2553
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:28.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

2554
01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Connie is a good wrestler too.</v>

2555
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:30.861
<v Speaker 1>Is a very good,</v>

2556
01:04:30.861 --> 01:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2557
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:32.063
<v Speaker 1>That's his background.</v>

2558
01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:32.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2559
01:04:32.901 --> 01:04:33.734
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2560
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>He just keeps more of that damn look.</v>

2561
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Get them yet.</v>

2562
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>It's comfortable in there.</v>

2563
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Did it.</v>

2564
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 1>That leg kick hurt him.</v>

2565
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.630
<v Speaker 1>You think that inside one,</v>

2566
01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.520
<v Speaker 1>and it always hurts.</v>

2567
01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I think sucks.</v>

2568
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you get kicked right above the knee.</v>

2569
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2570
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking terrible for feeling.</v>

2571
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.700
<v Speaker 1>It just feels like you're hoping your your ligament stay together.</v>

2572
01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And they do,</v>

2623
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:10.480
<v Speaker 5>This ain't bad.</v>

2624
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.313
<v Speaker 5>I say bad at all.</v>

2625
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:13.910
<v Speaker 5>It's small right there.</v>

2626
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:16.820
<v Speaker 5>Just triangle his legs.</v>

2627
01:06:16.821 --> 01:06:17.750
<v Speaker 5>It's all he's got to do.</v>

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:05.751
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

01:07:05.751 --> 01:07:07.950
<v Speaker 5>you went to the wrong corner down.</v>

2664
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.813
<v Speaker 5>They bet they're</v>

2665
01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.270
<v Speaker 5>all fucked up.</v>

2666
01:07:12.271 --> 01:07:13.020
<v Speaker 5>That was awesome.</v>

2667
01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:13.400
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

2668
01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.320
<v Speaker 5>British based on the night caught them with some good shots.</v>

2669
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:16.903
<v Speaker 5>Hurt him badly.</v>

2670
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:18.783
<v Speaker 5>Hurt him bad.</v>

2671
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.630
<v Speaker 5>40 seconds left to fucking go down to guard.</v>

2672
01:07:21.631 --> 01:07:21.781
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2673
01:07:21.781 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't care if you liked it.</v>

2674
01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:23.580
<v Speaker 5>Not a bad idea.</v>

2675
01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.773
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to triangle.</v>

2676
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:26.310
<v Speaker 5>Ah Man.</v>

2677
01:07:26.311 --> 01:07:27.690
<v Speaker 5>If that fight was two minutes longer,</v>

2678
01:07:27.691 --> 01:07:28.740
<v Speaker 5>he could have caught him in something.</v>

2679
01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:30.060
<v Speaker 5>He was scrambling.</v>

2680
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.890
<v Speaker 5>You got 30 seconds on top of them.</v>

2681
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.520
<v Speaker 5>30 you know how hard it is to get a finished 30 seconds.</v>

2682
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.371
<v Speaker 5>It all depends on,</v>

2683
01:07:35.371 --> 01:07:37.190
<v Speaker 5>is it the way I like it?</v>

2687
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.580
<v Speaker 5>It's so suicidal.</v>

2688
01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:45.443
<v Speaker 5>Like people say,</v>

2689
01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:50.070
<v Speaker 5>why is it so hard for Damien Maia to pull guard?</v>

2690
01:07:50.071 --> 01:07:50.880
<v Speaker 5>He'll sit on his butt.</v>

2691
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.140
<v Speaker 5>People don't want to get on top of them.</v>

2692
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2693

2772
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:45.900
<v Speaker 7>They're obviously just had that card and one,</v>

2773
01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.013
<v Speaker 7>they're heavyweights,</v>

2774
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2775
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:48.621
<v Speaker 7>tournament.</v>

2776
01:09:48.621 --> 01:09:49.041
<v Speaker 7>They're doing it,</v>

2777
01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 7>they're killing it right now.</v>

2778
01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.760
<v Speaker 7>And then really ratings really got jail fade or coming up.</v>

2779
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.713
<v Speaker 7>You got Ryan Bader,</v>

2780
01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.351
<v Speaker 7>mitre owned.</v>

2781
01:09:54.351 --> 01:09:55.590
<v Speaker 7>Well they need a heavyweight champion.</v>

2782
01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:55.740
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2783
01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:56.001
<v Speaker 7>Michael.</v>

2784
01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:58.260
<v Speaker 7>Then in page you see that they don't have a heavyweight champion.</v>

2785
01:09:58.261 --> 01:09:58.971
<v Speaker 7>Can I have one now?</v>

2786
01:09:58.971 --> 01:09:59.610
<v Speaker 7>Under the year?</v>

2787
01:09:59.610 --> 01:10:00.230
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2788
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:01.340
<v Speaker 7>There aren't that many big guys.</v>

2789
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:02.230
<v Speaker 7>It's Ryan Bader.</v>

2790
01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:03.110
<v Speaker 7>It could be issues,</v>

2791
01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:03.351
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2792
01:10:03.351 --> 01:10:05.540
<v Speaker 7>Cause he's a light heavyweight and he's the light heavyweight champ.</v>

2793
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.820
<v Speaker 7>But maybe fights better at at heavyweight than he does it line everywhere.</v>

2794
01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.713
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>

2795
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.630
<v Speaker 7>She felt Davis' head kicked Kale.</v>

2796
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.970
<v Speaker 7>That was crazy.</v>

2797
01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:13.761
<v Speaker 7>Davis looks good.</v>

2798
01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:14.594

01:10:33.111 --> 01:10:33.944
<v Speaker 7>Mixed it up.</v>

2814
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.600
<v Speaker 7>We're missing Colorado going,</v>

2815
01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:38.841

01:10:43.241 --> 01:10:43.551
<v Speaker 7>What is it?</v>

2823
01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.700
<v Speaker 7>Why does he throw the front kick?</v>

2824
01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:47.211
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2825
01:10:47.211 --> 01:10:48.200
<v Speaker 7>shoot him again.</v>

2826
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:49.330
<v Speaker 7>Oop.</v>

2827
01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:53.750
<v Speaker 7>He guilt guilting coming in hot note pads again.</v>

2828
01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:55.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2829
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.331
<v Speaker 7>You can't get it as well.</v>

2830
01:11:00.331 --> 01:11:03.710
<v Speaker 7>I grew up trying on the body and doing a good job at defending.</v>

2831
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:06.050
<v Speaker 7>You wouldn't give that first round ten eight what'd you</v>

2832
01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.770
<v Speaker 7>Nah,</v>

2833
01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:09.230
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2834
01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:09.950
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

2835
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.180
<v Speaker 7>Maybe he ain't been down.</v>

2836
01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 7>The rules with the number plate.</v>

2837
01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.413
<v Speaker 7>What's the new rule?</v>

2838
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 7>The new</v>

2839
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.270
<v Speaker 2>a scoring system.</v>

2840
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:15.980
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

2841
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.131
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2842
01:11:16.131 --> 01:11:20.070
<v Speaker 2>the new scoring system is when you show like a clear advantage,</v>

2843
01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to have someone look at it.</v>

2844
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.960
<v Speaker 2>But a clear advantage is the difference between like winning and winning.</v>

2845
01:11:27.331 --> 01:11:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Like clearly he clearly won that first round.</v>

2846
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I would have to look at it like how they,</v>

2847
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>how they uh,</v>

2848
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:33.271
<v Speaker 2>frame it.</v>

2849
01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Now I think we have a real problem being imprisoned by that 10 point system.</v>

2850
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I think the 10 point system is stupid.</v>

2851
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much happened there.</v>

2852
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:46.130
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the recently there's been a bunch of early standups from</v>

2853
01:11:46.441 --> 01:11:51.441
<v Speaker 2>the ground while the Leon Roberts one with a Damien Maia and uh,</v>

2854
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:52.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2855
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:57.530
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] was ridiculous with the wizard Riddick that was super is ridiculous</v>

2856
01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.480
<v Speaker 2>that someone not knowing what's going on.</v>

2857
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:01.231
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

2858
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:04.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're dealing with a fighter that is taking a fight on last minute</v>

2859
01:12:04.591 --> 01:12:07.950
<v Speaker 2>notice against a super dominant wrestler and he essentially is in a great</v>

2860
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:12.180
<v Speaker 2>position and could maybe get his back and that just biggest advantage.</v>

2861
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.193
<v Speaker 2>You fuck them.</v>

2862
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm our county takes him down now here.</v>

2863
01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2864
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.210
<v Speaker 2>He felt was another fire recently when they were on the ground.</v>

2865
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:19.590
<v Speaker 2>The guy was like side controller,</v>

2866
01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.453
<v Speaker 2>the mount,</v>

2867
01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.300
<v Speaker 2>and then the ref stood them up like that.</v>

2868
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Upon that same chili card,</v>

2869
01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:28.470
<v Speaker 2>there's also in the girls fight where the female referee let them just stay on</v>

2870
01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:28.591
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2871
01:12:28.591 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but with no engagement.</v>

2872
01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:30.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2873
01:12:30.181 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 2>stand them up Nazi.</v>

2874
01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.120
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't want to be down there.</v>

2875
01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:33.954
<v Speaker 2>She does.</v>

2876
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.160
<v Speaker 2>No one's interacting.</v>

2877
01:12:35.161 --> 01:12:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Let's go taste it nights.</v>

2878
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:40.410
<v Speaker 2>He's got a fucking wicked mission control.</v>

2879
01:12:40.411 --> 01:12:41.940
<v Speaker 2>He pulls to that Michigan lateral.</v>

2880
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Very nice.</v>

2881
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Got immediately right now he could hit a triangle right here.</v>

2882
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Made huck look at that.</v>

2883
01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.393
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

2884
01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.090

2886
01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Connie ain't doing shit on the ground either.</v>

2887
01:12:53.531 --> 01:12:56.800
<v Speaker 2>He's not getting it mean he might be doing okay defensively,</v>

2888
01:12:56.801 --> 01:12:58.460
<v Speaker 2>but he's not getting shit off often.</v>

2889
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.600

2890
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.310
<v Speaker 2>he's threatened nonstop down there,</v>

2891
01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.210
<v Speaker 2>which to me should be a win for Jason Knight.</v>

2892
01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Jason,</v>

2893
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I'd gone for a leg lock here.</v>

2894
01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it.</v>

2895
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Amir,</v>

2896
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:10.083
<v Speaker 2>Connie Austan.</v>

2897
01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.920
<v Speaker 2>He's losing and so he goes to the ground,</v>

2898
01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:13.480
<v Speaker 2>but over that leg lock right here.</v>

2899
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

2900
01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like a around a piece.</v>

2901
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he'd be</v>

2902
01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:23.283
<v Speaker 2>judges.</v>

2903
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:25.000
<v Speaker 2>The judges for sure.</v>

2904
01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Given that the Americana,</v>

2905
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.113
<v Speaker 2>that's it's one,</v>

2906
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:27.590
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2907
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:29.530
<v Speaker 2>one with him on the ground.</v>

2908
01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.513
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

2909
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.393
<v Speaker 2>He still,</v>

2910
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:33.740
<v Speaker 2>he still took them down sucks though.</v>

2911
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Cause Jason Knight was doing work and threatened him the entire time.</v>

2912
01:13:36.401 --> 01:13:37.930
<v Speaker 2>When the gun get the gift to be a Connie,</v>

2913
01:13:37.931 --> 01:13:38.950
<v Speaker 2>he's on the defensive.</v>

2914
01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the flaws in our judging isn't,</v>

2915
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:42.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant.</v>

2916
01:13:42.671 --> 01:13:43.660
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>

2917
01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it should be like a hundred points system.</v>

2918
01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there should never be any standing up five minute rounds.</v>

2919
01:13:49.811 --> 01:13:51.190
<v Speaker 2>There should never be any standup.</v>

2920
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:51.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2921
01:13:51.521 --> 01:13:52.354
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

2922
01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Why you standing in lockdown and have forever five minutes by the time they get</v>

2923
01:13:57.101 --> 01:13:57.671
<v Speaker 2>to the ground,</v>

2924
01:13:57.671 --> 01:13:59.500
<v Speaker 2>like there's not any get downs.</v>

2925
01:13:59.530 --> 01:14:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Like if there's boring on the feet,</v>

2926
01:14:01.631 --> 01:14:02.020
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

2927
01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.570
<v Speaker 2>they're not that doing what you doing guys just hold position,</v>

2928
01:14:04.571 --> 01:14:05.370
<v Speaker 2>you know shit.</v>

2929
01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:06.101
<v Speaker 2>It's just the fight.</v>

2930
01:14:06.101 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 2>That's just how I got the fuck out of</v>

2931
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.560
<v Speaker 2>four minutes to get back up to the feet when the over,</v>

2932
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.450
<v Speaker 2>because without</v>

2933
01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:14.300
<v Speaker 5>this Brendan,</v>

2934
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:17.230
<v Speaker 5>this is what happens if you could,</v>

2935
01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 5>if they stand them up because they're holding than guys w why would they learn</v>

2936
01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu if they get taken down?</v>

2937
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:23.281
<v Speaker 5>If a strike,</v>

2938
01:14:23.281 --> 01:14:24.070
<v Speaker 5>it gets taken out.</v>

2939
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:26.680
<v Speaker 5>All you gotta do is get good at holding and the Rep's going to stand them up.</v>

2940
01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:29.740
<v Speaker 5>That's what it leads to and it fucks a sport up round three you can't have that.</v>

2941
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:30.161
<v Speaker 5>That gives,</v>

2942
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:35.161
<v Speaker 5>that gives a strike or a reason to not learn Jujitsu and just hold and look to</v>

2943
01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:35.770
<v Speaker 5>the referee,</v>

2944
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.340
<v Speaker 5>stand them up or fucks up the teachers.</v>

2945
01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 5>Learn wrestling.</v>

2946
01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.940
<v Speaker 5>Keep winning by just holding him down.</v>

2947
01:14:39.941 --> 01:14:40.774
<v Speaker 5>One take done.</v>

2948
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.730
<v Speaker 5>Then you got to learn how to fight off your back.</v>

2949
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:43.420
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2950
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.253
<v Speaker 5>you got to learn how to fight.</v>

2951
01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:46.180
<v Speaker 5>You got to push the sport.</v>

2952
01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:47.560
<v Speaker 5>You can't go backwards.</v>

2953
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:50.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm Eric standard looking for a take down again and standing up the fight.</v>

2954
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.370
<v Speaker 5>That takes everything backwards and it makes it so you don't have to learn into</v>

2955
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 5>and trying to win the fight though.</v>

2956
01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:57.730
<v Speaker 5>It's an issue that you could say the same thing about them standing.</v>

2957
01:14:57.731 --> 01:14:58.990
<v Speaker 5>That happens all the time standing.</v>

2958
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:00.130
<v Speaker 5>No one says shit about that.</v>

2959
01:15:00.131 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 5>We can't put them to the ground.</v>

2960
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:01.601
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

2961
01:15:01.601 --> 01:15:02.910
<v Speaker 5>We do an in combat Jiu Jitsu.</v>

2962
01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:05.910
<v Speaker 5>We have get down's baby kid kid down</v>

2963
01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:08.981
<v Speaker 5>to minutes.</v>

2964
01:15:08.981 --> 01:15:09.431
<v Speaker 5>If you guys,</v>

2965
01:15:09.431 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 5>there's no take down in two minutes,</v>

2966
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.650
<v Speaker 5>we get them down.</v>

2967
01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:12.910
<v Speaker 5>Remember when this was illegal,</v>

2968
01:15:12.911 --> 01:15:14.380
<v Speaker 5>these kidneys tracks were illegal.</v>

2969
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:15.520
<v Speaker 5>They're not illegal anymore.</v>

2970
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:16.720
<v Speaker 5>They should do more of those.</v>

2971
01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:18.430
<v Speaker 5>When a guy has a someone's back,</v>

2972
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:19.211
<v Speaker 5>remember how hits him.</v>

2973
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:20.230
<v Speaker 5>He used to do that to the stomach.</v>

2974
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:21.940
<v Speaker 5>Why don't they do that?</v>

2975
01:15:21.941 --> 01:15:23.140
<v Speaker 5>That opens up the neck.</v>

2976
01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.020
<v Speaker 5>People forget about it and you don't need to think about too.</v>

2977
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:26.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2978
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:26.680
<v Speaker 5>it's true.</v>

2979
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:30.250
<v Speaker 5>Totally because those are some serious kicks in.</v>

2980
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:31.780
<v Speaker 5>You're breathing,</v>

2981
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.613
<v Speaker 5>but he does it.</v>

2982
01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:35.440
<v Speaker 5>They never did create some space in America is so strong.</v>

2983
01:15:35.441 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 5>Wrestling mats had a flying Kung Fu here.</v>

2984
01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:40.550
<v Speaker 5>This guy's too greasy and he's got us.</v>

2985
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh triangle.</v>

2986
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:44.710
<v Speaker 5>you had it for a second.</v>

2988
01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:45.544
<v Speaker 5>He's trying.</v>

2989
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.710
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to throw some shit up there.</v>

2990
01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:48.340
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

2991
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.790
<v Speaker 5>So receives throwing some shit up.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Kevin has in his corner.</v>

2993
01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:52.810
<v Speaker 5>Very.</v>

01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:54.010

2995
01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:54.853
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

2996
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:56.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2997
01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.030
<v Speaker 5>100% but of course.</v>

2998
01:15:58.031 --> 01:15:59.150
<v Speaker 5>But how's your boy Dan harder.</v>

2999
01:15:59.151 --> 01:15:59.940
<v Speaker 5>You still talk to him?</v>

3000
01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:00.330
<v Speaker 5>Eddie,</v>

3001

<v Speaker 5>you in touch with him at all?</v>

3002
01:16:01.231 --> 01:16:02.290
<v Speaker 5>I haven't talked to him in a while,</v>

3003
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:04.810
<v Speaker 5>but he seems to be doing great as a commentator.</v>

3004
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.051
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3005
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:05.571
<v Speaker 5>he's doing great.</v>

3006
01:16:05.571 --> 01:16:06.291
<v Speaker 5>He's really good at it.</v>

3007
01:16:06.291 --> 01:16:06.880
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>

3008
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.260
<v Speaker 5>but he's got a book out too.</v>

3009
01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:08.771
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>

3010
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:10.660
<v Speaker 5>Like half reptile or something like that.</v>

3011
01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:12.130
<v Speaker 5>50% reptile.</v>

3012
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:14.850
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it's mixed martial arts on conspiracy theory.</v>

3013
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.793
<v Speaker 5>That life.</v>

3014
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:21.360
<v Speaker 5>It's got to go for a triangle right here and he's got a fucking madame theories.</v>

3015
01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:24.280
<v Speaker 5>Part reptile part reptiles.</v>

3016
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 5>It's about his life story.</v>

3017
01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.650
<v Speaker 5>So UFC,</v>

3018
01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:27.484
<v Speaker 5>MMA in me,</v>

3019
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.610
<v Speaker 5>part rep talk.</v>

3020
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:29.890
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's a bad name for a book.</v>

3021
01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:30.731
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3022
01:16:30.731 --> 01:16:33.070
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's got a personalization for it.</v>

3023
01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:34.763
<v Speaker 5>Lizard man.</v>

3024
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:35.320
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>

3025
01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.130
<v Speaker 5>this is a,</v>

3026
01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:38.080
<v Speaker 5>this is a terrible position for Jason Knight.</v>

3027
01:16:38.081 --> 01:16:38.710
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

3028
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:39.543
<v Speaker 5>it's losing.</v>

3029
01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.650
<v Speaker 5>Honey is not doing Jack Shit.</v>

3030
01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:42.543
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

3031
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.280
<v Speaker 5>But Jason Wright is threatening off of his back.</v>

3032
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:46.143
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3033

<v Speaker 5>there we go.</v>

3034
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:49.140
<v Speaker 5>Jamie gets caught with the crack head.</v>

3035
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.360
<v Speaker 5>That's actually quite New York crackhead,</v>

3036
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:51.671
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3037
01:16:51.671 --> 01:16:52.504
<v Speaker 5>They're</v>

3038
01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:55.270
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3039
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:56.740
<v Speaker 5>what is our mayor county going to do here?</v>

3040
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:58.030
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to stack them and,</v>

3041
01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.100
<v Speaker 5>and just pressure through and just survive here.</v>

3042
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.850
<v Speaker 5>Look at him and shit like that.</v>

3043
01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.980
<v Speaker 5>He's not doing anything.</v>

3044
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:04.210
<v Speaker 5>This is what you guys want it though.</v>

3045
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:04.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3046
01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:07.000
<v Speaker 5>I want to stand it up.</v>

3047
01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:07.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

3048
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.883
<v Speaker 5>Oh</v>

01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:11.031
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3050
01:17:11.031 --> 01:17:12.820
<v Speaker 1>When we were talking about Mark Goddard,</v>

3051
01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:17.740
<v Speaker 1>how Jesus was complaining White Dude,</v>

3052
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 1>he's not doing shit.</v>

3053
01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:19.770
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't doing shit.</v>

3054
01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.633
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

3055
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3056
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:26.000
<v Speaker 1>How dare you stand them up for action.</v>

3057
01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:27.350
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

3058
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:28.880
<v Speaker 1>There's action on the ground.</v>

3059
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:29.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3060
01:17:29.231 --> 01:17:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I like this action.</v>

3061
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3062
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:31.160
<v Speaker 1>he's stunned him.</v>

3063
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:31.993
<v Speaker 1>He's done them.</v>

3064
01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Connie,</v>

3065
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 1>please could take him down and while he wants some points while he's getting</v>

3066
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:40.664
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

3067
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:41.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a,</v>

3068
01:17:41.601 --> 01:17:43.460
<v Speaker 1>that's literally always been able to do in this fight.</v>

3069
01:17:43.461 --> 01:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

3070
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:44.901
<v Speaker 1>a couple of jabs,</v>

3071
01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>he landed in the first round.</v>

3072
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:46.783
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

3073
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:48.183
<v Speaker 1>Beaten them.</v>

3074
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:49.123
<v Speaker 1>Stand up.</v>

3075
01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:49.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3076
01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:50.650
<v Speaker 1>it's gone for a leg lock.</v>

3077
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:52.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough sell.</v>

3078
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:55.670
<v Speaker 1>He's got to do something.</v>

3079
01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:56.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3080
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:57.710
<v Speaker 1>a this now.</v>

3081
01:17:57.710 --> 01:17:58.191
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

3082
01:17:58.191 --> 01:17:59.024
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3083
01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:00.253
<v Speaker 1>But it's weird.</v>

3084
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:01.071
<v Speaker 1>He's losing the fight.</v>

3085
01:18:01.071 --> 01:18:02.090
<v Speaker 1>But what the fuck is con,</v>

3086
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:02.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3087
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:02.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

3088
01:18:02.841 --> 01:18:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Connie done taking them down.</v>

3089
01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:04.874
<v Speaker 1>But that's it.</v>

3090
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:05.803
<v Speaker 1>Is that enough?</v>

3091
01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just being on top of it enough when the guy on top,</v>

3092
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:14.720
<v Speaker 1>but he did get the tape that you got to take down.</v>

3093
01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.160
<v Speaker 1>But it's not good enough.</v>

3094
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

3095
01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:18.170
<v Speaker 1>It is in our common sport.</v>

3096
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:22.730
<v Speaker 1>But how much of this should be scored with Jason Knight controlling off of his</v>

3097
01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:24.950
<v Speaker 1>back and going for submissions versus I'm here.</v>

3098
01:18:24.951 --> 01:18:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Connie literally here doing nothing.</v>

3099
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

3100
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:29.180
<v Speaker 1>But he has can control top control.</v>

3101
01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3102
01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:29.990
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3103
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:31.370
<v Speaker 1>but also anybody's control though.</v>

3104
01:18:31.371 --> 01:18:32.181
<v Speaker 1>He's just on top.</v>

3105
01:18:32.181 --> 01:18:36.020
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have any control but just doing anything but holding him in the spot.</v>

3106
01:18:36.021 --> 01:18:36.441
<v Speaker 1>But Jason,</v>

3107
01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:37.160
<v Speaker 1>nice thought landing.</v>

3108
01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:37.401
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

3109
01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:38.470
<v Speaker 1>when he's trying,</v>

3110
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:43.460
<v Speaker 1>he's at least trying to be offensive off of his back and Connie's literally</v>

3111
01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:44.294
<v Speaker 1>doing nothing.</v>

3112
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Like all he's doing is holding on here.</v>

3113
01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:46.371
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3114
01:18:46.371 --> 01:18:47.380
<v Speaker 1>that's what you guys wanted.</v>

3115
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.140
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>

3116
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.990
<v Speaker 1>that's part of this port lands a shot there.</v>

3117
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:52.520
<v Speaker 1>He lands a shot that's good for him.</v>

3118
01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.593
<v Speaker 1>That's good for him.</v>

3119
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:55.670
<v Speaker 1>But Jason Knight is being way more active.</v>

3120
01:18:55.671 --> 01:18:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Amir.</v>

3121
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Connie thrown a few shots there.</v>

3122
01:18:57.231 --> 01:18:58.064
<v Speaker 1>Asked.</v>

3123
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3124
01:18:58.431 --> 01:18:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Now he passed.</v>

3125
01:18:59.190 --> 01:18:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3126
01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3127
01:19:00.130 --> 01:19:00.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you man.</v>

3128
01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:02.320
<v Speaker 1>But there was a boy,</v>

3129
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.931
<v Speaker 1>they score it.</v>

3130
01:19:02.931 --> 01:19:03.321
<v Speaker 1>Look out.</v>

3131
01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:04.101
<v Speaker 1>Look out for Jason Nights.</v>

3132
01:19:04.101 --> 01:19:04.934
<v Speaker 1>Neck.</v>

3133
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3134
01:19:05.691 --> 01:19:06.830
<v Speaker 1>it kind of has this fight easily.</v>

3135
01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:07.041
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

3136
01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:08.110
<v Speaker 1>He could have a 10 figure choke.</v>

3137
01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:08.660
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3138
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.081
<v Speaker 1>you remember that?</v>

3139
01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:11.270
<v Speaker 1>What does that fucking that step over?</v>

3140
01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:11.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3141
01:19:11.901 --> 01:19:12.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3142
01:19:12.021 --> 01:19:12.440
<v Speaker 1>he heard him.</v>

3143
01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.240
<v Speaker 1>He hurt him.</v>

3144
01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm your conduct or legal needle?</v>

3145
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3146
01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a punch to the suspect.</v>

3147
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I think the was to the body,</v>

3148
01:19:18.831 --> 01:19:19.101
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

3149
01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

3150
01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.150
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

3151
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

3152
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.060
<v Speaker 1>mere county definitely win this fight.</v>

3153
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:24.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's the one he finished.</v>

3154
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.460
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

3155
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 1>What's that technique?</v>

3156
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn,</v>

3157
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

3158
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.741
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3159
01:19:27.741 --> 01:19:29.900
<v Speaker 1>you got one arm under the,</v>

3160
01:19:29.901 --> 01:19:30.734
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3161
01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:31.341
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3162
01:19:31.341 --> 01:19:32.174
<v Speaker 1>the arm,</v>

3163
01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.300
<v Speaker 1>one arm over the top and you step over with the legs.</v>

3164
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:36.230
<v Speaker 1>You know that move.</v>

3165
01:19:36.231 --> 01:19:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Fuck for a proven record.</v>

3166
01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.380
<v Speaker 1>That entire time I call it a 10 figure Cho.</v>

3167
01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the proven well isn't a 10 finger choke?</v>

3168
01:19:41.721 --> 01:19:43.220
<v Speaker 1>The one when it's uh,</v>

3169
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>in the chest,</v>

3170
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you got him in the chest and you have the head planted and we should call it the</v>

3171
01:19:48.021 --> 01:19:48.801
<v Speaker 1>10 finger chokes.</v>

3172
01:19:48.801 --> 01:19:52.520
<v Speaker 1>It proved a necktie would for whatever reason we call it the 10 figures.</v>

3173
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Well Tony De Sousa is the reason why everybody calls it the Peruvian necktie</v>

3174
01:19:56.631 --> 01:20:00.870
<v Speaker 1>because he's got a pet who and there's a Peruvian darts as well too when if you</v>

3175
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:01.491
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3176
01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:02.150
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

3177
01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:02.871

3209
01:20:47.311 --> 01:20:48.600
<v Speaker 5>he didn't do anything on top,</v>

3210
01:20:48.601 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 5>but those take downs count.</v>

3211
01:20:51.130 --> 01:20:51.963
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3212
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.863
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3213
01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.113
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

3214
01:20:58.450 --> 01:20:59.800
<v Speaker 5>Now is that the coal Maine,</v>

3215
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:01.481
<v Speaker 5>do you remember?</v>

3216
01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:02.170
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

3217
01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:03.070
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that guy?</v>

3218
01:21:03.071 --> 01:21:03.904
<v Speaker 5>That was more,</v>

3219
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.540
<v Speaker 5>I think the,</v>

3220
01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:09.540
<v Speaker 5>the first gear teen master in Nma was that little pecan Kenya Guy.</v>

3221
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:11.201
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember him?</v>

3222
01:21:11.201 --> 01:21:13.150
<v Speaker 5>He used to fight and shoot a little Brazilian guy.</v>

3223
01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.130
<v Speaker 5>His name was Antonio Nogueira.</v>

3224
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3225
01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:17.430
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

3226
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:19.190
<v Speaker 5>I forget guillotine.</v>

3227
01:21:19.191 --> 01:21:20.920
<v Speaker 5>So many motherfuckers.</v>

3228
01:21:20.921 --> 01:21:21.790
<v Speaker 5>I think he was uh,</v>

3229
01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:22.751
<v Speaker 5>an Andrea Penna,</v>

3230
01:21:22.751 --> 01:21:24.520
<v Speaker 5>Doris Guy from Nova.</v>

3231
01:21:24.521 --> 01:21:25.840
<v Speaker 5>You young remember him?</v>

3232
01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.410
<v Speaker 5>He was a guy that if you shot in on him,</v>

3233
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:33.310
<v Speaker 5>he was going to guillotine you and he had his own special 10 finger guillotine.</v>

3234
01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.030
<v Speaker 5>He called.</v>

3235
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:35.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't know exactly how he did.</v>

3236
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.831
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3237
01:21:35.831 --> 01:21:39.160
<v Speaker 5>everyone's got like their own little modifications for guillotines cause you</v>

3238
01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:41.290
<v Speaker 5>really can't see the grip when you got a guillotine.</v>

3239
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.730
<v Speaker 5>The grip is actually hidden.</v>

3240
01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.570
<v Speaker 5>You really don't,</v>

3241
01:21:43.571 --> 01:21:43.681
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3242
01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:45.940
<v Speaker 5>it's a hard to tell what kind of guilting you putting in.</v>

3243
01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.940
<v Speaker 5>Even with the high elbow guillotines and Marcella,</v>

3244
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:50.103
<v Speaker 5>Marcella teen,</v>

3245
01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:50.560
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3246
01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.850
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to tell if you're holding it like this or like this because the grip</v>

3247
01:21:54.851 --> 01:21:55.684
<v Speaker 5>is hidden.</v>

3248
01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.190
<v Speaker 5>Secret guillotines and the way that pit Kango Nogueira did it,</v>

3249
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.850
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3250
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:02.830
<v Speaker 5>I still don't,</v>

3251
01:22:02.831 --> 01:22:03.880
<v Speaker 5>I still a,</v>

3252
01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:05.011
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

3253
01:22:05.011 --> 01:22:07.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like weird little secret grip.</v>

3254
01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:08.740
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever get into the Pretzel Grip?</v>

3255
01:22:08.741 --> 01:22:09.220
<v Speaker 5>Did you,</v>

3256
01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.570
<v Speaker 5>will you a big on that,</v>

3257
01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.030
<v Speaker 5>that weird grip where the,</v>

3258
01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:12.580
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3259
01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:17.580
<v Speaker 5>the palm of the bottom hand is facing outward and the palm of the topics that</v>

3260
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:19.060
<v Speaker 5>towards you.</v>

3261
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:19.900
<v Speaker 5>That's a great,</v>

3262
01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.280
<v Speaker 5>that's a great grip.</v>

3263
01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:23.510
<v Speaker 5>If you get your hands together,</v>

3264
01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.461
<v Speaker 5>that's a great grip.</v>

3265
01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:25.810
<v Speaker 5>But the reason why Marcello,</v>

3266
01:22:25.811 --> 01:22:27.640
<v Speaker 5>instead of going here,</v>

3267
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.170
<v Speaker 5>he goes here.</v>

3268
01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.510
<v Speaker 5>That's the difference is,</v>

3269
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:32.110
<v Speaker 5>is when you go here,</v>

3270
01:22:32.111 --> 01:22:34.660
<v Speaker 5>you need your palms to meet.</v>

3271
01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:35.950
<v Speaker 5>So if,</v>

3272
01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:37.480
<v Speaker 5>if there's a guy here,</v>

3273
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:38.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3274
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:40.900
<v Speaker 5>and I'm trying to guillotine and the first thing he's going to do is bring up</v>

3275
01:22:40.901 --> 01:22:42.100
<v Speaker 5>his hands like this,</v>

3276
01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:42.401
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3277
01:22:42.401 --> 01:22:44.620
<v Speaker 5>And he's going to defend a guillotine like this.</v>

3278
01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.370
<v Speaker 5>So his first move is going to be to come between your,</v>

3279
01:22:48.371 --> 01:22:49.204
<v Speaker 5>your hands,</v>

3280
01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:49.481
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3281
01:22:49.481 --> 01:22:51.310
<v Speaker 5>So if you could beat his hand,</v>

3282
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:53.470
<v Speaker 5>then you're good and this is amazing.</v>

3283
01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.690
<v Speaker 5>But if you don't beat his hand,</v>

3284
01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:56.650
<v Speaker 5>beat his hand,</v>

3285
01:22:56.650 --> 01:22:58.060
<v Speaker 5>then the guillotine is lost.</v>

3286
01:22:58.061 --> 01:22:59.630
<v Speaker 5>But if he comes up and,</v>

3287
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.160
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3288
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.430
<v Speaker 5>and blocks it like this and I come around the back of my hand,</v>

3289
01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.420
<v Speaker 5>he still fucked.</v>

3290
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 5>So it's a sense of security</v>

3291
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.180
<v Speaker 7>split decision.</v>

3292
01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:07.540
<v Speaker 7>I'm here,</v>

3293
01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:08.373
<v Speaker 7>Connie.</v>

3294
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:09.783
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>

3295
01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:13.163
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>

3296
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.333
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3297
01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.450
<v Speaker 7>Does that make sense on the grip?</v>

3298
01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.350
<v Speaker 7>Yes it does.</v>

3299
01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:16.710
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3300
01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:19.470
<v Speaker 7>the also to like the same as like with a rear naked,</v>

3301
01:23:19.471 --> 01:23:21.450
<v Speaker 7>it's like if you could keep that hand flat,</v>

3302
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.190
<v Speaker 7>it's easy to slide it up in there.</v>

3303
01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.250
<v Speaker 7>Then if you got it like this where it's hard to get underneath the chin.</v>

3304
01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:30.000
<v Speaker 7>I'm not too sure about that with the guillotine.</v>

3305
01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:32.300
<v Speaker 7>It's just a lot of people do it with the Pretzel Grip here.</v>

3306
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:33.090
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3307
01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:35.520
<v Speaker 7>But you got to get your hands together.</v>

3308
01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.300
<v Speaker 7>Marcello Garcia variation.</v>

3309
01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.340
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't matter that your hands are going to come up.</v>

3310
01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.330
<v Speaker 7>They think they're safe,</v>

3311
01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.640
<v Speaker 7>but we're going behind our own hand.</v>

3312
01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:46.163
<v Speaker 7>So that's what,</v>

3313
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:50.880
<v Speaker 7>that's when Marcello was fucking people up with that on the daily,</v>

3314
01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.650
<v Speaker 7>no one can black belts.</v>

3315
01:23:52.651 --> 01:23:52.801
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3316
01:23:52.801 --> 01:23:53.880
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is going on?</v>

3317
01:23:53.881 --> 01:23:55.830
<v Speaker 7>I'm defending the Guillotine and I'm still tapping,</v>

3318
01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.370
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

3319
01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:59.450
<v Speaker 7>It was the grip they given to went decision.</v>

3320
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.333
<v Speaker 7>I'm or Connie?</v>

3321
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.823

<v Speaker 5>You're not like a real comedian.</v>

3425

<v Speaker 5>Real comedians go out all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That was so much fun.</v>

3438
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Is it all just conspiracy theory stand up,</v>

3439
01:27:24.231 --> 01:27:26.960
<v Speaker 5>because I know you guys are calling it tinfoil hat conspiracy night.</v>

3440
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:28.760
<v Speaker 5>Is that just because of the podcast name?</v>

3441
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:29.720
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3442
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.290
<v Speaker 5>it's um,</v>

3443
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:32.420
<v Speaker 5>it's more designed to,</v>

01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3456
01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:50.120
<v Speaker 5>At the end we do a question and answer type of like a mini podcast thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>if they have too much extra words in them,</v>

3467
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:03.790
<v Speaker 5>if they're too fake,</v>

3468
01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.060
<v Speaker 5>if they come off Corny,</v>

3469
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.901
<v Speaker 5>that bedroom,</v>

3470
01:28:05.901 --> 01:28:06.591

3471
01:28:06.591 --> 01:28:07.424
<v Speaker 5>can feel it.</v>

3472
01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:09.200
<v Speaker 5>I've always liked to run my,</v>

3473
01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:11.630
<v Speaker 5>my material in that room before I do anything.</v>

3474
01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:12.860
<v Speaker 5>Joey did his short,</v>

3475
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:13.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3476
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:14.550
<v Speaker 5>I've never been in that room in the,</v>

3477
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:15.381
<v Speaker 5>in the ice house.</v>

3478
01:28:15.381 --> 01:28:15.711
<v Speaker 5>The one,</v>

3479
01:28:15.711 --> 01:28:16.250
<v Speaker 5>not the Ma,</v>

3480
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:17.630
<v Speaker 5>the big room they did in the small,</v>

3481
01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.401
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like the bell.</v>

3482
01:28:18.401 --> 01:28:18.810
<v Speaker 5>The room.</v>

3483
01:28:18.810 --> 01:28:19.200
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3484
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:19.880
<v Speaker 5>House.</v>

3485
01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:20.713
<v Speaker 5>That's where he did it.</v>

3486
01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.010
<v Speaker 5>That room's amazing.</v>

3487
01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:23.840
<v Speaker 5>That's what we just done that a couple of times.</v>

3488
01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:24.500
<v Speaker 5>A Joey too.</v>

3489
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.230
<v Speaker 5>That's a great one.</v>

3490
01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:26.063
<v Speaker 5>It's a great room.</v>

3491
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:28.760
<v Speaker 5>When I opened for Joey,</v>

3492
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:33.630
<v Speaker 5>I love it because it's probably 90% Latin and I love,</v>

3493
01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:34.970
<v Speaker 5>I love telling Mexican jokes.</v>

3494
01:28:34.971 --> 01:28:36.320
<v Speaker 5>I got so many Mexican stories.</v>

3495
01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:37.550
<v Speaker 5>It's just all fun.</v>

3496
01:28:37.551 --> 01:28:39.200
<v Speaker 5>There's no conspiracy theories going on.</v>

3497
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.410
<v Speaker 5>And with those crowds crowds to like 90% Latin.</v>

3498
01:28:42.411 --> 01:28:43.090
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3499
01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:44.120
<v Speaker 5>No last night was it?</v>

3500
01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:44.600
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3501
01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.710
<v Speaker 5>it seemed like it was when it's interesting like in Ontario,</v>

3502
01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Ontario's 9% Latin,</v>

3503
01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:51.441
<v Speaker 5>two hours,</v>

3504
01:28:51.441 --> 01:28:52.280
<v Speaker 5>a lot of fun.</v>

3505
01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.430
<v Speaker 5>It's a great room until levity in Oxnard,</v>

3506
01:28:55.500 --> 01:29:00.500
<v Speaker 5>a lot of Lake Ontario podcast last week.</v>

3507
01:29:00.651 --> 01:29:01.484
<v Speaker 5>And he said that</v>

3508
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 1>that because of you,</v>

3509
01:29:04.111 --> 01:29:04.321
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3510
01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:04.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3511
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 1>he said that he was telling you that Russian mafia story and then you said you</v>

3512
01:29:08.281 --> 01:29:09.061
<v Speaker 1>should do it on stage.</v>

3513
01:29:09.061 --> 01:29:09.894
<v Speaker 1>And then he did it and it,</v>

3514
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and it blew up at Russian mob story.</v>

3515
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And then I remembered I go,</v>

3516
01:29:13.501 --> 01:29:16.480
<v Speaker 1>you know what Joe told me to do that bleeding asshole story</v>

3517
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:20.280
<v Speaker 1>problem with blood coming out of my ass.</v>

3518
01:29:20.670 --> 01:29:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So I told them what,</v>

3519
01:29:22.201 --> 01:29:23.790
<v Speaker 1>how I fixed it and he goes,</v>

3520
01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:24.001
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3521
01:29:24.001 --> 01:29:25.200
<v Speaker 1>you got to do that onstage.</v>

3522
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:25.621
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3523
01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:26.410
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3524
01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:28.620
<v Speaker 1>At the first my first reaction was like fuck no,</v>

3525
01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to talk about that on stage,</v>

3526
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:34.040
<v Speaker 1>but I did it Friday and it went over well to it.</v>

3527
01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:35.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny story man.</v>

3528
01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 1>When you told her I was howling laughing.</v>

3529
01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.201
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

3530
01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I like you say that like,</v>

3531
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>oh you should do that bleeding asshole story and people who are listening,</v>

3532
01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:41.940
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with these?</v>

3533
01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:42.773
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

3534
01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:47.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a matter of like how you were telling me the story and when you</v>

3535
01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:48.450
<v Speaker 1>were telling me a story,</v>

3536
01:29:48.451 --> 01:29:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I was cracking up.</v>

3537
01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean I am not a comedy Snob by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

3538
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I like comedy.</v>

3539
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I like things that are funny and if it happens to be funny for x,</v>

3540
01:29:57.511 --> 01:29:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Y or z reason,</v>

3541
01:29:58.681 --> 01:29:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

3542
01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:00.653
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>

3543
01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I like to laugh.</v>

3544
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I like funny shit.</v>

3545
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.811
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3546
01:30:03.811 --> 01:30:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that like,</v>

3547
01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:06.270
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>

3548
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:08.760
<v Speaker 1>there's certain subjects that should be off limits.</v>

3549
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:10.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of how you approach the subject.</v>

3550
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 1>If it's a part of life,</v>

3551
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the problem is a lot of subjects are tainted because a lot of people do bad</v>

3552
01:30:17.881 --> 01:30:20.990
<v Speaker 1>comedy that's like cheap and easy and they,</v>

3553
01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:21.391
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3554
01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:21.960
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

3555
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 1>they use those subjects instead of,</v>

3556
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:26.830
<v Speaker 1>because the subjects are interesting and they,</v>

3557
01:30:26.850 --> 01:30:28.470
<v Speaker 1>they have like a real valid point.</v>

3558
01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 1>They use those subjects because they know it's going to get a cheap laugh.</v>

3559
01:30:31.171 --> 01:30:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Like a no original thought was the Fart joke or a cheap,</v>

3560
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:34.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3561
01:30:34.621 --> 01:30:35.610
<v Speaker 1>whatever kind of joke.</v>

3562
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:35.911
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3563
01:30:35.911 --> 01:30:37.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of cheap jokes,</v>

3564
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but then there's like a real live situation when you have to shit your pants,</v>

3565
01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:42.830
<v Speaker 1>like told her you should.</v>

3566
01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Fear had a fucking hilarious joke about,</v>

3567
01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.600
<v Speaker 1>there was a bridge across,</v>

3568
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.380

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:51.770
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy bridge.</v>

3571
01:30:51.771 --> 01:30:53.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like two miles long or something.</v>

3572
01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:57.060
<v Speaker 1>You walk across it and he was halfway across the bridge and you had a shit his</v>

3573
01:30:57.061 --> 01:30:59.220
<v Speaker 1>pants and he tell,</v>

3575
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:03.991
<v Speaker 1>that's a shit joke.</v>

3576
01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:05.760
<v Speaker 1>You gotta stop doing that joke and already looked at him.</v>

3577

3600
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:48.301

<v Speaker 1>what do you need to do is wear a tie?</v>

3608
01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Well you need to do is change your ride.</v>

3609
01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 1>What you need to do is go clean.</v>

3610
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I went through all that shit too.</v>

3611
01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:03.700
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a stage where they just leave you the fuck alone.</v>

3612
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Ari is now in that leave you the fuck.</v>

3613
01:32:06.801 --> 01:32:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's successful because he's successful.</v>

3614
01:32:08.650 --> 01:32:09.431
<v Speaker 1>When you're successful,</v>

3615
01:32:09.431 --> 01:32:10.370
<v Speaker 1>you can say what you want to do it.</v>

3616
01:32:10.371 --> 01:32:13.420
<v Speaker 1>A few years back he was in that you might make it,</v>

3617
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you might fall apart stage in in an agent's eyes like agents look at you and</v>

3618
01:32:18.101 --> 01:32:18.311
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

3619
01:32:18.311 --> 01:32:18.671
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3620
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:18.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3621
01:32:18.971 --> 01:32:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Eddie might be able to make it,</v>

3622
01:32:20.441 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to change some things.</v>

3623
01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:22.870
<v Speaker 1>It would change the way you're dressed.</v>

3624
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Change your hair drop.</v>

3625
01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.990
<v Speaker 1>You were eating as all star bleeding.</v>

3626
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Asshole thing is alienating fans,</v>

3627
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:29.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3628
01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 1>and they get it in their head that they know how to fix your act.</v>

3629
01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 1>They're almost always wrong.</v>

3630
01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.870
<v Speaker 1>They're almost always wrong or he's hilarious.</v>

3631
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3632
01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:38.043
<v Speaker 1>we have the same major.</v>

3633
01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 1>He didn't tell him either one of us.</v>

3634
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Shit already doesn't give a fuck.</v>

3635
01:32:41.531 --> 01:32:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3636
01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:42.851
<v Speaker 1>Ari is like,</v>

3637
01:32:42.851 --> 01:32:44.440

<v Speaker 1>he's got a flip phone,</v>

3639
01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:48.910
<v Speaker 1>but he's my favorite example of a dude who got money,</v>

3640
01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:52.810
<v Speaker 1>got some fame and some wealth and got some success and just said,</v>

01:32:54.041 --> 01:32:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing whatever I want.</v>

3643
01:32:55.361 --> 01:32:55.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:33:00.401 --> 01:33:00.671
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

3648
01:33:00.671 --> 01:33:01.660
<v Speaker 1>he's going somewhere now.</v>

3649
01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Does he want a toy?</v>

3650
01:33:02.650 --> 01:33:03.100
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3651
01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:05.420
<v Speaker 1>he just needs a certain minimum and that's all he cares about.</v>

3652
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:06.370
<v Speaker 1>He hits that things out.</v>

3653
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.360
<v Speaker 1>He made his monthly nut or his yearly nut.</v>

3679
01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:37.140
<v Speaker 1>He just really enjoys going to different cultures and be,</v>

3680
01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:37.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3681
01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:39.940
<v Speaker 1>he went to fucking Asia dude like Asia,</v>

3682
01:33:39.941 --> 01:33:44.941
<v Speaker 1>Asia standing pistils and shit staying in places where like 18 year old</v>

3683
01:33:45.250 --> 01:33:48.760
<v Speaker 1>backpackers go doves like your feeling that you're in danger.</v>

3684
01:33:48.761 --> 01:33:49.250
<v Speaker 1>He was not.</v>

3685
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.811
<v Speaker 1>Not Ever,</v>

3686
01:33:49.811 --> 01:33:50.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3687
01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:50.860
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3688
01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm too scared to do that.</v>

3689
01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to do that.</v>

3690
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:53.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3691
01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's dangerous.</v>

3692
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean it think it's rarely dangerous,</v>

3693
01:33:57.311 --> 01:33:59.110
<v Speaker 1>but I think any kind of travel,</v>

3694
01:33:59.440 --> 01:33:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3695
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm talking about traveling to a bar in,</v>

3696
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3697
01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Canoga Park could be dangerous.</v>

3698
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:05.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3699
01:34:05.741 --> 01:34:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you hear about it in a story.</v>

3700
01:34:06.911 --> 01:34:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Schaub Joe Rug and go to a bar and Canoga Joe gets stabbed by some crazy</v>

3701
01:34:10.901 --> 01:34:11.530
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

3702
01:34:11.530 --> 01:34:11.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3703
01:34:11.711 --> 01:34:12.820
<v Speaker 1>don't go to Canoga Park.</v>

3704
01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:13.990
<v Speaker 1>That's not what it is.</v>

3705
01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:17.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just like life is occasionally dangerous.</v>

3706
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3707
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think those hostels are most of those hostels or just college kids that</v>

3708
01:34:22.811 --> 01:34:25.660
<v Speaker 1>are just traveling abroad and looking to see the world.</v>

3709
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I've always been scared of hostels.</v>

3710
01:34:26.801 --> 01:34:28.660
<v Speaker 1>My brother stayed when you're up until he woke up.</v>

3711
01:34:28.661 --> 01:34:30.370
<v Speaker 1>So in sucking on his toes.</v>

3712
01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:34.443
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

3713
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Well what?</v>

3714
01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I was scared of it because of those horror movies,</v>

3715
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 1>the hostel,</v>

3716
01:34:40.361 --> 01:34:40.980
<v Speaker 1>the hostel,</v>

3717
01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:42.810
<v Speaker 1>are we fucking terrifying.</v>

3718
01:34:43.230 --> 01:34:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Part two's even more sta.</v>

3719
01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:46.660

<v Speaker 1>How's still is so hostile is brutal man.</v>

3721
01:34:51.130 --> 01:34:52.610
<v Speaker 1>How easy is it to,</v>

3722
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:53.930
<v Speaker 1>to Lord,</v>

3723
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you know those 18 year old backpackers that are across Europe?</v>

3724
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 2>So I'll leave you dude.</v>

3725
01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:04.910
<v Speaker 2>All you gotta do is get hot chicks point out the dude's a hot chicks would drag</v>

3726
01:35:04.911 --> 01:35:05.744
<v Speaker 2>him into some shit.</v>

3727
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Put some,</v>

3728
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:10.700
<v Speaker 2>put some drugs in that drinks and book and two 50 year old and a 35 year old.</v>

3729
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:11.534
<v Speaker 2>A hot chick.</v>

3730
01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 2>But Ya,</v>

3731
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:12.681
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3732
01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:13.514
<v Speaker 2>where are we going</v>

3733
01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:15.411
<v Speaker 2>to get it?</v>

3734
01:35:15.411 --> 01:35:18.290
<v Speaker 2>But when you're 20 when you're 21 warm hole in the wall,</v>

3735
01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying easy.</v>

3736
01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:21.260
<v Speaker 2>That's how they got them.</v>

3737
01:35:21.261 --> 01:35:21.920
<v Speaker 2>And hostile.</v>

3738
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.180
<v Speaker 2>They just said they just sent chicks.</v>

3739
01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:27.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the easy chicks work every due to fall,</v>

3740
01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:28.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3741
01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 2>They'll fall right into it.</v>

3742
01:35:29.541 --> 01:35:29.841
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

3743
01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Chicks with drugs,</v>

3744
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3745
01:35:31.251 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Speaker 2>drink and it's over.</v>

3746
01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.930
<v Speaker 2>But I think for a lot of those people that travel like that and live like that,</v>

3747
01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:40.220
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be very hard to settle down once you get used to just traveling.</v>

3748
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:44.900
<v Speaker 2>And doing drugs and partying places and I feel like that movie doesn't end well</v>

3749
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:45.500
<v Speaker 2>for those people.</v>

3750
01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.240
<v Speaker 2>There's no like real stability.</v>

3751
01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:47.751
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3752
01:35:47.751 --> 01:35:48.960
<v Speaker 2>the meaning of life.</v>

3753
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Everyone.</v>

3754
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has their own movie playing right now.</v>

3755
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.171
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3756
01:35:51.171 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 2>it definitely doesn't end well.</v>

3757
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe start a pottery business or some shit</v>

3758
01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.620
<v Speaker 2>like and pottery.</v>

3759
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:59.360
<v Speaker 2>What does this one,</v>

3760
01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 2>this is another movie that Eli Roth made.</v>

3761
01:36:01.341 --> 01:36:02.151
<v Speaker 2>He also made hostile.</v>

3762
01:36:02.151 --> 01:36:03.090
<v Speaker 2>It's called green inferno.</v>

3763
01:36:03.170 --> 01:36:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I did see this.</v>

3764
01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Where did they get eaten by?</v>

3765
01:36:06.231 --> 01:36:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Cannibals.</v>

3766
01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I like to Brazil or somewhere.</v>

3767
01:36:08.370 --> 01:36:09.203
<v Speaker 2>Some</v>

3768
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.160
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

3769
01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:11.901
<v Speaker 2>This was breezy.</v>

3770
01:36:11.901 --> 01:36:14.060
<v Speaker 2>It was like some remote location,</v>

3771
01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 2>like in the jungle.</v>

3772
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:16.970
<v Speaker 2>I was actually a little disappointed in this.</v>

3773
01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:17.481
<v Speaker 2>The trailer.</v>

3774
01:36:17.481 --> 01:36:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3775
01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:18.613
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

3776
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Picture of the head and the upper left hand corner.</v>

3777
01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.380
<v Speaker 2>There's some crazy shit that happens in the movie to send me that.</v>

3778
01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Send me that a text message,</v>

3779
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.230
<v Speaker 2>man to watch.</v>

3780
01:36:27.231 --> 01:36:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think like Brazil,</v>

3781
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.520
<v Speaker 2>like tourism is down 8000% because of these fucking movies.</v>

3782
01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.051
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3783
01:36:34.051 --> 01:36:34.880
<v Speaker 2>It happens though.</v>

3784
01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Shit does happen,</v>

3785
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.651
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

3786
01:36:36.651 --> 01:36:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Still maybe Brazil was like slow the fuck down with these goddamn movies,</v>

3787
01:36:40.071 --> 01:36:45.071
<v Speaker 2>but they do have the biggest rain forest in the world and they do shit.</v>

3788
01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Amazon forest.</v>

3789
01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:48.913
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't be,</v>

3790
01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I was a text Tim Kenny and I say,</v>

3791
01:36:51.291 --> 01:36:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe when he's talking about all of those Nazis.</v>

3792
01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:55.910
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is is that</v>

3793
01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.960
<v Speaker 2>they flew from Germany to fucking Argentina.</v>

3794
01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:01.610
<v Speaker 2>That's a true story until I text them too.</v>

3795
01:37:01.611 --> 01:37:01.851
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

3796
01:37:01.851 --> 01:37:02.684
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3797

3798
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:08.000

<v Speaker 2>100,000 and you go to the village.</v>

<v Speaker 5>if you have to decide right now,</v>

3893
01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:23.850
<v Speaker 5>did Hitler die in that Bin on?</v>

3894
01:39:23.851 --> 01:39:24.770
<v Speaker 5>Like history tells you,</v>

3895
01:39:24.771 --> 01:39:26.520
<v Speaker 5>and this is Tim Kennedy.</v>

3896
01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:27.690
<v Speaker 5>He's never told a lie in his life.</v>

3897
01:39:27.691 --> 01:39:28.230

3900
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.130
<v Speaker 5>And he'd be so happy about what that history is wrong.</v>

3901
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:37.470
<v Speaker 5>History is often wrong.</v>

3902
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:40.710
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying is during Kennedy approves it,</v>

3977
01:41:30.011 --> 01:41:32.230
<v Speaker 5>for some reason I thought you were doing standup for a year.</v>

3978
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:33.090
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing it.</v>

3979
01:41:33.090 --> 01:41:35.290
<v Speaker 5>My first spot was at the comedy store.</v>

3980
01:41:35.291 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 5>I have it written my phone.</v>

3981
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:38.110
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to look comedy chaos night.</v>

3982
01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:38.910

3985
01:41:39.521 --> 01:41:39.950
<v Speaker 5>it was a,</v>

3986
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:41.260
<v Speaker 5>they gave me a spot in the belly room,</v>

3987
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:45.190
<v Speaker 5>fastest rising comedian of all time,</v>

3988
01:41:45.730 --> 01:41:46.510
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3989
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:50.530
<v Speaker 5>With zero standup experience and then all of a sudden you do standup and now</v>

3990
01:41:50.531 --> 01:41:53.380
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking playing all over the world making loot.</v>

3991
01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.273
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3992
01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:54.910
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

3993
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:55.691
<v Speaker 5>You're getting paid,</v>

3994
01:41:55.691 --> 01:41:56.320
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3995
01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3996
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.851
<v Speaker 5>That's almost as good.</v>

3997
01:41:57.851 --> 01:41:58.481
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>

3998
01:41:58.481 --> 01:42:00.130
<v Speaker 5>I'll never fast fall time.</v>

3999
01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:01.333
<v Speaker 5>You could be,</v>

4000
01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.560
<v Speaker 5>generally you grind for about 10 years until you pop if you do it all,</v>

4001
01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:08.981
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

4002
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:09.360
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4003
01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.370
<v Speaker 5>but I think you can do like the Charlie Sheen route where if you have some sort</v>

4004
01:42:12.371 --> 01:42:12.821
<v Speaker 5>of falling,</v>

4005
01:42:12.821 --> 01:42:13.990
<v Speaker 5>you do shows and then people are like,</v>

4006
01:42:13.991 --> 01:42:14.681
<v Speaker 5>this sucks.</v>

4007
01:42:14.681 --> 01:42:15.514
<v Speaker 5>I don't come back.</v>

4008
01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:19.990
<v Speaker 5>I think the sign of it is that you can come back to if you sell tickets of</v>

4009
01:42:19.991 --> 01:42:21.250
<v Speaker 5>places you've been before.</v>

4010
01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.220
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4011
01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:22.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4012
01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:23.080
<v Speaker 5>So it's not,</v>

4013
01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:24.340
<v Speaker 5>so they know it's not a gimmick.</v>

4014
01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:25.353
<v Speaker 5>That's the big thing.</v>

4015
01:42:25.450 --> 01:42:25.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4016
01:42:25.721 --> 01:42:25.901
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4017
01:42:25.901 --> 01:42:27.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing it and which I can learn.</v>

4018
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:28.210
<v Speaker 5>It's either way.</v>

4019
01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:28.871
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible.</v>

4020
01:42:28.871 --> 01:42:29.780

<v Speaker 5>Sam was telling me you are killing it.</v>

4038
01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:55.660
<v Speaker 5>The other night I had a good set Friday night.</v>

4039
01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:57.340
<v Speaker 5>It came together.</v>

4040
01:42:57.610 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>

4041
01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.780
<v Speaker 5>it was the first set I did not stoned.</v>

4042
01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.320
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

4043
01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.370
<v Speaker 5>So I decided,</v>

4044
01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.353
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

4045
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:06.910
<v Speaker 5>unless you're really good at something,</v>

4046
01:43:06.911 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be smoking weed and doing it.</v>

4047
01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:09.251
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4048
01:43:09.251 --> 01:43:13.360
<v Speaker 5>And until you are super confident and you got your shit down,</v>

4049
01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.540
<v Speaker 5>don't smoke week.</v>

4050
01:43:14.590 --> 01:43:15.251
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4051
01:43:15.251 --> 01:43:17.320
<v Speaker 5>So I decided to try it out,</v>

4052
01:43:17.321 --> 01:43:21.210
<v Speaker 5>like not smoke weed and go on stage and see what happens and earn.</v>

4053
01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:21.700
<v Speaker 5>It went good.</v>

4054
01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 5>It went,</v>

4055
01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:25.050
<v Speaker 5>it went better than that was probably my best set.</v>

4056
01:43:25.051 --> 01:43:25.210
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4057
01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:27.640
<v Speaker 5>and then you guys are at cobb's on Friday,</v>

01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.641
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

01:43:45.641 --> 01:43:47.320
<v Speaker 5>Then we do a Saturday,</v>

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.133
<v Speaker 5>So that's a smaller,</v>

4081
01:43:50.150 --> 01:43:53.150
<v Speaker 5>that's like I think 150 to hundred or something like that.</v>

4082
01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4083
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.530
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

4084
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:55.363
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4085
01:43:55.630 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 5>Can San Fran to,</v>

4086
01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:58.040
<v Speaker 5>until I get my shit together,</v>

4087
01:43:58.041 --> 01:43:58.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4088
01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go on stage,</v>

4089
01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:00.363
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4090
01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.990
<v Speaker 5>clear-eyed or this the smartest route man.</v>

4091
01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:03.981
<v Speaker 5>And then later,</v>

4092
01:44:03.981 --> 01:44:04.700
<v Speaker 5>once I,</v>

4093
01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:07.580
<v Speaker 5>once I feel super confident in my material,</v>

4094
01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:08.190
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4095
01:44:08.190 --> 01:44:09.023
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

4096
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:15.340
<v Speaker 5>my problem is I have way too much material and it's just scattered everywhere.</v>

4097
01:44:15.650 --> 01:44:16.670
<v Speaker 5>All these ideas,</v>

4098
01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:19.130
<v Speaker 5>every day I have new ideas,</v>

4099
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:22.070
<v Speaker 5>but they need to be organized more and fleshed out.</v>

4100
01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.840
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I did for this show too.</v>

4101
01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:24.261
<v Speaker 5>I decided,</v>

4102
01:44:24.261 --> 01:44:24.920
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

4103
01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.930
<v Speaker 5>there's just so much and it's overwhelming.</v>

4104
01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.180
<v Speaker 5>I just took three pieces,</v>

4105
01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:29.661
<v Speaker 5>pull my goal.</v>

4106
01:44:29.661 --> 01:44:30.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to stick to these three.</v>

4107
01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:32.513
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4108
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:33.470
<v Speaker 5>exactly,</v>

4109
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:34.130
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

4110
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:34.880
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4111
01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:35.713
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4112
01:44:36.150 --> 01:44:38.000
<v Speaker 5>I've served as great at helping with that too.</v>

4113
01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:41.120
<v Speaker 5>At first I was writing everything out and then I,</v>

4114
01:44:41.121 --> 01:44:41.741
<v Speaker 5>then Joe,</v>

4115
01:44:41.741 --> 01:44:42.470
<v Speaker 5>he told me,</v>

4116
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:43.100
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

4117
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:43.431
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

4118
01:44:43.431 --> 01:44:43.820
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

4119
01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:48.260
<v Speaker 5>you're at your best when you don't write it out and you just go off the cuff.</v>

4120
01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:48.851
<v Speaker 5>So Joe,</v>

4121
01:44:48.851 --> 01:44:49.684
<v Speaker 5>he told me,</v>

4122
01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.600
<v Speaker 5>just have ideas but don't write anything out and just go out there and try it.</v>

4123
01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:53.801
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

4124
01:44:53.801 --> 01:44:57.480
<v Speaker 5>and I did that and I think that's for me that,</v>

4125
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:57.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4126
01:44:57.770 --> 01:45:01.460
<v Speaker 5>Friday I just had powerpoints and a couple of lines like okay,</v>

4127
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:03.890
<v Speaker 5>this line is kind of funny in that line is kind of funny.</v>

4128
01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:07.970
<v Speaker 5>And then I just went off and just kind of just went for it.</v>

4129
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:09.260
<v Speaker 5>It worked out great.</v>

4130
01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:09.741
<v Speaker 5>It worked out.</v>

4131
01:45:09.741 --> 01:45:10.160
<v Speaker 5>Samsung,</v>

4132
01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.620
<v Speaker 5>I just doing the ice house last night was him.</v>

4133
01:45:12.621 --> 01:45:13.250
<v Speaker 5>He said it good.</v>

4134
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:13.740
<v Speaker 5>Oh cool.</v>

4135
01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:14.000
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

4136
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.220
<v Speaker 5>You guys write your material out,</v>

4137
01:45:16.670 --> 01:45:17.260
<v Speaker 5>material out.</v>

4138
01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:17.541
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4139
01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:17.961
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

4140
01:45:17.961 --> 01:45:21.860
<v Speaker 5>because hanging out with you for fucking 20 years in the comedy clubs,</v>

4141
01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:22.170
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4142
01:45:22.170 --> 01:45:22.851

4144
01:45:23.871 --> 01:45:24.720
<v Speaker 5>you got to write shit.</v>

4145
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:25.740
<v Speaker 5>You tell every company,</v>

4146
01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:25.941
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4147
01:45:25.941 --> 01:45:26.330
<v Speaker 5>Yah.</v>

4148
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:27.200
<v Speaker 5>So that's what I was doing.</v>

4149
01:45:27.201 --> 01:45:29.640
<v Speaker 5>I was writing everything out and a Joe,</v>

4150
01:45:29.641 --> 01:45:30.121
<v Speaker 5>he told me,</v>

4151
01:45:30.121 --> 01:45:31.040
<v Speaker 5>he goes right now,</v>

4152
01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:32.780
<v Speaker 5>maybe you shouldn't write shit out.</v>

4153
01:45:32.781 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 5>Just go out there and just free ball,</v>

4154
01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:35.540
<v Speaker 5>just have some ideas.</v>

4155
01:45:35.541 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

4156
01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:36.860
<v Speaker 5>are you sure?</v>

4157
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.941
<v Speaker 5>And he said yeah.</v>

4158
01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:40.040
<v Speaker 5>So I did a couple of spots with them at that,</v>

4159
01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:41.083
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4160
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:42.470
<v Speaker 5>Ontario Improv.</v>

4161
01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.270
<v Speaker 5>And those are,</v>

4162
01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.850
<v Speaker 5>those are two of the best shows I've done with Joey.</v>

4163
01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.140
<v Speaker 5>So I decided to do that.</v>

4164
01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:49.580
<v Speaker 5>Just have instead of write everything out,</v>

4165
01:45:49.610 --> 01:45:51.230
<v Speaker 5>maybe write out the funny,</v>

4166
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:52.011
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean,</v>

4167
01:45:52.011 --> 01:45:57.011
<v Speaker 5>but just kind of go out there and then repeating the same set over doing new</v>

4168
01:45:57.051 --> 01:45:58.820
<v Speaker 5>sets of written every sets mixed up.</v>

4169
01:45:58.821 --> 01:45:59.654
<v Speaker 5>Different</v>

4170
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:05.000
<v Speaker 5>bullet points or like what's like say if you had a bid on building a table,</v>

4171
01:46:05.001 --> 01:46:05.770
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4172
01:46:05.770 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 5>Like it's the bullet points,</v>

4173
01:46:07.071 --> 01:46:07.881
<v Speaker 5>the funny parts.</v>

4174
01:46:07.881 --> 01:46:09.770
<v Speaker 5>You have memorized the line,</v>

4175
01:46:09.771 --> 01:46:13.160
<v Speaker 5>like memorize the fund and then the way you set it up,</v>

4176
01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:14.090
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to Kinda,</v>

4177
01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.250
<v Speaker 5>I kinda just go for it cause it's more natural.</v>

4178
01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:16.791
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4179
01:46:16.791 --> 01:46:18.590
<v Speaker 5>Cause if you start memorizing shit,</v>

4180
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.843
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4181
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:22.670
<v Speaker 5>it takes away from the spontaneity.</v>

4182
01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:23.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4183
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:24.183
<v Speaker 5>It just doesn't,</v>

4184
01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:24.920
<v Speaker 5>it's not funny.</v>

4185
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.150
<v Speaker 5>You can find it in there though.</v>

4186
01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:26.960
<v Speaker 5>The spontaneity.</v>

4187
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.760
<v Speaker 5>Even though you have a structure you get to play with.</v>

4188
01:46:28.761 --> 01:46:29.270
<v Speaker 5>The one thing,</v>

4189
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:31.370
<v Speaker 5>the one thing that I've learned for me anyways,</v>

4190
01:46:31.371 --> 01:46:32.330
<v Speaker 5>like I watch,</v>

4191
01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:37.040
<v Speaker 5>I still watch Chapelle over and over and just like you know it for me,</v>

4192
01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:41.840
<v Speaker 5>like the latest Chappelle when he tells a story and he's telling you like a 10</v>

4193
01:46:41.841 --> 01:46:43.460
<v Speaker 5>minute story of how shit went down.</v>

4194
01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:44.840
<v Speaker 5>To me that's the funniest.</v>

4195
01:46:44.841 --> 01:46:48.020
<v Speaker 5>She had an actual real event like the mafia story,</v>

4196
01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:49.780
<v Speaker 5>the Russian mafia story with Bert Kreischer,</v>

4197
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4198
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.720
<v Speaker 2>It's an actual story,</v>

4199
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4200
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Then you see how real it is when he's describing it.</v>

4201
01:46:54.571 --> 01:46:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Instead of trying to make up a joke and trying to find funny,</v>

4202
01:46:57.690 --> 01:47:00.780
<v Speaker 2>stick to funny stories and then that'll,</v>

4203
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.520
<v Speaker 2>and then from there you could kind of,</v>

4204
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you don't know,</v>

4205
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:06.690
<v Speaker 2>you know Joe shooting mine on Monday night in Vegas and the shooting six of</v>

4206
01:47:06.691 --> 01:47:07.160
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

4207
01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:07.950
<v Speaker 2>not just six.</v>

4208
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:09.300
<v Speaker 2>So there's six comics,</v>

4209
01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Speaker 2>30 minute specials,</v>

4210
01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:12.180
<v Speaker 2>but big j auctions in that.</v>

4211
01:47:12.181 --> 01:47:13.014
<v Speaker 2>Who's hilarious?</v>

4212
01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Christina P.</v>

4213
01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Thompson Barrows wives is in that.</v>

4214
01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:19.190
<v Speaker 2>She's doing that because she just didn't know Sherry has this.</v>

4215
01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why just below one they'll fuck up.</v>

4216
01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:22.411
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

4217
01:47:22.411 --> 01:47:25.620
<v Speaker 2>but why not just shave and do an hour trying to extra bloat that bank,</v>

4218
01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:27.420
<v Speaker 2>I love her at that extra blow up.</v>

4219
01:47:28.230 --> 01:47:28.831
<v Speaker 2>But with Joe.</v>

4220
01:47:28.831 --> 01:47:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4221
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Joey's,</v>

4222
01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:30.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4223
01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:32.190
<v Speaker 2>And then they shoot to 30 minutes for him.</v>

4224
01:47:32.191 --> 01:47:34.170
<v Speaker 2>He shoots on Monday night in Vegas,</v>

4225
01:47:34.171 --> 01:47:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Sun Room in Vegas.</v>

4226
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:36.540
<v Speaker 2>But when you do those 30 minutes,</v>

4227
01:47:36.690 --> 01:47:37.021
<v Speaker 2>cause I,</v>

4228
01:47:37.021 --> 01:47:37.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:47:37.321 --> 01:47:38.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to dealing with you and I'm like,</v>

4230
01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:38.911

4233
01:47:39.961 --> 01:47:40.860
<v Speaker 2>This is what's happening.</v>

4234
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:41.520
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

4235
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:41.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4236
01:47:41.731 --> 01:47:43.110
<v Speaker 2>you have say in marketing with that,</v>

4238
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:46.021
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be,</v>

4239
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:48.900
<v Speaker 2>this is where the time different animal,</v>

4240
01:47:49.770 --> 01:47:51.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a different animal for sure.</v>

4241
01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Brendan selling out COBB's in San Francisco by himself.</v>

4242
01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

4243
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:57.590
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking huge man.</v>

4244
01:47:57.591 --> 01:47:59.280
<v Speaker 2>So that consumer in Boston,</v>

4245
01:47:59.340 --> 01:47:59.760
<v Speaker 2>the what?</v>

4246
01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.150
<v Speaker 2>The Wilbur Theater and house and it's 1100 somethings.</v>

4247
01:48:02.690 --> 01:48:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

4248
01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.231
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

4249
01:48:04.231 --> 01:48:04.950
<v Speaker 2>I told him that he's,</v>

4250
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:09.420
<v Speaker 2>he's probably one of the fastest rising comics coming from never doing standup.</v>

4251
01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean who else is there really ever,</v>

4252
01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:13.320
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

4253
01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Right low ever.</v>

4254
01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

4255
01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:17.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm telling stand up to selling out theaters in two years.</v>

4256
01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Did you know this crazy?</v>

4257
01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:19.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4258
01:48:19.111 --> 01:48:19.800
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

4259
01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.490
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

4260
01:48:20.490 --> 01:48:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Doing like fucking an hour and killing like you,</v>

4261
01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:25.530
<v Speaker 2>you put in the work,</v>

4262
01:48:25.531 --> 01:48:25.741
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

4263
01:48:25.741 --> 01:48:27.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what I tell other young comics.</v>

4264
01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I say pay attention to him because this is what happens when a person takes pro</v>

4265
01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:36.810
<v Speaker 2>athlete type of discipline and applies it to stand.</v>

4266
01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:40.320
<v Speaker 2>That discipline is everything that work ethic and discipline,</v>

4267
01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.580
<v Speaker 2>that's everything mad.</v>

4268
01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 2>It changes the whole game because a lot of comics are funny,</v>

4269
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:45.360
<v Speaker 2>but they're fucking lazy.</v>

4270
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:47.620
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking lazy and they don't they,</v>

4271
01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.920
<v Speaker 2>that's why I like you.</v>

4272
01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:52.950
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with guys who do the same material year after year after year and</v>

4273
01:48:52.951 --> 01:48:53.880
<v Speaker 2>they never do specials.</v>

4274
01:48:53.881 --> 01:48:57.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of those guys that are really talented guys and they just never,</v>

4275
01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:00.300
<v Speaker 2>they never bothered to record anything cause they don't want to have to,</v>

4276
01:49:00.301 --> 01:49:00.720
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4277
01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:01.680
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to rewrite.</v>

4278
01:49:01.710 --> 01:49:03.040
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense to me like it.</v>

4279
01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:04.710
<v Speaker 2>We talk about work ethic and stuff like that.</v>

4280
01:49:04.711 --> 01:49:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I see these other comedians who maybe aren't doing it,</v>

4281
01:49:06.811 --> 01:49:07.644
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

4282
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:12.640
<v Speaker 2>don't you see the guys like Rogan and burn deleah like you want to be on there?</v>

4283
01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:14.100
<v Speaker 2>You want to do what they do,</v>

4284
01:49:14.101 --> 01:49:14.934
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4285
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:16.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4286
01:49:16.291 --> 01:49:17.220
<v Speaker 2>he's got a guillotine.</v>

4287
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Nasty.</v>

4288
01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:22.170
<v Speaker 2>It's the same with fighting.</v>

4289
01:49:22.171 --> 01:49:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Just like you look at GSP,</v>

4290
01:49:23.311 --> 01:49:24.570
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's doing this and this.</v>

4291
01:49:24.571 --> 01:49:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Don't you want to be like that?</v>

4292
01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:27.720
<v Speaker 2>She'll probably follow that plant.</v>

4293
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:28.810
<v Speaker 2>But people got scared.</v>

4294
01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:30.001
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

4295
01:49:30.001 --> 01:49:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you get scared and then he finally get some tools,</v>

4296
01:49:32.401 --> 01:49:32.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4297
01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you have an act like you put together an act and you're,</v>

4298
01:49:35.401 --> 01:49:36.091
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4299
01:49:36.091 --> 01:49:38.070
<v Speaker 2>before we ready to film a special,</v>

4300
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:40.080
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that your act is killing,</v>

4301
01:49:40.081 --> 01:49:40.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4302
01:49:40.351 --> 01:49:41.310
<v Speaker 2>So if your act as killing,</v>

4303
01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you've got molden at home.</v>

4304
01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:44.370
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to let that go.</v>

4305
01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I got to let it go.</v>

4306
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4307
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:46.320
<v Speaker 2>let's look at this.</v>

4308
01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>

4309
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Decide,</v>

4310
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:47.830
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

4311
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I gotta</v>

4312
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.903
<v Speaker 1>take it aside.</v>

4313
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:50.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't do that,</v>

4314
01:49:50.171 --> 01:49:51.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't keep getting better.</v>

4315
01:49:51.311 --> 01:49:52.144
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

4316
01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.590
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I've learned,</v>

4317
01:49:53.591 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 1>even though there was a lot of fear and letting go of that old material,</v>

4318
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:57.970
<v Speaker 1>you always write new,</v>

4319
01:49:58.030 --> 01:50:00.640
<v Speaker 1>better material because you're a better comedian now.</v>

4320
01:50:00.641 --> 01:50:02.050
<v Speaker 1>You understand comedy better.</v>

4321
01:50:02.650 --> 01:50:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4322
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:03.761
<v Speaker 1>You just going to do better.</v>

4323
01:50:03.761 --> 01:50:04.541
<v Speaker 1>Like for me,</v>

4324
01:50:04.541 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 1>like letting go that like Bruce Jenner bit God,</v>

4325
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:08.050
<v Speaker 1>it was so hard to let go.</v>

4326
01:50:08.051 --> 01:50:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to let that one go because of the special.</v>

4327
01:50:10.590 --> 01:50:11.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4328
01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:12.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4329
01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't,</v>

4330
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that if my life depended on it right now.</v>

4331
01:50:14.891 --> 01:50:15.641
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it works.</v>

4332
01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the beats and I wouldn't do it right.</v>

4333
01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.880
<v Speaker 1>But when you get to a point when you get a bit so tight and so finally tuned,</v>

4334
01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:27.940
<v Speaker 1>that's when you got to let it go and then you move onto the next one.</v>

4335
01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And I've got some shit now that that's killing harder than that bit did.</v>

4336
01:50:31.690 --> 01:50:33.640
<v Speaker 1>But when I first started doing,</v>

4337
01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4338
01:50:34.091 --> 01:50:34.960
<v Speaker 1>a year ago,</v>

4339
01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:39.961
<v Speaker 1>year plus ago when I first released that Netflix special and then I went right</v>

4340
01:50:40.001 --> 01:50:43.600
<v Speaker 1>into write new material and doing new material is on shaky legs mat.</v>

4341
01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:46.150
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people don't like that shaky legs feeling.</v>

4342
01:50:46.151 --> 01:50:47.050
<v Speaker 1>You get real scared,</v>

4343
01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:49.030
<v Speaker 1>but you got to go through that.</v>

4344
01:50:49.031 --> 01:50:49.751
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go through that.</v>

4345
01:50:49.751 --> 01:50:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes you grow and continue to get better.</v>

4346
01:50:52.630 --> 01:50:52.961
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4347
01:50:52.961 --> 01:50:57.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that helps me a lot that a Jeremiah Watkins show that stand up</v>

4348
01:50:57.911 --> 01:50:58.744
<v Speaker 1>on the spot,</v>

4349
01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:02.560
<v Speaker 1>dude that is a fucking farm for material.</v>

4350
01:51:02.561 --> 01:51:05.580
<v Speaker 1>So much fun because people yell like someone look at you and go</v>

4351
01:51:05.730 --> 01:51:07.930
<v Speaker 2>of of hurricanes and you're like,</v>

4352
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:09.130
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:09.880
<v Speaker 2>hurricanes.</v>

4354
01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.030
<v Speaker 2>And then you start talking chin.</v>

4355
01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then they'll say something.</v>

4356
01:51:12.641 --> 01:51:13.474
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

4357
01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:14.560
<v Speaker 2>and the crowd,</v>

4358
01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:15.700
<v Speaker 2>the crowd knows like,</v>

4359
01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:16.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4363
01:51:18.651 --> 01:51:22.110
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's pretty loosey Goosey and they'll yell like strippers.</v>

4364

4367
01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:29.680
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing resource to have those shows where someone just yelled,</v>

4368
01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:31.240
<v Speaker 2>he used to call it Thunderpussy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's better though.</v>

4465
01:53:28.911 --> 01:53:33.370
<v Speaker 5>The stand up on the spot thing is better because it's not that it's not past</v>

4466
01:53:33.371 --> 01:53:34.130
<v Speaker 5>bits,</v>

4468
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:37.450

<v Speaker 5>no material.</v>

4471
01:53:39.011 --> 01:53:43.220
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be why people have done it and done their act two and Pete,</v>

4472
01:53:43.221 --> 01:53:44.300

01:53:59.390 --> 01:54:00.223
<v Speaker 5>Heckler</v>

4486
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.430
<v Speaker 5>fucking went nuclear on the guy.</v>

4487
01:54:03.431 --> 01:54:04.210
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4488
01:54:04.210 --> 01:54:09.000
<v Speaker 5>it's typically isn't how my favorite questions go and fucking get a scarf on.</v>

4489
01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:13.920
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

4490
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:15.980
<v Speaker 5>well that's it for big questions.</v>

4491
01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:16.751
<v Speaker 5>Where'd it go?</v>

4492
01:54:16.751 --> 01:54:17.584
<v Speaker 5>Fuck face.</v>

4493
01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:18.170
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4494
01:54:18.170 --> 01:54:18.830
<v Speaker 5>he was just,</v>

4495
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:20.870
<v Speaker 5>just trying so hard to get attention.</v>

4496
01:54:22.130 --> 01:54:24.110
<v Speaker 5>I've witnessed many,</v>

4497
01:54:24.111 --> 01:54:27.110
<v Speaker 5>many people getting torched by Joe once.</v>

4498
01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:27.610
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4499
01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:28.190
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4500
01:54:28.190 --> 01:54:29.023
<v Speaker 5>it's awesome.</v>

4501
01:54:29.690 --> 01:54:31.340
<v Speaker 5>It's awesome watching Joe because Joe,</v>

4502
01:54:31.730 --> 01:54:34.700
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't want to release until the guide.</v>

4503
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:37.370
<v Speaker 5>It's clear 100% and he deserves it.</v>

4504
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:38.780
<v Speaker 5>So a guy will yell and he's like,</v>

4505
01:54:38.781 --> 01:54:40.010
<v Speaker 5>calm down everything and he's like,</v>

4506
01:54:40.190 --> 01:54:41.830
<v Speaker 5>and like inside like keep going.</v>

4507
01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:42.693
<v Speaker 5>So I could just,</v>

4508
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:43.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4509
01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:44.720
<v Speaker 5>I just want to feel guilty.</v>

4510
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:46.430
<v Speaker 5>So when Joe Decides to go off,</v>

4511
01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:47.660
<v Speaker 5>it's over son.</v>

4512
01:54:47.661 --> 01:54:49.720
<v Speaker 5>There's no way I don't with the mic.</v>

4513
01:54:49.730 --> 01:54:50.361
<v Speaker 5>Forget it Joe.</v>

4514
01:54:50.361 --> 01:54:50.961
<v Speaker 5>Without a Mike,</v>

4515
01:54:50.961 --> 01:54:51.840
<v Speaker 5>you're still fucked dude.</v>

4516
01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:57.530
<v Speaker 5>I saw dank to go hard on these two girls in the front row when,</v>

4517
01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.640
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4518
01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.010
<v Speaker 5>when I was at the comm store last Tuesday night.</v>

4519
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:02.301
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

4520
01:55:02.301 --> 01:55:03.290
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't quit talking.</v>

4521
01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:03.621
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

4522
01:55:03.621 --> 01:55:04.160
<v Speaker 5>honey,</v>

4523
01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:05.240
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to get through a story.</v>

4524
01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:06.650
<v Speaker 5>And he was a longer story.</v>

4525
01:55:06.651 --> 01:55:07.760
<v Speaker 5>You could tell he's doing new material.</v>

4526
01:55:07.761 --> 01:55:08.594
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to get through it.</v>

4527
01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:09.680
<v Speaker 5>They kept interrupting.</v>

4528
01:55:09.681 --> 01:55:10.514
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

4529
01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.160
<v Speaker 5>I can go in on you if you want.</v>

4530
01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:12.950
<v Speaker 5>Say another thing.</v>

4531
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:13.783
<v Speaker 5>And she's goes,</v>

4532
01:55:14.250 --> 01:55:15.051
<v Speaker 5>another thing goes,</v>

4533
01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:15.771
<v Speaker 5>do you want to do this?</v>

4534
01:55:15.771 --> 01:55:17.650
<v Speaker 5>And then just fucking cuckoo.</v>

4535
01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:18.040
<v Speaker 5>Cuckoo,</v>

4536
01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:18.410
<v Speaker 5>cuckoo.</v>

4537
01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:19.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was just brutal,</v>

4538
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:20.510
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4539
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:21.560
<v Speaker 5>It makes a show though,</v>

4540
01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.060
<v Speaker 5>cause he did about 20 minutes of it.</v>

4541
01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:26.470
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of fucking heckling in at the comedy store lately.</v>

4542
01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.490
<v Speaker 5>What do people want to become a part of the show?</v>

4543
01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:29.480
<v Speaker 5>That's a terrible idea.</v>

4544
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:32.990
<v Speaker 5>There should be a warning warning.</v>

4545
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:37.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh there's two girls in the front row the other night just drunk and sloppy and</v>

4546
01:55:37.671 --> 01:55:39.700
<v Speaker 5>talking really loud.</v>

4547
01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:42.380
<v Speaker 5>You know like you're onstage and you hear them.</v>

4548
01:55:42.381 --> 01:55:43.260
<v Speaker 5>He tried to ignore them,</v>

4549
01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 5>but then you see the</v>

4550
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.600
<v Speaker 1>rest of the crowd going like this.</v>

4551
01:55:45.601 --> 01:55:46.860
<v Speaker 1>That's when you have to acknowledge it.</v>

4552
01:55:46.861 --> 01:55:49.020
<v Speaker 1>You have to see people turning towards him.</v>

4553
01:55:49.021 --> 01:55:49.261
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

4554
01:55:49.261 --> 01:55:49.800
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4555
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I got to play cop here most of the time.</v>

4556
01:55:51.451 --> 01:55:53.220
<v Speaker 1>The stores on top of that big time,</v>

4557
01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:55.770
<v Speaker 1>which is a new thing in the old days.</v>

4558
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:56.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4559
01:55:56.221 --> 01:55:59.480
<v Speaker 1>The way I got good at heckling at hecklers,</v>

4560
01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:02.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the big ways is that there was no crowd control at the store.</v>

4561
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean Zero Mad Max because in the old days when I used to go there,</v>

4562
01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:10.760
<v Speaker 1>the fucking comedians were all doormen and,</v>

4563
01:56:10.761 --> 01:56:11.311
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4564
01:56:11.311 --> 01:56:12.150
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>

4565
01:56:12.151 --> 01:56:13.680
<v Speaker 1>everything that was all comedians.</v>

4566
01:56:13.710 --> 01:56:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not that anymore.</v>

4567
01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Now they have like legit security,</v>

4568
01:56:16.741 --> 01:56:17.700
<v Speaker 1>like big guys.</v>

4569
01:56:17.850 --> 01:56:20.670
<v Speaker 1>They take care of everything people have earpieces on.</v>

4570
01:56:20.671 --> 01:56:21.690
<v Speaker 1>They're in control of everything.</v>

4571
01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:26.900
<v Speaker 1>When the store picked up the business like about three years ago,</v>

4572
01:56:27.331 --> 01:56:28.980
<v Speaker 1>when it really took off three,</v>

4573
01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:29.814
<v Speaker 1>four years ago,</v>

4574
01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:31.050
<v Speaker 1>that's when they'd go,</v>

4575
01:56:31.051 --> 01:56:31.621
<v Speaker 1>okay look,</v>

4576
01:56:31.621 --> 01:56:33.510
<v Speaker 1>this place is sold out every fucking night.</v>

4577
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And then a guy got murdered there.</v>

4578
01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:36.840
<v Speaker 1>There was a murder on the front porch.</v>

4579
01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:37.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4580
01:56:37.381 --> 01:56:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Guy got shot to death on the front porch.</v>

4581
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:40.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4582
01:56:40.411 --> 01:56:42.120
<v Speaker 1>It was some gang related type thing.</v>

4583
01:56:42.650 --> 01:56:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Some guy did something to somebody and apparently that dude who got killed,</v>

4584
01:56:46.861 --> 01:56:51.240
<v Speaker 1>he had some really dark shit on his Facebook to like pictures of people tied up</v>

4585
01:56:51.241 --> 01:56:52.074
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

4586
01:56:52.110 --> 01:56:52.620
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4587
01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:53.341
<v Speaker 1>they murdered him.</v>

4588
01:56:53.341 --> 01:56:54.810
<v Speaker 1>He shot him right in the front porch.</v>

4589
01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And from then on they put like a super intense security system there and cameras</v>

4590
01:56:58.921 --> 01:56:59.670
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

4591
01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Hired real security everywhere and ramped up the place.</v>

4592
01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Stop letting people walk into the parking lot.</v>

4593
01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:09.750
<v Speaker 1>That was a big one too because people would just stroll into the parking lot and</v>

4594
01:57:09.751 --> 01:57:12.780
<v Speaker 1>these drunk people would be backing up their cars and people would be getting</v>

4595
01:57:12.781 --> 01:57:14.070
<v Speaker 1>hit by people's cars.</v>

4596
01:57:14.071 --> 01:57:14.760
<v Speaker 1>A shit show.</v>

4597
01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:15.100
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

4598
01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:15.341
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

4599
01:57:15.341 --> 01:57:15.531
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

4600
01:57:15.531 --> 01:57:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you think's going to happen to the comedy store now that Mitsis passed away?</v>

4601
01:57:18.781 --> 01:57:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that DePaul is that the business is better than ever?</v>

4602
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:26.190
<v Speaker 1>The thing about it is it's sold out every night and it's making a lot of money.</v>

4603
01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to the comedy store on a Tuesday night,</v>

4604
01:57:28.801 --> 01:57:30.450
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a sold out main room.</v>

02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:48.400
<v Speaker 2>just put it up myself.</v>

4750
02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:48.851
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

4751
02:00:48.851 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 2>it's what age are you living in?</v>

4752
02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:52.510
<v Speaker 2>And then when confronted,</v>

4753
02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:52.751
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

4754
02:00:52.751 --> 02:00:52.931
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4755
02:00:52.931 --> 02:00:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Tiffany hydros was making so much money now and it's all because of this.</v>

4756
02:00:55.810 --> 02:00:56.643
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

4757
02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:57.940
<v Speaker 2>that's delusional.</v>

4758
02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he did.</v>

4759
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:01.330
<v Speaker 2>The guy who owns it,</v>

4760
02:01:01.331 --> 02:01:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he did like letting those kids do that and put those things up.</v>

4761
02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>But people that had no idea about the standup comedy business,</v>

4762
02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I didn't basically interns just filming people's sets and putting all their</v>

4763
02:01:12.791 --> 02:01:13.720
<v Speaker 2>material online.</v>

4764
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:14.950
<v Speaker 2>But the way it works is,</v>

4765
02:01:14.951 --> 02:01:15.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4766
02:01:15.161 --> 02:01:16.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a close community.</v>

4767
02:01:16.151 --> 02:01:19.150
<v Speaker 2>So if Joe or whoever San te Santana goes,</v>

4768
02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:20.160
<v Speaker 2>hey they're filming,</v>

4769
02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:21.310
<v Speaker 2>don't do it there anymore.</v>

4770
02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:22.260
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

4771
02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:23.093
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just don't,</v>

4772
02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.870
<v Speaker 2>everyone has those towns,</v>

4773
02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.400
<v Speaker 2>they go there.</v>

4774
02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.340
<v Speaker 2>They mean you'll,</v>

4775
02:01:26.341 --> 02:01:28.150
<v Speaker 2>you'll have three sold out shows,</v>

4776
02:01:28.450 --> 02:01:31.330
<v Speaker 2>not even a half a mile away at the comedy store.</v>

4777
02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>And then these they're canceling show cause there was no one there,</v>

4778
02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:35.651
<v Speaker 2>but that's a lot.</v>

4779
02:01:35.651 --> 02:01:36.360
<v Speaker 2>But then the Improv,</v>

4780
02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.590
<v Speaker 2>the improv still doing the Improv is doing better.</v>

4781
02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4782
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4783
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:40.183
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

4784
02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>the Improv moved that stupid fucking piano off the stage.</v>

4785
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>They put a platform on the side and push the pan over to the piano would fuck up</v>

4786
02:01:48.651 --> 02:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>the whole show for anybody that was on the right side of the stage.</v>

4787
02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>They can't see the in the ice house still bumping.</v>

02:01:58.300 --> 02:01:58.790

4857
02:03:49.650 --> 02:03:49.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4858
02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:50.753
<v Speaker 1>Fun Times.</v>

4859
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's baked.</v>

4860
02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just fun.</v>

4861
02:03:53.890 --> 02:03:55.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just like high school with your good friends.</v>

4862
02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Like when you walk into like first period and all your boys,</v>

4863
02:03:58.881 --> 02:03:59.900
<v Speaker 1>like we hit the front.</v>

4864
02:03:59.901 --> 02:04:01.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what it feels like.</v>

4865
02:04:01.130 --> 02:04:01.851
<v Speaker 1>What a lot of ways,</v>

4866
02:04:01.851 --> 02:04:02.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4867
02:04:02.031 --> 02:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that happens as you get older,</v>

4868
02:04:04.191 --> 02:04:06.170
<v Speaker 1>as you lose all the fun cause you have,</v>

4869
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you have responsibilities,</v>

4870
02:04:07.590 --> 02:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>you have a job you hate and you gotta get up in the morning and you're always</v>

4871
02:04:10.251 --> 02:04:11.060
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>

4872
02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:11.790
<v Speaker 1>And this is the,</v>

4873
02:04:11.790 --> 02:04:13.610
<v Speaker 1>the world that most people live in.</v>

4874
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.740
<v Speaker 1>When you could find a place where it's all basically people that avoided that</v>

4875
02:04:18.741 --> 02:04:21.980
<v Speaker 1>rat race and figured out some sneaky way through the system.</v>

4876
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:24.560
<v Speaker 1>And that sneaky way is talking shit</v>

4877
02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>to no,</v>

4878
02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:28.490
<v Speaker 1>no sound check needed.</v>

4879
02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:28.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4880
02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:31.520
<v Speaker 1>you just get on stage and it's uh,</v>

4881
02:04:32.050 --> 02:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4882
02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:34.580
<v Speaker 1>especially when high level comedians go up,</v>

4883
02:04:34.581 --> 02:04:35.151
<v Speaker 1>like yourself,</v>

4884
02:04:35.151 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to get an hour of just</v>

4885
02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>laughs just over and over again.</v>

4886
02:04:40.741 --> 02:04:42.180
<v Speaker 2>It's way better than a funny movie.</v>

4887
02:04:42.210 --> 02:04:42.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4888
02:04:42.391 --> 02:04:42.740
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

4889
02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:43.920

4892
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I ain't go listen to a deal vanti about something.</v>

4896
02:04:58.920 --> 02:04:59.311
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

4897
02:04:59.311 --> 02:05:00.660
<v Speaker 2>as long as I've been doing comedy,</v>

4898
02:05:00.661 --> 02:05:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I still love it.</v>

4899
02:05:01.590 --> 02:05:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I still love watching it.</v>

4900
02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:03.780
<v Speaker 2>I still love watching it.</v>

4901
02:05:03.781 --> 02:05:04.530
<v Speaker 2>If someone's Kellen,</v>

4902
02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I still love it,</v>

02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

4905
02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:07.471
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

4906
02:05:07.471 --> 02:05:08.304
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

4907
02:05:08.630 --> 02:05:12.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a great form of entertainment and I think it's necessary to,</v>

4908
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>because people get so serious about certain subjects.</v>

4909
02:05:14.821 --> 02:05:18.300
<v Speaker 2>If someone could just come along and mock it and laugh at it so hard,</v>

4910
02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:19.650
<v Speaker 2>and then you realize like,</v>

4911
02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:19.891
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4912
02:05:19.891 --> 02:05:21.270
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking ridiculous.</v>

4913
02:05:21.450 --> 02:05:22.440
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

4914
02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:23.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4915
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Alleviates pressure.</v>

4916
02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:29.600
<v Speaker 2>What was fascinating to me the other night with Tom Papa a Oswald and Tony</v>

4917
02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:30.181
<v Speaker 2>Hinchcliffe,</v>

4918
02:05:30.181 --> 02:05:33.480
<v Speaker 2>they all had the same premises on their joke,</v>

4919
02:05:33.481 --> 02:05:34.740
<v Speaker 2>but everything was,</v>

4920
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:37.470
<v Speaker 2>each opinion was so different.</v>

4921
02:05:37.471 --> 02:05:38.670
<v Speaker 2>I was laughing so hard,</v>

4922
02:05:38.671 --> 02:05:39.180
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4923
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:40.440
<v Speaker 2>But you just see how everyone is different,</v>

4924
02:05:40.441 --> 02:05:42.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's the popular subject.</v>

4925
02:05:42.431 --> 02:05:43.410
<v Speaker 2>So like Trump,</v>

4926
02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:45.660
<v Speaker 2>no sexual assault.</v>

4927

<v Speaker 2>Neil Magni.</v>

4934
02:05:54.861 --> 02:05:56.040
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to take down,</v>

4935
02:05:56.041 --> 02:05:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hector Lombard,</v>

02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Kelvin Gasland,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Johny Hendricks and Johnny Hendricks.</v>

4959

<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

4960
02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:39.423
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty tough.</v>

4961
02:06:40.150 --> 02:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>But then whenever he finds,</v>

4962
02:06:41.890 --> 02:06:42.723
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

4963

<v Speaker 2>the Jitsu guys screwed.</v>

4965
02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:46.390
<v Speaker 2>It's his Achilles heel because they take him down.</v>

4966
02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Merch umum his Jujitsu is not that good.</v>

4967
02:06:48.970 --> 02:06:50.050
<v Speaker 2>His defense has just,</v>

4968
02:06:50.051 --> 02:06:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4969

5002
02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:44.620
<v Speaker 7>Like you look at one of his arms like is tricep was nonexistent.</v>

02:19:44.301 --> 02:19:46.350
<v Speaker 2>well right now.</v>

5445
02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:48.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5446
02:19:48.081 --> 02:19:50.840
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of amazing that he's even top 10 with one win over.</v>

5447
02:19:50.841 --> 02:19:53.780
<v Speaker 2>A big guy in Donald Cerrone is really 155 pounder.</v>

5448
02:19:53.810 --> 02:19:53.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5449
02:19:53.961 --> 02:19:54.350
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

5450
02:19:54.350 --> 02:19:54.521
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5451
02:19:54.521 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 2>it's insane that I'm picking them to win the fight,</v>

5452
02:19:57.410 --> 02:19:59.930
<v Speaker 2>but I am not a fan of how they do the ratings,</v>

5453
02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:00.530
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

5454
02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a Fox thing?</v>

5455
02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:04.520
<v Speaker 2>So is he as being in a stick with it?</v>

5456
02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:05.241
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5457
02:20:05.241 --> 02:20:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Is it foxes decide decision that was,</v>

5458
02:20:07.611 --> 02:20:09.050
<v Speaker 2>that was one of Fox deals.</v>

5459
02:20:09.051 --> 02:20:11.720
<v Speaker 2>They want rankings because they didn't think the public could understand.</v>

5460
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:12.201
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5461
02:20:12.201 --> 02:20:17.201
<v Speaker 2>who was who without the rankings to arbitrary in to the two disagreed upon by</v>

5462
02:20:18.030 --> 02:20:18.920
<v Speaker 2>high level people,</v>

5463
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:19.760
<v Speaker 2>it will not,</v>

5464
02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:20.571
<v Speaker 2>no matter how you do it,</v>

5465
02:20:20.571 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 2>you can never get it right.</v>

5466
02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:23.240
<v Speaker 2>So you might as well just try it and just let it,</v>

5614
02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:31.333
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

5615
02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm a wing man.</v>

5616
02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:33.991
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5617
02:23:33.991 --> 02:23:34.824
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

5618
02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:37.210
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

5619
02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:37.510
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

5620
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:39.430
<v Speaker 2>we know as a martial arts to ruin us.</v>

5621
02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Like the sidekick.</v>

5622
02:23:40.650 --> 02:23:41.870
<v Speaker 2>No girl wants to fuck the side.</v>

5623
02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:43.860
<v Speaker 2>That's like Robbins.</v>

5624
02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:47.660
<v Speaker 2>If you know the real meaning to the dentist at sound.</v>

5625
02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:48.673
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5626
02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:51.480
<v Speaker 2>The dentist also zinc in his dick sucked in the bar.</v>

5627
02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:53.550
<v Speaker 2>She's a dentist is such an obscure a nickname.</v>

5628
02:23:53.551 --> 02:23:55.910
<v Speaker 2>I think he got to leave Josh neer alone.</v>

5629
02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.000
<v Speaker 2>That's his nickname.</v>

5630
02:23:57.090 --> 02:23:58.770
<v Speaker 2>That's so obscure one,</v>

5631
02:23:59.040 --> 02:23:59.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5632
02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:04.200
<v Speaker 2>but then they call Eve Edwards a dentist at one point in time because eve</v>

5633
02:24:04.201 --> 02:24:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Edwards because of Erin's iron,</v>

5634
02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:06.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5635
02:24:06.060 --> 02:24:06.691
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5636
02:24:06.691 --> 02:24:07.524
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

5637
02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:08.730
<v Speaker 2>He destroyed it.</v>

5638
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Broke his whole best.</v>

5639
02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5640
02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm sure,</v>

5641
02:24:12.090 --> 02:24:13.740
<v Speaker 2>and Riley was one of those tough,</v>

5642
02:24:13.741 --> 02:24:15.010
<v Speaker 2>tough journeyman.</v>

5643
02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5644
02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:16.170
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5645
02:24:16.170 --> 02:24:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

5646
02:24:16.530 --> 02:24:16.941
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't,</v>

5647
02:24:16.941 --> 02:24:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Robby Lauer made his UFC debut against Aaron Riley and just beat the brakes off</v>

5648
02:24:20.641 --> 02:24:21.474
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

5649
02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:25.440
<v Speaker 2>That's another super impressive performance by half old dos Anjos right to</v>

5650
02:24:25.441 --> 02:24:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Robbie Lawler fight like holy shit.</v>

5651
02:24:28.490 --> 02:24:29.323
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

5652
02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:31.830
<v Speaker 2>was an amazing fighter.</v>

5653
02:24:31.890 --> 02:24:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

5654
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:36.150
<v Speaker 2>He's like one of the best examples of a guy was holding themselves back by</v>

5655
02:24:36.151 --> 02:24:37.650
<v Speaker 2>staying in a lower weight class.</v>

5656
02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:40.020
<v Speaker 2>He did get the belt though.</v>

5657
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:40.801
<v Speaker 2>Yes he did,</v>

5658
02:24:40.801 --> 02:24:41.970
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't take it anymore.</v>

5659
02:24:41.971 --> 02:24:43.200
<v Speaker 2>His body couldn't take it anymore.</v>

5660
02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:44.400
<v Speaker 2>He was so big.</v>

5661
02:24:44.670 --> 02:24:48.990
<v Speaker 2>I ran into him in between fights when he was fighting 55 and he was 200 pounds.</v>

5662
02:24:49.350 --> 02:24:50.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much.</v>

5663
02:24:50.221 --> 02:24:51.840
<v Speaker 2>When they start to decline a little bit.</v>

5664
02:24:51.850 --> 02:24:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Cause the weight cut was fucking with him.</v>

5665
02:24:53.101 --> 02:24:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Then he went to 70 now he's at night,</v>

5666
02:24:54.591 --> 02:24:55.424
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5667
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

5668
02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy.</v>

5669
02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:58.530
<v Speaker 2>How tall is Dosantos?</v>

5670
02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:00.180
<v Speaker 2>He's short for us.</v>

5671
02:25:00.210 --> 02:25:00.990
<v Speaker 2>One 70 year,</v>

5672
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5673
02:25:01.290 --> 02:25:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I think he's five nine shorter.</v>

5676
02:25:06.510 --> 02:25:06.751

<v Speaker 5>How was the back feeling?</v>

5703
02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:56.580
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

5704
02:25:56.580 --> 02:25:59.290
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to tell because I haven't been able to train because of my knee and my</v>

5705
02:25:59.291 --> 02:25:59.771
<v Speaker 5>shoulder.</v>

5706
02:25:59.771 --> 02:26:02.230
<v Speaker 5>So when I get back into my knee's feeling better,</v>

5707
02:26:02.231 --> 02:26:04.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm on the bike 30 minutes a day.</v>

5708
02:26:04.541 --> 02:26:05.320
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

5709
02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:05.970
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5710
02:26:05.970 --> 02:26:06.910
<v Speaker 5>so I decided,</v>

5711
02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:07.773
<v Speaker 5>I decided,</v>

5712
02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:10.740
<v Speaker 5>I decided to hold off on the shoulder surgery and decided,</v>

5713
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:11.070
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5714
02:26:11.070 --> 02:26:12.040
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to do to you.</v>

5715
02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:13.630
<v Speaker 5>What can I do?</v>

5716
02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:14.920
<v Speaker 5>I've got to shit you got wrong in there.</v>

5717
02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:16.620
<v Speaker 5>The Labor,</v>

5718
02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:17.453
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5719
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:19.920
<v Speaker 5>rotator cuff and,</v>

5720
02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:20.651
<v Speaker 5>but they're saying,</v>

5721
02:26:20.651 --> 02:26:21.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5722
02:26:21.010 --> 02:26:21.581
<v Speaker 5>I finally,</v>

5723
02:26:21.581 --> 02:26:24.320
<v Speaker 5>I got a second opinion yesterday and um,</v>

5724
02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:25.390
<v Speaker 5>they told me,</v>

5725
02:26:25.390 --> 02:26:25.750
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

5726
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:28.180
<v Speaker 5>unless it's hurting really bad,</v>

5727
02:26:28.810 --> 02:26:31.810
<v Speaker 5>just hold off on it and it hold off on it.</v>

5728
02:26:31.811 --> 02:26:32.644
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

5729
02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:35.381
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

5730
02:26:35.381 --> 02:26:36.214
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5731
02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:38.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to go into surgery again,</v>

5732
02:26:38.981 --> 02:26:39.131
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

5733
02:26:39.131 --> 02:26:40.210
<v Speaker 5>Just again,</v>

5734
02:26:40.270 --> 02:26:43.260
<v Speaker 5>I just had knee surgery and then shoulder surgery surgery.</v>

5735
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:44.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to rehab it with,</v>

5736
02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:46.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to try to rehab it with,</v>

5737
02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:46.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5738
02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:46.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5739
02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:48.670
<v Speaker 5>like shoulder rehab exercises.</v>

5740
02:26:48.671 --> 02:26:50.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go that route first.</v>

5741
02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:52.720
<v Speaker 5>And if that doesn't work then I'll have surgery.</v>

5742
02:26:52.721 --> 02:26:55.990
<v Speaker 5>But I decided I'm not going to have surgery on my shoulder.</v>

5743
02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:58.180
<v Speaker 5>They're doing some crazy shit down in Panama.</v>

5744
02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:01.010
<v Speaker 5>Panama is $25,000 expensive.</v>

5745
02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:03.940
<v Speaker 5>And you know when Mel Gibson was on your podcast,</v>

5746
02:27:06.010 --> 02:27:06.843
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

5747
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:07.833
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man,</v>

5748
02:27:08.410 --> 02:27:10.060
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to it.</v>

5749
02:27:10.300 --> 02:27:12.250
<v Speaker 5>Is there a possibility that he was like,</v>

5750
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.941
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5751
02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:16.330
<v Speaker 5>he has some financial interest in the company or something?</v>

5752
02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:16.781
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5753
02:27:16.781 --> 02:27:17.441
<v Speaker 5>It was hard to tell.</v>

5754
02:27:17.441 --> 02:27:19.780
<v Speaker 5>He really wanted to do it for doctor reared and he's good friends with that.</v>

5755
02:27:19.781 --> 02:27:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Kyle,</v>

5756
02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:20.650
<v Speaker 5>did he help it?</v>

5757
02:27:20.650 --> 02:27:23.800
<v Speaker 5>So I want to believe all that Shit's real.</v>

5758
02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:24.670
<v Speaker 5>I want to.</v>

5759
02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:25.720
<v Speaker 5>But every time there's,</v>

5760
02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:26.290
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

5761
02:27:26.290 --> 02:27:27.280
<v Speaker 5>you hear about stem cells,</v>

5762
02:27:27.281 --> 02:27:30.790
<v Speaker 5>there's a new way and they do it different and now they're taking stem cells</v>

5763
02:27:30.791 --> 02:27:32.050
<v Speaker 5>from here instead of there.</v>

5764
02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:34.060
<v Speaker 5>Figured that shit out further.</v>

5765
02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:34.600
<v Speaker 5>Let us know.</v>

5766
02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:35.433
<v Speaker 5>They're all good.</v>

5767
02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:37.631
<v Speaker 5>They're all good.</v>

5768
02:27:37.631 --> 02:27:38.680
<v Speaker 5>But they keep getting better at it.</v>

5769
02:27:38.681 --> 02:27:42.120
<v Speaker 5>But talk to Tj because Tj had some raving things to say it,</v>

5770
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:47.150
<v Speaker 5>but he's an actor after the Mel Gibson podcast.</v>

5771
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

5772
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:51.970
<v Speaker 5>And after he was there before and then he went again,</v>

5773
02:27:52.270 --> 02:27:53.081
<v Speaker 5>he went again recently.</v>

5774
02:27:53.081 --> 02:27:53.361
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

5775
02:27:53.361 --> 02:27:54.610
<v Speaker 5>it's why do we have to go again?</v>

5776
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:55.261

02:28:48.470 --> 02:28:50.060
<v Speaker 7>I'm so curious about this fight.</v>

5813
02:28:52.011 --> 02:28:53.330
<v Speaker 7>Just beating the shit out some day.</v>

5814
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.621
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5815
02:28:54.621 --> 02:28:55.221
<v Speaker 7>it was weird,</v>

5816
02:28:55.221 --> 02:28:55.510
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

5817
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.700
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5818
02:28:55.700 --> 02:28:56.533
<v Speaker 7>Very strange.</v>

5819
02:28:57.050 --> 02:28:58.430
<v Speaker 7>I had heard that good,</v>

5820
02:28:58.431 --> 02:28:59.420
<v Speaker 7>but he knocked him out.</v>

5821
02:28:59.450 --> 02:28:59.900
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5822
02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:00.740
<v Speaker 7>Hurting him too.</v>

5823
02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:02.480
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't post that if I was him.</v>

5824
02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:03.111
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5825
02:29:03.111 --> 02:29:03.830
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>

5826
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:04.161
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5827
02:29:04.161 --> 02:29:07.100
<v Speaker 7>he posted some of him getting hit too after that because he said people are</v>

5828
02:29:07.101 --> 02:29:10.490
<v Speaker 7>calling him a bully that I don't like because that means he's reading the</v>

5829
02:29:10.491 --> 02:29:11.600
<v Speaker 7>comments and the,</v>

5830
02:29:11.601 --> 02:29:13.280
<v Speaker 7>he's reacting to those comments,</v>

5831
02:29:13.430 --> 02:29:15.080
<v Speaker 7>which means people can fuck with this guy.</v>

5832
02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:16.160
<v Speaker 7>If you're a young fighter,</v>

5833
02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:16.490
<v Speaker 7>to me,</v>

5834
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:17.900
<v Speaker 7>tough men to navigate through.</v>

5835
02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:19.070
<v Speaker 7>Well those comments,</v>

5836
02:29:19.071 --> 02:29:22.520
<v Speaker 7>you got to leave them alone because there's so many you're dealing with,</v>

5837
02:29:22.521 --> 02:29:22.880
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5838
02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:23.810
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5839
02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:28.900
<v Speaker 7>a pool of thousands and thousands of people and who knows who they are or what</v>

5840
02:29:29.170 --> 02:29:29.910
<v Speaker 7>their,</v>

5841
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:30.741
<v Speaker 7>those Pete yet.</v>

5842
02:29:30.741 --> 02:29:33.800
<v Speaker 7>But also a lot of those people aren't happy for your success.</v>

5843
02:29:33.810 --> 02:29:34.660
<v Speaker 7>Like Ms. Brown,</v>

5844
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:35.091
<v Speaker 7>their life.</v>

5845
02:29:35.091 --> 02:29:36.560
<v Speaker 7>So they come of course,</v>

5846
02:29:36.561 --> 02:29:38.180
<v Speaker 7>especially a guy like Tim is on the rise,</v>

5847
02:29:38.181 --> 02:29:38.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5848
02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:42.470
<v Speaker 7>or anyone in the spotlight tries that switch kick off the front leg.</v>

5849
02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:45.620
<v Speaker 7>UFC might want to hire someone to help these younger guys with that.</v>

5850
02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:49.850
<v Speaker 7>Well just give him a little psychological counseling on how to handle it and get</v>

5851
02:29:49.851 --> 02:29:52.820
<v Speaker 7>a social media expert in their tils are going to close the distance and land</v>

5852
02:29:52.821 --> 02:29:54.050
<v Speaker 7>that left hand over the top.</v>

5853
02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:55.160
<v Speaker 7>Wonderboy is not there though.</v>

5854
02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:55.940
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5855
02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:56.750
<v Speaker 7>One voice footwork.</v>

5856
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:58.490
<v Speaker 7>It's fricking ridiculous.</v>

5857
02:29:58.730 --> 02:30:02.300
<v Speaker 7>Well this is the perfect kind of style ram to an aggressive guy coming forward.</v>

5858
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:03.670
<v Speaker 7>This is what he's used to.</v>

5859
02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:05.540
<v Speaker 7>I have to imagine.</v>

5860
02:30:05.541 --> 02:30:07.490
<v Speaker 7>That's why I took the fight to stylistically.</v>

5861
02:30:07.610 --> 02:30:07.911
<v Speaker 7>It was like,</v>

5862
02:30:07.911 --> 02:30:08.091
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

5863
02:30:08.091 --> 02:30:08.900
<v Speaker 7>big guy.</v>

5864
02:30:08.900 --> 02:30:09.471
<v Speaker 7>Aggressive.</v>

5865
02:30:09.471 --> 02:30:11.310
<v Speaker 7>Let's do it right after the fight.</v>

5866
02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:12.633
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5867
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:13.491
<v Speaker 7>Even though remarried,</v>

5868
02:30:13.491 --> 02:30:16.760
<v Speaker 7>just be Mazda doll who he's see wondered why he shouldn't be there.</v>

5869
02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:17.300
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

5870
02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:18.260
<v Speaker 7>He better get the fuck out of there.</v>

5871
02:30:18.261 --> 02:30:19.130
<v Speaker 7>Don't stay there.</v>

5872
02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:19.971
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5873
02:30:19.971 --> 02:30:23.270
<v Speaker 7>he loves it but he was a little off balance and he didn't recuperate.</v>

5874
02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:27.830
<v Speaker 7>Well Darren made a shift as he was going to launch that leg kick and he put them</v>

5875
02:30:27.831 --> 02:30:31.340
<v Speaker 7>in a weird position where he was off balance.</v>

5876
02:30:32.330 --> 02:30:35.150
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's some good adjustments going on here at both guys trying to find</v>

5877
02:30:35.151 --> 02:30:35.870
<v Speaker 7>the right day.</v>

5878
02:30:35.870 --> 02:30:36.770
<v Speaker 7>Oh Shit.</v>

5879
02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:38.280
<v Speaker 7>God till likes the fire one.</v>

02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:42.560
<v Speaker 7>Aleks that slide with the right hand forward and then look off to the left.</v>

5881
02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:43.490
<v Speaker 7>Are you good?</v>

5882
02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:45.080

02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.351

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5900
02:31:13.341 --> 02:31:14.870
<v Speaker 7>Who knows what's going to happen and that's fine.</v>

5901
02:31:15.890 --> 02:31:16.760
<v Speaker 7>This is interesting.</v>

5902
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:18.230
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

5903
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:19.630
<v Speaker 7>so there's high level.</v>

5904
02:31:19.631 --> 02:31:21.540
<v Speaker 7>I was just trying to figure it out with the left hand.</v>

5905
02:31:21.570 --> 02:31:23.520
<v Speaker 7>Popped him with the left hand is caught him at the end of it.</v>

5906
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:25.140
<v Speaker 7>Not a lot of power but reached him.</v>

5907
02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:29.010
<v Speaker 7>He's letting until know that he's down there.</v>

5908
02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:29.840
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

5909
02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:30.673
<v Speaker 7>Snap.</v>

5910
02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:32.450
<v Speaker 7>He's also switching legs.</v>

5911
02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:32.941
<v Speaker 7>Switches,</v>

5912
02:31:32.941 --> 02:31:33.470
<v Speaker 7>dances.</v>

5913
02:31:33.470 --> 02:31:34.520
<v Speaker 7>Now he's all sideways.</v>

5914
02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:37.730
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to find a trading partner who's to emulate Wonderboy.</v>

5915
02:31:37.731 --> 02:31:38.420
<v Speaker 7>Man.</v>

5916
02:31:38.420 --> 02:31:41.530
<v Speaker 7>You don't really get a real look at to buy it.</v>

5917
02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:44.780
<v Speaker 7>He's picking his shots,</v>

5918
02:31:44.800 --> 02:31:47.450
<v Speaker 7>but I think he's trying to frustrate till so till jumps.</v>

5919
02:31:47.451 --> 02:31:47.990
<v Speaker 7>It makes a mistake.</v>

5920

02:35:02.450 --> 02:35:05.170
<v Speaker 7>So that first round you got to give it to one or right?</v>

6045
02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:06.560
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's super close,</v>

6046
02:35:06.561 --> 02:35:07.394
<v Speaker 7>but yeah.</v>

6047
02:35:07.550 --> 02:35:07.731
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6048
02:35:07.731 --> 02:35:08.564
<v Speaker 7>Give it to Wonderboy.</v>

6049
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:09.703
<v Speaker 7>Wonderboy,</v>

6050
02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:11.130
<v Speaker 7>not a whole lot going on most.</v>

6051
02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:11.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

6052
02:35:11.330 --> 02:35:12.830
<v Speaker 7>he landed like maybe two shots,</v>

6053
02:35:12.831 --> 02:35:14.450
<v Speaker 7>one of the body than that one.</v>

6054
02:35:14.451 --> 02:35:14.921
<v Speaker 7>Two of,</v>

6055
02:35:14.921 --> 02:35:15.741
<v Speaker 7>remember this though.</v>

6056
02:35:15.741 --> 02:35:16.790
<v Speaker 7>They're in Liverpool,</v>

6057
02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:17.630
<v Speaker 7>the home kit.</v>

6058
02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:22.630
<v Speaker 7>He's the hometown kid and the judges look at a octagon control so that it's not</v>

6059
02:35:22.791 --> 02:35:26.600
<v Speaker 7>necessarily could give to wonder Boone that that frontline Darren until I don't</v>

6060
02:35:26.601 --> 02:35:27.590
<v Speaker 7>think landed anything,</v>

6061
02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:30.470
<v Speaker 7>but he's going forward and the judges are morons,</v>

6062
02:35:30.490 --> 02:35:30.891
<v Speaker 7>so like,</v>

6063
02:35:30.891 --> 02:35:31.131
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

6064
02:35:31.131 --> 02:35:31.851
<v Speaker 7>going forward.</v>

6065
02:35:31.851 --> 02:35:32.910
<v Speaker 7>That works well.</v>

6066
02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:34.910
<v Speaker 7>Give it to till he did a good job.</v>

6067
02:35:34.911 --> 02:35:38.360
<v Speaker 7>Didn't t they always ask a question after they say something.</v>

6068
02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:40.401
<v Speaker 7>He's amazing.</v>

6069
02:35:40.401 --> 02:35:41.234
<v Speaker 7>Isn't he</v>

6070
02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:43.431
<v Speaker 7>fantastic?</v>

6071
02:35:43.431 --> 02:35:44.360
<v Speaker 7>Righthand wasn't it</v>

6072
02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:50.020
<v Speaker 7>the slides about to get loose in the third round.</v>

6073
02:35:50.021 --> 02:35:51.390
<v Speaker 7>I feel like what's getting loose?</v>

6074
02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:53.230
<v Speaker 7>Heredi a little bit.</v>

6075
02:35:53.260 --> 02:35:55.180
<v Speaker 7>It's just such a dangerous chess game.</v>

6076
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.930
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>

6077

02:35:58.930 --> 02:35:59.820
<v Speaker 7>He's always like that.</v>

6080
02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:00.581
<v Speaker 7>It's like that.</v>

6081
02:36:00.581 --> 02:36:02.080
<v Speaker 7>That's that karate style sign.</v>

6082
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:04.170
<v Speaker 7>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Tilt.</v>

6086
02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:08.560
<v Speaker 7>Elbows are no joke either.</v>

6087
02:36:08.561 --> 02:36:09.730
<v Speaker 7>Now if he gets in close,</v>

6088
02:36:09.731 --> 02:36:11.230
<v Speaker 7>they're the one that he landed on.</v>

6089
02:36:11.231 --> 02:36:12.780
<v Speaker 7>Cowboy was God.</v>

6090
02:36:13.270 --> 02:36:14.290
<v Speaker 7>Who else has he beaten?</v>

6091

6096
02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:22.600
<v Speaker 7>he hasn't really knocked you off your socks before that cowboy fight.</v>

6097
02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:24.100
<v Speaker 7>He's at some decisions.</v>

6098
02:36:25.170 --> 02:36:26.003
<v Speaker 7>The knockout.</v>

6099
02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:28.270
<v Speaker 7>You stop somebody too early on.</v>

6100

<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

6291
02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:10.100
<v Speaker 7>Darren till super aggressive here.</v>

6292
02:41:10.101 --> 02:41:10.934
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

6293
02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:12.610
<v Speaker 7>I wonder if a Wonderboy,</v>

6294
02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:13.610
<v Speaker 7>his knee is okay</v>

6295
02:41:16.540 --> 02:41:17.101
<v Speaker 7>because those,</v>

6296
02:41:17.101 --> 02:41:17.934
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

6297
02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:21.270
<v Speaker 7>he still hasn't landed anything now except for those sidekicks to the knee.</v>

6298
02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:22.320
<v Speaker 7>Here's the land.</v>

6299
02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:23.100
<v Speaker 7>Anything to the head.</v>

6300
02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:23.610
<v Speaker 7>Nothing.</v>

6301
02:41:23.610 --> 02:41:24.960
<v Speaker 7>Wonder boys knee seems fine.</v>

6302
02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:27.740
<v Speaker 7>He's moving fine tooth around so far.</v>

6303
02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:29.370
<v Speaker 7>No shot to the head.</v>

6304
02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:30.293
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6305
02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:30.870
<v Speaker 7>Ooh,</v>

6306
02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:31.703
<v Speaker 7>kick to the body.</v>

6307
02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:38.670
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

6308
02:41:38.670 --> 02:41:40.950
<v Speaker 7>the whole thing with Wonderboy is just,</v>

6309
02:41:41.550 --> 02:41:46.350
<v Speaker 7>you make a mistake and he counters you and so far till hasn't really made any</v>

6310
02:41:46.351 --> 02:41:48.510
<v Speaker 7>mistakes but wonder boys found a few openings,</v>

6311
02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:53.030
<v Speaker 7>but there's never been like one big bum rush where he'd left a gap and Wonderboy</v>

6312
02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:54.150
<v Speaker 7>could drop a ball on him.</v>

6313
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:57.600
<v Speaker 7>Did I miss anything?</v>

6314
02:41:57.660 --> 02:41:57.961
<v Speaker 7>Nope.</v>

6315
02:41:57.961 --> 02:41:58.650
<v Speaker 7>Nothing.</v>

6316
02:41:58.650 --> 02:42:00.000
<v Speaker 7>But they did show the replay.</v>

6317
02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:01.880
<v Speaker 7>The knee buckling a Wonderboy.</v>

6318
02:42:01.900 --> 02:42:02.621
<v Speaker 7>It look pretty now.</v>

6319
02:42:02.621 --> 02:42:02.911
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6320
02:42:02.911 --> 02:42:03.744
<v Speaker 7>From what?</v>

6321
02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:04.740
<v Speaker 7>From that sidekick.</v>

6322
02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:05.753
<v Speaker 7>Oh Wow.</v>

6323
02:42:05.850 --> 02:42:06.760
<v Speaker 7>From a side kick front.</v>

6324
02:42:06.761 --> 02:42:07.594
<v Speaker 7>Like psyche through me.</v>

6325
02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:08.790
<v Speaker 7>But he's moving fine.</v>

6326
02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:11.220
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't seem like he's a limping at all.</v>

6327
02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:13.620
<v Speaker 7>And he threw some kicks with that left leg.</v>

6328
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:15.510
<v Speaker 7>So you would be nice at one one.</v>

6329
02:42:16.830 --> 02:42:17.461
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to tell.</v>

6330
02:42:17.461 --> 02:42:18.294
<v Speaker 7>It's hard.</v>

6331
02:42:18.470 --> 02:42:20.520
<v Speaker 7>Wonderboy was a little more aggressive though.</v>

6332
02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:20.941
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6333

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6516
02:47:02.841 --> 02:47:03.421

6517
02:47:03.421 --> 02:47:05.120
<v Speaker 7>But it caught him at the end of it for sure.</v>

6523
02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:11.791
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

6524
02:47:11.791 --> 02:47:13.890

6531
02:47:19.081 --> 02:47:23.560
<v Speaker 7>That is a great argument for the five round fight for high level folks.</v>

6532
02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:30.630
<v Speaker 7>Maybe we would feel so bad if we were leaving here and then like who won?</v>

6533
02:47:30.631 --> 02:47:32.490

<v Speaker 7>Unless you're super and you'd be so wonderful.</v>

6540
02:47:40.751 --> 02:47:41.640
<v Speaker 7>It was a hard jab.</v>

6541

6556
02:48:13.310 --> 02:48:13.950
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

6557
02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:14.850
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>

6558
02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:16.020
<v Speaker 7>He hasn't switched in the EOC.</v>

6559
02:48:16.021 --> 02:48:20.570
<v Speaker 7>This first made it well first times because his main event against cowboy Jase</v>

<v Speaker 7>that's his first main event.</v>

6563
02:48:26.211 --> 02:48:27.044
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

6564
02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:28.760
<v Speaker 7>And what about outside of the UFC?</v>

6566
02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:37.280
<v Speaker 7>What 17 or a 14 on crazy speaks perfect Portuguese.</v>

6573
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:42.860

6611
02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:32.910
<v Speaker 7>it'd be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</v>

6627
02:49:56.281 --> 02:49:56.461
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

6628
02:49:56.461 --> 02:49:57.790
<v Speaker 7>I didn't get the fuck down.</v>

6629
02:49:57.840 --> 02:49:58.311
<v Speaker 7>I'm watching it.</v>

6630
02:49:58.311 --> 02:49:58.711
<v Speaker 7>It's fine.</v>

6631
02:49:58.711 --> 02:49:59.544
<v Speaker 7>Your son,</v>

6632
02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:02.280
<v Speaker 7>one boy with a step in Jab.</v>

6633
02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:07.110
<v Speaker 7>Not a lot of action that's fighting.</v>

6634
02:50:07.180 --> 02:50:08.410
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

6635
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:11.530
<v Speaker 7>Wonderboy looking for that left hand over the top because it land.</v>

6636
02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:12.160
<v Speaker 7>Nope.</v>

6637
02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:13.210
<v Speaker 7>Just kind of grazed him.</v>

6638
02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:15.790
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of hard to tell his back was to us.</v>

6639
02:50:16.020 --> 02:50:17.980
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be a tough fucking fight to judge,</v>

6640
02:50:17.981 --> 02:50:18.814
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

6641
02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:22.870
<v Speaker 7>Tell us having a hard time hitting him,</v>

6642
02:50:22.871 --> 02:50:23.950
<v Speaker 7>that's for damn sure.</v>

6643
02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:24.911
<v Speaker 7>Beautiful Dark.</v>

6644
02:50:24.911 --> 02:50:25.211
<v Speaker 7>Under that,</v>

6645
02:50:25.211 --> 02:50:26.800
<v Speaker 7>we get this tail with a clinch.</v>

6646
02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:29.790
<v Speaker 7>What if he takes him down to,</v>

6647
02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:30.940
<v Speaker 7>we just stop the fight.</v>

6648
02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.530
<v Speaker 7>Interestingly,</v>

6649
02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:31.931
<v Speaker 7>the tills,</v>

6650
02:50:31.931 --> 02:50:33.070
<v Speaker 7>the one holding onto him here.</v>

6651
02:50:33.130 --> 02:50:33.963
<v Speaker 7>Oh elbow.</v>

6652
02:50:34.220 --> 02:50:35.590
<v Speaker 7>That clenches more ties.</v>

6653
02:50:35.591 --> 02:50:36.424
<v Speaker 7>Nasty.</v>

6654
02:50:39.230 --> 02:50:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Good elbow on the break there.</v>

6655
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:44.180
<v Speaker 7>If you're one of my say exactly what he wanted.</v>

6656
02:50:44.660 --> 02:50:46.540
<v Speaker 7>That lace kind of fucked up that lead leg.</v>

6657
02:50:46.580 --> 02:50:47.413
<v Speaker 7>Right leg.</v>

6658
02:50:47.420 --> 02:50:47.780
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

6659
02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:49.010
<v Speaker 7>It does look a little bruised.</v>

6660
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.820
<v Speaker 7>Oh Oo.</v>

6661
02:50:49.820 --> 02:50:50.690
<v Speaker 7>Good kick to the body.</v>

6662
02:50:50.700 --> 02:50:51.440
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

6663
02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:53.480
<v Speaker 7>You guys watched that show Cobra Kai?</v>

6664
02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:54.171
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

6665
02:50:54.171 --> 02:50:55.004
<v Speaker 7>I haven't seen.</v>

6666
02:50:55.150 --> 02:50:56.390
<v Speaker 7>I've heard of course to be good.</v>

6667
02:50:56.480 --> 02:50:56.691
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6668
02:50:56.691 --> 02:50:56.851
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

6669
02:50:56.851 --> 02:50:57.261
<v Speaker 7>it's great.</v>

6670
02:50:57.261 --> 02:50:59.570
<v Speaker 7>That's a crazy well on Wonderboy.</v>

6671
02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:00.170
<v Speaker 7>His leg.</v>

6672
02:51:00.170 --> 02:51:03.080
<v Speaker 7>I really haven't noticed him getting hit that much either.</v>

6673
02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:04.550
<v Speaker 7>It's on both legs to the,</v>

6674
02:51:04.551 --> 02:51:05.450
<v Speaker 7>obviously the right legs.</v>

6675
02:51:05.451 --> 02:51:07.070
<v Speaker 7>Worse with that left leg is pretty tender.</v>

6676
02:51:07.071 --> 02:51:07.904
<v Speaker 7>Roni too.</v>

6677
02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:09.141
<v Speaker 7>They'll ride lego.</v>

6678
02:51:09.141 --> 02:51:10.310
<v Speaker 7>It's really fucked us.</v>

6679
02:51:10.311 --> 02:51:11.960
<v Speaker 7>I don't really remember him kicking him that heart.</v>

6680
02:51:12.050 --> 02:51:14.990
<v Speaker 7>It must have been when he was standing in south park sideways,</v>

6681
02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:15.853
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

6682
02:51:17.470 --> 02:51:18.810
<v Speaker 7>and now he hasn't gone back then.</v>

6683
02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:20.590
<v Speaker 7>Athey really not mine.</v>

6684
02:51:20.610 --> 02:51:21.371
<v Speaker 7>Let's just round it.</v>

6685
02:51:21.371 --> 02:51:22.204
<v Speaker 7>Doesn't like it.</v>

6686
02:51:22.450 --> 02:51:23.410
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

6687
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.750
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>

6688
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:25.000
<v Speaker 7>his footwork just stupid.</v>

6689
02:51:25.001 --> 02:51:26.740
<v Speaker 7>So Darren till can't really get a read on them.</v>

6690
02:51:27.970 --> 02:51:28.421
<v Speaker 7>But again,</v>

6691
02:51:28.421 --> 02:51:29.860
<v Speaker 7>the judges are given that the till.</v>

6692
02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:31.861
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

6693
02:51:31.861 --> 02:51:35.100
<v Speaker 7>that nothing big has happened where you go all that guide.</v>

6694
02:51:35.250 --> 02:51:36.180
<v Speaker 7>Definitely.</v>

6695
02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:38.730
<v Speaker 7>If someone likes someone just knock someone down.</v>

6696
02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:39.690
<v Speaker 7>You've got the fight,</v>

6697
02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:42.390
<v Speaker 7>it shows Mike LP got the good right hand to the body.</v>

6698
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:52.120
<v Speaker 7>So such a high level chess game here,</v>

6699
02:51:52.330 --> 02:51:53.141
<v Speaker 7>which I did get.</v>

6700
02:51:53.141 --> 02:51:54.070
<v Speaker 7>I'm on the edge of my seat.</v>

6701
02:51:54.071 --> 02:51:56.530
<v Speaker 7>But if you're just a regular fan like come on man.</v>

6702
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:03.240
<v Speaker 7>I tell you what he's going to get more shit is Wonderboy.</v>

6703
02:52:03.390 --> 02:52:04.800
<v Speaker 7>Cause there's one Woodley fights,</v>

6704
02:52:04.830 --> 02:52:06.110
<v Speaker 7>which 39 that's fault.</v>

6705
02:52:06.730 --> 02:52:07.391
<v Speaker 7>It's not his fault.</v>

6706
02:52:07.391 --> 02:52:08.480
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying the public thing.</v>

6707
02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:09.250
<v Speaker 7>Shit,</v>

6708
02:52:09.250 --> 02:52:09.881
<v Speaker 7>I guess.</v>

6709
02:52:09.881 --> 02:52:10.331
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

6710
02:52:10.331 --> 02:52:11.200
<v Speaker 7>It's what it is.</v>

6711
02:52:11.660 --> 02:52:12.493
<v Speaker 7>It's this is the,</v>

6712
02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:13.990
<v Speaker 7>you mean you want to beat him?</v>

6713
02:52:13.991 --> 02:52:15.870
<v Speaker 7>You got to come after him and he'd come after him.</v>

6714
02:52:15.871 --> 02:52:16.990
<v Speaker 7>You run into the woodchipper.</v>

6715
02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:19.180
<v Speaker 7>But the thing is he's not winning when he does this,</v>

6716
02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:23.350
<v Speaker 7>but we didn't win against Woodley when he did this for sure.</v>

6717
02:52:23.410 --> 02:52:24.560
<v Speaker 7>But he's lacking previously.</v>

6718
02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:26.650
<v Speaker 7>He's obviously got number one for a reason.</v>

6719
02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:27.461
<v Speaker 7>He's number one in the world.</v>

6720
02:52:27.461 --> 02:52:28.420
<v Speaker 7>I'm happening there.</v>

6721
02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:30.130
<v Speaker 7>Cut that back.</v>

6722
02:52:30.131 --> 02:52:31.450
<v Speaker 7>Leg is fucked up man.</v>

6723
02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:32.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

6724
02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:35.180
<v Speaker 7>I'll do friendly voice will [inaudible] yeah,</v>

6725
02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:37.180
<v Speaker 7>he's wobbling a little on back to his corner.</v>

6726
02:52:37.181 --> 02:52:38.530
<v Speaker 7>That leg is fucked up man.</v>

6727
02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:43.450
<v Speaker 7>Maybe they just didn't loosen this fifth round and just save it for the fifth</v>

6728
02:52:43.451 --> 02:52:43.751
<v Speaker 7>round.</v>

6729
02:52:43.751 --> 02:52:44.584
<v Speaker 7>Eddie.</v>

6730
02:52:44.890 --> 02:52:45.700
<v Speaker 7>I hope so.</v>

6731
02:52:45.700 --> 02:52:46.240
<v Speaker 7>Me Too.</v>

6732
02:52:46.240 --> 02:52:46.691
<v Speaker 7>Because again,</v>

6733
02:52:46.691 --> 02:52:47.560
<v Speaker 7>if it stopped right here,</v>

6734
02:52:47.561 --> 02:52:48.400
<v Speaker 7>I'd be bummed out.</v>

6735
02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:51.480
<v Speaker 7>I'm pretty lack luster.</v>

6736
02:52:52.210 --> 02:52:57.210
<v Speaker 7>I was really crushed to give it to till I'm 100% know that every round of that</v>

6737
02:52:57.720 --> 02:52:58.553
<v Speaker 7>gift.</v>

6738
02:52:59.060 --> 02:53:01.030
<v Speaker 7>And then one like we don't want to me too obviously.</v>

6739
02:53:01.031 --> 02:53:02.290
<v Speaker 7>And he gives one to one a boy.</v>

6740
02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:03.570
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

6741
02:53:03.570 --> 02:53:06.430
<v Speaker 7>This is up three to one till.</v>

6742
02:53:06.470 --> 02:53:06.860
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6743
02:53:06.860 --> 02:53:08.740
<v Speaker 7>Real because of the judges.</v>

6744
02:53:08.770 --> 02:53:09.280
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

6745
02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:10.660
<v Speaker 7>But knowledge is of what you think.</v>

6746
02:53:10.661 --> 02:53:11.110
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

6747
02:53:11.110 --> 02:53:12.370
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

6748
02:53:12.460 --> 02:53:13.750
<v Speaker 7>even then it'd be tough.</v>

6749
02:53:14.020 --> 02:53:15.310
<v Speaker 7>You can maybe go to two,</v>

6750
02:53:15.311 --> 02:53:15.971
<v Speaker 7>but I,</v>

6751
02:53:15.971 --> 02:53:17.200
<v Speaker 7>I'd say tills winning this fight.</v>

6752
02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:19.780
<v Speaker 7>I don't know about that.</v>

6753
02:53:19.781 --> 02:53:21.070
<v Speaker 7>I think Wonderboy is winning.</v>

6754
02:53:21.490 --> 02:53:22.930
<v Speaker 7>Can I get some Goddamn copy?</v>

6755
02:53:22.931 --> 02:53:23.591
<v Speaker 7>Strike numbers.</v>

6756
02:53:23.591 --> 02:53:24.131

02:53:24.131 --> 02:53:24.640
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>

6758
02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:25.900
<v Speaker 7>No wonder they left her ass.</v>

6759
02:53:25.930 --> 02:53:26.763
<v Speaker 7>Just kidding.</v>

6760
02:53:27.370 --> 02:53:28.480
<v Speaker 7>Can I get something?</v>

6761
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:31.930
<v Speaker 7>How's your show going on showtime?</v>

6762
02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:32.793
<v Speaker 7>Enjoying it.</v>

6763
02:53:32.950 --> 02:53:33.401
<v Speaker 7>It's been good,</v>

02:53:34.030 --> 02:53:34.750
<v Speaker 7>It's been fun.</v>

6766
02:53:34.750 --> 02:53:36.250
<v Speaker 7>Nice to a lot of fun.</v>

6767
02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:40.000
<v Speaker 7>Did you know that guy that just died without from the comedy division?</v>

6768
02:53:40.001 --> 02:53:40.140
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

6769
02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:40.973

6959
02:58:39.231 --> 02:58:40.190
<v Speaker 2>The flat after that.</v>

6960
02:58:41.180 --> 02:58:42.350
<v Speaker 2>It'd be hard pressed.</v>

6961
02:58:42.680 --> 02:58:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Especially in Liverpool man.</v>

6962
02:58:44.781 --> 02:58:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Until I want to boys in a tough spot though.</v>

6963
02:58:48.680 --> 02:58:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he's that happy about that.</v>

6964
02:58:50.391 --> 02:58:51.224
<v Speaker 2>That was um,</v>

6965
02:58:51.410 --> 02:58:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean he landed a good shot.</v>

6966
02:58:53.060 --> 02:58:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I guess he was trying,</v>

6967
02:58:54.080 --> 02:58:55.370
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like he wasn't trying.</v>

6968
02:58:55.400 --> 02:58:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6969
02:58:56.090 --> 02:59:00.740
<v Speaker 2>he was [inaudible] drank till after that lackluster performance cause he,</v>

6970
02:59:00.741 --> 02:59:01.730
<v Speaker 2>cause Wonderboy is number one.</v>

6971
02:59:01.731 --> 02:59:02.151
<v Speaker 2>You'll like him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>number one obviously I think you put them in the top.</v>

6973
02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Waterboy is just a nightmare for everybody.</v>

6974
02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:08.900
<v Speaker 2>He's a nightmare for everybody.</v>

6975
02:59:10.010 --> 02:59:10.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6976
02:59:10.580 --> 02:59:10.881
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

6977
02:59:10.881 --> 02:59:12.160
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to look good against him.</v>

6978
02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:12.371
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6979
02:59:12.371 --> 02:59:14.420
<v Speaker 2>win over him is as a win.</v>

6980
02:59:14.500 --> 02:59:14.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6981
02:59:14.780 --> 02:59:17.030
<v Speaker 2>he beat you back at number one.</v>

6982
02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:17.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6983
02:59:17.511 --> 02:59:18.680
<v Speaker 2>he didn't even make the weight.</v>

6984
02:59:18.830 --> 02:59:19.551
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

6985
02:59:19.551 --> 02:59:22.370
<v Speaker 2>that's where it gets tricky because no one gives a fuck about that.</v>

6986
02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:22.641
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

03:05:01.930 --> 03:05:02.890
<v Speaker 5>As soon as I was done,</v>

7208
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:03.800
<v Speaker 5>I killed it before then.</v>

7209
03:05:03.940 --> 03:05:07.900
<v Speaker 5>I was done with that before the movie even started that the chicken watermelon</v>

03:05:19.270 --> 03:05:21.700
<v Speaker 5>my wife took my son to some,</v>

7219
03:05:21.790 --> 03:05:21.941

7220
03:05:21.941 --> 03:05:25.850
<v Speaker 5>birthday party thing and they were going to be gone for a couple of hours and I</v>

7221
03:05:25.890 --> 03:05:26.201
<v Speaker 5>just said,</v>

7222
03:05:26.201 --> 03:05:27.190
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm going to go to.</v>

7223
03:05:27.191 --> 03:05:27.520
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

7224
03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:29.800
<v Speaker 5>I like that the idea of going to movies,</v>

7225
03:05:29.830 --> 03:05:31.210
<v Speaker 5>it's just that they all suck.</v>

7226
03:05:31.600 --> 03:05:32.560
<v Speaker 5>But I like going,</v>

7227
03:05:32.561 --> 03:05:33.160
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

7228
03:05:33.160 --> 03:05:35.350
<v Speaker 5>I like buying some candy or solo though.</v>

7229
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:36.423
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

7230
03:05:36.660 --> 03:05:38.980
<v Speaker 5>I go by myself all the time.</v>

7231
03:05:39.490 --> 03:05:40.061
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

7232
03:05:40.061 --> 03:05:40.894
<v Speaker 5>I did not,</v>

7233
03:05:40.960 --> 03:05:42.460
<v Speaker 5>not so much since I had a kid,</v>

7234
03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:44.830
<v Speaker 5>but back in the day I would go all the time by myself.</v>

7235
03:05:44.860 --> 03:05:47.140
<v Speaker 5>I think I've only been maybe three times,</v>

7236
03:05:48.040 --> 03:05:50.200
<v Speaker 5>not even in my life by myself.</v>

7237
03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:53.860
<v Speaker 5>I saw a student turbine only because I want to be able to leave if I go with</v>

7238
03:05:53.861 --> 03:05:57.280
<v Speaker 5>someone else and I got a fucking state cause nobody likes to talk to them.</v>

7239
03:05:57.281 --> 03:05:58.360
<v Speaker 5>And I like no,</v>

7240
03:05:58.361 --> 03:05:59.530
<v Speaker 5>most people don't like leaving.</v>

7241
03:05:59.830 --> 03:06:00.663
<v Speaker 5>Most people they get,</v>

7242
03:06:00.670 --> 03:06:03.250
<v Speaker 5>so I got to fucking sit there for the whole stupid movie.</v>

7243
03:06:03.640 --> 03:06:04.630
<v Speaker 5>So have I like minutes.</v>

7244
03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:07.360
<v Speaker 5>I like the freedom to leave cause I won't,</v>

7245
03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:09.610
<v Speaker 5>I want as soon as I don't give a shit about the movie,</v>

7246
03:06:09.611 --> 03:06:11.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm out or Deadpool two is amazing.</v>

7247
03:06:11.740 --> 03:06:12.311
<v Speaker 5>That was good.</v>

7248
03:06:12.311 --> 03:06:12.911
<v Speaker 5>I stayed for that.</v>

7249
03:06:12.911 --> 03:06:14.020
<v Speaker 5>I saw that by myself too.</v>

7250
03:06:14.410 --> 03:06:15.130
<v Speaker 5>That was good.</v>

7251
03:06:15.130 --> 03:06:15.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7252
03:06:15.580 --> 03:06:17.440
<v Speaker 5>Deadpool tunes because she moved by herself.</v>

7253
03:06:17.550 --> 03:06:18.900
<v Speaker 5>Know I really need that.</v>

7254
03:06:18.970 --> 03:06:19.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7255
03:06:19.241 --> 03:06:20.050
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>

7256
03:06:20.050 --> 03:06:20.890
<v Speaker 5>I I just need to,</v>

7257
03:06:20.891 --> 03:06:22.300
<v Speaker 5>I just need the freedom to leave.</v>

7258
03:06:22.301 --> 03:06:22.521
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

7259
03:06:22.521 --> 03:06:23.860
<v Speaker 5>that's really what that's about.</v>

7260
03:06:24.210 --> 03:06:25.043
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

7261
03:06:26.350 --> 03:06:26.521
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

7262
03:06:26.521 --> 03:06:29.050
<v Speaker 5>That welterweight division is pure fire right now.</v>

7263
03:06:29.890 --> 03:06:30.161
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

7264
03:06:30.161 --> 03:06:30.701
<v Speaker 5>no kidding.</v>

7265
03:06:30.701 --> 03:06:31.030
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

7266
03:06:31.030 --> 03:06:32.320
<v Speaker 5>Pure fucking fire.</v>

7267
03:06:33.340 --> 03:06:35.770
<v Speaker 5>I think at all the young guys out of Colby Covington,</v>

7268
03:06:36.470 --> 03:06:37.600
<v Speaker 5>Uzman and then,</v>

7269
03:06:37.601 --> 03:06:37.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

7270
03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:38.381
<v Speaker 5>Darren till,</v>

7271
03:06:38.381 --> 03:06:40.600
<v Speaker 5>till if I had to bet on one of them being like the,</v>

7272
03:06:40.660 --> 03:06:41.980
<v Speaker 5>the world champion be till,</v>

7273
03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:42.580
<v Speaker 5>I think so,</v>

7274
03:06:42.580 --> 03:06:43.060
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

7275
03:06:43.060 --> 03:06:43.690
<v Speaker 5>Out of all those,</v>

7276
03:06:43.690 --> 03:06:43.851
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

7277
03:06:43.851 --> 03:06:44.680
<v Speaker 5>those three guys,</v>

7278
03:06:44.680 --> 03:06:45.670
<v Speaker 5>dangerous motherfucker,</v>

7279
03:06:45.671 --> 03:06:46.420
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

7280
03:06:46.420 --> 03:06:47.710
<v Speaker 5>If you trade them with that guy.</v>

7281
03:06:47.740 --> 03:06:50.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean the thing that wonder boy did that was so interesting is he's just never</v>

7282
03:06:50.981 --> 03:06:51.640
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

7283
03:06:51.640 --> 03:06:52.540
<v Speaker 5>He's just never there.</v>

7284
03:06:52.541 --> 03:06:52.870
<v Speaker 5>And it,</v>

7285
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:56.130
<v Speaker 5>it made it a hard fight for to keep his composure</v>

7286
03:06:56.130 --> 03:07:00.330
<v Speaker 2>and fight five hard rounds and constantly be chasing them and wonder boys never</v>

7287
03:07:00.331 --> 03:07:03.330
<v Speaker 2>there and wonder what tagged him a couple times but til I was the one that</v>

7288
03:07:03.331 --> 03:07:07.830
<v Speaker 2>landed the big haymaker but you also see till under control experience still</v>

7289
03:07:07.831 --> 03:07:08.161
<v Speaker 2>stuck.</v>

7290
03:07:08.161 --> 03:07:10.080
<v Speaker 2>This technique is me tough to beat man.</v>

7291
03:07:10.560 --> 03:07:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Now I'd like to see him against a guy who has high level wrestling,</v>

7292
03:07:13.321 --> 03:07:16.670
<v Speaker 2>like a Colby come dinner Woodlea or uh,</v>

7293
03:07:16.690 --> 03:07:17.440
<v Speaker 2>even who you know,</v>

7294
03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:18.730
<v Speaker 2>been super high level wrestler.</v>

7295
03:07:18.750 --> 03:07:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I see that where it's not ideal matchup for him,</v>

7296
03:07:20.971 --> 03:07:24.070
<v Speaker 2>see how he performs cause cowboy and Wonderboy are there.</v>

7297
03:07:24.090 --> 03:07:24.481
<v Speaker 2>Striker.</v>

7298
03:07:24.481 --> 03:07:24.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

7299
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it's it's wheelhouse.</v>

7300
03:07:25.980 --> 03:07:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

7301
03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Let me see your Rda.</v>

7302
03:07:27.270 --> 03:07:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Huseman or Colby?</v>

7303
03:07:28.261 --> 03:07:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Killington.</v>

7304
03:07:28.740 --> 03:07:28.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7305
03:07:28.981 --> 03:07:30.540
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see him versus cope.</v>

7306
03:07:30.650 --> 03:07:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I think [inaudible] fine.</v>

7307
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.601
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

7308
03:07:33.601 --> 03:07:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Purple because the purple thing,</v>

7309
03:07:35.070 --> 03:07:35.831
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he's a purple.</v>

7310
03:07:35.831 --> 03:07:36.720
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing it for awhile.</v>

7311
03:07:37.290 --> 03:07:38.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7312
03:07:38.310 --> 03:07:39.210
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

7313
03:07:39.240 --> 03:07:39.511
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

7314
03:07:39.511 --> 03:07:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you do Colby Rich Dad.</v>

7315
03:07:40.810 --> 03:07:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you could kill off the young lions yet.</v>

7316
03:07:42.750 --> 03:07:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I think you let the young lions go after the Robbie Lawler's,</v>

7317
03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:46.260
<v Speaker 2>the cowboys,</v>

7318
03:07:46.290 --> 03:07:48.380
<v Speaker 2>the RDAs do it that way.</v>

7319
03:07:48.410 --> 03:07:50.910
<v Speaker 2>They think that way or do they just try and make the best fights that can do</v>

7320
03:07:50.920 --> 03:07:51.753
<v Speaker 2>UFC?</v>

7321
03:07:52.110 --> 03:07:52.943
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody saying,</v>

7322
03:07:52.980 --> 03:07:54.230
<v Speaker 2>oh just what do you like?</v>

7323
03:07:54.250 --> 03:07:54.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7324
03:07:54.730 --> 03:07:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just whatever the fuck works.</v>

7325
03:07:56.720 --> 03:07:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Cause this fight doesn't make too much sense for wonder boy.</v>

7326
03:07:59.100 --> 03:07:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7327
03:07:59.790 --> 03:08:01.440
<v Speaker 2>But it's a fun fight for us to watch.</v>

7328
03:08:01.470 --> 03:08:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7329
03:08:02.010 --> 03:08:02.491
<v Speaker 2>very fun.</v>

7330
03:08:02.491 --> 03:08:03.324
<v Speaker 2>Fight to watch,</v>

7331
03:08:03.660 --> 03:08:03.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

7332
03:08:03.970 --> 03:08:05.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a clubbing punch or boom.</v>

7333
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7334
03:08:06.470 --> 03:08:07.303
<v Speaker 2>a lot of power.</v>

7335
03:08:07.500 --> 03:08:07.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7336
03:08:07.681 --> 03:08:09.480
<v Speaker 2>he's got power and he's a big fella.</v>

7337
03:08:09.960 --> 03:08:10.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean if he,</v>

7338
03:08:10.681 --> 03:08:15.681
<v Speaker 2>if they wanted him to have to weigh 188 they know that he's probably well,</v>

7339
03:08:16.500 --> 03:08:21.500
<v Speaker 2>well north of that I'd probably come in and well north of 200 c but missing the</v>

7340
03:08:21.511 --> 03:08:22.130
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

7341
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:23.790
<v Speaker 2>we don't make a big enough deal of it.</v>

7342
03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a f I don't really kill either.</v>

7343
03:08:25.681 --> 03:08:28.260
<v Speaker 2>But it is a problem and it's a huge problem.</v>

7344
03:08:28.261 --> 03:08:29.490
<v Speaker 2>It's such an advantage.</v>

7345
03:08:29.491 --> 03:08:31.190
<v Speaker 2>But like with Mackenzie dern,</v>

7346
03:08:31.210 --> 03:08:31.860
<v Speaker 2>after she missed it,</v>

7347
03:08:31.860 --> 03:08:32.401
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care.</v>

7348
03:08:32.401 --> 03:08:32.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

7349
03:08:32.611 --> 03:08:32.821
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

7350
03:08:32.821 --> 03:08:33.441
<v Speaker 2>do your thing girl.</v>

7351
03:08:33.441 --> 03:08:36.540
<v Speaker 2>And she missed it by seven fucking pounds.</v>

7352
03:08:36.541 --> 03:08:36.751
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

7353
03:08:36.751 --> 03:08:37.800
<v Speaker 2>That's so big.</v>

7354
03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:39.120
<v Speaker 2>That means it doesn't drain her.</v>

7355
03:08:39.380 --> 03:08:40.320
<v Speaker 2>So when she goes to anybody,</v>

7356
03:08:40.330 --> 03:08:41.460
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge advantage.</v>

7357
03:08:41.480 --> 03:08:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7358
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:42.451
<v Speaker 2>She goes to fight.</v>

7359
03:08:42.451 --> 03:08:43.850
<v Speaker 2>She's not drained out huge.</v>

7360
03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:45.840
<v Speaker 2>That Mackenzie dern fight.</v>

7361
03:08:45.870 --> 03:08:46.591
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

7362
03:08:46.591 --> 03:08:48.810
<v Speaker 2>That was like some UFC two type shit.</v>

7363
03:08:49.050 --> 03:08:51.150
<v Speaker 2>She took that check down mountain her,</v>

7364
03:08:51.490 --> 03:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>she soccer.</v>

7365
03:08:53.730 --> 03:08:54.361
<v Speaker 2>It was like that.</v>

7366
03:08:54.361 --> 03:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>It was like a hoist versus uh,</v>

7367
03:08:56.580 --> 03:08:57.300
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

7368
03:08:57.300 --> 03:09:00.210
<v Speaker 2>that Dutch kickboxer with the g pants,</v>

7369
03:09:00.300 --> 03:09:01.380
<v Speaker 2>which she got a crap.</v>

7370
03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:05.060
<v Speaker 2>But her striking was the impressive thing cause she landed a bunch overhand</v>

7371
03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:06.030
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

7372
03:09:06.030 --> 03:09:06.863
<v Speaker 2>She does.</v>

7373
03:09:07.260 --> 03:09:08.130
<v Speaker 2>She has big,</v>

7374
03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:10.800
<v Speaker 2>she's not afraid to throw down Mackenzie fan man.</v>

7375
03:09:10.970 --> 03:09:12.300
<v Speaker 2>She's got giant balls.</v>

7376
03:09:12.301 --> 03:09:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Her ground game is so high.</v>

7377
03:09:14.340 --> 03:09:15.630
<v Speaker 2>She went scrape through that.</v>

7378
03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:17.160
<v Speaker 2>It looked like that chick never trained.</v>

7379
03:09:17.250 --> 03:09:17.670
<v Speaker 2>She looked,</v>

7380
03:09:17.670 --> 03:09:19.410
<v Speaker 2>she looked too thick though that fight.</v>

7381
03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:20.280
<v Speaker 2>She didn't like it.</v>

7382
03:09:21.270 --> 03:09:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I like sick.</v>

7383
03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:22.711
<v Speaker 2>But then there's like,</v>

7384
03:09:22.711 --> 03:09:23.191
<v Speaker 2>damn girl,</v>

7385
03:09:23.191 --> 03:09:23.640
<v Speaker 2>you need to,</v>

7386
03:09:23.640 --> 03:09:24.870
<v Speaker 2>we need a little pride here.</v>

7387
03:09:24.960 --> 03:09:26.940
<v Speaker 2>She said to the way she's dressed,</v>

7388
03:09:27.070 --> 03:09:29.360
<v Speaker 2>if she was in a miniskirt with a halter top,</v>

7389
03:09:29.370 --> 03:09:30.870
<v Speaker 2>don't get a twist and I'm on board,</v>

7390
03:09:30.871 --> 03:09:31.201
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

7391
03:09:31.201 --> 03:09:31.650
<v Speaker 2>She went,</v>

7392
03:09:31.650 --> 03:09:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that like the love handles are spilling over the top and like</v>

7393
03:09:34.411 --> 03:09:34.711
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

7394
03:09:34.711 --> 03:09:37.140
<v Speaker 2>now it gets a little thick sometimes.</v>

7395
03:09:37.141 --> 03:09:37.974
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

7396
03:09:38.250 --> 03:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at it,</v>

7397
03:09:39.151 --> 03:09:40.610
<v Speaker 2>but it just looks better.</v>

7398
03:09:41.220 --> 03:09:43.350
<v Speaker 2>It's all depends on how much ask goes with the package.</v>

7399
03:09:43.860 --> 03:09:44.693
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

7400
03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:45.150
<v Speaker 2>The front,</v>

7401
03:09:45.150 --> 03:09:46.350
<v Speaker 2>the front to back ratio.</v>

7402
03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:47.543
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>

7403
03:09:47.970 --> 03:09:48.151
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

7404
03:09:48.151 --> 03:09:48.984
<v Speaker 2>this is why,</v>

7405
03:09:49.170 --> 03:09:53.070
<v Speaker 2>this is why we can't be on ESPN or Fox fire me.</v>

7406
03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:54.033
<v Speaker 2>Good</v>

7407
03:09:54.290 --> 03:09:54.841
<v Speaker 1>fire me.</v>

7408
03:09:54.841 --> 03:09:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I dare you not even saying that.</v>

7409
03:09:56.861 --> 03:09:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Just make me just do the paper views.</v>

7410
03:09:58.841 --> 03:09:59.674
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine with that.</v>

7411
03:09:59.860 --> 03:10:00.440
<v Speaker 1>That's all you doing,</v>

7412
03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

7413
03:10:00.700 --> 03:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh well you,</v>

7414
03:10:01.170 --> 03:10:01.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7415
03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I do the previews to the prelims.</v>

7416
03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

7417
03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:09.670
<v Speaker 1>well I want to have Latino cause well I guess it would just the contract comes</v>

7418
03:10:09.671 --> 03:10:11.770
<v Speaker 1>over like does everyone like the UFC tonight,</v>

7419
03:10:11.771 --> 03:10:11.951
<v Speaker 1>crew,</v>

7420
03:10:11.951 --> 03:10:14.220
<v Speaker 1>everyone's I've seen.</v>

7421
03:10:14.230 --> 03:10:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I was never working for Fox.</v>

7422
03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do the fire.</v>

7423
03:10:16.540 --> 03:10:17.350
<v Speaker 1>It was one of my,</v>

7424
03:10:17.350 --> 03:10:18.190
<v Speaker 1>one of these days,</v>

7425
03:10:19.210 --> 03:10:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but one of the stipulations of my newer contract,</v>

7426
03:10:21.241 --> 03:10:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

7427
03:10:21.380 --> 03:10:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do the Fox events anymore.</v>

7428
03:10:22.900 --> 03:10:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And that deals through when you don't have to be done.</v>

7429
03:10:25.810 --> 03:10:26.351
<v Speaker 1>It's already done.</v>

7430
03:10:26.351 --> 03:10:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a bit like this year.</v>

7431
03:10:27.911 --> 03:10:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't do any of the Fox events.</v>

7432
03:10:29.381 --> 03:10:31.640
<v Speaker 1>If you notice like when there are big fights on [inaudible].</v>

7433
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't do any of them.</v>

7434
03:10:33.010 --> 03:10:33.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even done.</v>

7435
03:10:33.531 --> 03:10:34.150
<v Speaker 1>The big ones.</v>

7436
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

7437
03:10:34.540 --> 03:10:37.450
<v Speaker 1>None of them zero paper if he's still doing it right.</v>

7438
03:10:37.460 --> 03:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to do anymore?</v>

7439
03:10:38.410 --> 03:10:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Too much work?</v>

7440
03:10:39.100 --> 03:10:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Too much work did,</v>

7441
03:10:41.480 --> 03:10:43.960
<v Speaker 1>this seems is not a big deal because they have the suit there for me,</v>

7442
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

7443
03:10:44.690 --> 03:10:48.190
<v Speaker 1>my issue was a fox actually paid me less money,</v>

7444
03:10:48.520 --> 03:10:50.180
<v Speaker 1>less money to do the fence on Fox,</v>

7445
03:10:50.181 --> 03:10:50.651
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

7446
03:10:50.651 --> 03:10:51.880
<v Speaker 1>you guys are never paying you.</v>

7447
03:10:52.180 --> 03:10:52.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7448
03:10:52.421 --> 03:10:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought the UFC pagan.</v>

7449
03:10:53.770 --> 03:10:53.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7450
03:10:53.951 --> 03:10:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I get to Fox event.</v>

7451
03:10:54.911 --> 03:10:55.744
<v Speaker 1>It's a Fox event.</v>

7452
03:10:56.200 --> 03:10:56.741
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

7453
03:10:56.741 --> 03:10:57.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7454
03:10:57.460 --> 03:10:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

7455
03:10:58.120 --> 03:10:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but it was also,</v>

7456
03:10:59.860 --> 03:11:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like when I first started doing it for them,</v>

7457
03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:06.040
<v Speaker 1>they got in my ear like the very first events for Fox.</v>

7458
03:11:06.370 --> 03:11:07.780
<v Speaker 1>They were like telling me what to do.</v>

7459
03:11:07.960 --> 03:11:10.600
<v Speaker 1>They were like telling me to take it down a notch,</v>

7460
03:11:10.601 --> 03:11:12.280
<v Speaker 1>don't be so amped up about that.</v>

7461
03:11:12.281 --> 03:11:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

7462
03:11:13.240 --> 03:11:13.871
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

7463
03:11:13.871 --> 03:11:14.260
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

7464
03:11:14.260 --> 03:11:15.093
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing here?</v>

7465
03:11:15.100 --> 03:11:15.371
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

7466
03:11:15.371 --> 03:11:16.060
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

7467
03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I do commentary.</v>

7468
03:11:17.230 --> 03:11:17.801
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do.</v>

7469
03:11:17.801 --> 03:11:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it forever.</v>

7470
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:19.870
<v Speaker 1>This is how I do it.</v>

7471
03:11:19.900 --> 03:11:21.850
<v Speaker 1>If you think you can change me,</v>

7472
03:11:22.090 --> 03:11:23.350
<v Speaker 1>then we're not going to work together.</v>

7473
03:11:23.410 --> 03:11:23.731
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

7474
03:11:23.731 --> 03:11:25.150
<v Speaker 1>we had what a real problem.</v>

7475
03:11:25.180 --> 03:11:25.930
<v Speaker 1>And that was a flop.</v>

7476
03:11:25.930 --> 03:11:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Seduction,</v>

7477
03:11:26.500 --> 03:11:27.160
<v Speaker 1>right Joe?</v>

7478
03:11:27.160 --> 03:11:27.451
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7479
03:11:27.451 --> 03:11:28.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a fox productions.</v>

7480
03:11:28.370 --> 03:11:32.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the junior dos Santos Cain Velasquez upon.</v>

7481
03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:33.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7482
03:11:33.011 --> 03:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I believe that was the first one.</v>

7483
03:11:34.220 --> 03:11:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7484
03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:35.313
<v Speaker 1>But it's just,</v>

7485
03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't,</v>

7486
03:11:36.910 --> 03:11:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>

7487
03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:39.280
<v Speaker 1>They want a sports guy.</v>

7488
03:11:39.310 --> 03:11:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

7489
03:11:39.730 --> 03:11:40.120

03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:41.890
<v Speaker 1>MMA is what it is.</v>

7491
03:11:41.950 --> 03:11:42.221
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

7492
03:11:42.221 --> 03:11:43.054
<v Speaker 1>it's fighting.</v>

7493
03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:47.680
<v Speaker 1>It is a very specific kind of sport and I've been doing it the way I do it</v>

7494
03:11:47.681 --> 03:11:47.921
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

7495
03:11:47.921 --> 03:11:49.120
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like the way I do it,</v>

7496
03:11:49.121 --> 03:11:49.661
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

7497
03:11:49.661 --> 03:11:50.494
<v Speaker 1>Don't hire me,</v>

7498
03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but don't try to get me to become some sports guy.</v>

7499
03:11:53.681 --> 03:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in that at all.</v>

7500
03:11:55.150 --> 03:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>When I commentated for pride,</v>

7501
03:11:56.381 --> 03:11:56.801
<v Speaker 1>they told me,</v>

7502
03:11:56.801 --> 03:11:57.101
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

7503
03:11:57.101 --> 03:11:57.551
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

7504
03:11:57.551 --> 03:11:58.384
<v Speaker 1>Too much.</v>

7505
03:11:59.450 --> 03:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>No say Nice.</v>

7506
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

7507
03:12:01.090 --> 03:12:01.923
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7508
03:12:01.970 --> 03:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't even speak English.</v>

7509
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.891
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

7510
03:12:05.891 --> 03:12:06.724
<v Speaker 1>Nice Shot,</v>

7511
03:12:06.940 --> 03:12:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Nice Jab.</v>

7512
03:12:07.870 --> 03:12:08.531
<v Speaker 1>To their credit,</v>

7513
03:12:08.531 --> 03:12:09.011
<v Speaker 1>they stopped.</v>

7514
03:12:09.011 --> 03:12:11.200
<v Speaker 1>They stopped doing it after the first event.</v>

7515
03:12:11.201 --> 03:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>When I voiced my displeasure,</v>

7516
03:12:13.180 --> 03:12:15.650
<v Speaker 1>I just let them know like really clearly this isn't,</v>

7517
03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to doing this.</v>

7518
03:12:16.930 --> 03:12:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to change how I do it to make you do this if I'm helping you.</v>

7519
03:12:20.990 --> 03:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not even that.</v>

7520
03:12:22.121 --> 03:12:24.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just like if you don't like the way I do it,</v>

7521
03:12:24.490 --> 03:12:29.440
<v Speaker 1>this is not an option for you to direct me and tell me to do it the way you like</v>

7522
03:12:29.441 --> 03:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>it because you think that that's better.</v>

7523
03:12:31.540 --> 03:12:34.150
<v Speaker 1>This is a personal choice by one or two.</v>

7524
03:12:34.151 --> 03:12:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Whoever the fuck the people were that were producers or executives,</v>

7525
03:12:37.210 --> 03:12:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with them and I'm not doing it that way.</v>

7526
03:12:40.390 --> 03:12:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Like this is just how it,</v>

7527
03:12:42.030 --> 03:12:43.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like real simple.</v>

7528
03:12:43.121 --> 03:12:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Like if you bought a Ferrari and it had a certain sound to it,</v>

7529
03:12:46.511 --> 03:12:46.751
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

7530
03:12:46.751 --> 03:12:46.991
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

7531
03:12:46.991 --> 03:12:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this sound.</v>

7532
03:12:48.101 --> 03:12:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Can you guys go back to the factory and fix these mufflers?</v>

7533
03:12:51.261 --> 03:12:51.860
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

7534
03:12:51.860 --> 03:12:52.040
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

7535
03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:52.200
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

7536
03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:53.033
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

7537
03:12:53.180 --> 03:12:54.750
<v Speaker 2>this is what a Ferrari is like.</v>

7538
03:12:54.770 --> 03:12:56.870
<v Speaker 2>This is you don't like it then you like Ferrari's.</v>

7539
03:12:56.900 --> 03:12:57.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7540
03:12:57.050 --> 03:12:57.111
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7541
03:12:57.111 --> 03:12:57.410
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

7542
03:12:57.410 --> 03:12:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I like it for a ride,</v>

7543
03:12:58.251 --> 03:13:00.740
<v Speaker 2>but I want it to sound like a Corolla doesn't work.</v>

7544
03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:01.131
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>

7545
03:13:01.131 --> 03:13:01.780
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7546
03:13:01.780 --> 03:13:02.010
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7547
03:13:02.010 --> 03:13:04.010
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably a bad analogy.</v>

7548
03:13:04.011 --> 03:13:06.230
<v Speaker 2>But the idea behind it you get,</v>

7549
03:13:06.260 --> 03:13:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

7550
03:13:07.010 --> 03:13:07.830
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do.</v>

7551
03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Like I get amped up if some shit is going down,</v>

7552
03:13:10.970 --> 03:13:13.370
<v Speaker 2>these guys were throwing blows and I'm screaming.</v>

7553
03:13:13.460 --> 03:13:16.340
<v Speaker 2>It's because I feel that with some would call it passion.</v>

7554
03:13:16.370 --> 03:13:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7555
03:13:16.590 --> 03:13:17.121
<v Speaker 2>it's bullets.</v>

7556
03:13:17.121 --> 03:13:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Legitimate Passion.</v>

7557
03:13:18.101 --> 03:13:18.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

7558
03:13:18.650 --> 03:13:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not faking it,</v>

7559
03:13:19.610 --> 03:13:21.050
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't want that.</v>

7560
03:13:22.310 --> 03:13:23.540
<v Speaker 2>But they let it go after awhile,</v>

7561
03:13:23.570 --> 03:13:26.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like they fought for me when I quit either.</v>

7562
03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:27.980
<v Speaker 2>How long has the Reebok deal for?</v>

7563
03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:29.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

7564
03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:30.441
<v Speaker 2>three years.</v>

7565
03:13:30.441 --> 03:13:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I think three years.</v>

7566
03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Two to three years.</v>

7567
03:13:32.660 --> 03:13:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it worked out for Reebok,</v>

7568
03:13:35.181 --> 03:13:36.014
<v Speaker 2>like his Reebok.</v>

7569
03:13:36.110 --> 03:13:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Reebok exploding now because of this.</v>

7570
03:13:38.780 --> 03:13:39.141
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7571
03:13:39.141 --> 03:13:39.851
<v Speaker 2>Adidas zones,</v>

7572
03:13:39.851 --> 03:13:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Reebok to Adidas is killing it,</v>

7573
03:13:41.511 --> 03:13:41.900
<v Speaker 2>but I dunno,</v>

7574
03:13:41.900 --> 03:13:43.100
<v Speaker 2>free box exploding.</v>

7575
03:13:43.101 --> 03:13:43.280
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

7576
03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:44.091
<v Speaker 2>they're the niche,</v>

7577
03:13:44.091 --> 03:13:44.361
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7578
03:13:44.361 --> 03:13:45.081
<v Speaker 2>The MMA,</v>

7579
03:13:45.081 --> 03:13:46.640
<v Speaker 2>the in with crossfit.</v>

7580
03:13:46.820 --> 03:13:50.030
<v Speaker 2>So they're in that world until Reebok's defense.</v>

7581
03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:50.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7582
03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:50.960
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

7583
03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:51.860
<v Speaker 2>they made the offer,</v>

7584
03:13:51.890 --> 03:13:52.730
<v Speaker 2>they don't know.</v>

7585
03:13:52.760 --> 03:13:54.380
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what the deal was.</v>

7586
03:13:54.381 --> 03:13:55.940
<v Speaker 2>They know they are screwing over fighters.</v>

7587
03:13:55.941 --> 03:13:57.380
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a UFC thing.</v>

7588
03:13:57.750 --> 03:13:59.320
<v Speaker 2>It was not Reebok Reebok,</v>

7589
03:13:59.321 --> 03:14:00.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like Whoa,</v>

7590
03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:00.890
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck.</v>

7591
03:14:00.890 --> 03:14:04.610
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like even the UFC wasn't aware of how much fight is for actually</v>

7592
03:14:04.611 --> 03:14:06.560
<v Speaker 2>making off of sponsorships.</v>

7593
03:14:06.980 --> 03:14:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean you and I know that there was some debate as to whether or not,</v>

7594
03:14:10.930 --> 03:14:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just,</v>

7595
03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:16.280
<v Speaker 2>they had a distorted perception of how much some fighters were making and they</v>

7596
03:14:16.281 --> 03:14:17.081
<v Speaker 2>just think they killed,</v>

7597
03:14:17.081 --> 03:14:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they talked to maybe the top 10 guys and we're like,</v>

7598
03:14:20.181 --> 03:14:20.780
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

7599
03:14:20.780 --> 03:14:21.710
<v Speaker 2>we're going pay you this.</v>

7600
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:23.030
<v Speaker 2>We will take care of you in this way.</v>

7601
03:14:23.031 --> 03:14:25.420
<v Speaker 2>And then the rest of the guys get on board and they,</v>

7602
03:14:25.430 --> 03:14:26.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7603
03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:26.751
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

7604
03:14:26.751 --> 03:14:27.440
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

7605
03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I get it man,</v>

7606
03:14:28.341 --> 03:14:28.910
<v Speaker 2>if I'm Dana,</v>

7607
03:14:28.910 --> 03:14:33.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making decisions based off those 10 to 15 top guys.</v>

7608
03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:33.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll make my,</v>

7609
03:14:33.700 --> 03:14:33.850
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

7610
03:14:33.850 --> 03:14:36.560
<v Speaker 2>my decisions that's going to affect my bottom line.</v>

7611
03:14:36.770 --> 03:14:38.030
<v Speaker 2>And one was just what they did.</v>

7612
03:14:38.031 --> 03:14:43.031
<v Speaker 2>One judge and the pain fight gave every round and Jason Knight One judge did</v>

7613
03:14:43.761 --> 03:14:44.541
<v Speaker 2>look at it like you,</v>

7614
03:14:44.541 --> 03:14:46.820
<v Speaker 2>like he was on his back and he didn't get taken down,</v>

7615
03:14:47.120 --> 03:14:48.890
<v Speaker 2>but he was the one that was aggressive on the ground.</v>

7616
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:49.731
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

7617
03:14:49.731 --> 03:14:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you just take it twice down and have one thing you do and then be</v>

7618
03:14:53.801 --> 03:14:54.634
<v Speaker 2>in control.</v>

7619
03:14:54.890 --> 03:14:56.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just been educated.</v>

7620
03:14:56.660 --> 03:14:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7621
03:14:57.200 --> 03:14:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I could get out of here soon.</v>

7622
03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Boy Sets wrap her up.</v>

7623
03:15:00.290 --> 03:15:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

7624
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo.</v>

7625
03:15:01.581 --> 03:15:06.581
<v Speaker 2>Tell everybody you're a tinfoil hat comedy at Cobb's Friday this Friday at</v>
