<v Speaker 1>I think it's fantastic and I'm a big fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>of yoga and what you've done for not</v>

18
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>just what you've done is made yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>available to people that thought that</v>

19
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>yoga was for chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and I,</v>

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you say that because how it</v>

21
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was yoga for regular.</v>

22
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It was regular people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular guys made it for guys.</v>

23
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>People think of yoga as being something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like you have to be into,</v>

24
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be all day and you hear Dallas</v>

29
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is for,</v>

30
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>for something that I think is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important for body maintenance and for</v>

31
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>keeping your spine healthy and mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that a lot of</v>

32
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>us ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially big guys who liked to lift</v>

33
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>weights or do a lot of crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>doing yoga the first 42 years of my</v>

36
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't start wrestling.</v>

37
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I was 35 really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

38
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>and my career didn't take off.</v>

39
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>The was Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old are you now?</v>

40
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Sixty two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

41
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>If you folks saw what he did with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>warmup,</v>

42
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>no warm up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Dover,</v>

43
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>grab your ankles fully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully flattened your body out.</v>

44
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Press your body up against your thighs</v>
<v Speaker 1>with no warmup.</v>

45
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Then he picks his knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ankle up and fully extends his leg</v>

46
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>over his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>

47
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>That is incredibly impressive for a 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old person.</v>

48
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>It's all about staying ahead of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it's all about owning it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back to just my career.</v>

50
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean my crew took off in [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>96,</v>

51
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>which was I was 40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>97 and 98 and I was on top of the world</v>

52
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.300
<v Speaker 1>wrestling 270 days a year every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I did the tonight show,</v>

53
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood squares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie called the first daughter was my</v>

54
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>first movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

55
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>So I mean I was probably working 320</v>
<v Speaker 1>days a year and the wear and tear on</v>

56
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>your body after awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like boom,</v>

57
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I took a power slam from Laura power</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb from Kevin Nash.</v>

58
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Kevin's legit six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10</v>

59
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>long way down and it wasn't that bump</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blew my back out.</v>

60
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.910
<v Speaker 2>It was all of it and being almost 43</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old and when I ruptured my l four</v>

61
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>and l five and we have this amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>vertebrae,</v>

62
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 2>that is what allows us to do all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit that we do but really allows</v>

63
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 2>us is those shock absorbers are</v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbers those discs in between the</v>

64
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 2>vertebrae.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll think of a jelly donut and slap</v>

65
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 2>that Jelly donut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now there's nothing there.</v>

66
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>So I have no desks in between my l four</v>
<v Speaker 2>or l five.</v>

67
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I was told by three different spine</v>
<v Speaker 2>specialists.</v>

68
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to wrestle again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just signed a multimillion dollar</v>

69
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>three year deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy who wouldn't be caught dead</v>

70
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 2>doing yoga would do anything to get back</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a ring.</v>

71
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.841
<v Speaker 2>And I was married at the time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she kind of bullied me into it and once</v>

72
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I started doing a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

73
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:54.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start filled difference and I thought</v>

74
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 2>it'd thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

75
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 2>now did you talk to any doctors that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to replace your discs,</v>

76
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>are fused your disks to one of the fuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one didn't.</v>

77
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.760
<v Speaker 2>And his thing was this a 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the beginning of those spacers that</v>

78
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 2>they have now don't have anything discs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have any of that.</v>

79
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>And his whole thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we do fuse you and you go back,</v>

80
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 2>you will be crippled because you won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>recover from that.</v>

81
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do yoga.</v>

82
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 2>And I started doing Bryan kest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever taken more Brian Class</v>

83
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 2>classes are in la?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

84
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 2>he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went to yoga as a power yoga.</v>

85
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy who kind of put power yoga</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the map and he made me feel like,</v>

86
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude's cool.</v>

87
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then today's a buddy of mine,</v>

88
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:40.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

89
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 2>but at the time I was just doing as vhs</v>
<v Speaker 2>tapes,</v>

90
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 2>but for what I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't getting me everything.</v>

91
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 2>So what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've rehabbed both shoulder surgeries,</v>

92
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.250
<v Speaker 2>both knee surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm Kinda like God given gifts of</v>

93
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to heal myself.</v>

94
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm the first guy in professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling to ever ice isis body by</v>

95
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 2>almost a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years before they would start</v>

96
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean like ice baths?</v>

97
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Like your shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

98
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>take it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got that.</v>

99
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>How'd you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

100
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just different reading on different know</v>

101
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 2>people had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they healed themselves and what</v>

102
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 2>people were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I've found that a lot of people</v>

103
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 2>don't want to put the extra work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can be the hardest workers ever,</v>

104
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>but they won't go that extra mile just</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go get a bag of ice,</v>

105
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 2>fill it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on your knees,</v>

106
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>put an ace bandage around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go wherever you want.</v>

107
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Although it's also like part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture of tough guys.</v>

108
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.570
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

109
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Just go get a beer and have some food.</v>

110
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just exhausted.</v>

111
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.890
<v Speaker 2>There's a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.590
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the same type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

113
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 2>It's so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can work 300 days a year.</v>

114
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 2>It was also the same type of guy that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go out and just deal with it.</v>

115
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And Steve Means Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I broke in,</v>

116
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I was like 35 and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 26 and Austin was always way ahead</v>

117
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 2>of the curve as far as talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he wouldn't know.</v>

118
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:08.091
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

119
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:08.581
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

120
00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And cared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leah got those ice bags.</v>

121
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 2>So back then we were drinking beers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that it's right to do,</v>

122
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 2>but back then we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would put the beers on my ice</v>

123
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 2>bags in between my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

124
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 2>my ace bandage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just keep us beers cold.</v>

125
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.470
<v Speaker 2>A true story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's her story.</v>

126
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is I started to mix the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rehabilitation techniques with the yoga</v>

128
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I threw an old school calisthenics,</v>

129
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 2>pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squats,</v>

130
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 2>crunches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did them with the slow burn</v>

131
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 2>movement because I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the beginning I had to do them on</v>

132
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 2>my knees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say slow burn movement,</v>

133
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 2>this is what you were just shown me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we started the podcast,</v>

134
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 2>a lot of dynamic tension exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

135
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.110
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it,</v>

136
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Lee was into exactly what a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

137
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Go look at Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he ever have an ounce of fat on him?</v>

138
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.860
<v Speaker 2>The guy was shredded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

139
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 2>that whole time under tension thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something I call dynamic resistance.</v>

140
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I hated that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like for the pushups,</v>

141
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would lower for three,</v>

142
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.280
<v Speaker 2>hold three inches off the ground for</v>
<v Speaker 2>three charter ranga,</v>

143
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>come up for three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower for three,</v>

144
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 2>hold for three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'd go into Cobra in downdog and in</v>

145
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 2>the beginning I had to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on my knees,</v>

146
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 2>but then I built that strength to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>off my knees.</v>

147
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 2>And then three second pushups became</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

148
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 2>five became 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 became sets of 10.</v>

149
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 2>If you go to my DDP Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>

150
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a video up there of me doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my 62nd birthday.</v>

151
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:43.961
<v Speaker 2>Well actually two days after 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ten second pushups at 62.</v>

152
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 2>So my core strength is at a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

153
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't lift weights anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really for 10 years because I</v>

154
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>really don't need it and I don't need</v>
<v Speaker 2>the size.</v>

155
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I like being like 2:30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is what today is called</v>

156
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.770
<v Speaker 2>unbranding DDP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

157
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I want people to stop calling</v>

158
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just yoga because it's so different now.</v>

159
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 2>You've done a lot of yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

160
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 2>What you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just took you through in that minute</v>

161
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 2>and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that like anything you've ever done</v>

162
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 2>in a yoga studio now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very different.</v>

163
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 2>You what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dynamic tension thing definitely</v>

164
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 2>adds another element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I have fun with it,</v>

165
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:20.834
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>

166
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>I do shit like when you take your</v>
<v Speaker 2>endorse a lunge and you throw your arms</v>

167
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:27.370
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go superstar,</v>

168
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're,</v>

169
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.350
<v Speaker 2>when we're in a like a lunch or folding</v>
<v Speaker 2>folding were to explode into touchdown.</v>

170
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 2>I'd say throw a little rick flare on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of that.</v>

171
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 2>And is everybody explodes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just having people having fun.</v>

172
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

173
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big event.</v>

174
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.910
<v Speaker 2>That was this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called all in and it's a um,</v>

175
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.710
<v Speaker 2>cody Rhodes who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

176
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 2>the American dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dusty Rhodes son,</v>

177
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>he's been in independent wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was at the show,</v>

178
00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 2>wwe for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And bottom line is he went away.</v>

179
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>They left their guaranteed money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be like a half a million bucks,</v>

180
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 2>left it and went to follow the dream</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he knew he was a main event guy</v>

181
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 2>and him in these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the young bucks they sold out.</v>

182
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.970
<v Speaker 2>This arena was 10,426 people in 29</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and 36 seconds to counted the</v>

183
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 2>cow the second that'll they did because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really big deal when you forget.</v>

184
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 2>So out when you're an independent group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not the wwe now.</v>

185
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane how many different groups</v>

186
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 2>are there now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Nwa was wwe,</v>

187
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Roy h,</v>

188
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.770
<v Speaker 2>there's the row as my buddy booker t</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls had down there in Houston and was</v>

189
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.613
<v Speaker 2>with billy.</v>

190
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Billy Corgan owns right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what the smell.</v>

191
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the batch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cody was going for the Nwa championship</v>

192
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.300
<v Speaker 2>against Nick who was just one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

193
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 2>studs up our business and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>

194
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 2>that a hell of a match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

195
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Billy owns that title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now think about this Vince Mcmahon,</v>

196
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.920
<v Speaker 2>just just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say he was paid one point $2</v>

197
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 2>billion by Fox for the programming for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>live show on Friday nights.</v>

198
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what the deal is at six</v>
<v Speaker 2>years or eight years,</v>

199
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:20.691
<v Speaker 2>but one point 2 billion and then I heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another multibillion dollar</v>

200
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 2>contract being out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comcast or something.</v>

201
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:28.791
<v Speaker 2>So that's like nfl stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when that kind of attention comes to</v>

202
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:33.030
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people are going to be like,</v>

203
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get involved in that.</v>

204
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 2>And plus Vince really has taken it</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream and a different level.</v>

205
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Like back when we were killing it in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>

206
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean we had the highest rated show on</v>
<v Speaker 2>cable television,</v>

207
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 2>whether it was wcw or wwe APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every week we are one,</v>

208
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 2>two and three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes one,</v>

209
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.141
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three and four.</v>

210
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Top four shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But our dollars that we could get for</v>

211
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 2>the advertising was nothing like they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting today because they made it kid</v>

212
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.890
<v Speaker 2>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They changed that.</v>

213
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.540
<v Speaker 2>And it was brilliant by Vince,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>

215
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 2>it changed format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But today it's about to go through</v>

216
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 2>another boom and this whole independent</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that cody and these young bucks</v>

<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing all over the</v>

00:11:39.161 --> 00:11:41.770
<v Speaker 2>He left the guy smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's right.</v>

232
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.550
<v Speaker 2>It's even more crazy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

233
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.590
<v Speaker 2>now it's legal right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pot's legal and now the Numb,</v>

234
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.470
<v Speaker 2>the level that you can get tested for is</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much lower than anything that he got.</v>

235
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he enjoys it.</v>

236
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's missing fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

237
00:11:56.411 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 2>fighting is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that pro wrestling is probably</v>

238
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 2>harder on your body doing those 300 days</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

239
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything like it</v>

240
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 2>in all of entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

241
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy to think that you are getting</v>

242
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 2>body slammed and thrown into the ropes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forearm slammed and all that shit's</v>

243
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>going on 300 days a year.</v>

244
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.730
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really.</v>

245
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just really should be a way where you</v>

246
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:24.910
<v Speaker 2>could take some time off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

247
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.990
<v Speaker 2>When I was on Hollywood squares one time</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

248
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.310
<v Speaker 2>So once your season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when are you?</v>

249
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Nothing about wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said Hilarious when I'm hurt,</v>

250
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

251
00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:36.040
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line not hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>injured,</v>

252
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 2>injured ligaments like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

253
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:40.991
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

254
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:44.910
<v Speaker 2>You guys compete or perform hurt on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>

255
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so did the guys in the NFL,</v>

256
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.530
<v Speaker 2>so the guys in the UFC as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

257
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I think with Matt Riddle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's got a great personality</v>

258
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to cut any weight</v>

259
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 2>anymore and now he's gigantic and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun guy.</v>

260
00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:59.760
<v Speaker 2>I think wwe is perfect for someone like</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

261
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 2>I was down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I train a lot of the guys down to neck,</v>

262
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.190
<v Speaker 2>it's called nxt next and that's a.</v>

263
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.860
<v Speaker 2>These kids are unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so talented,</v>

264
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:12.450
<v Speaker 2>but I bring my ddpy program down to them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all on my hands.</v>

265
00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So you're starting that early with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

266
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>So they plus I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:17.710
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 62,</v>

268
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 2>their 24 to 28,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

269
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:24.470
<v Speaker 2>so they grew up watching me so it's much</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier for,</v>

270
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 2>for me to get them to pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is look at Chris Jericho,</v>

271
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:32.500
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the top stars in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he is not with wwe right now.</v>

272
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:32.970
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 2>he comes and goes and he was at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>show all in.</v>

274
00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:39.490
<v Speaker 2>He did a run in a surprise thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blew the roof off.</v>

275
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be 48 in November.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrestles like he's 28.</v>

276
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.410
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing my program since he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing I did when he blew his</v>

277
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:50.470
<v Speaker 2>back out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And three Dr said he was not going to</v>

278
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 2>rustle anymore.</v>

279
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Five weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 percent pain free,</v>

280
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 2>three months later he headlined</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrestlemania against Punk.</v>

281
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 2>He talks about it all the time now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has your back today,</v>

282
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:04.600
<v Speaker 2>those same disks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't do it,</v>

283
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.630
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like brushing your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta brush your teeth.</v>

284
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to do it every single day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but pretty much,</v>

285
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I wake up I might first 10</v>

286
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:16.390
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why call it wake up man,</v>

287
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I feel I call it oil for the tin man and</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

288
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.220
<v Speaker 2>And the real proof of this for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm the first transformation.</v>

289
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is they said my career</v>
<v Speaker 2>was over when I was 42.</v>

290
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I started doing what now is called DDP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why three months,</v>

291
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:35.400
<v Speaker 2>less than three months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joy.</v>

292
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.800
<v Speaker 2>I was back in the ring at 42.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said my career's over 43 on the</v>

293
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 2>world champ.</v>

294
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's like getting our ads are</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oscar.</v>

295
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're the guy,</v>

296
00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:47.390
<v Speaker 2>you deserve this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I yield the most eyes on you,</v>

297
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 2>you know I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a match with Hogan flair in</v>

298
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.090
<v Speaker 2>staying three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arguably.</v>

299
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he'll eat in the top five biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>names ever.</v>

300
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.730
<v Speaker 2>And I walk out that world champion Ric</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flair,</v>

301
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 2>took the diamond cutter in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Hogan.</v>

302
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Hogan gave me such a hug afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

303
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 2>this is what this business supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

304
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.100
<v Speaker 2>That someone like you who known would</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe would ever be anyone could work</v>

305
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 2>so hard that they would become the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>champ.</v>

306
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:20.410
<v Speaker 2>When I got my hall of fame ring a 2017</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside ahead.</v>

307
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Inscribed in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work ethic equals dreams.</v>

308
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Explanation Point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>DDP.</v>

309
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

310
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't tell you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You understand.</v>

311
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Putting the work in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting the work in is everything.</v>

312
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Now you're back to date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever get an Mri on it?</v>

313
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did all that well,</v>

314
00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 2>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now no know I don't have any.</v>

315
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I don't do it,</v>

316
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:43.460
<v Speaker 2>if I'm on too many planes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trains and automobiles,</v>

317
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm going to get released.</v>

318
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 2>But I know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to say to my wife and I swear to</v>

319
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.140
<v Speaker 2>God because every morning I do roll out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bed.</v>

320
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Some nights you'd feel like you get hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a truck.</v>

321
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.160
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleeping is the worst thing for me</v>

322
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 2>because I get in those positions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in and when I wake up I'm like,</v>

323
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as I do within eight</v>

324
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a completely different</v>

325
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.620
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your disk though was completely gone?</v>

326
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gone.</v>

327
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.470
<v Speaker 2>There was literally bone on bone.</v>

328
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 2>And is it still like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

329
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 2>but this is something I will try and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell Joe,</v>

330
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Speaker 2>which makes what I'm doing different</v>
<v Speaker 2>than regular yoga,</v>

331
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 2>not just the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say most Yogis are very,</v>

332
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:26.471
<v Speaker 2>not mistake ddpy way more t and a and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>met today the beginning,</v>

333
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.260
<v Speaker 2>but what I mean today is tone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude because it's an attitude.</v>

334
00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:34.390
<v Speaker 2>And so he switched it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept saying it worked,</v>

335
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 2>it worked like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

336
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it for me.</v>

338
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.090
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

339
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 2>this repetition is the mother of</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning where you do something the more</v>

340
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Speaker 2>you own it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on that I want to,</v>

341
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you something that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought with me because I've been</v>

342
00:16:48.921 --> 00:16:52.050
<v Speaker 2>waiting for your show to release this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

343
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I've got a new book coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

344
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.840
<v Speaker 2>and no one seemed to cover yet and it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>taught here at Premiere Premiere and I'm</v>

384
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Somebody contacted me about him as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone from his organization contacted</v>

385
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

386
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

387
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I saw uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a program on television was</v>

388
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 1>detailing you helping him get cleaned</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you getting him involved in Yoga.</v>

389
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome because you're.</v>

390
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.050
<v Speaker 1>You're exposing something that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

391
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It just just be something that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

392
00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I just really think that all athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all people.</v>

393
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I think yoga is a life staple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't know.</v>

394
00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I do do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I got through that I got through</v>

395
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 1>with wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have easily stepped into that</v>

396
00:19:23.431 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 1>yoga community and what the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>namaste a route,</v>

397
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's not who I am and I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the yoga people like they get it.</v>

398
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 1>They don't need me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who need me is all those</v>

399
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 1>people that bitterly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have nobody.</v>

400
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.400
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the disabled veteran that I</v>

404

<v Speaker 1>everybody that I know that it's had no</v>

<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>

442
00:21:38.821 --> 00:21:43.650
<v Speaker 3>for 15 years doctors told me I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>never walk unassisted again.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Too many jumps took its toll on his</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

448

<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than anything,</v>

538
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.710
<v Speaker 2>change your mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what positive.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bend over enough to do it and so she</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts them all together.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bathroom with his canes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>In the deep sand with my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as his mentor.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He helped people with cancer and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of shit.</v>

585
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.060
<v Speaker 2>This guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a different level of lip</v>

586

<v Speaker 2>great grandparents used to call it</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking food.</v>

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Like is everything go to Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to France.</v>

597
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's the way it's supposed to be.</v>

598
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:02.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at just the,</v>

599
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.850
<v Speaker 2>the obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease,</v>

600
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes,</v>

601
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 2>autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how is it through the roof?</v>

602
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.620
<v Speaker 2>How are there 400 pound guys everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 years ago that didn't happen,</v>

603
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:18.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

604
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 2>and then they change everything as far</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm concerned.</v>

605
00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:23.320
<v Speaker 2>There's three reasons why it could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in because I don't know,</v>

606
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking wrestler.</v>

607
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:30.510
<v Speaker 2>But I know when I get people to eat what</v>
<v Speaker 2>God created and stuff that's not</v>

608
00:30:30.671 --> 00:30:35.080
<v Speaker 2>genetically modified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've found that they get out of pain and</v>

609
00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 2>that's what we did with Jake and Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

610
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Razor Ramon also moved into my house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then when you get a chance to watch</v>

611
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.510
<v Speaker 2>before you have Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

612
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:42.700
<v Speaker 2>definitely watch a resurrection.</v>

613
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Jake the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I can set you up with that too.</v>

614
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

615
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 2>jake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got them eating real food and Scott</v>

616
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.820
<v Speaker 2>All Aka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>razor Ramon,</v>

617
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:56.850
<v Speaker 2>eating real food and within two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're already going to start getting</v>

618
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 2>out of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm,</v>

619
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I eat the way I eat because I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel like I'm 82.</v>

620
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel like I'm 42 at 62 now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about your food plan,</v>

621
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:11.380
<v Speaker 2>like are you giving them specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>portions and what to eat?</v>

622
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you set it up on the APP?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which right now are all.</v>

623
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Dude I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have the most extensive app on</v>

624
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:23.770
<v Speaker 2>the planet and it like just go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>workouts and I'll come back to the</v>

625
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.540
<v Speaker 2>android and iphone everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now you can get it a lot about</v>

626
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.800
<v Speaker 2>windows phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it works on that thing.</v>

627
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've set it up for everything that you</v>

628
00:31:34.331 --> 00:31:37.150
<v Speaker 2>can use after the IPAD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your computer.</v>

629
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't realize it at the time that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I set it up for the iphone,</v>

630
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 2>the droid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the IPAD,</v>

631
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:45.250
<v Speaker 2>the tablet and the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like going back in time,</v>

632
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I would've done the phone because in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

633
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.190
<v Speaker 2>because you can have your phone go right</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the TV,</v>

634
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.420
<v Speaker 2>right if you've got an apple tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I see it caused me a lot more money</v>

635
00:31:55.421 --> 00:31:59.350
<v Speaker 2>to do it with all five units.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is I created this thing</v>

636
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.890
<v Speaker 2>like from Arthur stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it ddpy rebuilt.</v>

637
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.370
<v Speaker 2>You can't get out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do the workout.</v>

638
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got three workouts in bed that have</v>

639
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:12.970
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just friggin working out for 10</v>

640
00:32:12.971 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twelve minutes will get you up and I</v>

641
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 2>called those bed flex.</v>

642
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Then I put you in chair force where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting in a chair.</v>

643
00:32:19.181 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I got eight workouts and I'd fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>chair,</v>

644
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 2>which gets you strong enough to hold the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chair,</v>

645
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 2>so I call those stand strong like Arthur</v>
<v Speaker 2>was doing.</v>

646
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Help you get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help you get down,</v>

647
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.320
<v Speaker 2>help you balance healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep you from falling.</v>

648
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Then you're ready for beginner and once</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the all the modifications that I</v>

649
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:39.250
<v Speaker 2>teach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will stand strong.</v>

650
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I got a guy who's 84 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is Ted Evans.</v>

651
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:44.750
<v Speaker 2>He's been working with me since he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>68.</v>

652
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.270
<v Speaker 2>The motherfucker can do every workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

653
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Every workout now is modified times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

654
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 2>but he can do every fucking workout I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it goes all the way to extreme</v>

655
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 2>psycho shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I did a workout today where I took</v>

656
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:01.340
<v Speaker 2>my foot and held out in front of me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>held it for 30 seconds.</v>

657
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Then pulled it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>held it for 30 seconds.</v>

658
00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:06.680
<v Speaker 2>This is all core stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be to stuff.</v>

659
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.920
<v Speaker 2>God skips my mind right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fighter of the UFC fighter.</v>

660
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm the French who was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

661
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody can ever take him down.</v>

662
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hook his leg and boom.</v>

663
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 2>You're not taking him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to hop around because his</v>

664
00:33:23.781 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 2>core strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to be doing some of this type of</v>

665
00:33:26.181 --> 00:33:27.590
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of gymnastics.</v>

666
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:28.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

667
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:32.120
<v Speaker 2>those guys are super freaked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any as wrestlers or UFC guys,</v>

668
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different level.</v>

669
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And George Superior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will remember.</v>

670
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Why couldn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's taking him down.</v>

671
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how they hook his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he really gets all of that inner</v>

672
00:33:41.901 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 2>strength and that's really what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing at a level that you can start in</v>

673
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:47.570
<v Speaker 2>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

674
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.110
<v Speaker 2>So there's no more fucking excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost fucking excuses and that's so</v>

675
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.560
<v Speaker 2>important is because people can feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry for themselves.</v>

676
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.950
<v Speaker 2>They can say they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the energy there to beat</v>

677
00:33:57.951 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>

678
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 2>There's always something you can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always something if you.</v>

679
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:04.250
<v Speaker 2>But if you give yourself that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse,</v>

680
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What what I love about that video is if</v>

<v Speaker 2>anybody had an excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here's what happened.</v>

699
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:53.120
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.520
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent him the food plan.</v>

701
00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Let me say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he writes me back,</v>

702
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I think I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it a try.</v>

703
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:01.783
<v Speaker 2>You go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

704

<v Speaker 2>Keep me posted.</v>

706
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.920
<v Speaker 2>But he said four words or he wrote for</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

707
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

708
00:35:08.631 --> 00:35:11.570
<v Speaker 2>give me your number right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I call it the motherfucker up.</v>

709
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.520
<v Speaker 2>If you say you can use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you can't,</v>

710
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:16.000
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that you say you can or you</v>

711
00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.053
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

712
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.300
<v Speaker 2>She said that originally who Henry Ford</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

713
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:20.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

714
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.340
<v Speaker 2>And I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did he ever do know what</v>

715
00:35:25.341 --> 00:35:29.180
<v Speaker 2>the fuck did he ever do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for when he said I can do it,</v>

716
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.990
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me your number.</v>

717
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.060
<v Speaker 2>So I called them and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

718
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.530
<v Speaker 2>we talked for about an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two weeks later he calls me back.</v>

719
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 2>The main thing talked to him in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

720
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 2>in that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is again what positively</v>

721
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.630
<v Speaker 2>unstoppable is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As important as the workout is,</v>

722
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 2>as important as the eating plan is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 percent of the equation,</v>

723
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.400
<v Speaker 2>the 90 percent is right between your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ears right here,</v>

724
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 2>that six inch piece of real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story you tell yourself,</v>

725
00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can really just get past that</v>

726
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 2>story and start</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling yourself a different story.</v>

727
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.650
<v Speaker 2>An example would be when I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went up from my hall of Fame</v>

728
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Induction Speech in front of 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in millions of people on USA and</v>

729
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 2>on the wwe network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is only nine 99,</v>

730
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a rib bottom line is,</v>

731
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:23.640
<v Speaker 2>is that I wasn't in the back going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

732
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I hope I don't fuck this up.</v>

733
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I forget was going to say,</v>

734
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sucks,</v>

735
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:29.430
<v Speaker 2>but what if I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I fuck up?</v>

736
00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm saying this can be the best</v>

737
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:32.970
<v Speaker 2>thing I've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to blow people away and make</v>

738
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:33.930
<v Speaker 2>them laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make them cry.</v>

739
00:36:33.931 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to inspire them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was my inner voice.</v>

740
00:36:36.631 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I went out there to the best thing I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever done,</v>

741
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:43.581
<v Speaker 2>like it's the best thing I've ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's about that story that you tell</v>

742
00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 2>yourself when you get all this shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people listen to you because</v>

743
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.500
<v Speaker 2>they need to be reminded it over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>

744
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you think about things is so</v>

745
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so important.</v>

746
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It's almost more important than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts,</v>

747
00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Way and the way this guy decided</v>

748
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that he was going to change his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that video is so important to</v>

749
00:37:05.741 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

750
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's ever.</v>

751
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.840
<v Speaker 2>That's the best testimonial video you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever going to say ever.</v>

752
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy is as broken as they get.</v>

753
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I easily could have been in a wheelchair</v>

754
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 2>easily or like was it announced a time</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going around,</v>

755
00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:19.044
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any kind of,</v>

756
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the unit of the airport,</v>

757
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.880
<v Speaker 2>where do they put you in which in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheelchair because it's too hard for too</v>

758
00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 2>hard for him to walk around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

759
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.180
<v Speaker 2>going back to eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back to the law,</v>

760
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.260
<v Speaker 2>what do you get them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

761
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use,</v>

762
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I get a make the GDP wider owner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do Paleo if you want to do</v>

763
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do this Keto Diet,</v>

764
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:40.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're doing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to say if you're early on in</v>

765
00:37:40.141 --> 00:37:41.780
<v Speaker 2>your young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

766
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I encourage them to do calorie counting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories in,</v>

767
00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 2>calories out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people that doesn't work</v>

768
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:48.480
<v Speaker 2>for anymore.</v>

769
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.360
<v Speaker 2>So what I get them to do is go gluten</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dairy free.</v>

770
00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And really I started with gluten free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can go and people go gluten free,</v>

771
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.440
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all's I know is the people I work with</v>

772
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.380
<v Speaker 2>get out of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of them.</v>

773
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.600
<v Speaker 2>So I don't give a fuck if you eat gluten</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>

774
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about the gluten fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis.</v>

775
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

776
00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is what I do.</v>

777
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:15.890
<v Speaker 2>This is what him and her and him and her</v>
<v Speaker 2>do and look at them and it just helps</v>

778
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:20.600
<v Speaker 2>drop weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about inflammation in your body.</v>

779
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Go back to icing your body sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were all at explored.</v>

780
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I try to get him to cut down as much as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>

781
00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Some people quit completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which blows my mind,</v>

782
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 2>which tells me they really have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>substance by my friend Stacy Morris who</v>

783
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 2>lost a 180 pounds in 18 months.</v>

784
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.530
<v Speaker 2>She's actually on the cover of women's</v>
<v Speaker 2>Day right now,</v>

785
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 2>that big magazine for women's Day of her</v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation.</v>

786
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.680
<v Speaker 2>She wrote a book on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something comfort,</v>

787
00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:49.660
<v Speaker 2>fuel it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating comfort or family comfort.</v>

788
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 2>You can catch it up on my site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's up there,</v>

789
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 2>but she wrote this book about eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>without sugar and that's like,</v>

790
00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling anybody do that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that up.</v>

791
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Your right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want us to delete the sugar I just</v>

792
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 2>don't use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not,</v>

793
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.940
<v Speaker 2>you're just not being a glutton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm eating good sugars like the</v>

794
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 2>honey that I'm putting in this gimmick</v>
<v Speaker 2>is organic honey.</v>

795
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

796
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

797
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 2>the food part for pretty inflammation</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the sugar,</v>

798
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:26.490
<v Speaker 2>dairy and wheat and gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get those out of your body.</v>

799
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:28.370
<v Speaker 2>I challenge you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

800
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever gone to gluten free?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

801

<v Speaker 2>I'm basically gluten free all the time</v>

804
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 2>except for I take cheat days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

805
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a cheat day and I'll have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bowl pasta.</v>

806
00:39:39.281 --> 00:39:43.190
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part I rarely eat bread</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I rarely read anything.</v>

807
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Pasta or anything with wheat will let me</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you this two and a half weeks.</v>

808
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Pasta</v>

809
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.430
<v Speaker 2>and the Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>German,</v>

810
00:39:54.431 --> 00:39:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Dutch kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all my best friends were Genta</v>

811
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.843
<v Speaker 2>Pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

812
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Rossi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read all my buddies will go mas,</v>

813
00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.900
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I love Italian food.</v>

814
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

815
00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.270
<v Speaker 2>there's a company called Tink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yada.</v>

816
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:13.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the best pasta I've ever had in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some brown rice pasta,</v>

817
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.870
<v Speaker 2>so there's always a substitute when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get that out of your body in two and a</v>

818
00:40:19.121 --> 00:40:20.170
<v Speaker 2>half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three weeks,</v>

819
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a different level job like you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>already feel better,</v>

820
00:40:22.901 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 2>you feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to get out of your body and</v>

821
00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.060
<v Speaker 2>then if you put it back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

822
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 2>here and there you're going to run late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to go away quick because</v>

823
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:31.960
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have all that shit stored in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

824
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also reminds me how shitty I feel</v>

825
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:39.181
<v Speaker 2>after I eat it when I do eat a pizza</v>
<v Speaker 2>laid on the couch,</v>

826
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:41.470
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lead weights in my stomach.</v>

827
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:44.020
<v Speaker 2>But what I substituted with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>spaghetti squash,</v>

828
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is an awesome choice.</v>

829
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Getty squash with some garlic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marinara sauce.</v>

830
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:51.340
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic and that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt free.</v>

831
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.240
<v Speaker 2>That's one of our recipes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way our,</v>

888
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's what happened.</v>

889
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

890
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I've been reaching out to different</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like Eddie Bravo.</v>

891
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.450
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a buddy of mine and I just got a</v>

892
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:25.710
<v Speaker 2>disc replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really had a lower back.</v>

893
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.900
<v Speaker 2>His disc was so bad he could barely get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of bed and he had a titanium</v>

894
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 2>articulating disk put in his back.</v>

895
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 2>He feels way better now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.760
<v Speaker 2>And he gained an inch five nine now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

897
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.460
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty sweet because of all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology that they had.</v>

898
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.080
<v Speaker 2>It's really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can help this,</v>

899
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.210
<v Speaker 2>this were all smashed from Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially lower back though.</v>

900
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I've always said like Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he did what they did.</v>

901
00:43:49.391 --> 00:43:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Your Jitsu community would have done in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

902
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.840
<v Speaker 2>in the yoga community.</v>

903
00:43:56.841 --> 00:43:57.470

<v Speaker 2>But we were just talking about where we</v>

<v Speaker 2>when I finished watching it,</v>

920
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I literally looked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:39.640
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thrown us out in the universe.</v>

922
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I want to get on Rogan show within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next year,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Brian into Dmu forever.</v>

925
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.220
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things where it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately or fortunately,</v>

926
00:44:56.221 --> 00:44:59.340
<v Speaker 2>there's just so many different requests</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to come on the podcast.</v>

927
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

928
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:01.830
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just I can't.</v>

929
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.140
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been in the back of my head for</v>

930
00:45:04.141 --> 00:45:07.140
<v Speaker 2>a long time and I think that yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

931
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:11.520
<v Speaker 2>it's so important and I think what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done is make it accessible to</v>

932
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:13.050
<v Speaker 2>people that wouldn't have considered it</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

933
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.310
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to do me and favor.</v>

934
00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I got to do when you're talking</v>

935
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:20.460
<v Speaker 2>about what the fuck I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ddpy.</v>

936
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Ddpy Yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

937
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Because it's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

938
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 2>mainly because people put it in a box</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get it.</v>

939
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Will you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you do a workout with me?</v>

940
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to.</v>

941
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 2>A robbery did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my partner and on it.</v>

942
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loved it.</v>

943
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:37.020
<v Speaker 2>He loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

944
00:45:37.021 --> 00:45:37.950
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bad ass.</v>

945
00:45:37.951 --> 00:45:39.540
<v Speaker 2>He said he's definitely doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

946
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.520
<v Speaker 2>His his take was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

947
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:43.170
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing yoga.</v>

948
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a whole nother edge to it</v>

949
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:48.900
<v Speaker 2>and I keep again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it my own and I encourage</v>

950
00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really cool about.</v>

951
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 2>I've got some workouts that have me in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two people or four people behind me</v>

952
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:59.460
<v Speaker 2>and they're like the introductory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always someone modifying.</v>

953
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Like when I first started doing yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one modified shit.</v>

954
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 2>They never told you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to figure this shit out.</v>

955
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.440
<v Speaker 2>So anything I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave you a more.</v>

956
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:12.210
<v Speaker 2>How do you make this easier step in</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower do we need,</v>

957
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Speaker 2>don't blow yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing that you don't know,</v>

958
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.860
<v Speaker 2>and I gave you one of Mark DDP Yoga mats</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the bag inside,</v>

959
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:24.861
<v Speaker 2>it is a bluetooth heart monitor and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to do is connect right to</v>

960
00:46:26.581 --> 00:46:29.250
<v Speaker 2>the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you an iphone guy or droid?</v>

961
00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I have iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm gonna switch over either</v>

962
00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.430
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

963
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I get that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sort of like a,</v>

964
00:46:34.471 --> 00:46:36.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an attic of not wanting to learn again,</v>

965
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.780
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got that mirror and things so it</v>

966
00:46:38.781 --> 00:46:41.730
<v Speaker 2>pops right up on your TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there will come where your heart</v>

967
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:43.110
<v Speaker 2>rate's at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

968
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 2>And then it tracks you at the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you not been in your zone?</v>

969
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.580
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been in your zone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long have you been over years old?</v>

970
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who did this APP for you?</v>

971
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

972
00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:56.040
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the president of our company.</v>

973
00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:00.940
<v Speaker 2>And we hired these guys out of Turkey</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were all went,</v>

974
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.320
<v Speaker 2>they all went to Georgia tech and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>way cheaper,</v>

975
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:07.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

976
00:47:07.821 --> 00:47:10.530
<v Speaker 2>it's been a long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got probably coming up on $3,000,000</v>

977
00:47:10.531 --> 00:47:13.690
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus crowd to it's lasted.</v>

978
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 2>It's extensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

979
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.970
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of interaction with it,</v>

980
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.290
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

981
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual,</v>

982
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make it like a video game at the end.</v>

983
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.240
<v Speaker 2>So when it gets to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll</v>

984
00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:33.300
<v Speaker 2>get to the end of brothers exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to hit the next level.</v>

985
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.800
<v Speaker 2>So when you're putting all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

986
00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:39.640
<v Speaker 2>like this has got to be a long process</v>
<v Speaker 2>of refining and getting it just right.</v>

987
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean this must have taken over your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

988
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

989
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I go on the road all the time.</v>

993
00:47:50.231 --> 00:47:55.231

995
00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had all these comic books that I</v>

996
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 2>collected from the time I was a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid and then when I became a standup</v>

<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's just a bummer man.</v>

999
00:48:08.831 --> 00:48:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared to go look at comic books</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1000
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.111
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1147
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.290
<v Speaker 1>he connects with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts out with,</v>

1148
00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to be rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be famous.</v>

1149
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:35.950
<v Speaker 1>And then he showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

1150
00:54:35.951 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 1>what can come with that if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally prepared to handle that.</v>

1151
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how any fucking kid can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 18,</v>

1152
00:54:42.391 --> 00:54:43.680
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years old.</v>

1153
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 1>We'll never seen anybody succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lebron,</v>

1155
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.540
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

1157
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>like him has succeeded because his</v>

1158
00:54:54.091 --> 00:54:56.700
<v Speaker 1>success comes along with athletic</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

1159
00:54:56.701 --> 00:55:00.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not just like being Justin</v>

1160
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 1>bieber being some sort of a musical</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstar.</v>

1161
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I think the struggle of the athletic</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit is one of the things that keeps</v>

1162
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:12.750
<v Speaker 1>you humble because there's no way to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the work and the work keeps you</v>

1163
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:13.240
<v Speaker 1>humble.</v>

1164
00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.150
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to kind of work that you have to</v>

1165
00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 1>put in to be Lebron James.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how genetically gifted he</v>

1166
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.580
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly he's a fucking freak athlete.</v>

1167
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's also.</v>

1168
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.490
<v Speaker 1>But he's also got a powerful mind when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear that guy talk.</v>

1169
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.740
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of a round table</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing he was doing.</v>

1170
00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw this with John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stewart and a few other people.</v>

1171
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Is that his show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that guy talks?</v>

1172
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.480
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1173
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.180
<v Speaker 1>The barbershop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Gosh,</v>

1174
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:39.090
<v Speaker 1>I love the prom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he talks,</v>

1175
00:55:39.091 --> 00:55:40.200
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1176
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:43.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking nuclear furnace burden</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside that guy.</v>

1177
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's so successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just him being a freak athlete.</v>

1178
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:51.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the mind his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that hard work and that dedication</v>

1179
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:56.361
<v Speaker 1>and his mind is the reason why he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>still so good and keeps it together at,</v>

1180
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he 35 now?</v>

1181
00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Thirty three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>33.</v>

1182
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 1>It's been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been around for a long time,</v>

1183
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but been super fucking successful for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

1184
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never fucked up.</v>

1185
00:56:06.601 --> 00:56:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Never drove his car into a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never punched a cop,</v>

1186
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:11.550
<v Speaker 1>never got crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

1187
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:16.100
<v Speaker 1>he's kept it together in a rare way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few superstars do because it's a,</v>

1188
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:16.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1189
00:56:16.861 --> 00:56:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1190
00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you went from when you first</v>
<v Speaker 1>started into pro wrestling to becoming</v>

1191
00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 1>super famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an an intoxicating</v>

1192
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.420
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1193
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's a confusing drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It confuses the shit out of a lot of</v>

1194
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:29.830
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately for you,</v>

1195
00:56:29.831 --> 00:56:31.070
<v Speaker 2>you are already a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1196
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.270
<v Speaker 2>And that was the big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just say starting at 35 was the</v>

1197
00:56:34.271 --> 00:56:38.170
<v Speaker 2>worst thing physically because bill one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my matches or any of these kids that</v>

1198
00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:41.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like four or five car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One match.</v>

1199
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every,</v>

1200
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.990
<v Speaker 2>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said is,</v>

1201
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as hard as it was starting at 35,</v>

1202
00:56:47.111 --> 00:56:52.111
<v Speaker 2>the really positive side was as 35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was much smarter and discipline,</v>

1203
00:56:52.851 --> 00:56:55.000
<v Speaker 2>more mature way more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1204
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 2>that I was telling you about when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to Atlanta,</v>

1205
00:56:56.861 --> 00:56:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you're going to stay at my place because</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1206
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:01.660
<v Speaker 2>my wife is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the best bed and breakfast and</v>

1207
00:57:01.661 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 2>there's like five rooms that are all</v>
<v Speaker 2>king size beds because again,</v>

1208
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting ready to work with top</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

1209
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.840
<v Speaker 2>You look at Lebron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at Brady,</v>

1210
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:15.040
<v Speaker 2>how do they perform such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially brady at being 40 years old</v>

1211
00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty amazing.</v>

1212
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.130
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the way he eats,</v>

1213
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty much the way I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't he a Vegan though?</v>

1214
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really.</v>

1215
00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:24.970
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't lagoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strict.</v>

1216
00:57:24.971 --> 00:57:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way I eat.</v>

1217
00:57:26.321 --> 00:57:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I still want the beef I still want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't eat it all the time now</v>

1218
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:31.780
<v Speaker 2>where I used to eat that shit all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1219
00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I used to eat 12 eggs in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I eat eight,</v>

1220
00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.820
<v Speaker 2>know five yolks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three whites,</v>

1221
00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.610
<v Speaker 2>but against keeping the protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1222
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 2>but he's eating for health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just call it that.</v>

1223
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:47.490
<v Speaker 2>And he's not beating up his body outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what he's doing.</v>

1224
00:57:47.861 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 2>When he gets hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he beats up his body.</v>

1225
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:52.090
<v Speaker 2>But before that all he's doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthening his body.</v>

1226
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's what DDP wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's strengthening you.</v>

1227
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Like I just was reading something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that,</v>

1228
00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:01.750
<v Speaker 2>that girly didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Todd didn't play in any preseason stuff</v>

1229
00:58:01.751 --> 00:58:03.100
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need that.</v>

1230
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.590
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be in the best shape,</v>

1231
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:08.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to have put his body</v>
<v Speaker 2>already through abuse,</v>

1232
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's just like wherever you can,</v>

1233
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.530
<v Speaker 2>everything that you do with your Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma,</v>

1234
00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 2>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nfl,</v>

1235
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:21.360
<v Speaker 2>getting to the show is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you get to the show,</v>

1236
00:58:21.641 --> 00:58:24.880
<v Speaker 2>you have two jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One be the best player.</v>

1237
00:58:24.881 --> 00:58:28.330
<v Speaker 2>You can be the best performer too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get hurt.</v>

1238
00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:32.260
<v Speaker 2>You know what's crazy about Tom Brady?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like someone's Dad.</v>

1239
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Like you see them on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't look like,</v>

1240
00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:37.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see Herschel Walker without a shirt</v>

1243
00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.410
<v Speaker 2>You see Tom Brady like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's totally normal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Look it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1246
00:58:49.721 --> 00:58:52.090

<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's in good shape.</v>

1247
00:58:52.091 --> 00:58:53.140
<v Speaker 2>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that,</v>

1248

<v Speaker 2>The greatest quarterback of all time.</v>

1250
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:03.550
<v Speaker 2>That's Mike's dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work Ethic,</v>

1251
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:07.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's his obviously his mind too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1252
00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:10.030
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking insane and that guy ain't</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking in his gut for anybody.</v>

1253
00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:12.130
<v Speaker 2>You could suck his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

1254
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 2>That's not sucking in his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lets that thing hanging out.</v>

1255
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a couple of inches over his fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>shorts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's covering her.</v>

1258
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Jessica Biel together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Created some sort of a nuclear</v>

1259
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:32.590
<v Speaker 2>explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too Hot.</v>

1260
00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

1261
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:37.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about healing your body and</v>

1262
00:59:37.431 --> 00:59:40.850
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're in that spot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I can do for these guys and</v>

1263
00:59:40.851 --> 00:59:42.200
<v Speaker 2>you'll see as we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we work out,</v>

1264
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:45.110
<v Speaker 2>you'll get it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is everything.</v>

1265
00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back to your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1266
00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:50.720
<v Speaker 2>this is what I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the conventional wisdom is,</v>

1267
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:52.990
<v Speaker 2>when it's bone on bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're fucked,</v>

1268
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.750
<v Speaker 2>there's too much inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is too much grinding and you're</v>

1269
00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.470
<v Speaker 2>just going to be too painful to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and you're gonna have to do</v>

1270
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:02.230
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

1271
01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.710
<v Speaker 2>How does the Yogis does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the muscle strength in the DDP.</v>

1272
01:00:06.711 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Why are we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.750
<v Speaker 2>How does the DDP wise do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>

1274
01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Just the strengthening all the core</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles around your spine stabilizes</v>

1275
01:00:15.771 --> 01:00:19.200
<v Speaker 2>everything and keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I can remember,</v>

1276
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a wrestler.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what I did before this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Might just like you do for military</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1309
01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:58.460

<v Speaker 2>I've been to Iraq three times.</v>

1310
01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan once you've done those</v>
<v Speaker 2>tours.</v>

1311

<v Speaker 2>Thirteen days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it yet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you do it,</v>

1338
01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:12.870
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much better,</v>

1339
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.540
<v Speaker 2>how much work are you going to put in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1340
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:18.300
<v Speaker 2>it all comes down to the work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where you are,</v>

1341
01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:20.610
<v Speaker 2>how much work you put in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where can you get right in.</v>

1342
01:03:20.611 --> 01:03:21.630
<v Speaker 2>We're it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1343
01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 2>my program meets you where you are.</v>

1344
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's the whole thing with Jerry to</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch where he is on the last episode.</v>

1345
01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I won't tell you what happened because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know eventually you'll get around to it</v>

1346
01:03:32.551 --> 01:03:34.020
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1347
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 2>this fucking shit's crazy and for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to answer your question on the back,</v>

1348
01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 2>all I can think of is I'm constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>lengthening and strengthening.</v>

1349
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I stretched my whole wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole athletic career right up those</v>

1350
01:03:47.941 --> 01:03:50.820
<v Speaker 2>42 and three quarters when I blew my</v>
<v Speaker 2>back out.</v>

1351
01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So stretching is great,</v>

1352
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:58.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the end all be all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stretching and strengthening the</v>

1353
01:03:58.351 --> 01:04:00.030
<v Speaker 2>muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ligaments and tendons.</v>

1354
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 2>When you use the resistance and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic time under tension,</v>

1355
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:07.830
<v Speaker 2>when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it elevates your heart rate.</v>

1356
01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're at the head laying down your</v>

1357
01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 2>heart rate's the lowest ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1358
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Sit Up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

1359
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Your heart rate goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand,</v>

1360
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:16.350
<v Speaker 2>walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jog,</v>

1361
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:17.810
<v Speaker 2>sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1362
01:04:17.811 --> 01:04:18.121
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1363
01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:18.954
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

1364
01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I had you flex your quads,</v>

1365
01:04:21.241 --> 01:04:23.070
<v Speaker 2>flexed your glutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab the ball,</v>

1366
01:04:23.071 --> 01:04:23.761
<v Speaker 2>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers,</v>

1367
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>wide movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance of guarantee.</v>

1368
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Your heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're starting at 80,</v>

1369
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:31.470
<v Speaker 2>it went to 105.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 15 or 20.</v>

1370
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I can take my heart rate from 90 to 140</v>
<v Speaker 2>by 135 like that,</v>

1371
01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.360
<v Speaker 2>and I mean two minutes standing still</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not yoga.</v>

1372
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:45.540
<v Speaker 2>That's DDP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1373
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.130
<v Speaker 2>And I've been wearing a heart monitor</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this for over 18 years,</v>

1374
01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 2>so it's more physically intensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be more strength.</v>

1375
01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:55.710
<v Speaker 2>It can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1376
01:04:55.711 --> 01:04:58.030
<v Speaker 2>I did 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ten second pushups almost second</v>

1377
01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:58.740
<v Speaker 2>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1378
01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.530
<v Speaker 2>but you still haven't gotten an MRI done</v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

1379
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just figured fuck.</v>

1380
01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 2>It feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to pay for that to see what it is</v>

1381
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:10.950
<v Speaker 2>because I know that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is possible to gain some space.</v>

1382
01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it has to be there.</v>

1383
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.140
<v Speaker 2>They've done it with decompression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've done it with,</v>

1384
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:16.974
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1385
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:21.060
<v Speaker 2>various exercises and things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that do lengthen the spine,</v>

1386
01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:22.510
<v Speaker 2>stretch you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's A.</v>

1387
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:25.030
<v Speaker 2>I have a bunch of things out back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you some of the things that</v>

1388
01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:27.160
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've people have created to</v>

1389
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:29.060
<v Speaker 2>decompress the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1390
01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever use one of those teeter</v>
<v Speaker 2>things where you hanging clinicals a</v>

1391
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally get out of my hyperbaric</v>

1392
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.580
<v Speaker 2>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that.</v>

1393
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:38.770
<v Speaker 2>What do you know about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never done it,</v>

1394
01:05:38.771 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard amazing things from UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that have fought and had pretty</v>

1395
01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>significant injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handbrakes muscle damage and gotten</v>

1396
01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:51.280
<v Speaker 2>there and had some pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty rapid recovery because of it.</v>

1397
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:52.190
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1398
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:56.800
<v Speaker 2>my doctor who she's my endocrinologist</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I told her I was doing and she</v>

1399
01:05:56.801 --> 01:05:57.634
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old Dallas,</v>

1400
01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it can only help you.</v>

1401
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.030
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only story I have about,</v>

1402
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said I had a woman who had radiation</v>

1403
01:06:07.721 --> 01:06:10.240
<v Speaker 2>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she had an open wound from her breast</v>

1404
01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:14.050
<v Speaker 2>cancer and it wouldn't close for over</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years,</v>

1405
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:17.470
<v Speaker 2>centered down to emory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally put her night Berg Chamber.</v>

1406
01:06:17.471 --> 01:06:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Three months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent healed.</v>

1407
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Same things happens with people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes.</v>

1408
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.960
<v Speaker 2>So I had heard like Lebron had it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1409
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 2>because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw an article on him,</v>

1410
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:28.540
<v Speaker 2>but I just heard people talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1411
01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:30.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in different areas that he had won.</v>

1412
01:06:30.221 --> 01:06:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Coby had one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have them in their house.</v>

1413
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:34.000
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they do or they don't.</v>

1414
01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I just heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it got me thinking in my house that I</v>

1415
01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:40.260
<v Speaker 2>was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just let it.</v>

1416
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:43.630
<v Speaker 2>It's called the accountability crib and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to put this out there</v>

1417
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:44.464
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

1418
01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.110
<v Speaker 2>It's when I moved jake into my home in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta,</v>

1419
01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:50.500
<v Speaker 2>I just bought it and it was all about</v>
<v Speaker 2>being accountability.</v>

1420
01:06:50.501 --> 01:06:52.190
<v Speaker 2>One of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina and uh,</v>

1421
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:55.030
<v Speaker 2>sent me a list of names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to call this something.</v>

1422
01:06:55.031 --> 01:06:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I put it out there on the Internet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she sent me like 22 names and one of</v>

1423
01:06:58.121 --> 01:07:01.330
<v Speaker 2>them is the accountability crib.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I call it DDPS</v>

1424
01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:03.910
<v Speaker 2>accountability crib.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you got to be accountable for</v>

1425
01:07:03.911 --> 01:07:06.310
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing,</v>

1426
01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I love that home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was 22 steps to get to my bedroom</v>

1427
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.160
<v Speaker 2>and my knees are bone on bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So going down was a drag.</v>

1428
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:18.820
<v Speaker 2>So I figured fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to buy a new home master on</v>

1429
01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:20.830
<v Speaker 2>main and I'm going to build this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1430
01:07:20.831 --> 01:07:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I have this place that I can bring in</v>
<v Speaker 2>top athletes that want to be healed,</v>

1431
01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:25.840
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1432
01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.840
<v Speaker 2>So going back to the crib,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making that like an airbnb now.</v>

1433
01:07:30.851 --> 01:07:32.650
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or have like the steak Robert Suite,</v>

1434
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.610
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1435
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:37.280
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>razor Ramon suite to DDP sweet.</v>

1436
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that'll be pretty cool.</v>

1437
01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:42.760
<v Speaker 2>That's going to happen next week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get into is hyperbaric</v>

1438
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.020
<v Speaker 2>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1439
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't Lebron Shave his head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on with that?</v>

1440
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Someone explained that there's some so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much fuckery going on with his hair.</v>

1441
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:50.861
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1442
01:07:50.861 --> 01:07:53.650
<v Speaker 2>That looks a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mine.</v>

1443
01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:58.730
<v Speaker 2>I would venture to say that he is not at</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 psi on that thing and what that means</v>

1444
01:08:00.101 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 2>is pounds per square inch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're like 10,</v>

1445
01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 2>say 10 feet below sea level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about four pounds per square</v>

1446
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:09.190
<v Speaker 2>inch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get know it just goes up.</v>

1447
01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Twenty would be like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight pound per square at 12 pounds per</v>

1448
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:17.270
<v Speaker 2>square inch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pressure is there.</v>

1449
01:08:17.271 --> 01:08:19.040
<v Speaker 2>An takes like 10 minutes to get up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1450
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Like you're blowing your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wow.</v>

1451
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just getting air,</v>

1452
01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 2>getting your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll fix your ears and all that shit.</v>

1453
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:31.330
<v Speaker 2>But what happens when you get to 12 psi</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it breaks the brain barrier and the</v>

1454
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.960
<v Speaker 2>oxygen will go to your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is.</v>

1455
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know any of this shit till I</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit next to a guy named Brad Campbell</v>

1456
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:41.600
<v Speaker 2>who's like an angel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cat.</v>

1457
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.280
<v Speaker 2>And we just started talking on a plane</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at some point I said,</v>

1458
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:47.930
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how old are you anyway?</v>

1459
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like you do a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

1460
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks at the Max 45,</v>

1461
01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1462
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm 57.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1463
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.420
<v Speaker 2>you're 57.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1464
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck you look like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1465
01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I've been living in a hyperbaric chamber</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the last 14 years.</v>

1466
01:09:01.621 --> 01:09:03.920
<v Speaker 2>So he's a Weirdo kid away from me.</v>

1467
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1468
01:09:05.571 --> 01:09:09.530
<v Speaker 2>how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that I was diagnosed with ms 22 years</v>

1469
01:09:09.531 --> 01:09:11.870
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1470
01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And using that to keep the MS and check.</v>

1471
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:19.840
<v Speaker 2>He told me that when he gets a 12 PSI</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it goes to your brain,</v>

1472
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:23.240
<v Speaker 2>and this would be layman's terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1473
01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Like when you get ms kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>crystallized on your brain,</v>

1474
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the crystals fill up,</v>

1475
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:36.010
<v Speaker 2>where do they go next down your spine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hence became the Walker,</v>

1476
01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.750
<v Speaker 2>the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what somebody.</v>

1477
01:09:41.751 --> 01:09:46.751
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who the person was who</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out 20 days in a chamber.</v>

1478
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 2>And it's all about consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it once or twice,</v>

1479
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:52.790
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel better a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

1480
01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.140
<v Speaker 2>but you do it like consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 days,</v>

1481
01:09:57.141 --> 01:10:00.140
<v Speaker 2>like they do their take off five days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do that four times.</v>

1482
01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.960
<v Speaker 2>You do your Mri on your brain before you</v>
<v Speaker 2>start and after there's a kid named</v>

1483
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Bryan who is one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>stores in professional wrestling and a</v>

1484
01:10:09.591 --> 01:10:13.490
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago he had to retire at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the height of his career and he was the</v>

1485
01:10:13.491 --> 01:10:17.630
<v Speaker 2>hottest guy on the planet at the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wasn't a big guy,</v>

1486
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:22.640
<v Speaker 2>but he was the number one guy in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>business and he had to retire because of</v>

1487
01:10:22.641 --> 01:10:23.474
<v Speaker 2>concussions.</v>

1488
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's back and I haven't talked to them</v>

1489
01:10:26.151 --> 01:10:28.600
<v Speaker 2>directly about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did hear that he was using a</v>

1490
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:30.950
<v Speaker 2>hyperbaric chamber to help heal his</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

1491
01:10:30.951 --> 01:10:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's telling me this story,</v>

1492
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking about them as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm thinking I've been hit in the</v>

1493
01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:38.380
<v Speaker 2>head a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1494
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I've been knocked out a shitload of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1495
01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:42.770
<v Speaker 2>but I knocked out a shit load of guys by</v>
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>

1496
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:44.990
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't trying to knock me out</v>

1497
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:47.540
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not checkers out there.</v>

1498
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:50.390
<v Speaker 2>So it I've been hit in the head with</v>
<v Speaker 2>chairs and all that shit.</v>

1499
01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:53.500
<v Speaker 2>So how do you guys do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you hit some of these?</v>

1500
01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Supposed to go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal.</v>

1501
01:10:56.090 --> 01:11:00.680
<v Speaker 2>If I walk up to you and we're about to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out there and I'm going to slap the</v>

1502
01:11:00.681 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it anymore.</v>

1503
01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.310
<v Speaker 2>But in the old days if I'm going to hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in a chair,</v>

1504
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.730
<v Speaker 2>you got to hit it like even right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>

1505
01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:09.590
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say I'm sorry right now.</v>

1506
01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 2>And you would say back to me and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>come with a motherfucker.</v>

1507
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Don't make it weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what you would say because</v>

1508
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.450
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to shoot an angle on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go with it.</v>

1509
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.210
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that back when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were 35,</v>

1510
01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:23.000
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand traumatic brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>injury.</v>

1511
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>That's why they let us do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to.</v>

1512
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:28.650
<v Speaker 2>They don't see that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you remember when Dennis Rodman</v>

1513
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:29.790
<v Speaker 2>wrestled?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1514
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was when I got Karl Malone involved</v>

1515
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:36.690
<v Speaker 2>and it was me and Karl Malone against</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodman and Hogan.</v>

1516
01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.710
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took my name to a different level,</v>

1517
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:45.480
<v Speaker 2>but robin was supposed to be a practice</v>
<v Speaker 2>that day in Detroit.</v>

1518
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.460
<v Speaker 2>We were in Detroit that night with metro</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

1519
01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:54.930
<v Speaker 2>him and Hogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to do this announcement and</v>

1520
01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 2>him and Hogan come from the back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whack me with chairs.</v>

1521
01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Now this is Dennis Rodman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1522
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not one of the boys.</v>

1523
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:05.270
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to lay it flat if you in and</v>

1524
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some big like probably like a</v>

1525
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:08.090
<v Speaker 2>mat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1526
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:12.030
<v Speaker 2>from a wrestling like the collegiate</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers wrestle on.</v>

1527
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:15.570
<v Speaker 2>So this big roll of rubber was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was probably about three feet off the</v>

1528
01:12:15.571 --> 01:12:17.430
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1529
01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I know you've never swung a chair</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1530
01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:24.480
<v Speaker 2>so let me show you something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I picked my hands up with a chair</v>

1531
01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:26.880
<v Speaker 2>and then I'd lower him down just right</v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of it.</v>

1532
01:12:26.881 --> 01:12:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Then I'd pick them up at low room flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1533
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.720
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll flag it is right.</v>

1534
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:33.360
<v Speaker 2>And I took it up and I hit it as hard as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

1535
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1536
01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.930
<v Speaker 2>if you hit me like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

1537
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.330
<v Speaker 2>And then I just turned with my left</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>

1538
01:12:39.331 --> 01:12:42.040
<v Speaker 2>move down a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the railing of the chair headed</v>

1539
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 2>and to put a big getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1540
01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:47.730
<v Speaker 2>if you hit me like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you break my rips.</v>

1541
01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so please let me see you do it.</v>

1542
01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Hit a fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was great,</v>

1543
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:55.620
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they came out and it was on espn</v>

1544
01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:59.700
<v Speaker 2>that night because he was supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a practice and hear his fucking around</v>

1545
01:12:59.701 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 2>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on a shoot and the angle or metro.</v>

1546
01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:06.510
<v Speaker 2>So it was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's all about laying it flat and</v>

1547
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:10.180
<v Speaker 2>then you'll see how it's not checkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fucking checkers.</v>

1548
01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 2>The one of the most disturbing things I</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever saw was brock lesnar doing that</v>

1549
01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:15.600
<v Speaker 2>flip off the top rope and landing on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1550
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of human beings that would</v>

1551
01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:21.270
<v Speaker 2>even survive that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes on to complete the pin.</v>

1552
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck did he not get knocked</v>

1553
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:27.870
<v Speaker 2>unconscious from that and how the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he not have permanent spinal injury</v>

1554
01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:30.270
<v Speaker 2>from that and he is 300 pounds at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1555
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I tell everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you fucking want about</v>

1556
01:13:33.361 --> 01:13:36.990
<v Speaker 2>fresh and wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't fake gravity.</v>

1557
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:40.440
<v Speaker 2>That little fucker that was flipping in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>

1558
01:13:40.441 --> 01:13:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the baddest motherfucker alive as</v>

1559
01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:47.430
<v Speaker 2>far as our maturity survived the hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds flying through the air,</v>

1560
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:51.240
<v Speaker 2>landing on the top of his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you watched it was this,</v>

1561
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:55.150
<v Speaker 2>here was this shared heritage with look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the size of the is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so fucked up.</v>

1563
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:01.350
<v Speaker 2>That is so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at him grabbing his head.</v>

1564
01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he landed on his fucking head.</v>

1565
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.700
<v Speaker 2>How is he alive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1566
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed that.</v>

1567
01:14:07.471 --> 01:14:09.670
<v Speaker 2>So bad is Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know.</v>

1568
01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's one of the best fuckers</v>
<v Speaker 2>landed</v>

1569
01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:17.330
<v Speaker 1>on his head and this was before and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this and the other band is</v>

1570
01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:23.260

<v Speaker 1>Next door was also completely fucked up</v>

1571
01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:24.120
<v Speaker 1>from wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1572
01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:26.380
<v Speaker 1>his arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of his arms were completely</v>

1573
01:14:26.381 --> 01:14:30.160
<v Speaker 1>atrophied because he said so many spinal</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeries and spinal injuries.</v>

1574
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>His neck has completely fused up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I begged Kim and Olympic gold medalist,</v>

<v Speaker 1>legit Olympic gold medalist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling broke his neck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>for and still wants to one again,</v>

1577
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.870

<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

1578
01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this job,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1580
01:14:47.081 --> 01:14:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously,</v>

1581
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:49.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's,</v>

1582
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.460

<v Speaker 1>it's entertainment,</v>

1583
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but physically demanding in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically demanding crazy.</v>

1584
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:57.970
<v Speaker 1>It might be more physically demanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a sport.</v>

1585
01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right up there.</v>

1586
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.020
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I could think that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be as bad,</v>

1587
01:15:02.021 --> 01:15:04.810
<v Speaker 1>but they don't do it every day is bull</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding.</v>

1588
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if that's a sport</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just crazy.</v>

1589
01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:11.560
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty nutty.</v>

1590
01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend of mine who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1591
01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:18.630
<v Speaker 1>has done it and he had eight or nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder surgeries.</v>

1592
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 1>His shoulder was just shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

1593
01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.010
<v Speaker 1>it was just all these cut marks all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>his shoulders.</v>

1594
01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:27.430
<v Speaker 1>It just blown apart and they stitch it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back together and blew it apart and</v>

1595
01:15:27.431 --> 01:15:28.870
<v Speaker 1>stitch it back together again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1596
01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 1>how about stop riding fucking 2000 pound</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

1597
01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck one of those six</v>

1598
01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.550
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just so crazy coming out of the</v>

1599
01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:38.110
<v Speaker 1>gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't control that at all.</v>

1600
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:39.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't control that at all.</v>

1601
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>So the guys who had those runs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty banged up and the other guy's</v>

1602
01:15:42.321 --> 01:15:43.660
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just started,</v>

1603
01:15:43.770 --> 01:15:46.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to a pardot to who is the</v>

1604
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.470
<v Speaker 1>president of the NFL alumni and we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about doing something for</v>

1605
01:15:50.471 --> 01:15:54.400
<v Speaker 1>the guys and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I do shit like that I just give it</v>

1606
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:56.590
<v Speaker 1>to them just to help them.</v>

1607
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And I've talked to a few of the players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a few guys,</v>

1608
01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loving it and so it just,</v>

1609
01:16:01.451 --> 01:16:03.600
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping them with because there's,</v>

1610
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys are all weight lifting,</v>

1611
01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:09.490
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't do either now because you're so</v>

1612
01:16:09.491 --> 01:16:11.850
<v Speaker 1>beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'll let you know.</v>

1613
01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It's funny when we watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1614
01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you watched the superbowl when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had the 50th anniversary a couple</v>

1615
01:16:16.341 --> 01:16:20.170
<v Speaker 1>of years back and all the mvps that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there just,</v>

1616
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:22.720
<v Speaker 1>it was brutal to watch how beat up they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1617
01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:25.300
<v Speaker 1>The only guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course Jerry Rice looks like he could</v>

1618
01:16:25.301 --> 01:16:28.030
<v Speaker 1>still play because that's a rubbish to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest.</v>

1619
01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 1>He's just a freaking super athlete and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow I don't know what all the crazy</v>

1620
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:34.510
<v Speaker 1>shots he's been hit with that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>survived.</v>

1621
01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:37.750
<v Speaker 1>But there are certain people I always</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they could eat plastic,</v>

1622
01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.420
<v Speaker 1>like they can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1623
01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:42.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said Herschel Walker prefer that.</v>

1624
01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Still wants to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fighting in strikeforce when he's</v>

1625
01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:48.570
<v Speaker 1>48 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>

1626
01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:52.180
<v Speaker 1>built like a fucking 20 year old freak</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nature fully shredded.</v>

1627
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1628
01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really have to stop and think if</v>

1629
01:16:56.411 --> 01:17:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that guy did fight when he was in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties instead of in his forties,</v>

1630
01:17:00.101 --> 01:17:01.030
<v Speaker 1>late forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1631
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:03.400
<v Speaker 1>He could have been a world champion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting.</v>

1632
01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:05.600
<v Speaker 1>He's that kind of a freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1633
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't my claim to fame is with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was his</v>

1634
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.590
<v Speaker 2>last big run for Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He caught the ball and ran 67 yards into</v>

1635
01:17:14.591 --> 01:17:19.590
<v Speaker 2>the ends on this is like 1997 and he put</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ball between his hands to deny</v>

1636
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:23.300
<v Speaker 2>mccarter side and did the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you didn't know because he put</v>

1637
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 2>the ball in there if it was battery with</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something else.</v>

1638
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:27.840
<v Speaker 2>And one of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1639
01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:31.260
<v Speaker 2>who had a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a radio show into a craig in,</v>

1640
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.610
<v Speaker 2>he had it in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called me up,</v>

1641
01:17:34.611 --> 01:17:35.444
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>D,</v>

1642
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm having Walker on the show today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1643
01:17:37.971 --> 01:17:39.720
<v Speaker 2>do you want to sit in the wings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask him if he,</v>

1644
01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:42.590
<v Speaker 2>if he did the diamond cutter or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's called Dude,</v>

1645
01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I definitely want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he put me on the phone and the wings</v>

1646
01:17:45.801 --> 01:17:47.240
<v Speaker 2>and I'm waiting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1647
01:17:47.241 --> 01:17:48.770
<v Speaker 2>so what happened that day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1648
01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:49.580
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1649
01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.530
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that thing you did with the</v>

1650
01:17:51.531 --> 01:17:52.580
<v Speaker 2>ball?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1651
01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:52.871
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1652
01:17:52.871 --> 01:17:56.300
<v Speaker 2>in the big WCW fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked Diamond Dallas page</v>

1653
01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:58.970
<v Speaker 2>and I felt like bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just did it and did a bang and</v>

1654
01:17:58.971 --> 01:17:59.804
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

1655
01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:01.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on the air right now with you.</v>

1656
01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:02.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get outta here.</v>

1657
01:18:02.451 --> 01:18:04.830
<v Speaker 2>And we became buddies out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost touch with them since then,</v>

1658
01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:05.900
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy.</v>

1659
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think you're doing and what I</v>

1660
01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:11.990
<v Speaker 3>think that one of the best benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 3>yoga,</v>

1661
01:18:11.991 --> 01:18:16.460
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure the same with ddpy said</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're connecting everything together.</v>

1662
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like yoga and sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this explosive exercise,</v>

1663
01:18:20.211 --> 01:18:22.610
<v Speaker 3>it's building up the muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you're doing is you're</v>

1664
01:18:22.611 --> 01:18:26.030
<v Speaker 3>tightening up all the joints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're tightening up the core and the</v>

1665
01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:27.590
<v Speaker 3>joints,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the thing that people are</v>

1666
01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:30.830
<v Speaker 3>missing that a lot of people are missing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are really into fitness and</v>

1667
01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.590
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing all this explosive stuff,</v>

1668
01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.700
<v Speaker 3>but what's connecting everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>together is what blows out the knees,</v>

1669
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:38.990
<v Speaker 3>the ankles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shoulders,</v>

1670
01:18:38.991 --> 01:18:40.700
<v Speaker 3>the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this.</v>

1671
01:18:40.701 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 3>This is something that's missing from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people's work because it's not as</v>

1672
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:45.230
<v Speaker 3>glamorous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1673
01:18:45.231 --> 01:18:47.200
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you do biceps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You buys,</v>

1674
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 3>get all pumped up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do chest,</v>

1675
01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.260
<v Speaker 3>you get all pumped up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look great.</v>

1676
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:54.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're doing is for overall body</v>

1677
01:18:54.951 --> 01:18:59.330
<v Speaker 3>maintenance and health and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>connecting all these parts together in a</v>

1678
01:18:59.331 --> 01:19:02.090
<v Speaker 3>way that makes the whole unit stronger</v>
<v Speaker 3>and healthier.</v>

1679
01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:04.770
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I was saying I'm stretching</v>

1680
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.860
<v Speaker 2>and strengthening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just think about going over your head</v>

1681
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:11.140
<v Speaker 2>and reaching up what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I started class,</v>

1682
01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:16.490
<v Speaker 2>like I just had 175 people pay to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of a workshop that I do called</v>

1683
01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:20.580
<v Speaker 2>inspiration meets perspiration and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee you two things.</v>

1684
01:19:20.581 --> 01:19:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so jacked up,</v>

1685
01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:24.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm so inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're to feel like they could run</v>

1686
01:19:24.241 --> 01:19:27.510
<v Speaker 2>through a brick wall and two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to sweat their ass off,</v>

1687
01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:31.590
<v Speaker 2>but I met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the it where they are on whatever</v>

1688
01:19:31.591 --> 01:19:34.920
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the person who might be 400 pounds</v>

1689
01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:40.280
<v Speaker 2>and the person who shredded over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get a good workout at the same time</v>

1690
01:19:41.791 --> 01:19:44.440
<v Speaker 2>because I'm showing him how to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>modification over there and he might</v>

1691
01:19:44.441 --> 01:19:46.800
<v Speaker 2>even have a chair and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go deep.</v>

1692
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:47.663
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1693
01:19:47.670 --> 01:19:48.503
<v Speaker 2>go deep.</v>

1694
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Now let me show you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now grab the ball opened up and then</v>

1695
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.790
<v Speaker 2>pull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But before I start,</v>

1696
01:19:53.791 --> 01:19:55.650
<v Speaker 2>one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's people there who come</v>

1697
01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.570
<v Speaker 2>because they hear it yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1698
01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.770
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I walk,</v>

1699
01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:00.810
<v Speaker 2>y'all got my mic on and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking.</v>

1700
01:20:00.811 --> 01:20:04.260
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you came here for the yoga where you</v>

1701
01:20:04.261 --> 01:20:06.990
<v Speaker 2>reach your arms to heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorta the universe smiles back.</v>

1702
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:08.910
<v Speaker 2>You and I dropped my arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1703
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.920
<v Speaker 2>we won't be doing any of that shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>

1704
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:15.180
<v Speaker 2>What kind of Yoga did you start with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Power Yoga was.</v>

1705
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he never did.</v>

1706
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1707
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I've done everything I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done all of them at least once just</v>

1708
01:20:24.331 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 2>to try like I respect yoga at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different level,</v>

1709
01:20:28.351 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 2>like as much as any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's really funny,</v>

1710
01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:34.680
<v Speaker 2>he's like guys like Brian Kest and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shipper ray and there was a,</v>

1711
01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 2>my buddy mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arthur Klein did a movie called why Yoga</v>

1712
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:44.480
<v Speaker 2>and in it he gives me a camera and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the second time I went to Iraq and I</v>

1713
01:20:45.381 --> 01:20:50.360
<v Speaker 2>filmed all this shit and meet with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and then go interview and I wasn't</v>

1714
01:20:50.361 --> 01:20:54.210
<v Speaker 2>interviewing someone else's interviewing</v>
<v Speaker 2>him for me and it got this great,</v>

1715
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:55.770
<v Speaker 2>great stuff.</v>

1716
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:59.820
<v Speaker 2>But in the beginning I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how like I literally was interviewed</v>

1717
01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:03.360
<v Speaker 2>when I wrote the Book Yoga for regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and I get it.</v>

1718
01:21:03.361 --> 01:21:07.460
<v Speaker 2>It was smoking hot chicks and regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys because back then I met TNF,</v>

1719
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you when I said it and I never thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>women would love the workout the way</v>

1720
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:13.440
<v Speaker 2>they do and those this year that you put</v>
<v Speaker 2>this together,</v>

1721
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:17.670
<v Speaker 2>2005.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was interviewed by this guy from</v>

1722
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:22.671
<v Speaker 2>the Wall Street Journal and literally he</v>
<v Speaker 2>quoted me saying when Kimberly had asked</v>

1723
01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:27.630
<v Speaker 2>me if I would do the yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like fuck that I wouldn't be</v>

1724
01:21:27.631 --> 01:21:31.860
<v Speaker 2>caught dead doing yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he put in there after Dash Dash,</v>

1725
01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:34.140
<v Speaker 2>dash that I wouldn't be caught dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing yoga.</v>

1726
01:21:34.141 --> 01:21:35.880
<v Speaker 2>So that's in the beginning of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1727
01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:38.460
<v Speaker 2>So the Yogis like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey me.</v>

1728
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.410
<v Speaker 2>But by the time it gets to the end where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see like I'm just putting a</v>

1729
01:21:43.411 --> 01:21:46.800
<v Speaker 2>different spin on it and I'm not trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do what you're doing,</v>

1730
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:50.340
<v Speaker 2>but similar writing as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

1731
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.420
<v Speaker 2>more benefits.</v>

1732
01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say power yoga,</v>

1733
01:21:52.921 --> 01:21:54.660
<v Speaker 2>for people who've never done yoga</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1734
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:56.010
<v Speaker 2>differ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Differentiate.</v>

1735
01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that mean when you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>power yoga versus something like Bikram</v>

1736
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being remiss to me personally,</v>

1737
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be that hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be in a hot room.</v>

1738
01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:11.421
<v Speaker 2>I want to hate my body up in the cold so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put myself in a position</v>

1739
01:22:11.911 --> 01:22:15.600
<v Speaker 2>where it's so hot that I can go farther</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I've ever come before because then</v>

1740
01:22:15.601 --> 01:22:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to walk out into the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and then I'm not going to get</v>

1741
01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:20.880
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to get what I get in</v>

1742
01:22:20.881 --> 01:22:24.300
<v Speaker 2>the real world and there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say I don't know how many</v>

1743
01:22:24.301 --> 01:22:26.580
<v Speaker 2>positions are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't say there's 46 positions or</v>

1744
01:22:26.581 --> 01:22:29.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is and peegrum things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty eight,</v>

1745
01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 slash 27 slash 20.</v>

1746
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But either way he trademarked that.</v>

1747
01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:38.570
<v Speaker 2>So that like a news that in court</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1748
01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.860
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he won,</v>

1749
01:22:40.861 --> 01:22:44.580
<v Speaker 2>but who can either way on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was his to begin with.</v>

1750
01:22:44.581 --> 01:22:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I think somebody else had had put all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those patterns together before him.</v>

1751
01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then probably so because again,</v>

1752
01:22:50.641 --> 01:22:53.160
<v Speaker 2>it's freaking yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been around for thousands of years,</v>

1753
01:22:53.161 --> 01:22:58.050
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do like the one time Chris</v>

1754
01:22:58.050 --> 01:22:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Jericho and I were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1755
01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:02.190
<v Speaker 2>he came by my house in La when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>living here and we went out to the park</v>

1756
01:23:02.191 --> 01:23:03.420
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you do?</v>

1757
01:23:03.421 --> 01:23:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Do you do stand up one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1758
01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.390
<v Speaker 2>strength building or next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go Chris,</v>

1759
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I do it different every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do the same open under the same</v>

1760
01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:13.420
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all the middle I go,</v>

1761
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like a match man.</v>

1762
01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:17.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm making it up as I go along at times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1763
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:19.000
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improv because I'm seeing what you can</v>

1764
01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:20.800
<v Speaker 2>do and then I'm going to take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1765
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I see you can really go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1766
01:23:23.021 --> 01:23:25.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to push you to a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>level that I go to.</v>

1767
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.430
<v Speaker 2>If you can't then I'm going to back way</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck off because I don't want to</v>

1768
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:32.050
<v Speaker 2>burn you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to.</v>

1769
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I did it with Tito.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tito Ortiz.</v>

1770
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:39.340
<v Speaker 2>One time he'd written something in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports illustrated,</v>

1771
01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:44.400
<v Speaker 2>interviewed him and I had met him at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>strip joint in Vegas and he was the man</v>

1772
01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 2>in ufc at the time and he wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't making any money.</v>

1773
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:52.930
<v Speaker 2>You remember back in the beginning when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't making any money and he</v>

1774
01:23:52.931 --> 01:23:56.270
<v Speaker 2>wanted to go to where we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1775
01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.730
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1776
01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:59.560
<v Speaker 2>here's what I really feel.</v>

1777
01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:03.520
<v Speaker 2>This shit you're doing is building crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum.</v>

1778
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at the top of where we're going to</v>

1779
01:24:05.861 --> 01:24:09.790
<v Speaker 2>go right now and it's so cyclical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some point it's going to fall out.</v>

1780
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.920
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's whole different thing than what</v>

1781
01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:13.570
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you appreciate it.</v>

1782
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Which I'm super excited about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bottom line is,</v>

1783
01:24:16.871 --> 01:24:18.160
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay where you are.</v>

1784
01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:20.800
<v Speaker 2>And he's saying this in the SII</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview.</v>

1785
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I still had his number and I called</v>

1786
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 2>them up and he answered the phone like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did he pay him?</v>

1788
01:24:26.801 --> 01:24:27.341
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1793
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.720
<v Speaker 2>And he put that oversight.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I heard that fight next month.</v>

1798
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I went down and worked out once</v>
<v Speaker 2>November.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Then after that he wouldn't do it and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally pinned him down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>guy at ibm and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

1902
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to inspire people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you'll know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his baby.</v>

1907
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:35.730
<v Speaker 2>That video is his baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>

1908
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.230
<v Speaker 2>just imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1909
01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:41.850
<v Speaker 2>yoga is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want to take credit for all of this even</v>

1910
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:44.130
<v Speaker 2>though it's our shit and it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>

1911
01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a version of.</v>

1912
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.030

<v Speaker 2>studio wall ever.</v>

1913
01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:56.190
<v Speaker 2>And that's what helped it go viral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So remember we said that in the video</v>

1914
01:29:56.191 --> 01:30:00.000
<v Speaker 2>that had been turned away by [inaudible]</v>

<v Speaker 2>he needed the chair.</v>

1916
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:03.540
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have any such thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to incorporate that</v>

1917
01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:05.440
<v Speaker 2>into their flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1918
01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:10.320

<v Speaker 2>is a balancing tool we have when we have</v>

1934
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I was running nightclubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running nightclubs.</v>

1935
01:30:53.701 --> 01:30:57.510
<v Speaker 2>The nightclub business since I was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually had any bounce.</v>

1936
01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know how old they'd know it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old mouth because I was six,</v>

1937
01:31:00.591 --> 01:31:05.591
<v Speaker 2>four and 180 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was tall and I started bouncing</v>

1938
01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:09.000
<v Speaker 2>when I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once if I was 17 and get the hell out of</v>

1939
01:31:09.001 --> 01:31:10.200
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not old enough,</v>

1940
01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:14.700
<v Speaker 2>but I came back when I was 18 and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was bar backing and bartending and I was</v>

1941
01:31:14.701 --> 01:31:19.080
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran a small rock and roll joint at 22</v>

1942
01:31:19.081 --> 01:31:22.380
<v Speaker 2>and a half years old and then I went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston.</v>

1943
01:31:22.381 --> 01:31:26.220
<v Speaker 2>I lived down there for awhile and Honky</v>
<v Speaker 2>tonks scene was insane.</v>

1944
01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Then I came back for a wedding and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a place in Asbury Park,</v>

1945
01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:31.650
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where I'm from,</v>

1946
01:31:31.651 --> 01:31:32.484
<v Speaker 2>the Jersey shore.</v>

1947
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:35.610
<v Speaker 2>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell people this from this same</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jon Bon Jovi,</v>

1951
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.900
<v Speaker 2>and Bruce Bracing.</v>

1952
01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:51.120
<v Speaker 2>like saved Jersey shore area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1953
01:31:51.121 --> 01:31:52.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1954
01:31:52.231 --> 01:31:54.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back for a wedding and there was</v>

1955
01:31:54.631 --> 01:31:56.690
<v Speaker 2>this club opening up and so I went in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1956
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I talked to the guy and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1957
01:31:57.931 --> 01:31:58.980
<v Speaker 2>I need a head bartender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1958
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a head bartender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll be a general manager and I'll</v>

1959
01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 2>get behind the stick two days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this place was huge.</v>

1960
01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Like you stick the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get behind the bar and bartender.</v>

1961
01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:13.020
<v Speaker 2>No one's slower nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get behind the stadium,</v>

1962
01:32:13.050 --> 01:32:16.120
<v Speaker 2>behind the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stick,</v>

1963
01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:17.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1964
01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:18.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll put our place was.</v>

1965
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 2>It was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big.</v>

1966
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:23.020
<v Speaker 2>We had rock and roll and disco burst</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1967
01:32:23.021 --> 01:32:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Bruce springsteen ever sang dancing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dark was kind of with a band called</v>

1968
01:32:27.730 --> 01:32:30.520
<v Speaker 2>bystander and sang with them because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know Bruce Van,</v>

1969
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:35.440
<v Speaker 2>two blocks one block away was the stone</v>
<v Speaker 2>pony where I watched him probably 18</v>

1970
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:38.530
<v Speaker 2>sundays in a row play with a band called</v>
<v Speaker 2>cats on a smooth surface.</v>

1971
01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.200
<v Speaker 2>You just jump up and start playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1972
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:44.860
<v Speaker 2>and now how'd you go to pro wrestling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was running a club.</v>

1973
01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:48.460
<v Speaker 2>I tried it when I was 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was right before I started to</v>

1974
01:32:48.461 --> 01:32:49.870
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1975
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:53.740
<v Speaker 2>get a chance at running a club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had three matches.</v>

1976
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked,</v>

1977
01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I talked my knee and when I was 12 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

1978
01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:01.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love football and hockey.</v>

1979
01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Like in my mind I'm going to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive end for the New York giants.</v>

1980
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's my mind at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I walked back,</v>

1981
01:33:06.851 --> 01:33:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I hit by a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my face bounced off the hood,</v>

1982
01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 2>netsuite 42 feet and appointed him</v>
<v Speaker 2>ambassador Jesus Christ.</v>

1983
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:16.620
<v Speaker 2>No such thing as rehab in 1968.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they wouldn't let me play football or</v>

1984
01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.550
<v Speaker 2>hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there,</v>

1985
01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.730
<v Speaker 2>here's the two sports that you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken.</v>

1986
01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:22.960
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>

1987
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:26.080
<v Speaker 2>you can't get a doctor to sign for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they weren't going to sign for me.</v>

1988
01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:30.700
<v Speaker 2>So they gave me two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baseball and basketball.</v>

1989
01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I suck at both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And baseball,</v>

1990
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:37.510
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have somebody basketball</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

1991
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:40.700
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't even make the team in</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh grade and I didn't give a fuck</v>

1992
01:33:40.701 --> 01:33:42.730
<v Speaker 2>cause I didn't really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say you gotTa have somebody,</v>

1993
01:33:42.731 --> 01:33:44.110
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have someone to throw the</v>

1994
01:33:44.111 --> 01:33:46.900
<v Speaker 2>ball back and forth with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You to have nine guys.</v>

1995
01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:50.680
<v Speaker 2>You had to know yodlee seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that the play with another</v>

1996
01:33:50.681 --> 01:33:53.110
<v Speaker 2>seven or whatever and I just what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want of course,</v>

1997
01:33:53.111 --> 01:33:55.600
<v Speaker 2>but whatever you can do to make work for</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball,</v>

1998
01:33:55.601 --> 01:33:58.120
<v Speaker 2>you just need one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a ball in a hoop.</v>

1999
01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Eighth Grade I sat on the bench and</v>

2000
01:34:01.931 --> 01:34:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I'd never sat on the bench ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that's never happened to me</v>

2001
01:34:06.221 --> 01:34:08.380
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it taught me the greatest lesson.</v>

2002
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.010
<v Speaker 2>It taught me that summer I played every</v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2003
01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:14.800
<v Speaker 2>all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five hours a day,</v>

2004
01:34:14.801 --> 01:34:18.190
<v Speaker 2>minimum you when you're by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll lay ups,</v>

2005
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.690
<v Speaker 2>hooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foul shots,</v>

2006
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:22.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then games pickup in the beginning,</v>

2007
01:34:23.150 --> 01:34:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get picked up until the end</v>

2008
01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as time went on over that</v>

2009
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:29.440
<v Speaker 2>summer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept getting better and better and</v>

2010
01:34:29.441 --> 01:34:32.920
<v Speaker 2>better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My freshman year I started and we went</v>

2011
01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:34.960
<v Speaker 2>undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By my sophomore year I was playing</v>

2012
01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:39.250
<v Speaker 2>varsity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I realized that work ethic equals</v>

2013
01:34:39.251 --> 01:34:41.650
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the huge lesson I learned</v>

2014
01:34:41.651 --> 01:34:45.160
<v Speaker 2>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm 23 years old and I've,</v>

2015
01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hurt my knee,</v>

2016
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to take some time off away</v>

2017
01:34:49.661 --> 01:34:53.170
<v Speaker 2>from the dream of being a wrestler and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get caught in the booze,</v>

2018
01:34:53.171 --> 01:34:57.210
<v Speaker 2>the poets and the party because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>broad</v>

2019
01:34:58.940 --> 01:34:59.773
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

2020
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>And I was lucky that I had way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>parenting myself,</v>

2021
01:35:06.291 --> 01:35:08.390
<v Speaker 2>like getting into that whole Party</v>
<v Speaker 2>scene,</v>

2022
01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:11.690
<v Speaker 2>which I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but slowly I kind of backed myself out a</v>

2023
01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 2>little bit each year and I've got this</v>
<v Speaker 2>club in Fort Myers,</v>

2024
01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Florida time and this one I actually own</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little piece of my buddy Tony could</v>

2025
01:35:19.281 --> 01:35:22.040
<v Speaker 2>pharaoh and couple other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2026
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:26.010
<v Speaker 2>One night I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the office and we had a camera at</v>

2027
01:35:26.011 --> 01:35:29.120
<v Speaker 2>the backdoor and camera at the front</v>
<v Speaker 2>door in this place would hold legally,</v>

2028
01:35:29.121 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 2>probably about 600 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a thousand in there and I'm</v>

2029
01:35:34.011 --> 01:35:36.170
<v Speaker 2>looking to cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That person walks in,</v>

2030
01:35:36.171 --> 01:35:38.090
<v Speaker 2>looks just like kicked the snake</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roberts.</v>

2031
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of Jake Roberts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I frigging you outside of the</v>

2032
01:35:44.211 --> 01:35:46.160
<v Speaker 2>building come around because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to walk through the people.</v>

2033
01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.720
<v Speaker 2>And I go to this girl judy at the front.</v>

2034
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.780
<v Speaker 2>So I go to the guy just walked in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like Jake Roberts.</v>

2035
01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:51.920
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I practically go running it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like a huge mark.</v>

2038
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And when I see him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I slowed down</v>

2039
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:04.790
<v Speaker 2>over fanboy go one over bad boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

<v Speaker 2>who's like one of my favorite managers</v>

<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

2134
01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.190
<v Speaker 2>He's in that video and I'm picking up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drawers and I'm not talking to</v>

2135
01:40:50.191 --> 01:40:55.191
<v Speaker 2>anybody but myself and I say</v>
<v Speaker 2>cap with the rubber bands and the beard.</v>

2136
01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.660
<v Speaker 2>So I look up at that video and I go rock</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrestling.</v>

2137
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I should've been a part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I walk into my office now,</v>

2138
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:09.160
<v Speaker 2>other bartenders going to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>count their drawers right now.</v>

2139
01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 2>And smoky comes into my head bartender</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he comes,</v>

2140
01:41:12.011 --> 01:41:13.180
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>page check.</v>

2141
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Because my real first name is paige</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Falkenberg.</v>

2142
01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:21.590
<v Speaker 2>And my dad said that that names ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>dry.</v>

2143
01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Anybody hates Falkenberg is get a tough</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell.</v>

2144
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might Dallas page that makes sense.</v>

2145
01:41:28.511 --> 01:41:29.344
<v Speaker 2>Their work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2146
01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:33.100
<v Speaker 2>But my dad's page one and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm freaking,</v>

2147
01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your page two.</v>

2148
01:41:34.661 --> 01:41:35.494

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2149
01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.840
<v Speaker 2>As a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said he didn't like that.</v>

2150
01:41:37.841 --> 01:41:41.980
<v Speaker 2>So Dallas cowboys was my theme that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>loved the most when I was little kid</v>

2151
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:44.950
<v Speaker 2>don't know because of the stars or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and Landry and all that shit.</v>

2152
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:49.630
<v Speaker 2>And he ends up a nickname me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dallas.</v>

2153
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:51.580
<v Speaker 2>So I always loved that name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's put them together.</v>

2154
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:53.060
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2155
01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:56.040
<v Speaker 2>So I tried that as handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2156
01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Speaker 2>So bottom line is smokey comes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and he goes,</v>

2157
01:41:59.550 --> 01:42:01.110
<v Speaker 2>page jake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes up,</v>

2158
01:42:02.290 --> 01:42:03.610
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean rock and wrestling?</v>

2159
01:42:03.610 --> 01:42:04.990

2352
01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:55.560
<v Speaker 2>That was the beginning of everything.</v>

01:51:02.531 --> 01:51:07.330
<v Speaker 2>anything to my career early on.</v>

01:51:07.331 --> 01:51:11.440
<v Speaker 2>there for cody because I get choked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>just thinking about it without dusty</v>

<v Speaker 2>Rhodes original Diamond Dallas page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave me every break I ever had and</v>

2358
01:51:16.451 --> 01:51:21.451
<v Speaker 2>for me to watch his son do what they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>last weekend.</v>

2359
01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember your first match?</v>

2360
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:27.850
<v Speaker 2>My first,</v>

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Three and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I finally get the call because</v>

2363
01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:38.980
<v Speaker 2>dusty who went to wwe and he did just</v>
<v Speaker 2>polka dotted gimmick.</v>

2364
01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Willem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came back to run the to WCW and now</v>

01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:59.140

<v Speaker 2>It's really wears on your knees and</v>

2439
01:55:12.911 --> 01:55:15.580
<v Speaker 3>on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fucking kid is a stud.</v>

2440
01:55:15.581 --> 01:55:19.930
<v Speaker 3>He is a stud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did this stunt in cold water where</v>

2441
01:55:19.931 --> 01:55:23.410
<v Speaker 3>you had a dive into this cold water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold your breath in and complete this</v>

2442
01:55:23.411 --> 01:55:25.720
<v Speaker 3>stunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was in it for more than two</v>

2443
01:55:25.721 --> 01:55:28.110
<v Speaker 3>minutes holding his breath and cold</v>
<v Speaker 3>water enough,</v>

2444
01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about cold water that is</v>

2445
01:55:30.131 --> 01:55:34.050
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus very grueling physical activity.</v>

2446
01:55:34.051 --> 01:55:36.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just in cold water holding his</v>

2447
01:55:36.761 --> 01:55:39.190
<v Speaker 3>breath for two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is impressive enough as it is,</v>

2448
01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:43.710
<v Speaker 3>but he was swimming around and pulling</v>
<v Speaker 3>off like he blew everybody out of the</v>

2449
01:55:43.711 --> 01:55:44.280
<v Speaker 3>water</v>

2450
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.080
<v Speaker 2>and he told me he did a shitload of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

01:57:52.710 --> 01:57:57.120
<v Speaker 2>and there's times where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really real because your reality</v>

2502
01:57:57.121 --> 01:57:59.220
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as real life in</v>

2503
01:57:59.221 --> 01:58:02.010
<v Speaker 2>reality show shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of their stuff you</v>

2504
01:58:02.011 --> 01:58:05.340
<v Speaker 2>could tell that they're like shooting on</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they want the real,</v>

2505
01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:06.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real deal.</v>

2506
01:58:06.810 --> 01:58:09.810
<v Speaker 2>But he told that story like he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>backstage,</v>

2507
01:58:09.811 --> 01:58:12.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of his suits on and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife there he goes,</v>

2508
01:58:12.031 --> 01:58:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come here and database Kabir let,</v>

2509
01:58:14.290 --> 01:58:16.290
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about the story when we first</v>
<v Speaker 2>met.</v>

2510
01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:21.620
<v Speaker 2>And I just knew that that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's hit a couple of roadblocks</v>

2511
01:58:21.631 --> 01:58:23.700
<v Speaker 2>along the way that he could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could have quit.</v>

2512
01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:25.560
<v Speaker 2>He could've walked away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have not.</v>

2513
01:58:25.710 --> 01:58:28.650
<v Speaker 2>But he had such a belief in himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell people,</v>

2514
01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:33.860
<v Speaker 2>never underestimate the power you give</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself by believing in you.</v>

2515
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:38.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's who the MS is and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be a huge.</v>

2516
01:58:38.490 --> 01:58:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact we get a of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>slat now because of the man.</v>

2517
01:58:42.970 --> 01:58:47.410
<v Speaker 2>The Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest star in the world is one of</v>

2518
01:58:47.411 --> 01:58:49.600
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

<v Speaker 2>ever seen and I was flying home.</v>

<v Speaker 2>seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's laughing so hard,</v>

2526
01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:08.650
<v Speaker 2>but I'm laughing because I'm watching it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know what they're saying or an</v>

2527
01:59:08.651 --> 01:59:11.500
<v Speaker 2>idea of it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just pulled them over for a second.</v>

2536
01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I just because I don't really know him</v>
<v Speaker 2>that well,</v>

2537
01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:37.660
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to know.</v>

2538
01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I wanted him to know that I was so proud</v>
<v Speaker 2>of him not for what he's done is an</v>

2539
01:59:42.911 --> 01:59:45.430
<v Speaker 2>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I'm super proud of him on</v>

2540
01:59:45.431 --> 01:59:47.710
<v Speaker 2>that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how he carried the company on his</v>

2541
01:59:47.711 --> 01:59:52.711
<v Speaker 2>back for over a decade and still did so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much work for charity mean it was mind</v>

2542
01:59:53.191 --> 01:59:56.260
<v Speaker 2>boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no one has done more along that</v>

<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony was here right now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is that this group,</v>

2606
02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:05.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean Hulk Hogan was probably one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first big guys that transcend into</v>

2607

<v Speaker 1>Dick robbers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of all the guys that I know,</v>

02:08:39.821 --> 02:08:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody counted them out and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking stronger.</v>

2727
02:08:41.981 --> 02:08:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Never again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2728
02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:44.121
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

2729
02:08:44.121 --> 02:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>we're going to move around a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on to hit you a little bit,</v>

2730
02:08:47.361 --> 02:08:52.361
<v Speaker 1>a little bit with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>little hole mania music.</v>

2731
02:08:53.970 --> 02:08:57.490
<v Speaker 1>They're just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was snug.</v>

2732
02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Stallone was so slim and trim back</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2733
02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hilarious that he was</v>

2734
02:09:03.791 --> 02:09:06.970
<v Speaker 1>playing a heavyweight champion because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a big guy.</v>

2735
02:09:07.330 --> 02:09:10.900
<v Speaker 1>He really is more like a middleweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Hogan was.</v>

2736
02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he wouldn't even be able to back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these days.</v>

2737
02:09:14.141 --> 02:09:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you be able to make the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Weight limit UFC as a 265 pound</v>

2738
02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 1>cutoff for whatever reason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2739
02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:21.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>

2740
02:09:21.371 --> 02:09:23.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no super heavyweight division</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2741
02:09:23.471 --> 02:09:24.500
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2742
02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:26.620
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a super heavyweight division.</v>

2743
02:09:26.621 --> 02:09:29.020
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the UFC is never implemented it,</v>

2744
02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:32.110
<v Speaker 1>so it's been sanctioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a 265 and above,</v>

2745
02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but the UFC heavyweight division has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutoff and the bunch of guys have had to</v>

2746
02:09:37.631 --> 02:09:39.310
<v Speaker 1>cut weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brock's a big example.</v>

2747
02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Brock had to cut weight to make to 65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francis and gone.</v>

2748
02:09:43.081 --> 02:09:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silvia.</v>

2749
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Few guys have had to actually cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2750
02:09:45.670 --> 02:09:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Mark Hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut weight to make to 65 work.</v>

2751
02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Mark's about walking around in tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

2752
02:09:51.281 --> 02:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>10 to 90.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just bad.</v>

2753
02:09:54.250 --> 02:09:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad man mark on.</v>

2754
02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:00.820
<v Speaker 1>But I love about sly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

2755
02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:02.830
<v Speaker 1>you go back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know that story.</v>

2756
02:10:02.831 --> 02:10:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how he wrote that script or</v>

2757
02:10:06.071 --> 02:10:11.071
<v Speaker 1>rocking would not sell it and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>all 300 like Ryan O'neal to play rock.</v>

2758
02:10:11.241 --> 02:10:13.360
<v Speaker 1>You're someone called Paul Newman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was.</v>

2759
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was Ryan O'neil,</v>

2760
02:10:15.431 --> 02:10:18.490
<v Speaker 1>they wanted Ryan o'neal to play rocky</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he held out and he's like,</v>

2761
02:10:18.491 --> 02:10:19.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking wrote this.</v>

2762
02:10:19.901 --> 02:10:22.350
<v Speaker 1>This is me your vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

2763
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:27.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the greatest example of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>positively unstoppable in owning it.</v>

2764
02:10:27.410 --> 02:10:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Like just alone could have written this</v>
<v Speaker 1>book or has 100,000 times and when you</v>

2765
02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>

2766
02:10:33.450 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of my mentors without me</v>

2767
02:10:36.021 --> 02:10:37.420
<v Speaker 1>knowing him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2768
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:41.570
<v Speaker 1>because I've just watched how he's lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>his life and he's recreated themselves</v>

2769
02:10:41.571 --> 02:10:45.170
<v Speaker 1>so many times and that's what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to crazies of the guys</v>

2770
02:10:45.171 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 1>doing the expendables as a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>action star.</v>

2771
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:52.930
<v Speaker 1>He's in his seven deans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fuck in their seventies is</v>

2772
02:10:52.941 --> 02:10:57.890
<v Speaker 1>believable in inaction is guys have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat people up and movies like a</v>

2773
02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:00.020
<v Speaker 1>suspension of disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let it slide,</v>

2774
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:02.720
<v Speaker 1>but when you see him doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2775
02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I kind of believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's still jacked at 70,</v>

2776
02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:08.270
<v Speaker 1>72,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 73 years old.</v>

2777
02:11:08.271 --> 02:11:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is he now?</v>

2778
02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Seventy two years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking insane.</v>

2779
02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you a behind the scenes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>stone cold Steve Austin,</v>

2780
02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:19.550
<v Speaker 1>who was like a brother to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real one,</v>

2781
02:11:19.551 --> 02:11:21.680
<v Speaker 1>like literally we lived together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wrote together,</v>

2782
02:11:21.681 --> 02:11:24.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my best friends and he's doing</v>

<v Speaker 1>the first expendables and he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about,</v>

2784
02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's on the set for about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks by this time and he</v>

2785
02:11:34.671 --> 02:11:35.960
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2790

<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2792
02:11:56.361 --> 02:11:59.060
<v Speaker 1>when he were doing the Hollywood fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the back,</v>

02:12:08.931 --> 02:12:12.860
<v Speaker 1>He's got these fucking screws keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>his spine together in his neck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of his neck.</v>

2800
02:12:19.521 --> 02:12:24.260

<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

2840

<v Speaker 2>Let's figure this out after.</v>

2842

<v Speaker 2>The one thing I want to do about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you about the positively</v>

2843
02:14:15.211 --> 02:14:16.770

<v Speaker 2>When to come out.</v>

2844
02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:19.440
<v Speaker 2>The Art of owning it doesn't come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>until January,</v>

2845
02:14:19.650 --> 02:14:20.850
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my goal.</v>

2846
02:14:20.930 --> 02:14:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had two books before this.</v>

2847
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't push them to be best sellers</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they weren't really worthy.</v>

2848
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:31.260
<v Speaker 2>This is because I know it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really help people and here's the hook</v>

2849
02:14:31.261 --> 02:14:33.300

<v Speaker 2>gets released and talk about this,</v>

2897
02:16:56.770 --> 02:16:59.170
<v Speaker 2>but I've got a new documentary coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2898
02:16:59.171 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 2>You've already seen and I know you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to love the resurrection.</v>

2899
02:17:02.050 --> 02:17:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Jake the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to see that.</v>

2900
02:17:03.370 --> 02:17:06.310
<v Speaker 2>We just took it off Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only on itunes.</v>

2901
02:17:06.311 --> 02:17:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like ninety nine cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely the look up to inspire.</v>

2902
02:17:10.590 --> 02:17:13.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has some sort of addiction in</v>

2903
02:17:13.391 --> 02:17:14.680
<v Speaker 2>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's their uncle,</v>

2904
02:17:14.681 --> 02:17:16.540
<v Speaker 2>their father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sister or brother.</v>

2905
02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:22.200
<v Speaker 2>There's somewhere around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had so many people come up to me in</v>

2906
02:17:22.991 --> 02:17:25.330
<v Speaker 2>so many people have come up to Jake and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2907
02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:30.520
<v Speaker 2>that movie changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say I'm three months sober,</v>

2908
02:17:30.690 --> 02:17:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I am two years sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that movie changed my life and Jake</v>

2909
02:17:36.370 --> 02:17:40.750
<v Speaker 2>doing the program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gave him a way to get wins,</v>

2910
02:17:40.751 --> 02:17:45.230
<v Speaker 2>meaning like going from 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven pounds to under 302 to 78 and you</v>

2911
02:17:45.231 --> 02:17:46.270
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

2912
02:17:46.510 --> 02:17:49.420
<v Speaker 2>But being able to move more and be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel better.</v>

2913
02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:54.550
<v Speaker 2>So resurrection gives you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration and you just watched</v>

2914
02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:56.230

<v Speaker 2>it's called relentless and it goes from</v>

2920

<v Speaker 2>the day that Kevin Nash blows my back</v>

<v Speaker 2>vice versa.</v>

2923
