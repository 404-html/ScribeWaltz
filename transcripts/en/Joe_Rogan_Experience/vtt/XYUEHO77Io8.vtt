29
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.410

<v Speaker 1>it's just a little window open.</v>

30
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm so clever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it so I can read your shit though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What do you give a fuck?</v>

43
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And you're telling me that pcs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another better than Max.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

47
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why you bring me one dude who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had a virus on his fucking Mac one.</v>

48
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.050
<v Speaker 1>I know everyone I know who's had a pc </v>
<v Speaker 1>except food and chicken.</v>

49
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>He claims to have never gotten a virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lie.</v>

50
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets viruses on pcs.</v>

51
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Just that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to get a Mac.</v>

52
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max,</v>

53
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:43.400
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking crash nearly as much.</v>

<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

55
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Everything else on the computer work </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

56
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.320

57
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>stop worrying about Mac versus pc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a goddamn operating system.</v>

58
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Republicans versus the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats.</v>

59
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people on one side or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other or just on a fucking team and </v>

60
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>they're simple little brains are stuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that team.</v>

61
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>They might not even agree with half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit the Republican say,</v>

62
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>but they support them and even say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>we got to support our team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with they're doing right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

65
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>but what's important is we support them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know push forward and we get a </v>

66
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Republican office 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah,</v>

67
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.360
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just the Washington redskins </v>

68
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.360
<v Speaker 1>versus the fucking Miami Dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all that shit is.</v>

69
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>It's teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like Boston versus Philly.</v>

70
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Philly soaks posted rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same ironic bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no fucking philly.</v>

379
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I've never done coke any ever because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in high school,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my friend Jimmy has cousin of selling </v>

<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

382
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.320
<v Speaker 1>he was selling it and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was doing that he lost all this </v>

383
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:38.261
<v Speaker 1>weight and he fucking who would like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide in the basement or in the attic </v>

384
00:17:38.261 --> 00:17:38.261
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I saw his whole life fall apart,</v>

387
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:47.060
<v Speaker 1>like I watched it happen and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>like saying that fucking stuff's bad for</v>

391
00:17:55.130 --> 00:18:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it was very obvious to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like the worst thing you could </v>

392
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.130
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nitrous?</v>

<v Speaker 1>like from whippets did it once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once when I worked at a ice cream place,</v>

395
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a headache.</v>

<v Speaker 1>only one time and it was awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the next day was so bad.</v>

399
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.570
<v Speaker 1>The next day I was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brain was like,</v>

400
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:26.690
<v Speaker 1>it felt like a sponge than had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrung out dry and then just left in the </v>

00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 1>sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

402
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.900
<v Speaker 1>And then you try to like clean something</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

403

<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so my brain was so dumb.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's got to be fucking terrible for you.</v>

407
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what it was in it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not have just been mdm,</v>

408
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:52.041
<v Speaker 1>a pure Mtma.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and I was trying to read a magazine and </v>

415
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even fucking concentrate on us.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That night.</v>

419
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I can understand why people do it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess if you're not a big reader,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The next day wouldn't be a problem,</v>

421
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

422
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people say there's no the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next day they feel.</v>

423
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:26.160

424
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:31.180
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just depends on how it's like </v>

425
00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.740
<v Speaker 3>strychnine in it and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ever candy flipped where it's a </v>

426
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 3>piece of candy and has ecstasy on one </v>
<v Speaker 3>side and acid on the other side of her.</v>

427
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:38.630
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great combo.</v>

428
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

429
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.080
<v Speaker 3>But I've heard it's like whenever you </v>
<v Speaker 3>combine things like that,</v>

430
00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:45.770
<v Speaker 3>the recovery times just accelerated even</v>
<v Speaker 3>more time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's the best weed?</v>

433
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.100

442
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.990
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's cool about California </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that you get to go these </v>

443
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.451
<v Speaker 1>places and experiment with all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different strains with Joel Diaz mixes </v>

<v Speaker 1>obliterated every day now.</v>

469
00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's just healthy.</v>

470
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

478
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the message board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a Gig in Sydney,</v>

<v Speaker 1>had a great fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian people are the shit that show</v>

480
00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 1>was fun man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the show was.</v>

481
00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been better because I got too</v>

482
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 1>drunk the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we got too drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brain was,</v>

484
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:30.210
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucked up because I could not </v>

485
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.220
<v Speaker 1>sleep because you're 19 hours ahead when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to Australia,</v>

486
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.870
<v Speaker 1>so your body doesn't know what time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

487
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I'd be exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to sleep three hours later I'd wake</v>

488
00:22:34.871 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 1>up and I didn't know what I thought I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was taking a nap.</v>

489
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Like my body had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not sleep for like eight hours </v>

<v Speaker 1>What's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's fucking phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's told me they write about them in </v>

543
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:43.540
<v Speaker 1>the paper when he was at a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in America you can't,</v>

544
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.130
<v Speaker 1>can't fucking get traction for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

545
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Some UFC that was great use arch </v>
<v Speaker 1>Barker's gigantic in Australia.</v>

546
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Fucking monstrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sold out someplace.</v>

547
00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly it was like a 1500 seat </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

548
00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Sold it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like 20 something nights in a </v>

549
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:01.960
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

550
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 1>just craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love American comedians over there.</v>

551
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:07.460
<v Speaker 1>So the show was fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time.</v>

552
00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Few people walked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's going to happen and if you </v>

553
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 1>don't know what you're getting into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

554
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I always try to tell people that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a big sign in the front of the</v>

555
00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:19.200
<v Speaker 1>show that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warning,</v>

556
00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:24.201
<v Speaker 1>this show will contain language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>material as extreme as you could </v>

557
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.190
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine.</v>

558
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.240
<v Speaker 1>But apparently some of the shit I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>people couldn't imagine.</v>

559
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't know what to expect but </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry you bummed out,</v>

560
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:37.910
<v Speaker 1>but I'm 99 percent of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a great fucking time.</v>

561
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:38.890
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty wild.</v>

562
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Crazy show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also it was because we were hammered</v>

563
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:44.240
<v Speaker 1>that night too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two nights in a row we got barbecued,</v>

564
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.630
<v Speaker 1>so I was planning on going to Australia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing all this.</v>

565
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Writing the alcohol just sticks a fork </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all those plans.</v>

566
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

567
00:25:52.791 --> 00:25:57.791
<v Speaker 1>you said that when he flew to Australia </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 17 hours whereas the flight </v>

568
00:25:57.791 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 1>really did it really feel like 17 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>because at the point where you were just</v>

569
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:00.380
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

570
00:26:00.381 --> 00:26:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I need to jump off this plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is too much or no,</v>

571
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

572
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.450
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that bad.</v>

577
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.991

<v Speaker 1>The real problem was once I got there I </v>

578

<v Speaker 3>I'd been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

597
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:02.331
<v Speaker 3>let me hang out in your bedroom up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine flying 16 hours from one</v>

598
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:03.680
<v Speaker 3>of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ask chairs.</v>

599
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Just jam next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralphie may on one side and Kevin Smith </v>

600
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.201
<v Speaker 3>and the other after they ran a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that somebody actually.</v>

601
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Smith</v>

602
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.740
<v Speaker 1>dumber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not know who he.</v>

603
00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess a lot of people don't know who </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>

604
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Like the way he looks like they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that that's all.</v>

605
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:27.010
<v Speaker 1>That's that famous director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might want to shut the fuck up that </v>

606
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 1>guys on twitter all day every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably ruined southwest.</v>

607
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.130
<v Speaker 1>That cost them money for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>

608
00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of me thinks so.</v>

609
00:27:33.671 --> 00:27:36.340
<v Speaker 3>But then the other part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just got so much attention,</v>

610
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.220
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially if you hate fat people,</v>

611
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

612
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to southwest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they lost the fat dollar.</v>

613
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.730
<v Speaker 3>I bet there's a lot of fat people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>got bummed out.</v>

614
00:27:45.731 --> 00:27:47.850
<v Speaker 3>How's Ralphie may fly southwest because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he it.</v>

615
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.420
<v Speaker 3>You know how much money that probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>saved them.</v>

616
00:27:49.421 --> 00:27:52.030
<v Speaker 3>All these pissed off fat people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>flying southwest now.</v>

617
00:27:52.031 --> 00:27:57.031
<v Speaker 3>Just save them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's already studies that they were </v>

618
00:27:57.031 --> 00:27:58.180
<v Speaker 3>thinking this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were thinking about making you take</v>

619
00:27:58.181 --> 00:28:03.181
<v Speaker 3>a shit before you flew because they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>found out that if they made everyone go </v>

620
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:03.760
<v Speaker 3>to the bathroom before they got on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>airplane,</v>

621
00:28:03.761 --> 00:28:05.890
<v Speaker 3>that they would say so many dollars per </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

622
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Like this was a real study that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were going into southwest.</v>

623
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.650
<v Speaker 3>This wasn't southwest system is American</v>
<v Speaker 3>Airlines or something like that.</v>

624
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 3>So can you imagine now that they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these fat people pissed off that </v>

625
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.860
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to fly southwest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably,</v>

626
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.350
<v Speaker 3>they're probably earning $5,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars a year.</v>

627
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Cost them more to fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fuel wise to Australia for a fat </v>

628
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 1>guy then for electricity.</v>

629
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's big enough times 100 then </v>

630
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:32.390
<v Speaker 3>that than you would imagine.</v>

631
00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

632
00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of makes sense.</v>

633
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe southwest paid Kevin Smith and </v>

634
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:41.610
<v Speaker 3>theirs is all just to save them a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>

635
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.120
<v Speaker 3>A couple million a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never do.</v>

636
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like the integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him.</v>

637
00:28:47.201 --> 00:28:47.380
<v Speaker 3>He was</v>

638
00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:48.520
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't do that.</v>

639
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.700
<v Speaker 1>He is really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy.</v>

640
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I met him when I came into k rock once.</v>

<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>

716
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.240

<v Speaker 3>people to just be able to get in touch </v>

<v Speaker 3>because have you ever seen him on the </v>

729

<v Speaker 3>couch?</v>

730
00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:40.770
<v Speaker 3>I forget</v>

731
00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 1>who it was in the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like cracking jokes.</v>

732
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.940
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't it would be a good like good side</v>

733
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:47.720
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

734
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know like have like a straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and then he gets the side guy.</v>

735
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 1>What is my take on the weed stores in </v>
<v Speaker 1>La?</v>

736
00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Getting raided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fucking sucks.</v>

737
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing makes me,</v>

738
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.440
<v Speaker 1>it makes me sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

739
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.760
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so strange,</v>

740
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange that they're still </v>

741
00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.891
<v Speaker 1>fucking with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the way the law is presented </v>

742
00:33:11.891 --> 00:33:11.891
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and California and I,</v>

743
00:33:11.891 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

744
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.520
<v Speaker 1>is that they believe that the way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law is presented is that you can give </v>

745
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:23.621
<v Speaker 1>weed away and you can sell it as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not making a profit and that </v>

746
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 1>these collectives are supposed to be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide medical patients with marijuana.</v>

747
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:34.121
<v Speaker 1>But apparently there's people out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are flaunting the wealth and </v>

748
00:33:34.121 --> 00:33:35.030
<v Speaker 1>they're making a fuck load of money off </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

749
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Millions and millions of dollars off </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling wheat.</v>

750
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>

751
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.950
<v Speaker 1>there's two parts of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one part of me that says,</v>

752
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:43.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

753
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be able to sell it.</v>

754
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:46.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

755
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you guys are Douche bags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But another part of me says,</v>

756
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.690
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'd be better.</v>

757
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be really in the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of weed.</v>

758
00:33:52.941 --> 00:33:57.941
<v Speaker 1>If it was free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you really would be in the spirit </v>

759
00:33:57.941 --> 00:33:58.820
<v Speaker 1>of weed that it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there isn't a for profit.</v>

760
00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will don't,</v>

761
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:05.310
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stores couldn't exist and they </v>

762
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.310
<v Speaker 1>couldn't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

763
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.011
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that hard to grow them and </v>

764
00:34:09.011 --> 00:34:09.011
<v Speaker 1>people would still grow and sell weed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

765
00:34:09.011 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Speaker 1>people will sell it illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

766
00:34:09.441 --> 00:34:10.760
<v Speaker 1>there would be plenty of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

767
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want good weed,</v>

768
00:34:12.311 --> 00:34:14.240
<v Speaker 1>you got to talk to this guy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

769
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.230
<v Speaker 1>But I kinda liked the idea of it not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being for profit.</v>

770
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.150
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

771
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bugs me,</v>

772
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 1>that people are overcharging for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant just because it's illegal and it's</v>

773
00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some places it's super expensive,</v>

774
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

775
00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:31.430
<v Speaker 1>$600 an ounce for like really powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potent weed,</v>

776
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I understand that God should get </v>

777
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.370
<v Speaker 1>paid for is growing and this and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I totally respect that.</v>

778
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to make a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money for it.</v>

779
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:44.981
<v Speaker 1>But if it was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be way fucking cheaper than it </v>

780
00:34:44.981 --> 00:34:49.001
<v Speaker 1>is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is the reason why it's </v>

781
00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:51.401
<v Speaker 1>expensive at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why these guys can make </v>

782
00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:53.891
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars in profit off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling weed is only because it's </v>

783
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.100
<v Speaker 1>illegal and difficult to get and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get it from these places.</v>

784
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.530
<v Speaker 1>If marijuana was legal and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow your own,</v>

785
00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.470
<v Speaker 1>which is how it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have no need to buy it.</v>

786
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:05.650
<v Speaker 1>You could have a little fucking plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>your backyard or in my closet is like </v>

787
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:05.840
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

788
00:35:05.841 --> 00:35:08.210
<v Speaker 1>This guy got fucking arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

789
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:13.510
<v Speaker 1>This guy just got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy just got arrested with 24 </v>

790
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.691
<v Speaker 1>different counts and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge him and the way it works </v>

791
00:35:16.691 --> 00:35:20.951
<v Speaker 1>apparently is what Obama has said is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not going to charge people </v>

792
00:35:20.951 --> 00:35:24.560
<v Speaker 1>who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were only violating federal law </v>

793
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:24.560
<v Speaker 1>federally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal.</v>

794
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.870
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go after people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to violate both the federal and </v>

795
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:32.231
<v Speaker 1>state laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to follow the state law to </v>

796
00:35:32.231 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 1>the letter and they're making an example</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of this one dude.</v>

797
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

798
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:39.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go and get a license,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to grow white seven or </v>

799
00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:39.041
<v Speaker 1>something like</v>

800
00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:39.041
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

801
00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:43.580
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to grow a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to have like a half a </v>

802
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.950
<v Speaker 2>pound of weed and get the other license </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do up to like 21 plants.</v>

803
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:47.680
<v Speaker 2>So I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

804
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.700
<v Speaker 2>you have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some reason they asked me if I need </v>

805
00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 2>an exemption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said what's an exemption for?</v>

806
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

807
00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:00.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regular amount of weed is not </v>

808
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.230
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although yes,</v>

809
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 2>the regular amount is not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need more.</v>

810
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 2>You could pretty much anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone can get back.</v>

811
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Even even kids could probably get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

812
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.560
<v Speaker 2>but if they can get that license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you just grow within your amount,</v>

813
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:15.590
<v Speaker 2>you could pretty much do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if the cops came over your </v>

814
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:15.590
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

815
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.630
<v Speaker 2>But it could be people that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the room to grow and they don't want to </v>

816
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.371
<v Speaker 2>be hassled and they want to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and purchase it at a reasonable </v>

817
00:36:22.371 --> 00:36:22.371
<v Speaker 2>rate.</v>

818
00:36:22.371 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 2>And I agree that there is a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate.</v>

819
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:26.880
<v Speaker 2>But right now the rate is so high that </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is worth more than gold.</v>

820
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana is worth more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth more per pound than gold is.</v>

821
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 2>That seems a little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

822
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:37.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely inflated because of the </v>

823
00:36:37.701 --> 00:36:39.861
<v Speaker 2>fact that there's no competition because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the fact that it's illegal and it's </v>

824
00:36:39.861 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 2>so fucking plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be legal.</v>

825
00:36:40.141 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Everybody should be able to grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it was legal,</v>

826
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.700
<v Speaker 2>there would be nobody making millions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and millions of dollars off of.</v>

827
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.720
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is it would fuck the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy up because pharmaceutical </v>

828
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.360
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking nosedive,</v>

829
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 2>there'd be so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical products.</v>

830
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 2>That would be that there would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>

831
00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

832
00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I believe that to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right now I have,</v>

833
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:05.460
<v Speaker 2>we whenever I want have wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still have Tom's for my stomach.</v>

834
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I still have aspirin for headaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

835
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.740
<v Speaker 2>they didn't replace any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have fucking glow coma dude.</v>

836
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different medications </v>

837
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:15.760
<v Speaker 2>for add.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot.</v>

838
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Those are the billion dollar medicines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not tom's Bro.</v>

839
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.880
<v Speaker 2>But you know what description and most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these people that are saying that </v>

840
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.230
<v Speaker 2>it's the best drug for a glaucoma and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff are just hippies wanting.</v>

841
00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:27.310
<v Speaker 2>We'd to be illegal because if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at them,</v>

842
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.880
<v Speaker 2>the medication for Glaucoma in </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison,</v>

843
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I bet you it's better than not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the best for interocular pressure.</v>

844
00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:39.780
<v Speaker 2>I believe that it's what's called when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Glaucoma.</v>

845
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:44.781
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's very painful for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and marijuana apparently is the best at </v>

846
00:37:44.781 --> 00:37:48.771
<v Speaker 2>relieving that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best ever restoring people's </v>

847
00:37:48.771 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 2>appetite when they have chemotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why cancer patients like it.</v>

848
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:55.190
<v Speaker 2>It's the best at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suppressed that a lot of different </v>

849
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.190
<v Speaker 2>things do.</v>

850
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 2>There's people that have had kids that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have autism.</v>

851
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a video that we showed them that</v>
<v Speaker 2>clip that autism and that was the only </v>

852
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 2>thing that calm the kid down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made him normal was we'd,</v>

853
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great for a lot of different things</v>

854
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:10.041
<v Speaker 2>and all those different things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription drugs that are worth </v>

855
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:12.210
<v Speaker 2>fucking billions of dollars every year </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pharmaceutical companies,</v>

856
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 2>which is why they lobby against </v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational drugs,</v>

857
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:21.130
<v Speaker 2>so called recreational drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just why to this day partnership </v>

858
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:24.180
<v Speaker 2>for drug free America to this day gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>money from pharmaceutical companies.</v>

859
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 2>They got money from alcohol companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tobacco companies,</v>

860
00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:30.180
<v Speaker 2>millions and millions of dollars in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past and because of that there was a lot</v>

861
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 2>of criticism so they no longer get money</v>
<v Speaker 2>from alcohol and tobacco companies,</v>

862
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:38.391
<v Speaker 2>but they still get money from </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies and </v>

863
00:38:38.391 --> 00:38:38.391
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical</v>

864
00:38:38.391 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 3>companies are responsible for oxycodone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vicodin,</v>

865
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 3>percocet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit.</v>

866
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 3>I still don't think it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if they made it legal,</v>

867
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 3>like all these companies are going go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of business.</v>

868
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I know my mom's not going to be smoking </v>
<v Speaker 3>weed.</v>

869
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:48.220

<v Speaker 3>Be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll take.</v>

871
00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 3>The other thing would be dumb enough for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few generations.</v>

872
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:58.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be dominoes we just doesn't </v>

<v Speaker 3>work with and that's like that's percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 percent is that in exchange for the </v>

874
00:39:00.511 --> 00:39:00.511
<v Speaker 3>things that we do</v>

875
00:39:00.511 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not 50 or 60 percent will weed is a</v>

876
00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 1>real effective medicine for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>

877
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly it be great for </v>
<v Speaker 1>textiles.</v>

878
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 1>It would be great for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat it.</v>

879
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the seeds,</v>

881
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amino acids.</v>

882
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that marijuana is good for </v>

883
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 1>besides just just getting you high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

884
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible that it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really mind blowing that it's </v>

885
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.731
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in 2010 with the access to </v>

886
00:39:29.731 --> 00:39:30.070
<v Speaker 1>information than we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's still illegal.</v>

<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

930
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:34.410
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a piece of soap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It smokes like a smokes.</v>

931
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Smokes like hash in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It smells like a Hippie,</v>

932
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:42.990
<v Speaker 3>like petroleum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It smells like Petroli when it burns </v>

933
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:42.990
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

934
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like,</v>

935
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a hash kind of feeling.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

940
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I said that incorrectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something else that,</v>

941
00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that marijuana was more expensive than </v>
<v Speaker 1>per ounce.</v>

942
00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.630
<v Speaker 1>It was oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

943
00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Worth more than oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worth more than something that's </v>

944
00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:13.380
<v Speaker 1>worth a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will magically be retarded for the </v>

977
00:43:46.401 --> 00:43:48.321
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably be communicating with </v>

978
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:50.330
<v Speaker 1>aliens permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably be locked into another </v>

979
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:50.580
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

980
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.800
<v Speaker 1>tell Jerry Garcia smoking opium wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted addicted.</v>

981
00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.590
<v Speaker 1>He moved to smoking black tar heroin </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>

982
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for sure.</v>

983
00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Did they used to have an opium dens back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wild west?</v>

984
00:44:05.431 --> 00:44:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't you remember?</v>

985
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.240
<v Speaker 3>But I never wanted it open the next day </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought about,</v>

986
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.170
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need it.</v>

987
00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was never like that.</v>

988
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Cocaine was kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for me by that opiod never was like </v>

989
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:21.290
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was more of like a treat like a </v>

990
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.290
<v Speaker 3>dessert.</v>

991
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

992
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a good argument because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument was on the message board as </v>

993
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.821
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were talking about things being </v>

994
00:44:27.821 --> 00:44:29.531
<v Speaker 1>addictive and hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with even alcohol being </v>

995
00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:29.531
<v Speaker 1>addictive is that it's not addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>

996
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not addicted to.</v>

997
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not have a drink every day for </v>

998
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.410
<v Speaker 1>the rest of my life and I'd have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with that.</v>

999
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:38.730
<v Speaker 1>But I like to have a drink sometimes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on stage.</v>

1000
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a drink sometimes my </v>
<v Speaker 1>buddies just to make things fun.</v>

1001
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Just makes you get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay for it the next day though.</v>

1002
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Especially rh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1003
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.150
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get older,</v>

1004
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:52.160
<v Speaker 1>do you pay for it more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is it's not </v>

1005
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:52.160
<v Speaker 1>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>

1006
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't hurt when I don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some people it is.</v>

1007
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Some people have to have a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was doing construction,</v>

1008
00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:01.610
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a dude who had a mountain dew </v>

1009
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:02.760
<v Speaker 1>bottle and he would fill it up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking beer,</v>

1010
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 1>just like cheap beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like colt 45 and he would drink beer all</v>

1011
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:08.160
<v Speaker 1>day while we worked all day.</v>

1012
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.130
<v Speaker 1>This guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was shaky.</v>

1013
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Jones and Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would show up for work though.</v>

1014
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:17.360
<v Speaker 1>He was there every fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven in the morning swinging that </v>

1015
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:17.360
<v Speaker 1>hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1016
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.920
<v Speaker 1>he was there pissing every five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was always hammered though.</v>

1017
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.560
<v Speaker 1>He was drinking beer all day for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude though.</v>

1018
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like everybody's got their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own biochemical makeup.</v>

1019
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're addicted to cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like Thompson Thompson,</v>

1020
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 1>guerra smoked cigarettes when he drinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't smoke other times and he can</v>

1021
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 1>go years without cigarettes with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1022
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.870
<v Speaker 1>But when he drinks he likes to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarette.</v>

1023
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.240
<v Speaker 1>When was the last meeting went a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no problem.</v>

1024
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:44.241
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's sending has taken a long time </v>

1025
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:46.251
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taking time off a bunch of times </v>

1026
00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:46.251
<v Speaker 1>and he won't smoke for months and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll have a cigarette,</v>

1027
00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:51.080
<v Speaker 1>they'll have a cigarette when he drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think cigarettes is like </v>

1028
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>that one thing that even if you quit </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

1029
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 1>it can be three years later in avondale </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they'll start smoking again.</v>

1030
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.760
<v Speaker 1>No reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you said that as soon as red.</v>

1031
00:45:57.761 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1032
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're doing something.</v>

1033
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Remember that movie the insider with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell Crowe or see that movie?</v>

1034
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:08.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all about like all the shit that </v>

1035
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:08.761
<v Speaker 1>they do to cigarettes to make it even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more addictive,</v>

1036
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:12.651
<v Speaker 1>like hundreds of different additives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of different additives just to </v>

1037
00:46:12.651 --> 00:46:13.970
<v Speaker 1>make it more addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>

1038
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I totally believe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1039
00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent believe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's the case,</v>

1040
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean who the fuck knows?</v>

1041
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean they say that cigarettes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

1042
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not as dangerous as heroin because </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin will kill you quicker and you can</v>

1043
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:30.831
<v Speaker 1>overdose from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But cigarettes will get you hooked </v>

1044
00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:30.831
<v Speaker 1>quicker than anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like apparently if you,</v>

1045
00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:33.720
<v Speaker 1>if you have that thing inside you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets you hooked to shit like that,</v>

1046
00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:37.390
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I that cigarettes do totally.</v>

1047
00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.130
<v Speaker 3>He with cocaine too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said?</v>

1048
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Well I almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was selling it and getting a </v>

1049
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.831
<v Speaker 3>large amounts of it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were allegedly allegedly selling </v>

1050
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:51.060
<v Speaker 3>really selling me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like this is like a character </v>

1051
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:55.141
<v Speaker 3>that would buy a large amount so he </v>
<v Speaker 3>could give it away and have some extra </v>

1052
00:46:55.141 --> 00:46:56.390
<v Speaker 3>for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Peter Pan of have.</v>

1053
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:57.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Peter Pan.</v>

1054
00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Robin Hood of cocaine was like one month</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my life back in [inaudible] 94 in </v>

1055
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:03.850
<v Speaker 3>this fictional story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's takes an old story.</v>

1056
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.490
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were rich,</v>

1057
00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.320
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you will,</v>

1058
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.200
<v Speaker 3>what if you like Jay z baller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1059
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:16.470
<v Speaker 3>private jet rich and you could just get </v>
<v Speaker 3>pure cocaine shipped right over here </v>

1060
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:20.401
<v Speaker 3>from the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The CIA would drop it off on your </v>

1061
00:47:20.401 --> 00:47:20.401
<v Speaker 3>doorstep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1062
00:47:20.401 --> 00:47:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I think I go back into the program.</v>

1063
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:25.570
<v Speaker 3>I think the only reason it was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>addictive to me because I am one of </v>

1064
00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:26.950
<v Speaker 3>those people that never go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors and I probably need to be one of</v>

1065
00:47:26.951 --> 00:47:31.951
<v Speaker 3>those people that are on speed or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something because I like having a </v>

1066
00:47:31.951 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 3>thyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like having a thyroid condition.</v>

1067
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Most of my day is spent like moping </v>
<v Speaker 3>around energy and stuff like that.</v>

1068
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1069
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.460
<v Speaker 3>when cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was alive for the first </v>

1070
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.381
<v Speaker 3>time and I think that's what was </v>
<v Speaker 3>addictive more of just like I felt like </v>

1071
00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I was out of some kind of coma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1072
00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:51.871
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well sometimes I'm having like a normal </v>

1073
00:47:51.871 --> 00:47:54.361
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not really into anything and </v>

1074
00:47:54.361 --> 00:47:54.361
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a cup of coffee and God damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1075
00:47:54.361 --> 00:47:54.361
<v Speaker 3>I just get fucking fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1076
00:47:54.361 --> 00:47:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1077
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel good about life.</v>

1078
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Fucking feels like the warm sun feels </v>
<v Speaker 3>better to clean my office.</v>

1079
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 3>We get a little fired up from </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulants,</v>

1080
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:02.260
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1081
00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.230
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're there for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cook it.</v>

1083
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:10.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what cocaine's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that I've had never stopped </v>

1084
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:11.380
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talked about this,</v>

1085
00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:17.730
<v Speaker 3>you would be talking so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your jaw would fly off and hit somebody </v>

1086
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:17.730
<v Speaker 3>in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have this</v>

1087
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:22.310
<v Speaker 1>think called Martin the coca and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tea that's made out of a,</v>

1088
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm talking to myself and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

1089
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:30.190
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monte to coco is a tea that's made out </v>

1090
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.490
<v Speaker 1>of a coca leaf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like cocaine,</v>

1091
00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:34.580
<v Speaker 1>the plant that they make cocaine from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the unprocessed forum,</v>

1092
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:35.540
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1093
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:40.370
<v Speaker 1>it's actually like indigenous people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shoe that I think it's improved.</v>

1094
00:48:40.371 --> 00:48:42.980
<v Speaker 1>They said it's like really common isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>approved.</v>

1095
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.840
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know he's outside smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes,</v>

1096
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.360
<v Speaker 1>talking to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1097
00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:47.870
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1098
00:48:47.871 --> 00:48:50.740
<v Speaker 1>they chew this leaf and it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for especially the people that,</v>

1099
00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:52.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are at high altitude,</v>

1100
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.310
<v Speaker 1>like a high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hurting communities,</v>

1101
00:48:55.311 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat this a true.</v>

1102
00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:02.150
<v Speaker 1>This tea is tea leaf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had it in a tea form and when I </v>

1103
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.810
<v Speaker 1>had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not good for me.</v>

1104
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't shut the fuck up.</v>

1105
00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Me and Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope are doing shrooms.</v>

1106
00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 1>It was the day the Iraq war started and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in the middle of the desert at </v>

1107
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.971
<v Speaker 1>my friend house and it's pretty crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're truman and right when the </v>

1108
00:49:15.971 --> 00:49:20.411
<v Speaker 1>shrooms we're kicking in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we noticed on the television set that </v>

1109
00:49:20.411 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 1>they were saying that the war coverage </v>
<v Speaker 1>begins at five and Stan hope looked at </v>

1110
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.180
<v Speaker 1>me and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking kickoff for the war.</v>

1111
00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it was like they were</v>

1112
00:49:29.361 --> 00:49:34.361
<v Speaker 1>telling us when the war coverage is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to start tuning in at five or war </v>

1113
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:34.910
<v Speaker 1>coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a kickoff.</v>

1114
00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.380
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the program,</v>

1115
00:49:36.381 --> 00:49:40.760
<v Speaker 1>the war program was going to start and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when this guy,</v>

1116
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:41.780
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend John,</v>

1117
00:49:41.781 --> 00:49:46.781
<v Speaker 1>who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done more psychedelics than anyone </v>

1118
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:46.781
<v Speaker 1>I've ever met ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely probably fried.</v>

1119
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:48.240
<v Speaker 1>His brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a cool podcast though.</v>

1120
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was talking about,</v>

1121
00:49:50.991 --> 00:49:53.030
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this motto to Coco.</v>

1122
00:49:53.031 --> 00:49:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It'll help the mushrooms kick in </v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker.</v>

1123
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1124
00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I could not shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was telling Doug while I was doing</v>

1125
00:50:02.241 --> 00:50:02.540
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1126
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:07.541
<v Speaker 1>I can't shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is driving me crazy and he was </v>

1127
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:10.690
<v Speaker 1>laughing uncontrollably because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was hilarious that I was </v>

1128
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:11.600
<v Speaker 1>talking about how I couldn't shut the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck up yet aware of it,</v>

1129
00:50:11.601 --> 00:50:11.680
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1130
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:14.590
<v Speaker 3>it's the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what you would you would.</v>

1131
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.640
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those drugs that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God he never tried because you </v>

1132
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.221
<v Speaker 3>would freak out and love it because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes your mind open up and just think </v>

1133
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:27.060
<v Speaker 3>so clear because you're just nonstop </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking of new stuff.</v>

1134
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1135
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 2>that's for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how my friend Jimmy said that </v>

1136
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 2>when we're kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W W with the cousin,</v>

1137
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.420
<v Speaker 2>that was a problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me not to do it.</v>

1138
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 2>He taught you smell so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1139
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.360
<v Speaker 2>That is so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cigarettes are so funny.</v>

1140
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kept on talking about it and daddy </v>

1141
00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:47.950
<v Speaker 2>needed to taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daddy needed to tell you can't go two </v>

1142
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:48.560
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a cigarette right when we started</v>

1143
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:49.990
<v Speaker 2>to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1144
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 2>shut your fucking hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had your fix.</v>

1145
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 2>How'd your goddamn fix 'em anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>

1146
00:50:58.461 --> 00:51:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Bad Code and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what though?</v>

1147
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:08.110
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is in all states </v>

1148
00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:09.980
<v Speaker 2>that have changed cigarettes to go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>by himself now,</v>

1149
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 2>so if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't hit it long enough,</v>

1150
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 2>it will just go out because of the fires</v>
<v Speaker 2>out here reading the cigarette companies</v>

1151
00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:21.371
<v Speaker 2>had to make something in a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you don't hit it after a while it </v>

1152
00:51:21.371 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 2>will go out by itself and just makes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is.</v>

1153
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 2>That can't be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably doing something like that,</v>

1154
00:51:28.281 --> 00:51:31.250
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've probably made it extra addictive</v>

1155
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.430
<v Speaker 2>along the way and oh well we can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1156
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:39.580
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately caused with psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes and make you fucking mortgage </v>

1157

1228
00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.500

<v Speaker 2>I'm a goddamn comedian.</v>

1271
00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's like telling a basketball </v>
<v Speaker 2>player to not play with basketballs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was on your side where that's bullshit</v>

1291
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried.</v>

1292
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:48.640
<v Speaker 2>We cannot find the answer to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yahoo answers are all written by 16 year</v>

1293
00:57:48.641 --> 00:57:52.330
<v Speaker 2>olds or 40 year old retards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One or the other.</v>

1294
00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:58.540
<v Speaker 2>This guy says he knows everything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis more than seven seconds or </v>

1295
00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:58.790
<v Speaker 2>these yahoo answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1297
00:58:00.471 --> 00:58:01.490
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean shit.</v>

1298
00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:07.570
<v Speaker 3>It's something about your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mouth is filled with a whatever the</v>

1299
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:12.410
<v Speaker 2>makes sense because you don't inhale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a tobacco smoke.</v>

1300
00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.260
<v Speaker 2>When you smoke a cigar and you get high </v>
<v Speaker 2>as fuck,</v>

1301
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you get really high from cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cigars give you like a serious nicotine </v>

1302
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:21.020
<v Speaker 2>rush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's a good one.</v>

1304
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:24.590
<v Speaker 2>And if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that happens,</v>

1305
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:26.670
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't that happen with marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you know,</v>

1306
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.720
<v Speaker 2>you don't inhale the cigar smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take into your mouth and then you </v>

1307
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.481
<v Speaker 2>blow it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't take a deep head of it like </v>

1308
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:34.481
<v Speaker 2>you do with cigarettes.</v>

1309
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

1310
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.940
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough google search and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to just actually find that.</v>

1311
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:41.890
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1312
00:58:41.891 --> 00:58:46.891
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a recent article that was about </v>

1313
00:58:46.891 --> 00:58:46.891
<v Speaker 3>six months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write it some people weed is not</v>

1314
00:58:46.891 --> 00:58:48.500
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That really is true,</v>

1315
00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like standing hope doesn't like we'd </v>

1316
00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.300
<v Speaker 2>stand will pay tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't make any sense because he </v>

1317
00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.781
<v Speaker 2>likes everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he probably got too high to </v>

1318
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:00.890
<v Speaker 2>get paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get too high we will fucking rock</v>

1319
00:59:00.891 --> 00:59:01.730
<v Speaker 2>your world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1320
00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Shit makes you really.</v>

1321
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.190
<v Speaker 3>The last year see I was and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>tripping my ass off.</v>

1322
00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I almost had to run out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking like,</v>

1323
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:12.961
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am just going to leave and go to my </v>

1324
00:59:12.961 --> 00:59:12.961
<v Speaker 3>room and take a nap.</v>

1325
00:59:12.961 --> 00:59:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Because I was trying to hard from we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

1326
00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:19.791
<v Speaker 2>this is this rivalry says opium trivia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The term are you hip comes from opium </v>

1327
00:59:20.401 --> 00:59:22.580
<v Speaker 2>dens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would lay on your side,</v>

1328
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 2>on your hip and smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence the term.</v>

1329
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Are you hip?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of makes sense because if you </v>

1330
00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.141
<v Speaker 2>ever watched like those old western </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies are dudes are doing heroin or </v>

1353
01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 2>This guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>red band is right.</v>

1354
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Arrowhead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

1355
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Robberies comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes clean our.</v>

1356
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read it to us.</v>

1357
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>

1358
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Mouse smoking cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the primary health issues with </v>

1359
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:42.700
<v Speaker 2>cannabis is the effect of smuggled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs.</v>

1360
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:47.501
<v Speaker 2>While the risks from longterm cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking or not fully understood is </v>

1361
01:00:47.501 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 2>assumed by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before I do this,</v>

1362
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I will tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will take this copy,</v>

1363
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:57.190
<v Speaker 2>mount smoking is not as efficient as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long smoking and requires approximately </v>

1364
01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 2>three times the material for the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of effect,</v>

1365
01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.320
<v Speaker 2>but for some people efficiency is not an</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

1366
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's not an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1367
01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:10.610
<v Speaker 2>because we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that expensive as we were </v>

1368
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:10.610
<v Speaker 2>talking about how it's worth a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money because.</v>

1369
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:12.470
<v Speaker 2>But it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that much.</v>

1370
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's one marijuana joint is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

1371
01:01:15.621 --> 01:01:18.740
<v Speaker 2>like $10 or something like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably wasn't.</v>

1372
01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:20.900
<v Speaker 2>How much is a joint it joint?</v>
<v Speaker 2>$10.</v>

1373
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 2>$10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>California joint will fast for sure.</v>

1374
01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you out of your mind joining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're.</v>

1375
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Even if you smoke a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you actually inhaled a full joint,</v>

1376
01:01:32.241 --> 01:01:34.340
<v Speaker 2>you would be blitzkrieg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California weed,</v>

1377
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:39.430
<v Speaker 2>California Wade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you take California weed and you </v>

1378
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.430
<v Speaker 2>mouth mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1379
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:44.950
<v Speaker 2>You could probably get by on like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>hits of California weed from a joint and</v>

1380
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:46.780
<v Speaker 2>you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when.</v>

1381
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.880
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that you could do also</v>
<v Speaker 2>is if you inhale it and you breathe it </v>

1382
01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.150
<v Speaker 2>out your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

1383
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.800
<v Speaker 2>you put it in your mouth and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow it out your notes,</v>

1384
01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:57.980
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going hailing it if it </v>

<v Speaker 2>know that like smoke,</v>

1389
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:10.680

<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to inhale it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll smoke it with you and make you </v>

<v Speaker 2>two and a half hours.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Folks Boring.</v>

1438
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:31.520

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday and Sunday.</v>

1440
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.820
<v Speaker 2>And I want to take a link right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to open this bitch and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to put that on twitter so </v>

1442
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:43.790
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost sold out.</v>

1443
01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is very close to sold out.</v>

1444
01:04:45.831 --> 01:04:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Like all the shows went about Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Houston.</v>

1445
01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:50.870
<v Speaker 2>People wondering if you're coming back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to him coming back.</v>

1446
01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:56.020
<v Speaker 2>We're right now trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we're doing the Improv or </v>

1447
01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.751
<v Speaker 2>whether we're doing the house of Blues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a problem with the House of </v>

1448
01:04:58.751 --> 01:05:00.080
<v Speaker 2>blues initially where they said the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house of blues could not a seat.</v>

1449
01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:05.081
<v Speaker 2>Everybody and I did not want to do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show where people have to stand and we </v>

1450
01:05:05.081 --> 01:05:07.070
<v Speaker 2>talked about this before that we went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Doug Stanhope show when he was in la</v>

1451
01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:11.210
<v Speaker 2>and I love Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I fucking can't stand and just watch</v>

1452
01:05:11.211 --> 01:05:13.190
<v Speaker 2>a show for an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hurts your feet.</v>

1453
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Your back starts hurting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your neck,</v>

1454
01:05:14.691 --> 01:05:19.691
<v Speaker 2>gets cramped up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I realized like this is </v>

1455
01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:19.691
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sitting and watching a show is awesome,</v>

1456
01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.600
<v Speaker 2>but standing and watching a show sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets annoying.</v>

1457
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Not a big fan of the house of Blues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to see a concert last week and </v>

1458
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:30.540
<v Speaker 3>I had a horrible experience with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuckers with House of Blues.</v>

1459
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Which one though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went on sunset.</v>

1460
01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.930
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1461
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:36.500
<v Speaker 3>when you go through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stamp your hands.</v>

1462
01:05:36.501 --> 01:05:38.910
<v Speaker 3>They quit wristbands on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They check your ids.</v>

1463
01:05:38.911 --> 01:05:40.440
<v Speaker 3>They scan the tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1464
01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:43.560
<v Speaker 3>so we went up there and it was general </v>
<v Speaker 3>admission.</v>

1465
01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:47.430
<v Speaker 3>We found a place that we wanted to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit and stay lean up against the wall.</v>

1466
01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:51.360
<v Speaker 3>It was perfect for the concert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Halfway through the opening,</v>

1467
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.610
<v Speaker 3>a act or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opening band,</v>

1468
01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:56.850
<v Speaker 3>security grabbed my girlfriend coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the bathroom goes,</v>

1469
01:05:56.851 --> 01:05:58.050
<v Speaker 3>where's your hand stamp?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

1470
01:05:58.110 --> 01:05:59.430
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1471
01:05:59.431 --> 01:06:01.830
<v Speaker 3>maybe it washed off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a wristband.</v>

1472
01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Here's my ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

1473
01:06:03.601 --> 01:06:04.800
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands not stamped.</v>

1474
01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:06.240
<v Speaker 3>You're Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

1475
01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:07.590
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have my ticket right here.</v>

1476
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.160
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

1477
01:06:08.161 --> 01:06:09.630
<v Speaker 3>He's going to have a hand stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

1478
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.490
<v Speaker 3>my boyfriend's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1479
01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.300
<v Speaker 3>go get him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's kicked out too.</v>

1480
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1483
01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:21.690

<v Speaker 3>But that has nothing to do with Houston,</v>

1484

<v Speaker 3>Texas or a company dickheads.</v>

01:06:56.401 --> 01:06:56.401
<v Speaker 2>the house of Blues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people might get fucked.</v>

1500
01:06:56.401 --> 01:06:57.950
<v Speaker 3>My problem with the House of Blues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a corporate thing,</v>

1501
01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:00.680
<v Speaker 3>the whole not being able to make great </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking time at all.</v>

1502
01:07:00.681 --> 01:07:02.870
<v Speaker 3>The House of Blues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you have anytime when you're out in</v>

1503
01:07:02.871 --> 01:07:04.520
<v Speaker 3>front of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good crowd of people,</v>

1504
01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:04.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1505
01:07:04.971 --> 01:07:07.550
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of the few venues where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guarantee that everything's going to</v>

1506
01:07:07.551 --> 01:07:08.770
<v Speaker 3>run smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1507
01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.930
<v Speaker 3>they get rid of douchebags in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience to record your own.</v>

1508
01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Say That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that fans aren't allowed to bring </v>

1509
01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.340
<v Speaker 3>cameras into the place or they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave them at the box on.</v>

1510
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that,</v>

1511
01:07:19.801 --> 01:07:24.801
<v Speaker 2>as these motherfuckers want to stick </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras in your face while you're on </v>

1512
01:07:24.801 --> 01:07:24.930
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly record things and put them on</v>

1513
01:07:24.931 --> 01:07:29.931
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do that with various </v>

1514
01:07:29.931 --> 01:07:31.540
<v Speaker 2>very district going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of what it is annoying for </v>

1515
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:31.570
<v Speaker 2>them and for the bands and for different</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1516
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you don't want their stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>pirated.</v>

1517
01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.060
<v Speaker 2>They're just protecting the artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That make sense to me.</v>

1518
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a bad experience.</v>

1519
01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:44.330
<v Speaker 2>But I think he had isolated Douche bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people that run the House of </v>

1520
01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Blues and I'm in Vegas are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

1521
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:48.900
<v Speaker 2>The those people are super cool and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one we go to the most.</v>

1522
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>House of Blues and San Diego.</v>

1523
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.200

<v Speaker 2>side night a customers.</v>

1524
01:07:54.201 --> 01:07:56.010
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard any complaints.</v>

1525
01:07:56.011 --> 01:07:59.250
<v Speaker 2>So if you guys have had complaints about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house of Blues,</v>

1526
01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.800

<v Speaker 2>Maybe Dan Ackroyd's house of Blues in </v>

1528
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:11.490

<v Speaker 2>through gigantic fail.</v>

1531
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of built in costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It costs.</v>

1532
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I get paid the same amount to do a 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seat room in Vegas as I do to do the </v>

1533
01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>house of Blues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like 900 seats,</v>

1534
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.370
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's another thing.</v>

1539
01:08:42.941 --> 01:08:47.941
<v Speaker 3>The prices were ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a bud light with six bucks or </v>

1540
01:08:47.941 --> 01:08:47.941

1545
01:08:55.661 --> 01:08:57.670
<v Speaker 3>two bucks for a bud light outside of Los</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angeles.</v>

1546
01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The opium dens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says the actual</v>

1551
01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:13.780
<v Speaker 4>or is</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are you hip being opium dens lying on?</v>

1553
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.520
<v Speaker 1>He says it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

1554
01:09:22.521 --> 01:09:23.750
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ingenious,</v>

1555
01:09:23.751 --> 01:09:27.290
<v Speaker 1>too convoluted and too silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is wiki 44,</v>

1556
01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:32.291
<v Speaker 1>but that's Wiki.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is his opinion is often a great </v>

1557
01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:35.561
<v Speaker 1>deal of uncertainty and tracking word </v>
<v Speaker 1>origins since we have written worked </v>

1558
01:09:35.561 --> 01:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>record going phrase may have been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>common use long before anybody wrote it </v>

1559
01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:42.911
<v Speaker 1>down after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one doesn't use slang phrases in most </v>

1560
01:09:42.911 --> 01:09:42.911
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as newspaper,</v>

1561
01:09:42.911 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 1>a certain competence accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should use slang and everything.</v>

1562
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.950
<v Speaker 1>So talk while we pretend to not talk the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we talk,</v>

1563
01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that like writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionally,</v>

1564
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:54.040
<v Speaker 1>like when I write my blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read exactly the way I talk.</v>

1565
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an open letter to Kellogg's,</v>

1566
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:58.580
<v Speaker 1>which more or less I did as a writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

1567
01:09:58.581 --> 01:10:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I was writing every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from month to month.</v>

1568
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:05.720
<v Speaker 1>My Spike TV special was being recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote down,</v>

1569
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I wrote my material out every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1570
01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>I wrote not wrote down material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote new blogs every day and you </v>

1571
01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just needed to shit to write about.</v>

1572
01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:15.650
<v Speaker 1>And one of them was this Kellogg's </v>
<v Speaker 1>banning Michael Phelps because he smoked</v>

1573
01:10:15.651 --> 01:10:17.810
<v Speaker 1>weed because I wrote this open letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote it.</v>

1574
01:10:17.811 --> 01:10:20.900
<v Speaker 1>The way I talk with swears and just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way I normally talk people look,</v>

1575
01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>they're going to read that open letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't want him to read a stupid.</v>

1576
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm just writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

1577
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:29.300
<v Speaker 1>You could read it or you don't read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not gonna write something you to</v>

1578
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:31.790
<v Speaker 1>have more impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like they're going to listen.</v>

1579
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:34.130
<v Speaker 1>They're going to listen to a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pothead,</v>

1580
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:39.131
<v Speaker 1>comedian slash cage fighting commentator</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Kellogg's is gonna make their </v>

1581
01:10:39.131 --> 01:10:39.560
<v Speaker 1>decisions based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1582
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it's for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for humor.</v>

1583
01:10:41.451 --> 01:10:46.451
<v Speaker 1>It's for entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the word hip really hit heal from a</v>

1584
01:10:47.941 --> 01:10:52.000
<v Speaker 1>west African language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be either or though this,</v>

1585
01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.050
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could be that,</v>

1586
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.120
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original hip that rivalries talks </v>

1587
01:10:59.120 --> 01:10:59.120
<v Speaker 1>about is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

1588
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's no real.</v>

1589
01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:04.640
<v Speaker 1>If the origins of it are or are murky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could.</v>

1590
01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It could be both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not saying anything to </v>

1591
01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:09.670
<v Speaker 1>discredit that</v>

1592
01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:10.840
<v Speaker 4>anyone who gives a fuck</v>

1593
01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>red band is totally right about the Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he really,</v>

1594
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.860
<v Speaker 1>truly right?</v>

1596
01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking taste thing.</v>

1597
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:25.191
<v Speaker 3>I think cigarettes are disgusting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sucking on them everyday because </v>

1598
01:11:25.191 --> 01:11:25.610
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't think they're discussing if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you smoke them for when.</v>

1599
01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:28.620
<v Speaker 3>You're totally right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1600
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:33.680
<v Speaker 3>If I was a junkie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't think they're just kind of </v>

1601
01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:33.680
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hand and I lost my stool.</v>

1605
01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened to me.</v>

1606
01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.760
<v Speaker 3>I lost my store and almost got in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight with a bunch of Persians and the </v>
