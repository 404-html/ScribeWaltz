<v Speaker 1>you don't think you could.</v>

130
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>You think you can just come into someone's neighborhood.</v>

131
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>They don't fucking shoot at you.</v>

132
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>You can't just take over.</v>

133
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>And then when you take over,</v>

134
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>people fight back and when they fight back,</v>

135
00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:46.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

136
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>who's the fucking bad guys?</v>

138
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.811
<v Speaker 1>and this is the,</v>

139
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood he grew up in and all of a sudden he sees he's fucking</v>

140
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:54.661
<v Speaker 1>helicopters,</v>

141
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>fly overhead and tanks rolling around on the ground.</v>

142
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>What would you think you think you'd been invaded and the bad guy?</v>

143
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.251

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

147
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I obviously never would want anything bad to happen to any of our troops</v>

148
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>overseas,</v>

149
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.670

213
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.120

220
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.480

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.090
<v Speaker 1>She did it once.</v>

294
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.080
<v Speaker 1>She did it once and it was her boyfriend and then it caught on quite God out.</v>

295
00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what their family's making?</v>

296
00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:01.170
<v Speaker 1>17 what million?</v>

297
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.251
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how much?</v>

298
00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:03.084
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of money.</v>

299
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.290
<v Speaker 1>They're making a lot of money.</v>

300
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:05.101
<v Speaker 1>They're making a lot of money.</v>

301
00:07:05.101 --> 00:07:06.180
<v Speaker 1>She's everywhere.</v>

302
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>But who you know?</v>

303
00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Who knows who the fuck put that video out.</v>

304
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't really,</v>

305
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe she did.</v>

306
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.811
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she did.</v>

307
00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he did.</v>

308
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

309
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone else got ahold of it.</v>

310
00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

311
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 1>But the the,</v>

312
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>the point is if we,</v>

313
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.600
<v Speaker 1>even if we knew like that you put it out on purpose,</v>

314
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.740
<v Speaker 1>it's okay still.</v>

315
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like people gas.</v>

316
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.790
<v Speaker 1>As long as you say that you didn't put it on purpose,</v>

317
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.743
<v Speaker 1>you get a pass.</v>

318
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.400
<v Speaker 1>But if you do put it on purpose,</v>

319
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.530
<v Speaker 1>if you make a porno video on purpose,</v>

320
00:07:31.531 --> 00:07:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you fuck on camera on purpose,</v>

321
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.013
<v Speaker 1>you don't get in.</v>

322
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.333
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that strange?</v>

323
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

324
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.040
<v Speaker 1>he is not going to give you a fucking TV show.</v>

325
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.431
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

326
00:07:38.431 --> 00:07:41.730
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get nothing unless it's a TV show on porn and it makes you</v>

327
00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:42.564
<v Speaker 1>want to cry,</v>

328
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.081
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

329
00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:45.360
<v Speaker 1>But then keeping up with the Kardashians doesn't make you want to cry.</v>

330
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.433
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

331
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You've watched like one of those inside pieces on Bella.</v>

332
00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Donna,</v>

333
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.101
<v Speaker 1>did you ever watch that?</v>

334
00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Show it down?</v>

335
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.920
<v Speaker 1>They said it made you want to cry,</v>

336
00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:53.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

337
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

338
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad she's retired now.</v>

340
00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:56.274
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

341
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's happy and he was,</v>

342
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.700
<v Speaker 1>she was happier when she's taking baseball.</v>

343
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

344
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I was probably ahead.</v>

345
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.171
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

346
00:08:01.171 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 1>it takes all kinds of people do to make this world go round.</v>

347
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

348
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.010
<v Speaker 1>but for,</v>

349
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:05.970
<v Speaker 1>it is a weird thing though,</v>

350
00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:10.971
<v Speaker 1>that you're allowed to do it as long as you at least claim that you did it on</v>

351
00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:12.960
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>

352
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.340
<v Speaker 1>that it got released on accident.</v>

353
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.710
<v Speaker 1>But if we suspect that you put it out on purpose,</v>

354
00:08:16.711 --> 00:08:18.840
<v Speaker 1>you actually made your own sex video and released it.</v>

355
00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

356
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I think or I think it's pretty easy to get a video out nowadays because I've,</v>

357
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I've been realizing how many recordings now I've made of myself that I just</v>

358
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.100
<v Speaker 2>accidentally tweet.</v>

359
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.160
<v Speaker 2>The other day I accidentally tweeted something that I thought was a direct</v>

360
00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:34.650
<v Speaker 2>message out to everybody and then I was like,</v>

361
00:08:34.651 --> 00:08:34.981
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

362
00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:35.521
<v Speaker 2>that's close.</v>

363
00:08:35.521 --> 00:08:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I caught it right away</v>

364
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.070
<v Speaker 1>and my was a,</v>

365
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.093
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

366
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.583
<v Speaker 1>a video.</v>

367
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.090
<v Speaker 1>A video was a video,</v>

368
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.280
<v Speaker 1>some sexy time,</v>

369
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

370
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:43.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

371
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:43.921
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

372
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:44.131
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

373
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:45.330
<v Speaker 2>It was a video of,</v>

374
00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:46.440
<v Speaker 2>it could've been sexy time.</v>

375
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.060
<v Speaker 2>It was cheesy video,</v>

376
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.110
<v Speaker 2>like a cheesy like,</v>

377
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

378
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.950
<v Speaker 2>just make a video together and accidentally put it out.</v>

379
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.401
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

380
00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 2>like I was trying to delete it,</v>

381
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

382
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I deleted right away.</v>

384
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 2>There's only one person supposedly that commented on it,</v>

385
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 2>but like 170 people solid and,</v>

386
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like probably luck if there's just one person in there that grabbed that</v>

387
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

388
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 2>that would have been an awful,</v>

389
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 2>how embarrassing is the video?</v>

390
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not that embarrassing.</v>

391
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 2>It's just gross.</v>

392
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.453
<v Speaker 2>Gay.</v>

393
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.280
<v Speaker 2>You said it's not that you list when you sit</v>

394
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 2>down bear thing,</v>

395
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.021
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 2>you like submitted to yourself.</v>

398
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>You crawled inside of yourself.</v>

399
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 2>It creeped me out.</v>

400
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 2>When I saw,</v>

401
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 2>when I realized I did it,</v>

402
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:28.854
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

403
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

404
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 2>give us the cliff notes version of what's on the video.</v>

405
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 2>we did,</v>

409
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to play it.</v>

410
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.321
<v Speaker 2>At least I don't have it on,</v>

411
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

412
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.433
<v Speaker 2>I deleted it.</v>

413
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:37.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

414
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 2>once I get it off everything,</v>

415
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:41.160

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.101
<v Speaker 2>You talked to her.</v>

431
00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly how it talks to her and pretend you're in a movie.</v>

432
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.213
<v Speaker 2>I love you baby.</v>

433

434
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the best way to do it.</v>

435
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Just pretend you like in a Tom cruise movie.</v>

436
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

437
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 2>We did another blackout podcast and it was,</v>

438
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 2>we started drinking at like midnight,</v>

439
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 2>we got,</v>

440
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.800
<v Speaker 2>we drank a whole bottle of vodka and two huge glasses of great vodka.</v>

441
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

442
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:18.534
<v Speaker 2>And an hour.</v>

443
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it to me and Veronica Richie and it,</v>

444
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 2>but what's so hilarious,</v>

445
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:28.040
<v Speaker 2>it starts off Ronica Richie girl is a penthouse pet.</v>

446
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

447
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:29.244
<v Speaker 2>But at the beginning of it,</v>

448
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 2>it was really awkward conversation because he's super shy,</v>

449
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 2>super shy,</v>

450
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.633
<v Speaker 2>super shy,</v>

451
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.043
<v Speaker 2>family shot.</v>

452
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Her whole family's really shy.</v>

453
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 2>People just fucking each other.</v>

454
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.111
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

455
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:40.944
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's going on?</v>

456
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 2>I asked that.</v>

457
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 2>That's how drunk became,</v>

458
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 2>and then there was one point where she,</v>

459
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

460
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 2>she went stand up and she fell and did like a backflip.</v>

461
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.051
<v Speaker 2>So winning me,</v>

462
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:52.170
<v Speaker 2>you've known this chick for awhile and that's the only time you've ever talked</v>

463
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 2>to her about molestation?</v>

464
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 2>He did it on,</v>

465
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

466

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.470
<v Speaker 2>why do I know about those soap operas,</v>

503
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Muslim,</v>

504
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.760
<v Speaker 2>the opera is awful.</v>

505
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.050
<v Speaker 2>It might as well be opera.</v>

506
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>

507
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Something that's old and stupid.</v>

508
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.351
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

509
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:44.720
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that you're going to have this crazy running drama every day and</v>

510
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.060
<v Speaker 2>like what's going to happen?</v>

511
00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:51.061
<v Speaker 2>And she comes home and finds him with her and just every day there's drama and</v>

512
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 2>crazy music.</v>

513
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>And what a weird</v>

514
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 1>way to live man.</v>

515
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Fucking stone Joe.</v>

516
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:56.921
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah,</v>

517
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

518
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>The two volcanoes got back in,</v>

519
00:11:59.291 --> 00:11:59.690
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>

520
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 1>He dove right back in.</v>

521
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Sunn o w dove in just an hour ago and you dove right back in.</v>

522
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried one of the fake the volcanoes?</v>

523
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:08.660
<v Speaker 1>That's like a,</v>

524
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 1>a copy of it,</v>

525
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 1>like a generic copy of the volcano?</v>

526
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.213
<v Speaker 1>No I haven't.</v>

527
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.180
<v Speaker 1>It's called like uh,</v>

528
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the wave or something.</v>

529
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it's called but I just wondered if you,</v>

530
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>cause it's only $90 compared to whatever the volcano is,</v>

531
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>like $400.</v>

532
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.533
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

533
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

534
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go budget on vaporizers.</v>

535
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

536
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 1>it seems like complicated man.</v>

537
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:31.660
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's a lot of shit go on there and electricity and it's heat</v>

538
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 1>and anytime just heat I say you got to get the best thing cause you don't want</v>

539
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:38.740
<v Speaker 1>things burning through the fucking cord and blowing up in your house or</v>

540
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

541
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Some cheap piece of shit would do just get,</v>

542
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.060
<v Speaker 1>get the stuff that's going to work.</v>

543
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:44.080
<v Speaker 1>And that the volcano thing,</v>

544
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about is a vaporizer and would vaporizing is ladies and</v>

545
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen is for the health conscious amongst us,</v>

546
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>the stoners that don't want any of those bad nasty bits that you take in from</v>

547
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>burning smoke,</v>

548
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>which apparently is not nearly as bad for you as tobacco smoke.</v>

549
00:12:58.121 --> 00:12:59.890
<v Speaker 1>But it's gotta be somewhat bad for you.</v>

550
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just smoke.</v>

551
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:01.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

552
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:01.894
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

553
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.861
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

554
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:04.360
<v Speaker 1>It has some health benefits.</v>

555
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>It's an expectorant and apparently it's very good for people when they have</v>

556
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:08.314
<v Speaker 1>asthma,</v>

557
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.161
<v Speaker 1>people have asthma,</v>

558
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:12.410
<v Speaker 1>at least some of them have reported that they have a,</v>

559
00:13:12.411 --> 00:13:13.690
<v Speaker 1>a benefit from uh,</v>

560
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 1>from small gangs,</v>

561
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.430
<v Speaker 1>from smoking the pot.</v>

562
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 1>But with the vapor I does is it cuts out all the health problems.</v>

563
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

564
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 1>it heats it up but doesn't burn it.</v>

565
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

566
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>and it blows air through it and it releases this THC missed and that is</v>

567
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:28.294
<v Speaker 1>collected.</v>

568
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 1>And one of these,</v>

569
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:31.241
<v Speaker 1>and what this is,</v>

570
00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:31.580
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

571
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you hear it iTunes folks,</v>

572
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a plastic bag at the end of it.</v>

573
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 1>It has this whole novel and you just suck out the pure THC.</v>

574
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And if you suck out enough,</v>

575
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 1>you can see aliens.</v>

576
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:43.790
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

577
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the volcano,</v>

578
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I've tried every single kind of vaporizer known to man.</v>

579
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And the volcano is the only one that I recommend.</v>

580
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to get one,</v>

581
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.480
<v Speaker 1>get the volcano because that shit works where the other ones you have to,</v>

582
00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to adjust the temperature.</v>

583
00:13:57.131 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

584
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it feels like you're not getting anything.</v>

585
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Then other times it's like you got too much dark smoke for some reason.</v>

586
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 1>All that shit is just too ridiculous.</v>

587
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Just the volcano does it.</v>

588
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:06.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

589
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:08.020
<v Speaker 1>It just figures out how it works.</v>

590
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 1>But I see how people don't want to pay that money.</v>

591
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Much money to get home.</v>

592
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I was on craigslist looking in.</v>

593
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.760
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of those generic ones on it.</v>

594
00:14:14.761 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 1>You know the only reason why all this shit cost so much cause it's illegal.</v>

595
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.433
<v Speaker 1>It's the only reason.</v>

596
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.160
<v Speaker 1>The only reason everything costs so much because it's illegal.</v>

597
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana should be cheapest.</v>

598
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

599
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.771
<v Speaker 1>it's a plant.</v>

600
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:24.521
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to grow.</v>

601
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:25.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a God damn weed.</v>

602
00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even get sick.</v>

603
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't rot.</v>

604
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

605
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:28.511
<v Speaker 1>you were like,</v>

606
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 1>look at some trees and there's bugs.</v>

607
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Fucking them up.</v>

608
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Box.</v>

609
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't fuck up.</v>

610
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Re first pitch.</v>

611
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:35.560
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even have a chance.</v>

612
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Bugs and have a chance.</v>

613
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Reefer doesn't need pesticides.</v>

614
00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Like people always say what happened?</v>

615
00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Did they put pesticides?</v>

616
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:40.761
<v Speaker 1>You Weed,</v>

617
00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:41.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

618
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 1>You like DDD poisoning bro.</v>

619
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:43.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what's wrong with weed.</v>

620
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.771
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

621
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:46.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't need it doesn't need pesticides.</v>

622
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get sick.</v>

623
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not like all these pussy ass plants.</v>

624
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the toughest plants that's ever existed.</v>

625
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the best fiber,</v>

626
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.600
<v Speaker 1>the fiber that you make at a hamp,</v>

627
00:14:54.601 --> 00:14:56.400
<v Speaker 1>like when you make hemp jeans or clothes or,</v>

628
00:14:56.401 --> 00:14:57.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

629
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like so much more sturdy than cotton and the paper,</v>

630
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 1>like hemp paper is so superior to cotton,</v>

631
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>it all became illegal.</v>

632
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't even know this,</v>

633
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but we came illegal back when they figured out a more effective way to process</v>

634
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 1>the hemp fiber.</v>

635
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>It was legal forever,</v>

636
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 1>but it became like something that people stopped using because cotton became so</v>

637
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 1>much more easy to process.</v>

638
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 1>They came up with the cotton gin and instead of just having slaves pick the</v>

639
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:22.641
<v Speaker 1>cotton,</v>

640
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>which was a huge pain in the ass,</v>

641
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 1>then they could run it through this fucking machine and it made it way easier.</v>

642
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.141
<v Speaker 1>And so people were like,</v>

643
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:27.974
<v Speaker 1>fuck this hemp,</v>

644
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 1>because hemp fibers like really tough stuff and you got to break it down.</v>

645
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever watched like manual breaking down of hemp fiber?</v>

646
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a laborious process,</v>

647
00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

648
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 1>because the fucking stock of this plant,</v>

649
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>this is like an animal or an alien planet rather.</v>

650
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredible plant.</v>

651
00:15:43.561 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the fibers like super fucking tough and strong.</v>

652
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 1>You make the best rope out of it,</v>

653
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 1>the best cloth out of it.</v>

654
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like so superior,</v>

655
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.020
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a long time to turn that fiber into cloth or paper.</v>

656
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.000
<v Speaker 1>It's really difficult to break down.</v>

657
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And then in like the early 1930s a guy came out with a machine called a</v>

658
00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:07.460
<v Speaker 1>decorticator and with the decorticator did was allow them to process it just</v>

659
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 1>like the cotton gin processes.</v>

660
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Cotton allows it to smash it down into this,</v>

661
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 1>this pub and make it more much more usable,</v>

662
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>like almost immediately.</v>

663
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And then that's when they said,</v>

664
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:17.601
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

665
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's when pot became illegal.</v>

666
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Palm became illegal entirely because of hemp,</v>

667
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.550
<v Speaker 1>which has nothing to do with the psychoactive properties.</v>

668
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.020
<v Speaker 1>It became illegal because of William Randolph Hearst who was running newspapers</v>

669
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:34.430
<v Speaker 1>and he also had paper mills and they were going to make people start using hemp</v>

670
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:34.851
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>

671
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 1>That was going to be the shit because you could,</v>

672
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you could tank like a forest full of trees and you chop them down when you're</v>

673
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 1>fucked because you don't have any more trees.</v>

674
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

675
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long ass time for those trees to grow back.</v>

676
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.303
<v Speaker 1>But hemp,</v>

677
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you grow it every four months.</v>

678
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:49.370
<v Speaker 1>You'd have a new fucking crop.</v>

679
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

680
00:16:49.941 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you could use the same property over and over and over again.</v>

681
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's renewable and you get much more paper pull.</v>

682
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So this motherfucker was going to have to spend millions of dollars.</v>

683
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 1>So them and Dupont,</v>

684
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.941
<v Speaker 1>William Randolph,</v>

685
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Hearst and dupont,</v>

686
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.100
<v Speaker 1>they got together and they said,</v>

687
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:04.500
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

688
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.180
<v Speaker 1>we will do,</v>

689
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.210
<v Speaker 1>we'll fucking say that pot makes um,</v>

690
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>blacks and Mexicans rape white chicks.</v>

691
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's all they did.</v>

692
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:11.631
<v Speaker 1>That's what they did.</v>

693
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 1>That's literally what they did.</v>

694
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 1>They started printing stories.</v>

695
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 1>William Randolph Hearst did in the paper of this new drug called marijuana and</v>

696
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 1>what marijuana was,</v>

697
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.890
<v Speaker 1>had nothing even to do with pot.</v>

698
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.090
<v Speaker 1>The original name for marijuana was a slang for a wild Mexican tobacco.</v>

699
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 1>So they call it marijuana and then say blacks and Mexicans are smoking</v>

700
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:30.950
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

701
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 1>So when congress made hemp illegal,</v>

702
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 1>when they made a marijuana illegal,</v>

703
00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Dee Dee didn't even know they were making hemp illegal as well.</v>

704
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.430
<v Speaker 1>They fucked everybody and they did it.</v>

705
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.440
<v Speaker 1>19 fucking 30 something.</v>

706
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.860
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that that shit is still going on.</v>

707
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It's still illegal in the age of the Internet.</v>

708
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.671
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>

709
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>the information is at your disposal.</v>

710
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Everything you can Google search,</v>

711
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 1>every fucking study ever done on pot,</v>

712
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and you could see right away that most people want it legal.</v>

713
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Who's stopping it?</v>

714
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

715
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 1>people with money.</v>

716
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Why they stopped doing it?</v>

717
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

718
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:07.680
<v Speaker 1>because they're making money on marijuana being illegal and they're using that</v>

719
00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:08.910
<v Speaker 1>money that bribing politicians,</v>

720
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's how they keep it in place.</v>

721
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.831
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

722
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

723
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 1>In 2011 you can be that open.</v>

724
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 1>It's that open where you can see so clearly.</v>

725
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It's so sick,</v>

726
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:19.890

<v Speaker 1>It's sick that we live like this.</v>

729
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 1>It's sick that you can put people in jail for Dwight and a smoke a joint and</v>

730
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:29.590

<v Speaker 1>We know what drugs are bad folks.</v>

736
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 1>We know we have to stop letting people tell you that the drugs that are good or</v>

737
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 1>bad because they're fucking wrong.</v>

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.410
<v Speaker 1>from the merger with the UFC and the strike force and stuff like that.</v>

756
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's something,</v>

757
00:19:16.181 --> 00:19:18.280
<v Speaker 1>do you know anything about this guy or no,</v>

758
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I know anything more than a,</v>

759
00:19:19.841 --> 00:19:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I saw there was a headline on mma.tv or mixed martial arts.com.</v>

760
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

761
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I saw that,</v>

762
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.740
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't read it.</v>

763
00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not interesting to me.</v>

764
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:28.301
<v Speaker 1>Not Interested.</v>

765
00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:28.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

766
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.021
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

767
00:19:29.021 --> 00:19:29.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

768
00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:31.360
<v Speaker 1>he seems like a nice guy and I wish them well,</v>

769
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

770
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in young guys that are coming up and I mean,</v>

771
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.610
<v Speaker 1>occasionally a guy like Lester Lester was like a serious wrestler,</v>

772
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

773
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.980
<v Speaker 1>like you're serious amateur wrestler.</v>

774
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what made him excited.</v>

775
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.470
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just that it was a big guy.</v>

776
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Is this guy now?</v>

777
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe so.</v>

778
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

779
00:19:47.231 --> 00:19:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

780
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know his background,</v>

781
00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I would have heard about him the way I heard about Lesnar when</v>

782
00:19:53.681 --> 00:19:56.740
<v Speaker 1>lesbian was a wrestler and we got back when he was doing pro wrestling,</v>

783
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I had heard about what a freak he was.</v>

784
00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.391
<v Speaker 1>Like people were,</v>

785
00:19:59.391 --> 00:20:01.720
<v Speaker 1>were talking about what a crazy specimen this guy was.</v>

786
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.071
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

787
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:03.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking video of him.</v>

788
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

789
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.740
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about in the podcast before,</v>

790
00:20:05.741 --> 00:20:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth,</v>

791
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it's worth repeating.</v>

792
00:20:07.211 --> 00:20:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

793
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.410
<v Speaker 1>it's so ridiculous.</v>

794
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.930
<v Speaker 1>He was 300 pounds solid muscle,</v>

795
00:20:10.931 --> 00:20:11.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

796
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.050
<v Speaker 1>He gets on top of the fucking turnbuckle or whatever the hell it is,</v>

797
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:19.000
<v Speaker 1>stands on the ropes and flips through the air and lands on his head.</v>

798
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Lans I his fucking head.</v>

799
00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.060
<v Speaker 1>He flew through the air and landed on his head and he was still conscious and he</v>

800
00:20:28.931 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 1>climbed on top of the guy.</v>

801
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:32.410
<v Speaker 1>It's still got the pin and you watch it.</v>

802
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.280
<v Speaker 1>If you watch it,</v>

803
00:20:33.281 --> 00:20:34.140
<v Speaker 1>you watch them do that and go,</v>

804
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.320
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to kill people.</v>

805
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.490
<v Speaker 1>How did that not kill him?</v>

806
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Who's this guy?</v>

807
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.230
<v Speaker 1>How could,</v>

808
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.710
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did that guy survived that?</v>

809
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.640
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to snap your neck and break every fucking bone in your spinal</v>

810
00:20:43.641 --> 00:20:44.300
<v Speaker 1>column.</v>

811
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.520
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be just chaos for you after that.</v>

812
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.881
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

813
00:20:46.881 --> 00:20:47.651
<v Speaker 1>he liked finishes.</v>

814
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 1>The match is ridiculous.</v>

815
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.230
<v Speaker 1>So he was already this guy where people are like this Brock Lesnar guy,</v>

816
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

817
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you ain't never seen a heavyweight move like that guy.</v>

818
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And we had heard about his fucking times and that was like one of the things</v>

819
00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:01.960
<v Speaker 1>they talked about during his wrestling days was his times in the NFL combine.</v>

820
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

821
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>the NFL combine is,</v>

822
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:03.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

823
00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:04.331
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

824
00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:04.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

825
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I actually can pull up the numbers because it's so ridiculous.</v>

826
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:07.021
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

827
00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:07.854
<v Speaker 1>it's worth reading.</v>

828
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.190
<v Speaker 1>But the NFL combine,</v>

829
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it's when they take athletes and they,</v>

<v Speaker 1>40 yards of 4.6 seconds.</v>

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:03.011
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

991
00:25:03.011 --> 00:25:03.940

00:25:03.941 --> 00:25:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen the video part.</v>

993
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:05.581
<v Speaker 1>You haven't seen it?</v>

994
00:25:05.581 --> 00:25:05.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

995
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.663
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty ruthless.</v>

996
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Cross beat the fuck out of that girl and they keep going back.</v>

997
00:25:08.831 --> 00:25:11.770
<v Speaker 1>They keep kicking him and then a girl kicks her when she's down kicks boots are</v>

998
00:25:11.771 --> 00:25:13.660
<v Speaker 1>in the hand and the girl starts convulsing.</v>

999
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1000
00:25:14.441 --> 00:25:14.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:25:14.621 --> 00:25:15.454
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty rough.</v>

1002
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty rough.</v>

1003
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And people would call it so fuck.</v>

1004
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.470
<v Speaker 1>It looks so fake.</v>

1005
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.841
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what,</v>

1006
00:25:18.841 --> 00:25:19.674
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't fake,</v>

1007
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.820
<v Speaker 1>that big gigantic kick to the head.</v>

1008
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.930
<v Speaker 1>That shit was real.</v>

1009
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:23.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1010
00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible and people don't know.</v>

1011
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.290
<v Speaker 1>People go into convulsions.</v>

1012
00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So it's very possible that someone can have a seizure from heavy brain trauma</v>

1013
00:25:29.171 --> 00:25:29.860
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1014
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Very possible.</v>

1015
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.333
<v Speaker 1>Don't think it's not,</v>

1016
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.790
<v Speaker 1>the girl really kicked her in the head like it was,</v>

1018
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:36.190
<v Speaker 1>it was really stumped her head,</v>

1019
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1020
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:37.923
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty rough.</v>

1021
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.651
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1022
00:25:38.651 --> 00:25:38.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1023
00:25:38.891 --> 00:25:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the manager is trying to keep the girls off of the,</v>

1024
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.010
<v Speaker 1>he can't,</v>

1025
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.030
<v Speaker 1>he's in effective,</v>

1026
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.110
<v Speaker 1>everybody got fired.</v>

1027
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.183
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>

1028
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.390
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy.</v>

1029
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.090
<v Speaker 1>But the idea was that she was a,</v>

1030
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.461
<v Speaker 1>a he,</v>

1031
00:25:48.461 --> 00:25:50.740
<v Speaker 1>she and she was going into the woman's room.</v>

1032
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what I read.</v>

1033
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not that's true,</v>

1034
00:25:53.231 --> 00:25:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

1035
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they've interviewed her and got the whole full deal.</v>

1036
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.981
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1037
00:25:56.981 --> 00:25:58.570
<v Speaker 1>this is like another form of soap opera.</v>

1038
00:25:59.130 --> 00:25:59.963
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1039
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:00.931
<v Speaker 1>Antwan Dodson,</v>

1040
00:26:00.931 --> 00:26:02.680
<v Speaker 1>he got arrested for marijuana possession.</v>

1041
00:26:02.681 --> 00:26:03.514
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear?</v>

1042
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Did He,</v>

1043
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1044
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Ron and tell him that home home home boy somewhere in Alabama.</v>

1045
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.170
<v Speaker 2>What's it doing in Alabama is probably where he lives.</v>

1046
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:10.531
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1047
00:26:10.531 --> 00:26:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I thought he moved back to La.</v>

1048
00:26:11.611 --> 00:26:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I heard that he was living in la now and they were filming a new show with a</v>

1049
00:26:15.191 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 2>mallet.</v>

1050
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it went back home and say hi to the homeys and they got busted.</v>

1052
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

1053
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:20.250
<v Speaker 1>How amazed.</v>

1054
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.083
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1055
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

1056
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Back then man,</v>

1057
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 1>you still can get busted back there rather back there is back then.</v>

1058
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:28.400
<v Speaker 1>That's funny because I said back then,</v>

1059
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you know meaning like Alabama,</v>

1060
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.900
<v Speaker 1>but it is back then in time as well,</v>

1061
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:33.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:35.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

1063
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying back then because I'm thinking of it as it being in like the fifties,</v>

1064
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1065
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I should've said back there,</v>

1066
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.930
<v Speaker 1>but back then is more appropriate.</v>

1067
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.590
<v Speaker 1>They live in a fucking time warp.</v>

1068
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Stupid ass place where you can get fucking arrested for.</v>

1070
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1071
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 1>did you hear about the Rhode Island Guy?</v>

1072
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one I love hearing about politicians to get fucked up.</v>

1073
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.040
<v Speaker 1>This guy who is a,</v>

1074
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1075
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 1>he was a anti Marijuana House minority leader,</v>

1076
00:26:57.541 --> 00:26:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Robert Watson.</v>

1077
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 1>He was arrested for alcohol and drug charges.</v>

1078
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.720
<v Speaker 1>They pull homeboy over and uh,</v>

1079
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.870
<v Speaker 1>he failed the sup,</v>

1080
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.300
<v Speaker 1>the field sobriety test.</v>

1081
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

1082
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1083
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.431
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1084
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:08.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1085
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:08.870
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1086
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.520
<v Speaker 1>they grabbed him and they searched his pockets and they find out he's got a,</v>

1087
00:27:12.521 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 1>a plastic bag filled with pot and a wooden pipe.</v>

1088
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:20.330
<v Speaker 1>So this fucking dummy who is this anti pot guy gets busted with pot,</v>

1089
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1090
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:23.190
<v Speaker 1>and that to me,</v>

1091
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1092
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:24.141
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1093
00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:24.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1094
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1095
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 1>that's like a gay guy who secretly gay votes against gay marriage and that they</v>

1096
00:27:29.371 --> 00:27:30.204
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>

1097
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.380
<v Speaker 1>they should be locked up.</v>

1098
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.930
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1099
00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:32.530
<v Speaker 1>that's like a,</v>

1100
00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.363
<v Speaker 1>that's like a,</v>

1101
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you're like a trader.</v>

1102
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 1>You're like a trader for humanity.</v>

1103
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Like you're a bad person.</v>

1104
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Like if you really want to lock people in jail for pot and yet you enjoy pot,</v>

1105
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.670
<v Speaker 1>you're a shitty human being.</v>

1106
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.880
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to put your own personal gain ahead of the betterment of the</v>

1107
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:50.820
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1108
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:51.330
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1109
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.920
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to take something that you know is not right and push it because</v>

1110
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you think more people are gonna agree with you because it's the contemporary</v>

1111
00:27:59.131 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

1112
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:00.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1113
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.081
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1114
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a really shitty human being.</v>

1115
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.271
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

1116
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:03.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1117
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I hope that guy is ostracized from the political community for life.</v>

1118
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I hope they never allow him back.</v>

1119
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:10.531
<v Speaker 1>And it's sad,</v>

1120
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 1>but they probably will.</v>

1121
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.080
<v Speaker 1>He'll probably eventually show up somewhere else and apologize or become a</v>

1122
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Christian or,</v>

1123
00:28:17.171 --> 00:28:18.640
<v Speaker 1>or something stupid and,</v>

1124
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:19.381
<v Speaker 1>and they'll,</v>

1125
00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:20.660
<v Speaker 1>they'll suck them right back in.</v>

1126
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Enough people will believe in him that he'll get some shitty job at some shitty</v>

1127
00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 1>little fucking community where they won't bother Google search and what a Douche</v>

1128
00:28:27.211 --> 00:28:28.044
<v Speaker 1>bag he is.</v>

1129
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1130
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.690
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it gets I herpes,</v>

1131
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that that should exist where you can get herpes on your eyeball really</v>

1132
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.690
<v Speaker 1>and breaks out like once,</v>

1133
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 1>once a month or whatever.</v>

1134
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Whenever it happens.</v>

1135
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I heard of a story and I don't know if it's true.</v>

1136
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 1>So Internet do your research.</v>

1137
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.910
<v Speaker 1>A wrestler was on a,</v>

1138
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1139
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.530
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of a match.</v>

1140
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.910
<v Speaker 1>His contact fell out,</v>

1141
00:28:47.911 --> 00:28:49.740
<v Speaker 1>put his contact back in his eye,</v>

1142
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.550
<v Speaker 1>got staff from the contact lens and died.</v>

1143
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Is this true?</v>

1144
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1145
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.770
<v Speaker 1>This could very easily be one of those urban myths.</v>

1146
00:28:59.400 --> 00:28:59.821
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1147
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:00.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1148
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I heard the story and I was like,</v>

1149
00:29:01.201 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Speaker 1>that is the scariest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.</v>

1150
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:04.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1151
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.360
<v Speaker 1>you eyeball staff that winds up killing you just because a contact lens fell on</v>

1152
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:12.240
<v Speaker 1>the ground and the ground is so fucking polluted,</v>

1153
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:12.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1154
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:16.950
<v Speaker 1>there's so much funk and fucking human slime on that ground.</v>

1155
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.560
<v Speaker 1>That staff is some scary shit man.</v>

1156

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.700
<v Speaker 1>How scary like websites like rotten.com used to be there.</v>

1158
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:25.320
<v Speaker 1>What was the one,</v>

1159
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 1>the other one that was really bad?</v>

1160
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1161
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.750
<v Speaker 1>not rotten.com.</v>

1162
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.860
<v Speaker 1>That was the one I had like the red and black and I don't remember what you're</v>

1163
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.140
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

1164
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.180
<v Speaker 1>I remember I would be scared to go there.</v>

1165
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:36.721
<v Speaker 1>There was a few,</v>

1166
00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a few sites to this day that I won't fuck with,</v>

1167
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.440
<v Speaker 1>but somebody posted up a video the other day of a,</v>

1168
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 1>a Mexican lady cutting some dude's head off now I watched the whole time.</v>

1169
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:48.623
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1170
00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 1>That was weak as weak.</v>

1171
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.003
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have done it.</v>

1172
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.460
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

1173
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:51.660
<v Speaker 1>they'd,</v>

1174
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:51.961
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1175
00:29:51.961 --> 00:29:55.330
<v Speaker 1>she didn't just cut off as hatch to do a lot of other shit to him too.</v>

1176
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.220
<v Speaker 1>And there's a video of it and they,</v>

1177
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.450
<v Speaker 1>they show the guy dying.</v>

1178
00:29:58.451 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1179
00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 1>they show her.</v>

1180
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1181
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I was amazed at how,</v>

1182
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:06.670
<v Speaker 1>how much I've gotten over the impact of those things.</v>

1183
00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1184
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.051
<v Speaker 1>it used to be,</v>

1185
00:30:08.051 --> 00:30:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I would watch that and it would haunt my dreams.</v>

1186
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Like the first time I ever saw faces of death and I realized he's a really,</v>

1187
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:15.130
<v Speaker 1>bodies like faces death.</v>

1188
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Some of the faces of death were,</v>

1189
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:17.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1190
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was exactly faces of death,</v>

1191
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but one of those type of videos,</v>

1192
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember one of them was super disturbing.</v>

1193
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 1>It was in some Middle Eastern country where they were killing a guy by tying him</v>

1194
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:29.130
<v Speaker 1>in between two trucks and pulling them.</v>

1195
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1196

1197
00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1198
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that.</v>

1199
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:35.663
<v Speaker 2>The blood orgy was,</v>

1200
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.260
<v Speaker 2>they had a body in the middle and they were like,</v>

1274
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that it's bad that you become desensitized?</v>

1275
00:32:17.821 --> 00:32:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm not desensitized to it in real life.</v>

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.163
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit of that,</v>

1301
00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:53.780
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of,</v>

1302
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything particular that I need to be looking at,</v>

1303
00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 2>so I just decide,</v>

1304
00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

1305

<v Speaker 2>Let's just click it.</v>

1311
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what it,</v>

1312
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>

1313
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:05.781
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1314
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 2>I think the best movie for you ever is.</v>

1315
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 2>If they made like a horror movie,</v>

1316
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:14.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a free Friday the 13th but it was like Friday 13th but the porn</v>

1317
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:15.764
<v Speaker 2>mixed in with it,</v>

1318
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.880
<v Speaker 2>like it was like there was like six girls staying at this hotel.</v>

1319
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:19.500
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1320
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.520
<v Speaker 2>You're projecting your own fucked up weird shit on me.</v>

1321
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be your favorite movie ever.</v>

1322
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't like Friday movies.</v>

1323
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1324
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I like Werewolf movies,</v>

1325
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.590
<v Speaker 2>but I've making it figure out why.</v>

1326
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck that is.</v>

1327
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I guess somehow or another knowing that deep inside people,</v>

1328
00:33:34.641 --> 00:33:35.300
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>

1329
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 2>some sort of an animalistic nature that that it is almost like a wolf,</v>

1330
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.690
<v Speaker 2>you know you're aware of.</v>

1331
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.681
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1332
00:33:41.681 --> 00:33:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in person.</v>

1333
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Fuck is wrong with you.</v>

1334
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1335
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.090
<v Speaker 2>we'll stone exist.</v>

1336
00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:47.924
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

1337
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I remember when twilight with the big east always say you're aware of Wolf</v>

1338
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.440
<v Speaker 2>brand.</v>

1339
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 2>You're going to give me a bad reputation with these lies.</v>

1340
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.151
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's cool,</v>

1341
00:33:56.151 --> 00:33:56.984
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1342
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:57.831
<v Speaker 2>Poor friends.</v>

1343
00:33:57.831 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't just fucking him put shit like this.</v>

1344
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Put it up.</v>

1345
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.441
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

1346
00:34:01.441 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 2>it'd be on my Wikipedia page.</v>

1347
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:04.483
<v Speaker 2>That's going to become,</v>

1348
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 2>that's the next thing on the Wikipedia page.</v>

1349
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that you should put in that during the twilight days,</v>

1350
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan often said that he was aware of Wolf.</v>

1351
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you should put that on there,</v>

1352
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 2>but if it's on there,</v>

1353
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:15.973
<v Speaker 2>I ain't hating.</v>

1354
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.850
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1355
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:17.683
<v Speaker 2>I ain't mad at you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm already on some man Shit.</v>

1357
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1358
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:20.683
<v Speaker 2>because when they,</v>

1359

<v Speaker 2>when the Dale Wright's said that y'all had some man shit,</v>

1360

<v Speaker 2>I said something about putting it on.</v>

1361
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm on Wikipedia and apparently it's up there.</v>

1362
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:29.810

1365
00:34:31.971 --> 00:34:32.900
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to write,</v>

1366
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:33.734
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big ship.</v>

1367
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I got banned from Wikipedia.</v>

1368
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I support your fake writing shit about me on Wikipedia.</v>

1369
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:38.630
<v Speaker 2>As long as it's funny,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's it.</v>

1376
00:34:43.691 --> 00:34:44.990

1377
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:45.790
<v Speaker 2>it's silly.</v>
