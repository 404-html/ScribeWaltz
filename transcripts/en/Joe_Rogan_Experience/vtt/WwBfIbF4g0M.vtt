WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Da da,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're live and you have come </v>

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>bringing the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we've all hoped for.</v>

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>We had all heard about this when we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to sell.</v>

5
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:17.931
<v Speaker 1>We'd like cigarettes in a carton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll going to be pre rolled and you're </v>

6
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>going to be buying it just like you buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Marlboro and you've,</v>

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>you've come bringing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is real sure.</v>

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real thing though.</v>

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you get those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I got them into the Seattle when we just</v>
<v Speaker 1>played there.</v>

11
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>The company brought us a whole gift bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it hasn't worked with transport,</v>

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>with things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>I guess if I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw up our transport.</v>

14
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Definitely I'm not a traveler with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm acquire when you get there kind of a</v>

15
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

16
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's usually the best move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>it is the best move.</v>

18
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they even bother checking people in </v>

19
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>the Seattle airport anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>we're on a bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally different.</v>

21
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

22
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>So except if you go to Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never,</v>

23
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I would never take it on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

24
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>not a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a good move,</v>

25
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>but when they arrested Willie Nelson in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas and like,</v>

26
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how much.</v>

27
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't make exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>That was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was stupid.</v>

29
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>it hurts my feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

31
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're doing.</v>

32
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to solve crime arrests in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he eat now?</v>

33
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to be close to 80.</v>

34
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got to be in the top 10 of people </v>

35
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>who have done more for the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas than anyone.</v>

36
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on now.</v>

38
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's undeniably awesome.</v>

39
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

40
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I was a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to arrest that guy?</v>

42
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine willie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was probably like really serious and </v>

44
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sad.</v>

45
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>It's someone must've felt kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed.</v>

46
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking today because today </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is good.</v>

48
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>This is a historic day for music because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Prince.</v>

49
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

50
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange when a guy that's that</v>

51
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when I was a kid during my </v>

52
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>teen years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

53
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was,</v>

54
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really emerging and that's when people </v>

55
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>were really finding out about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking like,</v>

56
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is so interesting.</v>

57
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 1>It's such a combination of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

58
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no one that was like him </v>

59
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean David Bowie was sort of </v>

60
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>androgynous before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he took it into a different new </v>

61
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>place and it was mysterious and had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>with David Bowie.</v>

62
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always felt more like theater with </v>

63
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>prince.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt more like prince,</v>

64
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really him,</v>

65
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Purple Rain and then did the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he just started that way,</v>

67
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>but we kind of transformed into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>androgyny.</v>

68
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Prince was like that to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

69
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time pat and I </v>

70
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>played the first avenue in Minneapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they shot,</v>

71
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I think some parts from maybe the live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

72
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>The live segments from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that movie.</v>

73
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the big thing,</v>

74
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Just to be as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kind of owned Minneapolis,</v>

76
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:07.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put Minneapolis on the map and he </v>

77
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:07.741
<v Speaker 1>stayed there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

78
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and you thought of many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like thought of Prince.</v>

79
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:13.771
<v Speaker 1>You thought of Minneapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was part of the thing is that he </v>

80
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as this wizard that lived in this frozen</v>

81
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:19.171
<v Speaker 1>land and produced all this crazy music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never would have arrested prints </v>

82
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>for we'd know in Minneapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

83
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Now he gets a hall pass.</v>

84
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

85
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>he was the man in Minneapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean every he was,</v>

86
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>he's a god there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it was that got them,</v>

87
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 57 years old.</v>

88
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a thin guy.</v>

89
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Looks like he's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked very healthy.</v>

90
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>He looked like he could have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistaken for Ferrell.</v>

91
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

92
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two guys are like ageless,</v>

93
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did a show just a couple of </v>

94
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.320
<v Speaker 1>nights ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

95
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>he was on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

96
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so wild.</v>

97
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard when something like that </v>

98
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only speculate.</v>

99
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one really knows until you hear.</v>

100
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:02.431
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just reinforces this idea that we're </v>

101
00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 1>so fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all could go away.</v>

102
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

103
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it doesn't matter how much </v>

104
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>money you have can have the best doctors</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and it's just,</v>

105
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>you have to be thankful for what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have got to be a good human because it </v>

106
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>can just all go away so quickly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually it's all going to go away for</v>

107
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>

108
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very soon.</v>

109
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is very short.</v>

110
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent not going to last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hondo says nobody gets out alive.</v>

111
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one instill.</v>

112
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a people run through life </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulating shit.</v>

113
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

114
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>and missing missing opportunities to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just take it all in and enjoy it.</v>

115
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>And when a guy like prince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the undeniable things that he </v>

116
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>left was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

117
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>you will always have his catalog of work</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make people happy.</v>

118
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Like he left a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an undeniable impact on people.</v>

119
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this day,</v>

120
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will pull out,</v>

121
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I wanna be your lover because that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first big hit.</v>

122
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And like that still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking bad ass song.</v>

123
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

124
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 1>what really kills me though is when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get an artist who people just weren't </v>

125
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>ready for and they're only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're only shown love after they die.</v>

126
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of kills me.</v>

127
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the case here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 1>for sure he's going to get when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>always showing love,</v>

129
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.040
<v Speaker 1>but he'll be showing a lot more love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People appreciate them now that they </v>

130
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>know it's ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do,</v>

131
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to Michael Jackson.</v>

132
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people weren't nearly as interested in </v>

133
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>him because he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once he died,</v>

134
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:43.681
<v Speaker 1>like once he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then his catalog went through the roof </v>

135
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:46.471
<v Speaker 1>and everybody wanted to buy the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff up and all the prince stuff is </v>

136
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:46.471
<v Speaker 1>like charting now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

137
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about Bill Hicks the </v>

138
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.341
<v Speaker 1>other day and how he died at his mom's </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Arkansas.</v>

139
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>He will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew it was going down for awhile.</v>

140
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.340
<v Speaker 2>He had pancreatic cancer and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a particularly brutal kind of </v>

141
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.811
<v Speaker 2>cancer apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the nineties when bill </v>

142
00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>died of it and he knew and just went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his mom's place to die,</v>

143
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 2>but just thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just sort of never made it,</v>

144
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 2>made it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He know what I mean.</v>

145
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he dies and then all of a </v>

146
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>sudden everybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

147
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.041
<v Speaker 2>he was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the best comics all the </v>

148
00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:24.041
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

149
00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:24.041
<v Speaker 2>he was certainly one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential,</v>

150
00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

151
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 2>he changed so many people's perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what comedy could be.</v>

152
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 2>He like opened up a whole new way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

153
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy could do that too.</v>

154
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:33.160
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

155
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.020
<v Speaker 2>nobody did that before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.090
<v Speaker 2>he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a consciousness to his comedy or </v>

157
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 2>like an elevation sorta thing to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy where he's trying to change your </v>

158
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 2>thought process along with make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>

159
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different thing.</v>

160
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get to that place.</v>

161
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>That's the place you always want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

162
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Some people are just born there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

163
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're talking about prince,</v>

164
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 2>he was prince when he started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had the third eye when he started.</v>

165
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes some people some time </v>

166
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.591
<v Speaker 2>on stage to figure themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a few years of like making </v>

167
00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 2>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to too many people.</v>

168
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

169
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 2>You could definitely get off on bad pass</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've got to recorrect come back.</v>

170
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.800
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a learning process to </v>

171
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.641
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's so difficult with cell </v>

172
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:24.641
<v Speaker 2>phones nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't learn in private,</v>

173
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:28.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you used to be able to go on stage and </v>

174
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:28.990
<v Speaker 2>like practice kind of in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

175
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 2>which is the best practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 2>but now everything's filmed.</v>

177
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Even your shit that you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work out,</v>

178
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 2>you can't just be so free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

179
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Big with big deal with standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal with standup because </v>

180
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.110
<v Speaker 2>the bits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hear them and then you hear the </v>

181
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.110
<v Speaker 2>finished product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will.</v>

182
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.000
<v Speaker 2>If you hear the like the starting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you should ideally he'll hear it </v>

183
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.750
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in full form and </v>
<v Speaker 2>completed for him,</v>

184
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people enjoy that process,</v>

185
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:03.851
<v Speaker 2>they'll like coming to the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 2>and watching people stumble through an </v>

186
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 2>idea that they're not exactly sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll see that bit,</v>

187
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 2>maybe six months later on a television </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialist.</v>

188
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

189
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

190
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 2>But he could also choose as a fan to not</v>
<v Speaker 2>seek that stuff out.</v>

191
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I think people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

192
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

193
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 2>it stops me from wanting to play songs.</v>

194
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

195
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're worried that like a video</v>

196
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:27.581
<v Speaker 2>of it getting out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being kind of in the halfway hacking my </v>

197
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 2>way down new song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

199
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well if you think it's really stifled,</v>

200
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 2>stifled some modern performing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen some of those things that </v>

201
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle's done and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Hannibal burress has done.</v>

202
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:46.541
<v Speaker 2>They take these bags and you put your </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell phone in and we to go in and it's </v>

203
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 2>sealed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're in the room,</v>

204
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:51.761
<v Speaker 2>you literally can open the bag and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you leave the room somehow there's </v>

205
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 2>some sensor and allows you to open the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bag.</v>

206
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a ridiculous idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the more I about it,</v>

207
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>it seems like</v>

208
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>it's the kind of thing that people may </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

209
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>But then thank you for afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

210
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

211
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>For the experience themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

213
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really paid attention anything</v>

214
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 1>for an hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>

215
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>

216
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

217
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a concert now,</v>

218
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.630
<v Speaker 1>all you see is phones up and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the concert through phones.</v>

219
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see this,</v>

220
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 1>you see people doing this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

221
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a sea of cell phones at these</v>

222
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird.</v>

223
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 1>They used to reach out and try to touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

224
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Now they either reach out to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

225
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 1>to take a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you notice a shift or it's slowly,</v>

226
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>like almost like people were infected by</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>

227
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>like the tin man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

228
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:42.490
<v Speaker 1>when we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a flip phone generation.</v>

229
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I know those are two problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hard.</v>

230
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Take a picture with some people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it,</v>

231
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:50.430
<v Speaker 1>but most people left them in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets.</v>

232
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

233
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:54.370
<v Speaker 1>because the picture's sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

234
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not something you want to brag </v>
<v Speaker 1>about now.</v>

235
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like the best photographer </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever with the iphone.</v>

236
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so good now and they're getting </v>

237
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.470
<v Speaker 1>better all the time and they're also </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting those little lenses on them.</v>

238
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>They're making them even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They slide a little lens over the top of</v>

239
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a lot of that,</v>

240
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 1>but people aren't experiencing it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pure way.</v>

241
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>You know you're not going to it and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and taking in the show.</v>

242
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Instead you're going into it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware that you were recording it and you</v>

243
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:22.080
<v Speaker 1>want to make sure you get it in frame </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you make sure you've got a good part</v>

244
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:27.081
<v Speaker 1>that's going to look good on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook or wherever the fuck you're </v>

245
00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:27.081
<v Speaker 1>going to put it.</v>

246
00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You missing your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not giving into the experience of</v>

247
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.100
<v Speaker 1>the music or the show or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to 100 percent.</v>

248
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Life is not as good with cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

249
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 1>but I have it in my hand all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

250
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that life is not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more challenging because it doesn't</v>

251
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>prevent you from putting it away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes it very addictive.</v>

252
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to put it away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could.</v>

253
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the kind of I think is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing where like your life would</v>

254
00:10:56.011 --> 00:11:01.011
<v Speaker 1>be better if you didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be able to experience life </v>

255
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:03.111
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd paid more attention to your kids </v>

256
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:03.111
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have more real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true love.</v>

257
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:07.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be taking fucking selfies </v>

258
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.961
<v Speaker 1>to post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd actually be hugging them </v>

259
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:08.961
<v Speaker 1>genuinely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

260
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I think a can't do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

261
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I've not met that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

262
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I love the data though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love all the information.</v>

263
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I love the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on to it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Constantly.</v>

269
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like the amount of data that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting now is,</v>

270
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.150

<v Speaker 1>Hasn't made us better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and I know they're wrong.</v>

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:21.361
<v Speaker 2>you're in the wrong party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely a lot of that out </v>

289
00:12:21.361 --> 00:12:24.241
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you're just where you need to </v>

290
00:12:24.241 --> 00:12:24.241
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say I really go to parties.</v>

291
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might've been a dozen parties out here</v>

292
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 2>in my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You just go busy working nights.</v>

295
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.620
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a lot of friends that put </v>

296
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:40.620
<v Speaker 2>on parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not normal.</v>

297
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I made me be like a pool party or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

298
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 2>You go over a buddy's house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your barbecue,</v>

299
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:43.960
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:48.961
<v Speaker 2>like a party party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to a few of those like </v>

301
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:48.961
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood parties where you're walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and go,</v>

302
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's drew barrymore.</v>

303
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:51.490

<v Speaker 2>And you go into another room.</v>

304

<v Speaker 2>This Ben Stiller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking weird.</v>

305
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And you feel totally out of place and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get out of there as quick as </v>

306
00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to a couple of those but never</v>

307
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 2>sought them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always seemed odd.</v>

308
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't love him so much.</v>

309
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.580
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

310
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.170
<v Speaker 3>we stay at the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chateau,</v>

311
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.920
<v Speaker 2>of course you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>

312
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.810
<v Speaker 2>It has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the spot and Hollywood,</v>

313
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the authentic spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so cliche,</v>

314
00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:17.040
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just been there.</v>

315
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleeping in the bed where,</v>

316
00:13:18.961 --> 00:13:20.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belushi died,</v>

317
00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:25.190
<v Speaker 2>just like raging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

318
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Learning nothing from his mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

319
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've woken up at that in that,</v>

321
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 3>in that a place like blood on the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like what happened?</v>

322
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Have we learned nothing from this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

323
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that places like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>contain memory is that there's a real </v>

324
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.680
<v Speaker 2>thought and we've brought it up before </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics at the comedy store because the </v>

325
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.650
<v Speaker 2>comedy store used to be Ciro's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nightclub.</v>

326
00:13:51.651 --> 00:13:54.290
<v Speaker 2>It was owned by Bugsy Siegel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mobster,</v>

327
00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:56.640
<v Speaker 2>and so there's murders that were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's weed,</v>

328
00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a murder that was there just a </v>

329
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 2>year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody got murdered on the front patio</v>

330
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.490
<v Speaker 2>at the comedy store were like the rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of weirdness and of comedy.</v>

331
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.670
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be in the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like that about the Chateau </v>

332
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Marmont because if you go to that place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

333
00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 2>is there one place more synonymous with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood debacle than that place?</v>

334
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:20.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that might be the hotel in </v>

335
00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:23.531
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood where you think of like Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depp's doing blow and Jack Nicholson is </v>

336
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 2>banging these fuckers and ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

337
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.860
<v Speaker 2>that's the place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

338
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

339
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I think that that plays just caters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

340
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:35.280
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like this and it's dark,</v>

341
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.610
<v Speaker 3>thick curtains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No cops.</v>

342
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Do you want know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll watch the old guard the door.</v>

343
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

344
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.970
<v Speaker 3>but I think there are places that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>magic in them.</v>

345
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I think that there are places that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>

346
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 3>you just can't explain like muscle </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoals,</v>

347
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we cut a record in muscle shoals.</v>

348
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's magic.</v>

349
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that,</v>

350
00:14:57.951 --> 00:14:59.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why no,</v>

351
00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.320
<v Speaker 3>the Americans lived there and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

352
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was spiritual land and.</v>

353
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's special.</v>

354
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.550
<v Speaker 3>There's something there that you're able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get in touch with yourself easier.</v>

355
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:19.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this something in the recording </v>

356
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.460
<v Speaker 3>studio itself or is there something in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the town?</v>

357
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:22.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so because there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple studios there and they all,</v>

358
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.020
<v Speaker 3>they all produce great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still great musicians coming out</v>

359
00:15:26.021 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 3>of muscle shoals and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

360
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.080
<v Speaker 3>there are certain places that are just,</v>

361
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is it possible that those buildings,</v>

362
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 3>those recording studios have memory that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a something and intangible,</v>

363
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.270
<v Speaker 3>something you can't put on a scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't measure it because the comedy </v>

364
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.451
<v Speaker 3>store feels like a place with memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I always ask because I </v>

365
00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:52.861
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took seven years off that place and I </v>

366
00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:55.070
<v Speaker 3>went back about a year and a half ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I still to this day I remember going</v>

367
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:56.090
<v Speaker 3>back again and going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

368
00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 3>there's that feeling again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with this,</v>

369
00:15:57.471 --> 00:15:58.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history.</v>

370
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 3>You knew the history for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went into the place though.</v>

371
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.110
<v Speaker 3>So it was before you even got there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>magic to you?</v>

372
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was for me and most mostly shows and </v>

373
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 3>I went into the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

374
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

375
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.300
<v Speaker 3>that's where Eddie Hinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

376
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 3>took a shit in that bathroom right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

377
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:14.150
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like A.</v>

378
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

379
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't,</v>

380
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.930
<v Speaker 3>if somebody didn't know ahead of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they went in there,</v>

381
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 3>they would think it was just as magic as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

382
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're right.</v>

383
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know because you have these preconceived</v>

384
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:29.280
<v Speaker 3>ideas about it that are on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't see it.</v>

385
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.810
<v Speaker 3>That was Mecca for comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So muscle shoals.</v>

386
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did skinner record there as well?</v>

387
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think skinner skinner.</v>

388
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.080
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure they recorded their </v>

389
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.680
<v Speaker 3>rolling stones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recorded so many fantastic aretha </v>

390
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 3>recorded there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

391
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean they cut so many tracks there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

392
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.260
<v Speaker 3>I like this one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Research,</v>

393
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 3>like a waffle house there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing there.</v>

394
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:56.330
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason anybody would go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle shoals.</v>

395
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Speaker 3>And it was the recording Mecca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

396
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

397
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 3>That's not close to any major </v>
<v Speaker 3>metropolis.</v>

398
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

399
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.650
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How else,</v>

400
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.240
<v Speaker 3>how else do you explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

401
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 3>this guy named Rupert Sheldrake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his official title of these </v>

402
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.140
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he thinks that there's memory and </v>

403
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.140
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks he can't.</v>

404
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.790
<v Speaker 3>You can't extract it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he thinks that there's memory in </v>

405
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:22.790
<v Speaker 3>wood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a memory in stones,</v>

406
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.220
<v Speaker 3>there's memory and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why people don't like the idea of</v>

407
00:17:26.221 --> 00:17:31.221
<v Speaker 3>a haunted house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we kind of inherently know that </v>

408
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:31.221
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone died in a house,</v>

409
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:33.000
<v Speaker 3>some some horrific tragedy took place in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the house.</v>

410
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.750
<v Speaker 3>That house actually has that sadness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that feeling in it.</v>

411
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.910
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a part of the house now.</v>

412
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

413
00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:42.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I believe it.</v>

414
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think we,</v>

415
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.000
<v Speaker 3>we create the history in our mind before</v>
<v Speaker 3>we even before we even get there.</v>

416
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's possible.</v>

417
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

418
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got a new guitar and it was,</v>

419
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a guitar that was owned by one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite musicians of all time and </v>

420
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.670
<v Speaker 1>this guy named Mississippi Fred </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdowell,</v>

421
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.930
<v Speaker 1>and I swear that it's magic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

422
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:05.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

423
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be magic though.</v>

424
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might have something in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it might have just something in</v>

425
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Speaker 1>it just because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:14.480
<v Speaker 1>it was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I'm saying is,</v>

427
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's saying but if it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still real,</v>

428
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:21.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that data amount of magic because </v>

429
00:18:21.711 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>it proved to me that someone felt it who</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know ahead of time but not really</v>

430
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.700
<v Speaker 1>because it works on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like magic doesn't have to work in end.</v>

431
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Everybody will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I would explain it that I already </v>

432
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:31.940
<v Speaker 1>thought of is magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

433
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.510
<v Speaker 1>So you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already thought it was magic,</v>

434
00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 1>but because you did it is.</v>

435
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

436
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would describe that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic.</v>

437
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if I had a notebook that </v>

438
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor road in where you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>never write in it,</v>

439
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.840
<v Speaker 1>you would save it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good example.</v>

440
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.650
<v Speaker 1>But like if somebody gave me like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard,</v>

441
00:18:53.651 --> 00:18:58.651
<v Speaker 1>if rich had a laptop and he wrote some </v>
<v Speaker 1>great shit on his laptop and then </v>

442
00:18:58.651 --> 00:18:58.770
<v Speaker 1>someone sold it and I had that laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

443
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And magic laptop.</v>

444
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden they would be matched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jokes are just all fire,</v>

445
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:06.180
<v Speaker 1>everything you right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think like,</v>

446
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I have to do this laptop justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the laptop of the great one.</v>

447
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to.</v>

448
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 1>This is no bullshit around with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

449
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think about it that way.</v>

450
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea behind like things being</v>

451
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 1>sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like if things,</v>

452
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.420
<v Speaker 1>if you decide things are sacred than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are sacred.</v>

453
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

454
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up to you to believe and if you </v>

455
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 1>treat them as sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's and,</v>

456
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 1>and life is short and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in magic,</v>

457
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.990
<v Speaker 1>then it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know I'm going to go run a </v>

458
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:41.990
<v Speaker 1>mountain right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it,</v>

459
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all I do everyday is go into the </v>

460
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 1>studio and like</v>

461
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.940
<v Speaker 1>make something out of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

462
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like magic to me still.</v>

463
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I wake up in the morning so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

464
00:19:55.851 --> 00:19:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like Christmas every morning.</v>

465
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.800
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's magic to me.</v>

466
00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

467
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.500
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I live for.</v>

468
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like,</v>

469
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've never really had a real job,</v>

470
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at my uncle's restaurant,</v>

471
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.450
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.300
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all I've ever done.</v>

473
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to do.</v>

474
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody's got a different path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do other shit.</v>

475
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Why do anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you still enjoy it,</v>

476
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:28.290
<v Speaker 1>he's still appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the music is amazing.</v>

477
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Why fucking times it makes it hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to other people.</v>

478
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 1>ones that are,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>other in Nashville.</v>

483

<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I've been a huge fan of the black keys </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time,</v>

485
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me to have you on is a real honor</v>

00:20:53.471 --> 00:20:58.471
<v Speaker 3>and a real treat so that you guys are so</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting because the music is so hard</v>

487
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:04.381
<v Speaker 3>to define like there's different styles </v>
<v Speaker 3>in different albums and it seems like </v>

488
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:10.861
<v Speaker 3>you guys go off in these really eclectic</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways and paths and there's so much </v>

489
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.980
<v Speaker 3>content,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you've guys have put out so many </v>

490
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:16.980
<v Speaker 3>sought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're so prolific.</v>

491
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I again,</v>

492
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:20.790
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know how else to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

493
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand how people go into </v>

494
00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:25.820
<v Speaker 3>the studio and take some fucking week to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do one song.</v>

495
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 3>They don't smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always smoke weed,</v>

496
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've done records with no we plenty </v>

497
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

498
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.850
<v Speaker 3>But I still do two songs a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I think you just love it and I </v>

499
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.931
<v Speaker 3>think if you love something and you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>give it that energy and it's obviously </v>

500
00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:42.931
<v Speaker 3>given you a lot of positive results.</v>

501
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 3>The thing is I think that people get so </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught up with worrying about what other</v>

502
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:51.211
<v Speaker 3>people think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just like over analyze and it's so </v>

503
00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:54.841
<v Speaker 3>hard to get really in touch with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something special when you're worrying </v>

504
00:21:54.841 --> 00:21:55.270
<v Speaker 3>so much about everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

505
00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:00.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a real aspect of social media </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think some people struggle with </v>

506
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.900
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a real thing too,</v>

507
00:22:00.901 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of very opinionated,</v>

508
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places that review music that are very,</v>

509
00:22:07.421 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 3>like into the trends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

510
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:14.971
<v Speaker 3>And I can see how that can be crippling </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a kid who's just trying to like make </v>

511
00:22:14.971 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

512
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Well any form criticism where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't like a performance,</v>

513
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 3>even if it's correct stills painful for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to hear and if you're hearing,</v>

514
00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:29.071
<v Speaker 3>if you like put together something and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it gets reviewed by a magazine or </v>

515
00:22:29.071 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 3>something and it gets poorly reviewed.</v>

516
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But not being able to take criticism as </v>

517
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 3>a sign of weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

518
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.700
<v Speaker 3>you have to know that you have to grow </v>
<v Speaker 3>into that.</v>

519
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:42.030
<v Speaker 3>And also music is so ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjective and there's stuff that people</v>

520
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:45.120
<v Speaker 3>love that I can't listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

521
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.960
<v Speaker 3>And there's stuff that I love that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>

522
00:22:46.961 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just always going to be that</v>

523
00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

524
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 3>And you have one person's take on it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the best thing ever.</v>

525
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:56.850
<v Speaker 3>And another person's take on it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fell asleep halfway through.</v>

526
00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.010
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

527
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.200
<v Speaker 3>there are records like that where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then again at the saint on on the </v>

528
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.240
<v Speaker 3>same hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there are records that people </v>

529
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.240
<v Speaker 3>played me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

530
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.630
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate this.</v>

531
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.570
<v Speaker 3>And then five years later it's my </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite thing.</v>

532
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't ready for it.</v>

533
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I didn't quite understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

534
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hear it in the right setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

535
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also what's beautiful about music </v>

536
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 3>and art is that it grows with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be the best of it can really grow</v>

537
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:27.640
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

538
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.440
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

539
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:34.441
<v Speaker 3>The hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right song at the right time can </v>

540
00:23:34.441 --> 00:23:35.080
<v Speaker 3>leave like a psychic imprint on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have that song.</v>

541
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 3>You always will associate that song with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that moment.</v>

542
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Powerful moments.</v>

543
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Things that changed forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old were you when you started doing </v>

544
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 3>music?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always around music.</v>

545
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:48.470
<v Speaker 3>My Dad had a great record collection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always playing music.</v>

546
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 3>My mom played piano and her whole family</v>
<v Speaker 3>play bluegrass.</v>

547
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what made me want to play</v>

548
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.730
<v Speaker 3>music was I wanted to play music with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncles.</v>

549
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.060
<v Speaker 3>They sat around in circles and my aunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would play Stanley brothers </v>

550
00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.200
<v Speaker 3>songs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandma died.</v>

551
00:24:05.201 --> 00:24:07.090

<v Speaker 3>It's just like music is a real part of </v>

554
00:24:14.281 --> 00:24:15.220
<v Speaker 3>my family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just always been there.</v>

555
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 3>That must have been crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You all sat around her grave and sang.</v>

556

<v Speaker 3>We sang her favorite songs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 3>by the Stanley brothers.</v>

559
00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:33.130
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorite songs ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people were saying six?</v>

560
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six people.</v>

561
00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:36.280
<v Speaker 3>And we brought her instruments.</v>

562
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] lot of crying and I'm crying</v>
<v Speaker 3>just thinking about it.</v>

563
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

564
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

565
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was her.</v>

566
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.030
<v Speaker 3>She loved to sit in the living room and </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to her kids play music.</v>

567
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like a and it's the reason I'm here</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

568
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

569
00:24:54.931 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because music is just really been such a</v>

570
00:24:58.251 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 3>part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

571
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:05.441
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When someone finds something that they </v>

572
00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:07.871
<v Speaker 3>really just tune into like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you see him just pursuing it with </v>

573
00:25:07.871 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 3>such wild abandon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

574
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what everybody as a fan,</v>

575
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.620
<v Speaker 3>that's what someone hopes for the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the person who puts out the sound </v>

576
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:20.420
<v Speaker 3>that you love is really into it and does</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all the time.</v>

577
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

578
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:26.270
<v Speaker 3>it's been the only thing I can really </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus on since I was about 15.</v>

579
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

580
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls and music was pretty much it.</v>

581
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.800
<v Speaker 3>I stopped messing around with sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

582
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

583
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys figured it out,</v>

584
00:25:37.691 --> 00:25:42.691
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He get that step five records before we </v>

585
00:25:42.881 --> 00:25:44.710
<v Speaker 3>even had song on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

586
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people were already talking about it</v>

587
00:25:47.081 --> 00:25:51.180
<v Speaker 3>before you guys had songs on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had such an authentic sound that you</v>

588
00:25:51.181 --> 00:25:53.140
<v Speaker 3>had already had a lot of momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was.</v>

589
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.780
<v Speaker 3>It was the cool thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that no one knew about yet.</v>

590
00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.560
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a great fan base before we had a </v>

591
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:01.560
<v Speaker 3>radio success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

592
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.070
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been really blessed like every,</v>

593
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.410
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was better than the one before.</v>

594
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.800
<v Speaker 3>What is your take on what's going on now</v>
<v Speaker 3>with radio?</v>

595
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.630
<v Speaker 3>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

596
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:15.510
<v Speaker 3>It must be strange to watch this </v>
<v Speaker 3>business go from being something where </v>

597
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:20.341
<v Speaker 3>you buy an actual physical thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>digital downloads and mean what has it </v>

598
00:26:21.641 --> 00:26:23.590
<v Speaker 3>been like to watch us all moving to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet?</v>

599
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.500
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really depressing.</v>

600
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people can make </v>
<v Speaker 3>connections with music like they used </v>

601
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.010
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

602
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.400
<v Speaker 3>when you used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you own something and you sit with </v>

603
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.400
<v Speaker 3>it and listened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

604
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.630
<v Speaker 3>you're like sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had uncles to disposable.</v>

605
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

606
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.740
<v Speaker 3>like sitting down with an album and </v>
<v Speaker 3>opening the album,</v>

607
00:26:41.741 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>putting the headphones on and not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about how,</v>

608
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the artists are treated with </v>

609
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 3>streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

610
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.311
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally criminal with a streaming </v>

611
00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:52.311
<v Speaker 3>things weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

612
00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 3>It's criminal to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

613
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I couldn't tell you numbers,</v>

614
00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just like youtube,</v>

615
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:03.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just paid ours fractions of what </v>

616
00:27:03.651 --> 00:27:05.961
<v Speaker 3>they should be paying and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not treated like a real um,</v>

617
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 3>valued thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

618
00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were discussing this the other day </v>

619
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.721
<v Speaker 2>about streaming services that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdest things about it is all they're </v>

620
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:19.960
<v Speaker 2>selling is artists work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

621
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all you have.</v>

622
00:27:21.101 --> 00:27:23.410
<v Speaker 2>You can't stream anything if someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>creates it,</v>

623
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:27.960
<v Speaker 2>that's all you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is what you're selling so well,</v>

624
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.090
<v Speaker 2>who's making all the money and why and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

625
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

626
00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 2>how has that worked out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now there's a lot of </v>

627
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.380
<v Speaker 2>opportunism going on and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are jockeying for a better slice of the </v>

628
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.551
<v Speaker 2>pie in a better position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we were talking about spotify and </v>

629
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:48.901
<v Speaker 2>all those different things and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>little money the artists actually get </v>

630
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:48.901
<v Speaker 2>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

631
00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.770
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird,</v>

632
00:27:50.771 --> 00:27:51.100
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

633
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:57.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine like going playing gigs </v>

634
00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:57.010
<v Speaker 3>at the Moore Theater and then saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

635
00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.280
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to pay you a streaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

636
00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.590
<v Speaker 3>not the real gig money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

637
00:28:00.591 --> 00:28:03.170
<v Speaker 3>It would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would make no sense.</v>

638
00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's Kinda the same thing.</v>

639
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

640
00:28:05.561 --> 00:28:10.561
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a product that you invested </v>

641
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:12.560
<v Speaker 3>your time and money into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be no different really.</v>

642
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

643
00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I think there should be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>established number.</v>

644
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.840
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much money are they making from it,</v>

645
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:24.220
<v Speaker 2>like how much money they make and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they play your one of your albums.</v>

646
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

647
00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.750
<v Speaker 4>Do you know streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Streaming?</v>

648
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero,</v>

649
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five cents per click</v>

650
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.170
<v Speaker 2>point zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

651
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.460
<v Speaker 2>five cents for a click for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you buy the album,</v>

652
00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.740
<v Speaker 2>how much is it per song?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much are they paying for?</v>

653
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.980
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

654
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:40.230
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

655
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 2>For,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a physical copy,</v>

656
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.060
<v Speaker 2>if you buy the album like on itunes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>on</v>

657
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.900
<v Speaker 3>CD,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cd or Itunes,</v>

658
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.540
<v Speaker 3>what is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the comparison to those?</v>

659
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:56.200
<v Speaker 4>You have a song is ninety nine cents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at 30,</v>

660
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:56.660
<v Speaker 4>40 seconds,</v>

661
00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:01.930
<v Speaker 2>no one can hear you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said if the song is ninety nine </v>

662
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:01.930
<v Speaker 2>cents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at 30 or forty cents.</v>

663
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.220
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] think as compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>streaming,</v>

664
00:29:04.221 --> 00:29:05.480
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say at one?</v>

665
00:29:05.481 --> 00:29:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

666
00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:06.860
<v Speaker 2>zero five.</v>

667
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.700
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you said?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Per time songs clicked.</v>

668
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>per time.</v>

669
00:29:12.941 --> 00:29:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Songs clicks or every time someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>clicks on it,</v>

670
00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.330
<v Speaker 4>it has to play for like 10 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

671
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just mass consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

672
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

673
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all started with being able to put it</v>

674
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:28.950
<v Speaker 2>on a server somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

675
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:33.951
<v Speaker 2>It all started from being digital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where things got odd where you </v>

676
00:29:33.951 --> 00:29:38.001
<v Speaker 2>could take someone stuff and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>need any special recording equipment to </v>

677
00:29:38.001 --> 00:29:42.501
<v Speaker 2>make copies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make copy on your computer </v>

678
00:29:42.501 --> 00:29:42.501
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You upload the copy and then</v>

679
00:29:42.501 --> 00:29:47.010
<v Speaker 1>that copy shared by x amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who just continually download it and </v>

680
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 1>share it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things gets weird.</v>

681
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 1>They get real weird when it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>digital entity,</v>

682
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 1>something that's out there in space and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then figuring out how you make money off</v>

683
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:59.881
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would feel like a streaming </v>

684
00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they have is someone's work.</v>

685
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.850
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if no one lets them put their stuff up,</v>

686
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.040
<v Speaker 1>then they don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

687
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the only benefit for you guys,</v>

688
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 1>it'd be more exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would help like ticket sales,</v>

689
00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:12.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

690
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 1>the major record labels own portions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these streaming services to.</v>

691
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets pretty deep.</v>

692
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

693
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just intertwined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nastiness and the artist pretty much </v>

694
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:29.581
<v Speaker 1>falls at the bottom of the barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the record labels have done the same </v>

695
00:30:29.581 --> 00:30:32.950
<v Speaker 1>thing that they used to do with physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>records and now they've done it with the</v>

696
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 1>streaming thing.</v>

697
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 1>They just hamstrings everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

698
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So should people not use those streaming</v>

699
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:42.610
<v Speaker 1>services?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the way to go?</v>

700
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean ultimately probably artists </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably shouldn't allow it,</v>

701
00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:49.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

702
00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.910
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

703
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to put it on there.</v>

704
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I should've,</v>

705
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I should've come with a spreadsheet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

706
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:01.750
<v Speaker 1>do you have the option?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

707
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 1>So like when they come to you and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

708
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:08.311
<v Speaker 1>Hey dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would want to put all your lily and </v>

709
00:31:08.311 --> 00:31:08.311
<v Speaker 1>you can say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

710
00:31:08.311 --> 00:31:08.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that.</v>

711
00:31:08.311 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 1>What you say or do you let them put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up there?</v>

712
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 1>We don't have anything on title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

713
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

714
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.880
<v Speaker 1>we have it on itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still pay it.</v>

715
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Then they pay the highest royalty rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

716
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.410
<v Speaker 1>A itunes.</v>

717
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

718
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 1>How's Google play?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're doing that.</v>

719
00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the newest one.</v>

720
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

721
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Google kind of they call own youtube so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get all that youtube money.</v>

722
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't they have to pay for like </v>

723
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:36.330
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth and shit too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

724
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:36.330
<v Speaker 1>isn't all that expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

725
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

726
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how the world has changed.</v>

727
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:46.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm a musician now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to worry about fucking this </v>

728
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.561
<v Speaker 1>business side of shit now and we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to like know about who owns all </v>

729
00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 1>these little portions of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like that's why we get taken</v>

730
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:56.230
<v Speaker 1>advantage of because we're just trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be artists and trying to make music.</v>

731
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.310
<v Speaker 1>We have to come become college </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors to even figure out our record</v>

732
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:01.810
<v Speaker 1>deals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

733
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 1>It's really unfair and when you sign a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid to a record deal,</v>

734
00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:09.721
<v Speaker 1>it's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pretty much are signing their life </v>

735
00:32:09.721 --> 00:32:09.721
<v Speaker 1>on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:32:09.721 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've read that piece that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Courtney love wrote years back.</v>

737
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever read anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty famous because a lot of </v>

738
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 1>people accused or using a ghost writer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was so well done,</v>

739
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 1>but it was a piece breaking down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you didn't know that she was the</v>

740
00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:25.900
<v Speaker 1>one who wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would go,</v>

741
00:32:25.901 --> 00:32:30.901
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a scathing review of how the </v>

742
00:32:30.901 --> 00:32:30.901
<v Speaker 1>money is distributed in the record </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

743
00:32:30.901 --> 00:32:35.760
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty shocking when you look at </v>

744
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.120
<v Speaker 1>it from terms of actual revenue to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually trickles down to the artist was</v>

745
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.480
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that they're selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The artists work and how these,</v>

746
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 1>these contracts are set up to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>people over.</v>

747
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.710
<v Speaker 1>But they've been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's these giant machines,</v>

748
00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:53.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have so many employees and they </v>

749
00:32:53.711 --> 00:32:55.331
<v Speaker 1>kind of have to justify keeping all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these buildings and having all these </v>

750
00:32:55.331 --> 00:32:57.710
<v Speaker 1>employees and there's a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be earned.</v>

751
00:32:57.711 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Just to keep this thing floating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

752
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got so engorged.</v>

753
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tech at the height of physical </v>

754
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:06.700
<v Speaker 1>sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

755
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

756
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.490
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to like get used to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>

757
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

758
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:14.910
<v Speaker 1>you're going to move back into apartment</v>
<v Speaker 1>next week and yeah,</v>

759
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.640
<v Speaker 1>it would suck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you try to figure out how to.</v>

760
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.800
<v Speaker 1>You might cut his pay a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the officers that you know,</v>

761
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

762
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 1>They just wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

763
00:33:25.101 --> 00:33:29.180
<v Speaker 1>they had to downsize quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to love record stores.</v>

764
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean the last real job I had was in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>record store.</v>

765
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Really last time I was ever really taxed</v>
<v Speaker 1>before being a musician.</v>

766
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.000
<v Speaker 1>I worked at quonset hut records in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Akron,</v>

767
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Ohio and it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned so much there.</v>

768
00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I learned so much cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People hit me with so much great music </v>

769
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 1>that I never would have heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well back then.</v>

770
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 1>That was the way you could find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

771
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 1>You go to the record stores and </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient autos would let you know about</v>

772
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.290
<v Speaker 1>dedicated their lives to learning about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

773
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:02.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like essentially college professors of </v>

774
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:02.320
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

775
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.130
<v Speaker 1>The guys that I worked with were pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much geniuses.</v>

776
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:08.140
<v Speaker 1>They were all like 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>55 year old guys with like other living </v>

777
00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 1>room is just all records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

778
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 1>And they would teach me things every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time I would go in there like,</v>

779
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've never heard this?</v>

780
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Well then you got to hear this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to hear this.</v>

781
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And it changed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

782
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.840
<v Speaker 1>isn't it funny that that is not like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>respected quality in the mainstream </v>

783
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.440
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being a Somalia is,</v>

784
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:31.210
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a guy who can like swish wine </v>

785
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.740
<v Speaker 1>around and tell you what part of France </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was grown like that's,</v>

786
00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.220
<v Speaker 1>that's something that we look at it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

787
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.980
<v Speaker 1>oh he's a sophisticated Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

788
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.770
<v Speaker 1>oh that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows a lot about sixties jazz.</v>

789
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a shit you loser.</v>

790
00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit about Somalia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

791
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.290
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

792
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 1>you got to come up with a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison,</v>

793
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:53.831
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for a lot of people it's sure it's </v>

794
00:34:53.831 --> 00:34:55.010
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big fancy schmancy type.</v>

795
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all a bunch of horse shit.</v>

797
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like just because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a college degree in it.</v>

798
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not taken seriously.</v>

799
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.370
<v Speaker 1>But what really is a college degree at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day?</v>

800
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to music,</v>

801
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean imagine if the only good </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians were musicians who had phds </v>

802
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.520
<v Speaker 1>and in music theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

803
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.180
<v Speaker 1>it would be like North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

804
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.480
<v Speaker 1>could you even put together the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>music that you guys made?</v>

805
00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:28.481
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really like thought about it in </v>

806
00:35:28.481 --> 00:35:28.481
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your,</v>

807
00:35:28.481 --> 00:35:31.410
<v Speaker 1>your stuff is so uniquely creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what like you have,</v>

808
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.970
<v Speaker 1>you guys had a sound for a lot of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs so it's like you would,</v>

809
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 1>you would hear it and even though it was</v>

810
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 3>interesting and unique and different </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the previous song,</v>

811
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.890
<v Speaker 3>you could tell us a black key song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

812
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.930
<v Speaker 3>it was coming from two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

813
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.200
<v Speaker 3>clearly coming from two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as soon as you add a lot of </v>

814
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.120
<v Speaker 3>theory and overproduction and different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people overseeing things and looking for</v>

815
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:59.880
<v Speaker 3>the right amount of beats per minute and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that jazz.</v>

816
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:05.210
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the greatest people are just </v>

817
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 3>the greatest people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

818
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.390
<v Speaker 3>if you could be around Richard Pryor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch him.</v>

819
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 3>You would feel the magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would see the way he walks,</v>

820
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.590
<v Speaker 3>the way he touches his lips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he,</v>

821
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I'm hanging out with Dr John,</v>

822
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

823
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is like from another planet.</v>

824
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.010
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

825
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 3>you can't teach that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

826
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.050
<v Speaker 3>it's total magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

827
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 3>I can't even imagine like an la Dr John </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be here,</v>

828
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 3>so doing session work fit well.</v>

829
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.800
<v Speaker 3>That's like when Phil Spector was making</v>
<v Speaker 3>records and stuff like that,</v>

830
00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:45.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be a studio full of Dr Johns.</v>

831
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 3>People that just had their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own thing about him.</v>

832
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Total self confidence,</v>

833
00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 3>their own style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No theory,</v>

834
00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 3>no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>

835
00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:02.380
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what he does and we're going to </v>

836
00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.480
<v Speaker 3>incorporate this and this with 12 other </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who have their own thing.</v>

837
00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

838
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:11.031
<v Speaker 3>And that's a cool thing that studios </v>
<v Speaker 3>would kind of lose now because people </v>

839
00:37:11.031 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 3>can't afford to have studios and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>had changed so much.</v>

840
00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Over time it gets depressing the more I </v>
<v Speaker 3>work with these older,</v>

841
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 3>older guys who are just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so hard to describe.</v>

842
00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.070
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like magic.</v>

843
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Was it because everything they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing was completely analog?</v>

844
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:32.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was a performance and you </v>

845
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:33.450
<v Speaker 3>need to like not only did you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with the part on the spot,</v>

846
00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 3>it had to kind of improvise.</v>

847
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.710
<v Speaker 3>You had to play perfectly behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat.</v>

848
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.040
<v Speaker 3>You had to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to just like,</v>

849
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just hard to explain.</v>

850
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:49.610
<v Speaker 3>You had to just kind of be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the nuance of everything </v>

851
00:37:50.551 --> 00:37:53.190
<v Speaker 3>going on around you and there's less of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that now.</v>

852
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:58.490
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's harder when people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get to record together and make </v>

853
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.620
<v Speaker 3>music together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the case,</v>

854
00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's.</v>

855
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
<v Speaker 3>You don't really make money make playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>music unless you reach a certain level </v>

856
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.060
<v Speaker 3>and it's so much harder to now than it </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever was before.</v>

857
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.750
<v Speaker 3>It's harder to reach a certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

858
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:13.040
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But doesn't youtube and things along </v>

859
00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.201
<v Speaker 3>those lines don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't it help some people reach a </v>

860
00:38:15.201 --> 00:38:15.330
<v Speaker 3>higher level quicker without the need </v>
<v Speaker 3>for mainstream media?</v>

861
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know?</v>

862
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beats me.</v>

863
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody who like got their </v>
<v Speaker 3>start on youtube,</v>

864
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.480
<v Speaker 3>didn't honey honey band.</v>

865
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Then they become famous from youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what started all about.</v>

866
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a combination of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to nail down on one.</v>

867
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we didn't do that but I mean we </v>

868
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 3>were like hit the road and we like </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing shows and we just kept hitting </v>

869
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 3>up city so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't know because I don't know.</v>

870
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't have experience with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So tell me about the arcs.</v>

871
00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Will the arts is just a group of Friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mine who I made records with for </v>

872
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:56.911
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who make some of my favorite </v>

<v Speaker 3>in various forms for different people.</v>

878
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 3>And then when we had free time we would </v>
<v Speaker 3>record for ourselves just for fun,</v>

879
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:18.180
<v Speaker 3>just making stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm Leon and I about a year and a </v>

880
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.880
<v Speaker 3>half ago got together just to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorize them,</v>

881
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:26.910
<v Speaker 3>put them in a folder to see what we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had like 70 songs while we're </v>

882
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 3>just sitting there.</v>

883
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.290
<v Speaker 3>So we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing you now,</v>

00:39:30.291 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

885
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:37.261

<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to like share this </v>

886
00:39:37.261 --> 00:39:37.261
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

887
00:39:37.261 --> 00:39:40.140
<v Speaker 3>so we just kind of came up with the rx </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was our platform that's </v>

888
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 3>insanely had 70 songs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 songs.</v>

889
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

890
00:39:42.851 --> 00:39:46.390
<v Speaker 3>every time we get in the studio together</v>
<v Speaker 3>with two or three songs,</v>

891
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:48.310
<v Speaker 3>we'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can just make them up,</v>

892
00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.840
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

893
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 3>When you go into the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have any idea?</v>

894
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:58.921
<v Speaker 3>If you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a session where you might </v>

895
00:39:58.921 --> 00:40:01.320
<v Speaker 3>improvise and come up with new stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have any idea of what direction </v>

896
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go in or do you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>concept or do you just go free ball?</v>

897
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:10.710
<v Speaker 3>You kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had just always a free freewill I </v>

898
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.930
<v Speaker 3>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you always done it that way?</v>

899
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for the most part.</v>

900
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

901
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I have had some songs written ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

902
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.840
<v Speaker 3>but that's more recently when I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

903
00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:22.140
<v Speaker 3>we were just making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean black,</v>

904
00:40:22.141 --> 00:40:25.820
<v Speaker 3>he's out there just totally improvised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you improvise,</v>

905
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.750
<v Speaker 3>would you have someone recording it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it or would you write it?</v>

906
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:35.010
<v Speaker 3>We did it all ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the basement it was just the two </v>

907
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:35.010
<v Speaker 3>of us and we had a four track cassette </v>
<v Speaker 3>recording them.</v>

908
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a digital recorder.</v>

909
00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

910
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we didn't have anybody helping us</v>

911
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why I was so cool.</v>

912
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why it was such a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

913
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.860
<v Speaker 3>there's hubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the I'll do big sessions now and </v>

914
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:52.860
<v Speaker 3>there'll be like an assistant running </v>
<v Speaker 3>around like taking notes,</v>

915
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.280
<v Speaker 3>like what guitar I'm using and Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

916
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:58.120
<v Speaker 3>oh this track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So interesting now,</v>

917
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just never had that growing up.</v>

918
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.720
<v Speaker 3>It just feel so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So would you guys,</v>

919
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.900
<v Speaker 3>would you guys recorded initially as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were improvising error or did you </v>

920
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.290
<v Speaker 3>improvise it and get it down and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>record it and improvise it?</v>

921
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Usually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually like,</v>

922
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:15.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first or second take is,</v>

923
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 3>is the one that's best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with the mistakes,</v>

924
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.280
<v Speaker 3>it has the best feeling for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more that you focus on stuff to </v>

925
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the more boring it gets.</v>

926
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:30.110
<v Speaker 3>You lose that like initial spark to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking cool life you have.</v>

927
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.240
<v Speaker 3>You make cool and then you release them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not complaining.</v>

928
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so cool the way you describe it to </v>

929
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.210
<v Speaker 3>you just kind of go in there and fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the trance and make the sounds.</v>

930
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.020
<v Speaker 3>And for me it's only gotten better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The feeling.</v>

931
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

932
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work harder than anybody I know.</v>

933
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.660
<v Speaker 3>I get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started working and I don't work until</v>

934
00:41:56.661 --> 00:41:58.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't stop falling asleep,</v>

935
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:59.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>

936
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 3>So I think if it is work or do you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it is like when I get paid,</v>

937
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 3>I think if it is work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of them doing it,</v>

938
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:11.531
<v Speaker 3>I never think of it as work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the checks come it's worked </v>

939
00:42:11.531 --> 00:42:11.531
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

940
00:42:11.531 --> 00:42:12.640
<v Speaker 3>must have done some work while you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing work.</v>

941
00:42:12.641 --> 00:42:14.920
<v Speaker 3>It's just passion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how would you describe it?</v>

942
00:42:14.921 --> 00:42:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pet.</v>

943
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 3>I feel so lucky being able to go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the studio.</v>

944
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 3>I love hearing shit like this man go and</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in Nashville too,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

947
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.740
<v Speaker 3>you could argue that rock and roll </v>
<v Speaker 3>started there with,</v>

948
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty woman.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

952
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.760
<v Speaker 3>That riff was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wayne Moss did that riff right down the </v>

953
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:39.760
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

954
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:41.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

955
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just love that stuff.</v>

956
00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:47.030
<v Speaker 3>I love learning from those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love being around that.</v>

957
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:49.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just so much fun for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

958
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:55.060
<v Speaker 3>I had um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheeler Walker Jr in here the other day </v>

959
00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.780
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about Nashville and he </v>

960
00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.391
<v Speaker 3>was talking about the money machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>being behind Nashville now and how </v>

961
00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 3>strange it is that you have some real </v>
<v Speaker 3>music in that town,</v>

962
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.380
<v Speaker 3>but then you also have this stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is just concocted because it looks like </v>

963
00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.340
<v Speaker 3>it would do numbers and Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

964
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.100
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

965
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.660
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't that happen on some,</v>

966
00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.790
<v Speaker 3>at some level it's a music business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

967
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.860
<v Speaker 3>You're always going to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

968
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a business.</v>

969
00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're always going to have douche holes</v>

970
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 3>making a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot more money than you.</v>

971
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.960
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that,</v>

972
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.220
<v Speaker 3>that's so great about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking ever see that.</v>

973
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm never around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck with that at all.</v>

974
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.010
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been in Nashville six years,</v>

975
00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:37.910
<v Speaker 3>seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

976
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:43.240
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that's so cool about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is they really do a hold up that </v>

977
00:43:44.211 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure and like if I run out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tape,</v>

978
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I make a phone call and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>delivers me reel to reel tape and like </v>

979
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:51.520
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

980
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Where else can you do that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

981
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:56.900
<v Speaker 3>If that big business wasn't going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't make it so easy for me to be</v>

982
00:43:56.901 --> 00:44:01.901
<v Speaker 3>around so many great musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these country guys that I work </v>

983
00:44:01.901 --> 00:44:01.901
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

984
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:07.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're embarrassed with some of the </v>

985
00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.400
<v Speaker 3>shit that they play on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't tell me how bad it is,</v>

986
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.200
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the reason they're there and </v>

987
00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.020
<v Speaker 3>healthy and able to come in and work </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me,</v>

988
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:20.180
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't complain about it and then </v>

989
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.310
<v Speaker 3>reap all the benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

990
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.810
<v Speaker 3>So I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like positive negatives,</v>

991
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.660
<v Speaker 3>that's very honest of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of looking at it too.</v>

992
00:44:26.661 --> 00:44:29.120
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good perspective because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like it hurts you.</v>

993
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you drive down the street,</v>

994
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 3>a burger</v>

995
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.880
<v Speaker 1>king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hurt you.</v>

996
00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:34.240
<v Speaker 1>If you don't go in there and eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

997
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make a living playing music and </v>

998
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Nashville and I never see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

999
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Well you just surround yourself with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight knit group.</v>

1000
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never leave home,</v>

1001
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 1>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never see it.</v>

1002
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nashville is for,</v>

1003
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:53.070
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is the,</v>

1004
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.660
<v Speaker 1>that's the remaining Mecca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1005
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well for,</v>

1006
00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.840
<v Speaker 1>for certain musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who love country and Bluegrass,</v>

1007
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.790
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely the place to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1008
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 1>bluegrass still lives in Nashville more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than anywhere else I'd say.</v>

1009
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It seems like this is a really good time</v>
<v Speaker 1>for country.</v>

1010
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It seems our country is experiencing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>resurgence right now.</v>

1011
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Like real country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea really.</v>

1013
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1014
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.600
<v Speaker 1>you're in the mix though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to say something stupid about</v>

1015
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 1>people buying records.</v>

1016
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Walmart behind them or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very nice of you to pull back </v>

1017
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.720
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't look at me getting smart </v>

1018
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:37.720
<v Speaker 1>with age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

1019
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:37.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd,</v>

1020
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to be double,</v>
<v Speaker 1>triple thinking stuff.</v>

1021
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I pull it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

1022
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:44.400
<v Speaker 1>No need for conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1023
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1024
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1025
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.680
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>country fans buy more out,</v>

1026
00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.750
<v Speaker 1>more physical copies than anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1027
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 1>By far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.540
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1029
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.980
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1030
00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.150
<v Speaker 1>They probably still use CD things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably have those.</v>

1031
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:05.151
<v Speaker 1>Walkmans was mega big hip ones with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big bellies yelling the neat things.</v>

1032
00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Always yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1033
00:46:06.621 --> 00:46:07.980
<v Speaker 1>that's good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just like,</v>

1034
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could never be black fellows.</v>

1035
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was true.</v>

1036
00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:16.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was always like a hazard to them </v>

1037
00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.441
<v Speaker 1>or something like there were big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I wanted was that big yellow disc </v>

1038
00:46:18.441 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 1>and the Tony Hawk skateboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all I ever wanted.</v>

1039
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Well I remember when they figured out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to have some sort of buffering so </v>

1040
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:28.821
<v Speaker 1>that when you were playing the cd you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually jump around a little bit </v>

1041

<v Speaker 2>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and my buddies used to be the guys in</v>

1218
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:14.091
<v Speaker 2>the parking lot with flags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are so many bad motherfuckers from </v>

1219
00:54:14.091 --> 00:54:14.091
<v Speaker 2>Ohio?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

1220
00:54:14.091 --> 00:54:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Why is that state so bad ass?</v>

1221
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:17.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it had a,</v>

1222
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:19.530
<v Speaker 3>I think that had a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1223
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.460
<v Speaker 3>with all the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it had a lot of art.</v>

1224
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.710
<v Speaker 3>But now that now that the industry is </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone,</v>

1225
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.160
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a struggle a bit,</v>

1226
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 3>but the art still there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1227
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.090
<v Speaker 3>The NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the culture,</v>

1228
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Understanding that there's respect for </v>

1229
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 3>art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1230
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:38.760
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just totally made that up.</v>

1231
00:54:38.761 --> 00:54:41.490
<v Speaker 3>But you might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might make sense that,</v>

1232
00:54:41.491 --> 00:54:43.180
<v Speaker 3>that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something,</v>

1233
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:48.590
<v Speaker 3>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of astronauts are from </v>

1271
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:29.110
<v Speaker 2>She had a bb gun though.</v>

1272
00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 2>And a map to the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1273
00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:36.901
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's wearing a diaper ain't </v>

1274
00:56:36.901 --> 00:56:38.491
<v Speaker 2>thinking that straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she knows the BB gun when she </v>

1275
00:56:38.491 --> 00:56:38.491
<v Speaker 2>picked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

1276
00:56:38.491 --> 00:56:42.120
<v Speaker 2>She had a map to the house x.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1277
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:44.470
<v Speaker 2>do you know the story about the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>broke into the White House?</v>

1278
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 2>Only one guy ever broken the White House</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the Obama Administration and I've</v>

1279
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:54.091
<v Speaker 2>been researching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he the only one who's ever broken </v>

1280
00:56:54.091 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 2>that one ever during the Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:56:55.030 --> 00:57:00.030
<v Speaker 2>He had in his car two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two rifles for hand guns.</v>

1282
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:07.080
<v Speaker 2>800 rounds of ammunition to hatchets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a machete and he broke into the White </v>

1283
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:11.950
<v Speaker 2>House with a knife on him and he only </v>
<v Speaker 2>got 18 months.</v>

1284
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:13.320
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1285
00:57:13.321 --> 00:57:14.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had ptsd.</v>

1286
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1287
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:20.660
<v Speaker 2>It's called the roof like plead deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We bars to the door and there was a </v>

1288
00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:22.120
<v Speaker 2>woman security guard and she couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop him.</v>

1289
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.820
<v Speaker 2>He was too big and he ran past her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got deep in.</v>

1290
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:29.880
<v Speaker 2>You got deep in the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like deeper than they had originally </v>

1291
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:29.880
<v Speaker 2>admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he?</v>

1292
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.941
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he have a map like with x at the </v>

1293
00:57:32.941 --> 00:57:32.941
<v Speaker 2>end?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was going to say.</v>

1294
00:57:32.941 --> 00:57:37.030
<v Speaker 2>He had a map like White House x is dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

1295
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:42.090
<v Speaker 2>this guy was completely out of his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the crazy thing is the only got 18 </v>

1296
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:45.421
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know a guy was in jail for 10 </v>

1297
00:57:45.421 --> 00:57:48.541
<v Speaker 2>years for growing weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in federal penitentiary for 10 </v>

1298
00:57:48.541 --> 00:57:51.961
<v Speaker 2>years for growing weed and this guy got </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 months for having an arsenal in his </v>

1299
00:57:51.961 --> 00:57:54.040
<v Speaker 2>car and breaking into the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a knife.</v>

1300
00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Idiocracy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that cop in New York just got a </v>

1301
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 2>convicted of manslaughter but didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>any jail time.</v>

1302
00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Which comp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which story just just happened the other</v>

1303
00:58:04.751 --> 00:58:06.190
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>

1304
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what the case was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was at one of those cases </v>

1305
00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.750
<v Speaker 2>where he had the duty where he was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like consorted patrolling the stairwells</v>

1306
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:15.970
<v Speaker 2>and projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sounds horrifying.</v>

1307
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.450
<v Speaker 2>No jail time for x and y PD officer </v>
<v Speaker 2>after manslaughter conviction reduced to</v>

1308
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:24.460
<v Speaker 2>criminally negligent homicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1309
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:28.070
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did Jamie.</v>

1310
00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's like seems like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday there's just something that </v>

1311
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:36.430
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1312
00:58:36.431 --> 00:58:39.940
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a lot of stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make any sense and also a lot of</v>

1313
00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:42.070
<v Speaker 2>stuff you have to deal with if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking cop.</v>

1314
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:45.520
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a subject that requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

1315
00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 2>at cops had done and it's obvious you've</v>

1316
00:58:48.881 --> 00:58:53.881
<v Speaker 2>seen videos of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw that cop shoot that guy in the </v>

1317
00:58:53.881 --> 00:58:53.881
<v Speaker 2>back running away and then throw the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Taser on them.</v>

1318
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:58.120
<v Speaker 2>We've all seen horrible shift seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think these guys are shellshocked.</v>

1319
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:03.240
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a vast majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out there that are operating as </v>

1320
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.390
<v Speaker 2>police officers that are barely keeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>it together.</v>

1321
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a hard job and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys are under stress all the </v>

1322
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:13.171
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every day might be the end of their </v>

1323
00:59:13.171 --> 00:59:13.171
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1324
00:59:13.171 --> 00:59:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Every car they pull over might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who shoots him.</v>

1325
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.490
<v Speaker 2>You walk into places and you're hated </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly,</v>

1326
00:59:15.491 --> 00:59:17.560
<v Speaker 2>instantly everybody's line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be the opposite.</v>

1327
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's lying to and on top of that,</v>

1328
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:25.590
<v Speaker 2>they've set up as the enemy and as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy by making them glorified revenue </v>

1329
00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:29.501
<v Speaker 2>collector's pulling people over for </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a fucking traffic ticker.</v>

1330
00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:30.760
<v Speaker 2>You know your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1331
00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:34.940
<v Speaker 2>your blinkers not working or you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>licensed plates expired all shit.</v>

1332
00:59:34.941 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 2>That has nothing to do with crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1333
00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of that going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they give them quotas on speeding </v>

1334
00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:42.610
<v Speaker 2>tickets and they turned them into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy.</v>

1335
00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:44.810
<v Speaker 2>You're taking money from people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stealing from people.</v>

1336
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.840
<v Speaker 2>They're being used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being used and.</v>

1337
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not right.</v>

1338
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:55.460
<v Speaker 2>I just always hope that with when people</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about stuff like this and all these</v>

1339
00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:57.800
<v Speaker 2>videos that are getting out and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>the awareness of it,</v>

1340
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:03.250
<v Speaker 2>that it'll bounce back the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then people will realize it and the </v>

1341
01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 2>people somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be a self correcting thing.</v>

1342
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.960
<v Speaker 2>You think that's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1343
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think it's in time.</v>

1344
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:17.200
<v Speaker 2>The things that are self correcting A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's some famous white person </v>

1345
01:00:17.661 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>has to die and then maybe it'll get </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrected.</v>

1346
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people.</v>

1347
01:00:20.331 --> 01:00:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1348
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be right.</v>

1349
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be when people take notice.</v>

1350
01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I saw that interview that you did with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ex Baltimore cop.</v>

1351
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's coming back in.</v>

1352
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Boy that that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that should be,</v>

1353
01:00:34.221 --> 01:00:35.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>required viewing.</v>

1354
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's running for.</v>

1355
01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm chief of police of Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to take over Chicago.</v>

1356
01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.860
<v Speaker 2>He thinks he can make some leeway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to come in and talk about </v>

1357
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.601
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what an uphill battle that would </v>

1358
01:00:49.601 --> 01:00:49.601
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1359
01:00:49.601 --> 01:00:49.601
<v Speaker 2>if anybody's going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a guy like him.</v>

1360
01:00:49.601 --> 01:00:52.520
<v Speaker 2>A radical thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean fighting the crime.</v>

1361
01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean changing the politics.</v>

1362
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the uphill battle,</v>

1363
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.650
<v Speaker 2>but both would be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1364
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Chicago became a blood bath after they </v>
<v Speaker 2>started arresting key gang members that </v>

1365
01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.911
<v Speaker 2>were in control of a drug distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they created a power vacuum and you </v>

1366
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much like hats happened.</v>

1367
01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that why they call it rec?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

1368
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that why they call it Cerec?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what they call it?</v>

1369
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they call it rec.</v>

1370
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:19.580
<v Speaker 2>You knew that Jamie is on black twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a regular basis.</v>

1371
01:01:19.581 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 2>We just came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called it that too.</v>

1372
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:22.730
<v Speaker 2>That was in the SPEC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they call it.</v>

1373
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.990
<v Speaker 2>That's what locals call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so white because it was a little war</v>

1374
01:01:25.991 --> 01:01:27.140
<v Speaker 2>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1375
01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:28.670
<v Speaker 2>It isn't more zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's essentially.</v>

1376
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like kind of the same thing</v>

1377
01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 2>where you take out people in power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's just chaos.</v>

1378
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were there,</v>

1379
01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:42.131
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a year and a half ago and there </v>

1380
01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:42.131
<v Speaker 2>was a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1381
01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.720
<v Speaker 2>I was talking with down there that used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a cop and now he was a limo driver</v>

1382
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:49.990
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was telling me what it was like and </v>

1383
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:49.990
<v Speaker 2>that it's always been a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1384
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:52.820
<v Speaker 2>but then when they decided to go in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make some key arrests,</v>

1385
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:58.030
<v Speaker 2>they had created a bit of a power vacuum</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it all ramped up where people </v>

1386
01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.290
<v Speaker 2>were trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was also like,</v>

1387
01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:05.291
<v Speaker 2>once the violence has wrapped up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people want to respond to that </v>

1388
01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:06.470
<v Speaker 2>violence and it ramps it up even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do you stop that,</v>

1389
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1390
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.530
<v Speaker 2>but if anybody knows it's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like Michael Wood.</v>

1391
01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:12.040
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a guy who was a former </v>
<v Speaker 2>cop,</v>

1392
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.080
<v Speaker 2>worked in Baltimore who understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he thinking about drugs as you think </v>

1393
01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:17.080
<v Speaker 2>they're going to need to be legalized?</v>

1394
01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1395
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's in locking up for </v>

1396
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.760
<v Speaker 2>anything that they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody agrees to that.</v>

1397
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's those nonviolent crimes.</v>

1398
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.470
<v Speaker 2>To have these prisons filled up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonviolent crimes is very bizarre,</v>

1399
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.390
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's not violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's embarrassing.</v>

1400
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 2>It's embarrassing to be embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be.</v>

1401
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.930
<v Speaker 2>We fucking run so many people's lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't look good.</v>

1402
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.240
<v Speaker 2>They're going to do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People make too much money.</v>

1403
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with political influence,</v>

1404
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>private prisons just.</v>

1405
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:51.860
<v Speaker 2>And then when that judge got caught in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania for taking young kids and </v>

1406
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:56.361
<v Speaker 2>locking them up in jail for money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was getting some sort of a </v>

1407
01:02:56.361 --> 01:03:00.050
<v Speaker 2>kickback from these detention institutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they would send young juvenile </v>

1408
01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:00.750
<v Speaker 2>detention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1409
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm just to know that there's people out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that are working in justice that </v>

1410
01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:06.490
<v Speaker 2>would be willing to take money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice.</v>

1411
01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm young kids future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1412
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:09.510

<v Speaker 2>that's really,</v>

1413
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:12.210
<v Speaker 2>really scary that these are the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we made justice to.</v>

1414
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.970
<v Speaker 2>That's heinous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1415
01:03:14.971 --> 01:03:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get so scared thinking about my kids.</v>

1416
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1417
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single day you see crazy shit.</v>

1418
01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:25.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see something like,</v>

1419
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black kid killed by a cop.</v>

1420
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Jesus Christ.</v>

1421
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like never ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does make me kind of want to not </v>

1422
01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:37.040
<v Speaker 2>leave my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's awful,</v>

1423
01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's also off of black kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed by black kids,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and of itself.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like the dog was fucking with the bear </v>

1435
01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:17.370
<v Speaker 2>little tiny bear is in comparison to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>full grown dog that's twice the size.</v>

1436

<v Speaker 2>He got the Thai clinch.</v>

1450
01:04:44.641 --> 01:04:46.590
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets the plum around the neck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ragdoll them to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He had just flips a dog on his back and </v>

1453
01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:55.110
<v Speaker 2>they looked at hip toss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hip toss at the end is huge.</v>

1454
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.640
<v Speaker 2>He's got the scarf hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold it on that thing.</v>

1455
01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:01.810
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge because that's.</v>

1456
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>He established his position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did and he gave it up very quickly,</v>

1457
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:08.340
<v Speaker 2>but well because he's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew it was going to get reversed.</v>

1458
01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apparently the doug has jujitsu and he</v>

1459
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:13.860
<v Speaker 2>wanted to stay so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a goon.</v>

1460
01:05:13.861 --> 01:05:15.750
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to keep it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dogs are goon.</v>

1461
01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:17.230
<v Speaker 2>The bear's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually it's going to.</v>

1462
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>He's going to have to cook</v>

1463
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take some time,</v>

1464
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>but trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad I got my dog is a goon.</v>

1465
01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good good.</v>

1466
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:29.060
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goon is when you roll with someone and </v>

1467
01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.891
<v Speaker 1>they're not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just strong and they throw you </v>

1468
01:05:31.891 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>off of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got to ride the boat.</v>

1469
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:37.140
<v Speaker 1>You've got to figure out a way to ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it like most people with big </v>

1470
01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:37.140
<v Speaker 1>muscles though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people who have big muscles.</v>

1471
01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a boxing fan and like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody walks in to the ring and they </v>

1472
01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:43.930
<v Speaker 1>bet a lot of muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pretty much automatically know they're</v>

1473
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two words for you,</v>

1474
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you get when you get big </v>

1475
01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:50.130
<v Speaker 1>muscles and intelligence and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

1476
01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>a deep knowledge of boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You totally both things,</v>

1477
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you don't,</v>

1478
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.810
<v Speaker 1>but when you did like when Mike Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in its prime,</v>

1479
01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:02.410
<v Speaker 1>it was so terrifying because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a guy like that before.</v>

1480
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Him is super fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculously powerful.</v>

1481
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Guy Just came in with perfect technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bobbing and weaving,</v>

1482
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.470
<v Speaker 1>throwing bombs at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooo,</v>

1483
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:15.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his side to side movement was just so </v>

1484
01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.050
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That little bear with fuck him up.</v>

1485
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Grab a hold of his dick from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flip him over on his back.</v>

1486
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seen him with his tigers?</v>

1487
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy.</v>

1488
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Murphy had one of the funniest </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories ever.</v>

1489
01:06:27.761 --> 01:06:32.761
<v Speaker 1>Told them this podcast we told about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pulled up to Mike Tyson's house with </v>

1490
01:06:32.761 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of his friends and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>in limos and nobody wanted to get out of</v>

1491
01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>the car because Mike Tyson was on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front lawn with a fucking lion.</v>

1492
01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 1>He's kept thinking line and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of actual real life.</v>

1493
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wanted to get it out of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where was the tiger?</v>

1494
01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Was it a lion?</v>

1495
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 1>One of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an animated thing.</v>

1496
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a tiger there.</v>

1497
01:06:50.591 --> 01:06:55.591
<v Speaker 1>He had a gang of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How rich do you have to get before you </v>

1498
01:06:55.591 --> 01:06:55.591
<v Speaker 1>start clicking the zoo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals,</v>

1499
01:06:55.591 --> 01:06:57.460
<v Speaker 1>but he was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wealthy living in Vegas,</v>

1500
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the test seems to be the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got lucky.</v>

1501
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:05.740
<v Speaker 1>You get a lot of fighters wind up </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting very dangerous animals.</v>

1502
01:07:05.741 --> 01:07:10.741
<v Speaker 1>I was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big thing with a lot of </v>

1503
01:07:10.741 --> 01:07:10.741
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just wondering what did he do with</v>

1504
01:07:10.741 --> 01:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>these things once he couldn't handle it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and find it.</v>

1505
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of animals?</v>

1506
01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:16.210
<v Speaker 1>A lot of boxers get a pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real common.</v>

1507
01:07:16.211 --> 01:07:20.380
<v Speaker 1>A lot of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxers MMA fighters get bulls.</v>

1508
01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real comment.</v>

1509
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.520
<v Speaker 1>They just want to be around something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's as bad asses them.</v>

1510
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1511
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.930
<v Speaker 1>or makes them feel and insist they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>

1512
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you'll be safe to other people that</v>

1513
01:07:32.201 --> 01:07:35.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to worry about if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pit bull most of the time you're safe.</v>

1514
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:40.740
<v Speaker 1>If it's your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that a pit bull attacks </v>

1515
01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:40.740
<v Speaker 1>it's owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare.</v>

1516
01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:45.470
<v Speaker 1>They pleased they want to please people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not even normal for them to go </v>

1517
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:49.471
<v Speaker 1>after people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually the only times that those dogs </v>

1518
01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:49.471
<v Speaker 1>go after people's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they're abused or totally.</v>

1519
01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I totally believe you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't let my kids know that's </v>

1520
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.730
<v Speaker 1>the children is different because </v>
<v Speaker 1>children are small and they think </v>

1521
01:07:56.730 --> 01:07:56.880
<v Speaker 1>children are like in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I came around.</v>

1522
01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand.</v>

1523
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.210
<v Speaker 1>But you're saying part of everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1524
01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:03.600
<v Speaker 1>so it's like when you get a pit bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically saying I'm,</v>

1525
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:06.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the population can't be around me.</v>

1526
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:08.980
<v Speaker 1>You could say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are,</v>

1527
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is it's not worth the risk </v>

1528
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:16.471
<v Speaker 1>to make the exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some people's dogs that </v>

1529
01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:16.471
<v Speaker 1>are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Guy,</v>

1530
01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:16.471
<v Speaker 1>I used</v>

1531
01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:21.040
<v Speaker 2>to have this pit bull named Lucy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was the sweetest dog ever to </v>

1532
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:21.960
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's killed babies.</v>

1533
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.380
<v Speaker 2>It didn't match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loved everybody,</v>

1534
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:26.030
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people would see her,</v>

1535
01:08:26.031 --> 01:08:27.320
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a pit bull?</v>

1536
01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 2>And they'd freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was the nicest dog ever.</v>

1537
01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.050
<v Speaker 2>But then you'll have other dogs that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not like that at all.</v>

1538
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dangerous.</v>

1539
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're tricky.</v>

1540
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.620
<v Speaker 2>And you never know because they all look</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

1541
01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:41.621
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd have to get the know the dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to know the history of the </v>

1542
01:08:41.621 --> 01:08:43.480
<v Speaker 2>dog and the dog's parent's history and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1543
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I have this dog that's a massive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a smaller massive.</v>

1544
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:52.020
<v Speaker 2>It's called a regency mastermind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the sweetest dog I've ever had in </v>

1545
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:56.411
<v Speaker 2>my life and the reason why is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who raised them like he </v>

1546
01:08:56.411 --> 01:08:56.411
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't.</v>

1547
01:08:56.411 --> 01:08:56.960
<v Speaker 2>He described it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1548
01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the parents and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about not letting parents that exhibit </v>

1549
01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.800
<v Speaker 2>any weird behavior breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1550
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:06.110
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to breed like a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice dog,</v>

1551
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:11.290
<v Speaker 2>he just makes sure that the dogs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>always friendly and only friendly dogs </v>

1552
01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:11.850
<v Speaker 2>breed and if they're not friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't allow them to breathe.</v>

1553
01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1554
01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:17.651
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to completely organized that </v>

1555
01:09:17.651 --> 01:09:17.651
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like genetically,</v>

1556
01:09:17.651 --> 01:09:22.210
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He makes sure that these dogs are never </v>

1557
01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:23.750
<v Speaker 2>any dog that growls at somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any dog that barks for no reason,</v>

1558
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:25.610
<v Speaker 2>they don't breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the ones they put in the other</v>

1559
01:09:25.611 --> 01:09:27.740
<v Speaker 2>barn where they secretly breed and fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1560
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.570
<v Speaker 2>He just fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1561
01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:31.340
<v Speaker 2>they're different dogs or daryl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a large dog.</v>

1562
01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.270
<v Speaker 2>One of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mom bread,</v>

1563
01:09:34.271 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 2>a bull mastiffs oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was always freaked out.</v>

1564
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Every time I went over they would like </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the yard playing with bowling </v>

1565
01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:42.730
<v Speaker 2>balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1566
01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 2>and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting out of the car.</v>

1567
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1568
01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 2>there are some enormous dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were originally made like they make</v>

1569
01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:50.750
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for some sort of guard dog.</v>

1570
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:55.751
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the idea behind them to make </v>

1571
01:09:55.751 --> 01:09:55.751
<v Speaker 2>them as big as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those English mastiffs.</v>

1572
01:09:55.751 --> 01:09:57.470
<v Speaker 2>So 200 pound dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're enormous.</v>

1573
01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1574
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I'll get those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like labs.</v>

1575
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I think labs are my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like the most predictable,</v>

1576
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're predictable.</v>

1577
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Who's got a good month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good month or good man.</v>

1578
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Is there any downside to living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nashville?</v>

1579
01:10:15.241 --> 01:10:20.241
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it all good living down there or is </v>

1580
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:20.241
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1581
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:24.821
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been such an influx of people </v>

1582
01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:24.821
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit congested now.</v>

1583
01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like Austin in that regard.</v>

1584
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's,</v>

1585
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the hotspot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that if you're young and you </v>

1586
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.900
<v Speaker 2>have aspirations and you want to live in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cool place,</v>

1587
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:38.830
<v Speaker 2>it seems to take longer and longer each </v>
<v Speaker 2>year to get across town ski guys keep </v>

1609
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.800
<v Speaker 1>they're pros.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1610
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1611
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.740
<v Speaker 1>They all have their own lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1612
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.800
<v Speaker 1>because they have been ripped off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1613
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 1>they've been referred the past that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to really good musicians.</v>

1614
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And what an amazing relationship you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have though,</v>

1615
01:11:40.801 --> 01:11:44.520
<v Speaker 1>if you had a bunch of heavy duty </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians that went in on a handshake.</v>

1616
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:47.890
<v Speaker 1>We don't talk about money really ahead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

1617
01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:52.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll buy plane tickets and flying to </v>

1618
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:54.921
<v Speaker 1>Nashville and spend a week recording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will never wants to talk about contrast </v>

1619
01:11:54.921 --> 01:11:57.711
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all done at advanced on </v>

1620
01:11:57.711 --> 01:11:57.711
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

1621
01:11:57.711 --> 01:11:57.711
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:11:57.711 --> 01:11:57.711
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we finished the record.</v>

1623
01:11:57.711 --> 01:11:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll work it out now.</v>

1624
01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it should be done.</v>

1625
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:05.121
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until you get screwed and then you're </v>

1626
01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:05.121
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1627
01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I should've done this ahead of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1628
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how it should be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least there's a level of trust </v>

1629
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 1>that you guys do the recording in </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance.</v>

1630
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1631
01:12:13.501 --> 01:12:16.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a high level of trust and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out afterwards.</v>

1632
01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a very high level of trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what if you guys catch </v>

1633
01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>lightening in a bottle when he bitched?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gets greedy?</v>

1634
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone gets those.</v>

1635
01:12:22.551 --> 01:12:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Scrooge mcduck Ching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ching,</v>

1636
01:12:24.061 --> 01:12:26.130

<v Speaker 1>thing you know.</v>

1637
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Have you guys ever had your songs ripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>off before?</v>

1638
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1639
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.360
<v Speaker 1>What does that feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm strange,</v>

1640
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:37.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for,</v>

1641
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.920
<v Speaker 1>for pat and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spent so many years just trying to </v>

1642
01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 1>get noticed to like have people copying </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1643
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It was just so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this,</v>

1644
01:12:46.201 --> 01:12:47.610
<v Speaker 1>we had this one case where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1645
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's happened multiple times </v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

1646
01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:54.740
<v Speaker 1>but we had this one case where a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some casino did an advertisement and the</v>

1647
01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:01.290
<v Speaker 1>owner of the casino posted something on </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit on like twitter or something like,</v>

1648
01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.340
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check it out.</v>

1649
01:13:02.341 --> 01:13:07.341
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just ripped off this black keys song </v>

1650
01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:07.341
<v Speaker 1>for a new ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys like it.</v>

1651
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:13.950
<v Speaker 1>We just used that in the case and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

1652
01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Did they just not know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he knew how the Internet </v>

1653
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1654
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he just thought posting to his </v>

1655
01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1656
01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Was it like a native American casino </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they thought they had different </v>

1657
01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.070
<v Speaker 1>laws?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because they know,</v>

1658
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have different laws when it </v>

1659
01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:36.080
<v Speaker 1>comes to that kind of stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1660
01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was like the whole thing.</v>

1661
01:13:38.421 --> 01:13:43.421
<v Speaker 1>It's like the native American casinos </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were allowed to have because he </v>

1662
01:13:43.421 --> 01:13:43.421
<v Speaker 1>knows some places that you can never </v>
<v Speaker 1>have casinos.</v>

1663
01:13:43.421 --> 01:13:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they had their own rules.</v>

1664
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:48.750
<v Speaker 1>That's where a lot of other early mma </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights were done because it was illegal.</v>

1665
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.680
<v Speaker 1>It was illegal to have mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was illegal have mma competitions,</v>

1666
01:13:52.681 --> 01:13:55.200
<v Speaker 1>but it was legal to have them at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>native American places.</v>

1667
01:13:55.201 --> 01:13:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So they must have different malls in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways.</v>

1668
01:13:58.201 --> 01:13:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.660
<v Speaker 1>That's how they have casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1670
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys do and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just touring across the country with </v>

1671
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.310
<v Speaker 1>this new music?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:09.480
<v Speaker 1>They were just on tour playing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows when you hear for Coachella.</v>

1673
01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that experience like?</v>

1674
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1675
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.980
<v Speaker 3>it's like most kind of festivals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's it,</v>

1676
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 3>it can be fun if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're into that type of thing.</v>

1677
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:22.870
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1678
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it's got to be good for </v>

1679
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 3>like the young up and coming guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gals to be included in these lineups and</v>

1680
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:34.060
<v Speaker 3>people to be able to experience maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>some bands.</v>

1681
01:14:34.061 --> 01:14:34.810
<v Speaker 3>I know for honey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>

1682
01:14:34.811 --> 01:14:39.811
<v Speaker 3>it was a big deal to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience some bands that maybe you </v>

1683
01:14:39.811 --> 01:14:40.120
<v Speaker 3>weren't aware of before and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1684
01:14:40.121 --> 01:14:40.950
<v Speaker 3>let me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 3>For me it's kind of weird like watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>music in the sun.</v>

1686
01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:47.770
<v Speaker 3>It just feels weird to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

1687
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.760
<v Speaker 3>And you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get sound check,</v>

1688
01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you.</v>

1689
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 3>So you kind of go up there blind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then all you know,</v>

1690
01:14:53.981 --> 01:14:56.800
<v Speaker 3>and then you have a very short set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Normally most bands played,</v>

1691
01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a band is playing like the more theaters</v>

1692
01:14:59.681 --> 01:15:00.850
<v Speaker 3>on this plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our half,</v>

1693
01:15:00.851 --> 01:15:03.160
<v Speaker 3>at least when you played a festival,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have 45 minutes.</v>

1694
01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:03.860
<v Speaker 3>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1695
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.100
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1696
01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:11.101
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of effort to not be at your </v>

1697
01:15:11.101 --> 01:15:12.230
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1698
01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of,</v>

1699
01:15:14.091 --> 01:15:15.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1700
01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:20.980
<v Speaker 3>that can be a little difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you play a great festival and </v>

1701
01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:21.530
<v Speaker 3>you get a great crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can change your mind.</v>

1702
01:15:21.531 --> 01:15:25.040
<v Speaker 3>I guess we just played last week and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was awesome.</v>

1703
01:15:25.041 --> 01:15:27.050
<v Speaker 3>We had a really nice crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

1704
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:28.910
<v Speaker 3>What is it like being there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1705
01:15:28.911 --> 01:15:30.650
<v Speaker 3>how many people go to that God damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1706
01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.450
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be enormous now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1707
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:34.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1708
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:34.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1709
01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's become this whole big thing out </v>

1710
01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 3>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do two weekends now.</v>

1711
01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one.</v>

1712
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:46.110
<v Speaker 3>And then the weekend after that they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially the same thing.</v>

1713
01:15:46.111 --> 01:15:47.880
<v Speaker 3>But with country music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's it called?</v>

1714
01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Stagecoach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stagecoach,</v>

1715
01:15:49.321 --> 01:15:50.290
<v Speaker 3>festival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ge.</v>

1716
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:52.020
<v Speaker 3>So it was like three week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole town,</v>

1717
01:15:52.021 --> 01:15:56.340
<v Speaker 3>like is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is for three weeks at least,</v>

1718
01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.350
<v Speaker 3>is just completely inundated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1719
01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:01.350
<v Speaker 3>How strange and how do they choose that </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot?</v>

1720
01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1721
01:16:02.821 --> 01:16:06.900
<v Speaker 3>They do it on the polo grounds there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they use those polo grounds when it's</v>

1722
01:16:06.901 --> 01:16:08.450
<v Speaker 3>not in season?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1723
01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1724
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.270
<v Speaker 3>They just decided to put it on down </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1725
01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.700
<v Speaker 3>but it's become this gigantic thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has to go.</v>

1726
01:16:14.701 --> 01:16:19.701
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys who do those festivals </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be the same ones who do festivals </v>

1727
01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:19.701
<v Speaker 3>all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1728
01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:19.860
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

1729
01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:25.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those Lollapalooza guys to </v>

1730
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.370
<v Speaker 3>different festivals.</v>

1731
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:26.880
<v Speaker 3>They've started different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the benefit of doing those things is</v>

1732
01:16:26.881 --> 01:16:29.100
<v Speaker 3>really essentially just first exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1733
01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's money in it,</v>

1734
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.220
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like you guys doing on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>

1735
01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:34.530
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Money is good.</v>

1736
01:16:34.531 --> 01:16:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better money than,</v>

1737
01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:36.900
<v Speaker 3>than playing shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get more money.</v>

1738
01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1740
01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.360
<v Speaker 3>It's good money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's nice to route a tour around </v>

1741
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:44.360
<v Speaker 3>festivals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

1742
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1743
01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.800
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1744
01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Because comedians always think of it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>like south by southwest has,</v>

1745
01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.270
<v Speaker 3>is when you think about festivals </v>
<v Speaker 3>festival and what is that?</v>

1746
01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:58.300
<v Speaker 3>That's a more an industry thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1747
01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.030
<v Speaker 3>it's everybody's kind of playing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>

1748
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is ours?</v>

1749
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.820
<v Speaker 3>That's really weird when you're starting</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1750
01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a place to be seen.</v>

1751
01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more for up and comers I think,</v>

1752
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.560
<v Speaker 3>or when you have a brand new record </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out,</v>

1753
01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Speaker 3>you can go down there and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the media is going to be there.</v>

1754
01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Is Coachella the big festival?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

1755
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:20.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coachella is one of the biggest.</v>

1756
01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Lollapalooza is the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1757
01:17:22.431 --> 01:17:23.070
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>

1758
01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.400
<v Speaker 3>There are a few that are our mainstays </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1759
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Coachella is definitely one of them.</v>

1760
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that in the age of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet that you are getting better </v>

1761
01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.921
<v Speaker 2>crowds in different places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're getting people that </v>

1762
01:17:35.921 --> 01:17:37.960
<v Speaker 2>understand what you're doing and are big</v>
<v Speaker 2>fans and they're.</v>

1763
01:17:37.961 --> 01:17:41.510
<v Speaker 2>They're all over the place now instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like in an urban pockets.</v>

1764
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't go outside of urban pockets </v>

1765
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.070
<v Speaker 3>really be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1766
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean we stay in major cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>

1767
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:53.351
<v Speaker 3>We don't often hit the small towns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1768
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:57.830
<v Speaker 3>because we can hit major markets in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

1769
01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.050
<v Speaker 3>western Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North America.</v>

1770
01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:05.051
<v Speaker 3>We can do it in South America and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>like by the time we finished that you </v>

1771
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:09.960
<v Speaker 3>can kind of do those again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

1772
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:13.760
<v Speaker 3>You really have to want to go there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a lot less money.</v>

1773
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes Sense.</v>

1774
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Why would you think that maybe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

1776
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:25.750
<v Speaker 2>especially for fucking around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating new stuff sometimes getting a </v>

1777
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:26.140
<v Speaker 2>new look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1778
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:28.880
<v Speaker 2>and then being in a new place and </v>
<v Speaker 2>performing for a new counterpart,</v>

1779
01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.590
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a new feel for what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1780
01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think if,</v>

1781
01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:37.980
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're that kind of band that does a </v>

1782
01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.070
<v Speaker 3>lot of improvising and fly by the seat </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your pants,</v>

1783
01:18:39.071 --> 01:18:41.200
<v Speaker 3>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be creating in the studio.</v>

1784
01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you enjoy travel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you enjoy like international gigs?</v>

1785
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less and less.</v>

1786
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Less and less.</v>

1787
01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.240
<v Speaker 3>The more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more productive I am at home,</v>

1788
01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:55.160
<v Speaker 3>the less I want to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1789
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.710
<v Speaker 3>And I love being around my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been a lot of fun.</v>

1790
01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:02.240
<v Speaker 3>So it's definitely become less and less </v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing I want to do.</v>

1791
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1792
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:07.630
<v Speaker 2>you're your dedication and the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>described wanting to do music,</v>

1793
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.750
<v Speaker 2>it's very infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love hearing shit like this because it</v>

1794
01:19:10.751 --> 01:19:12.550
<v Speaker 2>really does make me want to go do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1795
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:17.910
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that effect is one of the </v>

1796
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:21.481
<v Speaker 2>reasons why people really enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations with people like you </v>

1797
01:19:21.481 --> 01:19:23.770
<v Speaker 2>because when we're remodeling done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done this really.</v>

1798
01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:25.240
<v Speaker 3>I've never really done an interview like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1799
01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:26.500
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

1800
01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.710
<v Speaker 3>He's so comfortable though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

1801
01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.870
<v Speaker 3>So comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1802
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I guess just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel comfortable around you.</v>

1803
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.020
<v Speaker 2>You definitely say I feel like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to keep me safe.</v>

1804
01:19:37.021 --> 01:19:39.780
<v Speaker 2>I 100 percent of my stock here with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>map things.</v>

1805
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Barges didn't the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's fine.</v>

1806
01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:47.580
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like when a person hears </v>

1807
01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.870
<v Speaker 2>someone like you that is just in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what they do and produces amazing </v>

1808
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.020
<v Speaker 2>stuff and just has a passionate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1809
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:56.020
<v Speaker 2>it makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a bubbly thing.</v>

1810
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:57.940
<v Speaker 2>It starts boiling inside it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to,</v>

1811
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:59.410
<v Speaker 2>you want to get going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to get moving,</v>

1812
01:19:59.411 --> 01:20:02.170
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the fuel of inspiration.</v>

1813
01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.330
<v Speaker 2>It's so important for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1814
01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I think for all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1815
01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:11.520
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody who was in the certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>artists growing up knows that music </v>

1816
01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:17.780
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably one of the most </v>

1817
01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:17.780
<v Speaker 2>inspirational things as far as like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way it hits you,</v>

1818
01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:19.740
<v Speaker 2>the way emotionally way it hits you.</v>

1819
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as art forms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can listen to a three minute song </v>

1820
01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:28.160
<v Speaker 2>and it can hit you in a way that three </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes in a movie has no hope of like </v>

1821
01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.781
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like from start to go to three first </v>

1822
01:20:31.781 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 2>minutes of a movie never hit you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>some songs do.</v>

1823
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:37.760
<v Speaker 2>They just tell a story and this intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving way with music and sound and,</v>

1824
01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:43.890
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soul behind the way a person sings </v>

1825
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:46.230
<v Speaker 2>the words and that to hear from a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

1826
01:20:46.231 --> 01:20:51.231
<v Speaker 2>that that process is so intoxicating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you love it so much and that you still </v>

1827
01:20:51.231 --> 01:20:55.820
<v Speaker 2>after all these years do it and love it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and can't wait to get back in there and </v>

1828
01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.151
<v Speaker 2>you want to be productive and that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>work all the time and that you work at </v>

1829
01:20:59.151 --> 01:20:59.151
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even consider it.</v>

1830
01:20:59.151 --> 01:21:00.520
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what everybody wants to hear,</v>

1831
01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.560
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that when you hear a guy like </v>

1832
01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:05.590
<v Speaker 2>you talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you this,</v>

1833
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:10.610
<v Speaker 2>this podcast to be heard by over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million people and out of those million </v>

1834
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:11.550
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of them are going to start new</v>

1835
01:21:11.551 --> 01:21:15.090
<v Speaker 2>projects and get inspired to do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>just by hearing you do this.</v>

1836
01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to fuck him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that sounds like bliss.</v>

1839
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:27.350
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like career bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who loves what they do and for </v>

1840
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.350
<v Speaker 2>two years</v>

1841
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.220
<v Speaker 3>the business side is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of bullshit.</v>

1842
01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:30.990
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most people don't make it.</v>

1843
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:35.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started over 10 years ago and we used</v>

1844
01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:37.290
<v Speaker 3>to tour with a bunch of bands that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even exist anymore.</v>

1845
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:38.640
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

1846
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 3>we know that we're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1847
01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:45.981
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always felt something more from </v>

1848
01:21:47.061 --> 01:21:48.000
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1849
01:21:48.001 --> 01:21:53.001
<v Speaker 3>it's always meant more to me than it did</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all my friends just because I don't </v>

1850
01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:53.430
<v Speaker 3>know why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1851
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:56.250
<v Speaker 3>it's like part of my family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even still,</v>

1852
01:21:57.230 --> 01:21:58.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad had a great record collection but</v>

1853
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I am pretty quickly like surpassed his </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and just delve deeper,</v>

1854
01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:08.090
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I always felt really in tune with </v>

1855
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.090
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1856
01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I can remember being like 14 and hearing</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam Cooke and the soul stirrers and like</v>

1857
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.270
<v Speaker 3>it making me cry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1858
01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:18.660
<v Speaker 3>It was able to reach some place inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>me that,</v>

1859
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:21.660
<v Speaker 3>that nothing else ever was able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1860
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that everybody gets that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing right.</v>

1861
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:30.390
<v Speaker 3>But I definitely have that and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really controlled the way that I've</v>

1862
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.860
<v Speaker 3>made all the decisions for my life.</v>

1863
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to think as a young man in such</v>

1864
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:39.491
<v Speaker 2>a music rich environment that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>described your childhood growing up like</v>

1865
01:22:39.711 --> 01:22:44.711
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that had to have sparked and </v>

1866
01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:46.811
<v Speaker 2>fueled some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some areas of your creativity that just </v>

1867
01:22:46.811 --> 01:22:49.250
<v Speaker 2>led you to embrace it the way you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1868
01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:50.180
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1869
01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:53.600
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a really fortunate </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation that you grew up in.</v>

1870
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1871
01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:59.540
<v Speaker 2>With that story of you guys around your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother's grave singing that song,</v>

1872
01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:02.120
<v Speaker 2>that's an amazing story matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1873
01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I kind of wish I had that in my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1874
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1875
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.940
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know it,</v>

1876
01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1877
01:23:08.861 --> 01:23:12.880
<v Speaker 1>and not only were my uncle's a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians,</v>

1878
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.460
<v Speaker 1>but they think great tastes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael.</v>

1879
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Jim taught me how to sing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still got one of the best voices </v>

1880
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1881
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1882
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a blues music,</v>

1883
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:29.281
<v Speaker 1>but I was a real snob about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked certain things and I really </v>

1884
01:23:29.281 --> 01:23:29.281
<v Speaker 1>didn't like other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1885
01:23:29.650 --> 01:23:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And I had my uncle Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just had an amazing blues albums and </v>

1886
01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:37.150
<v Speaker 1>he hit me to the cool shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean early on.</v>

1887
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And I knew the difference between like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda corny barb blue shit and like the </v>

1888
01:23:42.941 --> 01:23:43.960
<v Speaker 1>deep stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1889
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.750
<v Speaker 1>And so I really had a headstart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1890
01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.180
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that it was assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I just got it,</v>

1891
01:23:49.181 --> 01:23:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1892
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I had great teachers and I was around </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1893
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:53.590
<v Speaker 1>some cool stuff growing up.</v>

1894
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it seems like,</v>

1895
01:23:55.690 --> 01:24:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that have it being around a </v>

1896
01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:01.210
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not just have great taste,</v>

1897
01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:06.000
<v Speaker 1>but also express themselves like freely </v>
<v Speaker 1>and openly like that they can sing at a,</v>

1898
01:24:06.001 --> 01:24:07.300
<v Speaker 1>at a funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1899
01:24:07.301 --> 01:24:10.780
<v Speaker 1>that's not a lot of families where there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so musical that they'll,</v>

1900
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:15.810
<v Speaker 1>they'll sit around and sing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother's favorite song when she </v>

1901
01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:15.810
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1902
01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:16.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

1903
01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.340
<v Speaker 1>it became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1904
01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:17.910
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1905
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:21.610
<v Speaker 1>it ceased to be music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it was just who I was.</v>

1906
01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was my life as a human is music.</v>

1907
01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like eating music,</v>

1908
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:31.090
<v Speaker 1>showering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like a part of thing.</v>

1909
01:24:31.091 --> 01:24:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1910
01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:35.560
<v Speaker 1>And without thinking about it and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what you did,</v>

1911
01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:37.060
<v Speaker 1>even if you didn't pursue it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

1912
01:24:37.061 --> 01:24:39.880
<v Speaker 1>you would still be involved in theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can.</v>

1913
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1914
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know,</v>

1915
01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I felt totally out of place,</v>

1916
01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:51.490
<v Speaker 1>like working in a kitchen and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>working anywhere else.</v>

1917
01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that a boxing glove or on your neck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1919
01:24:56.390 --> 01:25:01.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to give these out to golden </v>

1920

<v Speaker 1>glove winters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local regional golden glove.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I found it in a junk shop.</v>

1923
01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:10.970
<v Speaker 1>It does look cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like how you're rocking it underneath </v>

1924
01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the collar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old School style.</v>

1925
01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like an Italian horn I suppose where I </v>

1926
01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:20.720
<v Speaker 1>can remember Italian horns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1927
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:24.580
<v Speaker 1>People used to wear those stupid little </v>
<v Speaker 1>gold horns like a horn,</v>

1928
01:25:24.581 --> 01:25:25.840
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bull horn.</v>

1929
01:25:25.841 --> 01:25:26.660
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1930
01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:29.110
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

1931
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 1>It's this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would call them Italian horns.</v>

1932
01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:33.790
<v Speaker 1>There were a big east coast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was born in New Jersey and I grew up </v>

1935
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.310
<v Speaker 1>in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of looks like sperm.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Stupid charm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does the greatest farm.</v>

1937
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>That's probably what it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gold sperm.</v>

1938
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:47.080
<v Speaker 1>There you fuck with the bull?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the horns.</v>

1939
01:25:47.081 --> 01:25:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it was a horn.</v>

1940
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what it meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was explaining you have sperm</v>

1941

<v Speaker 1>He has been boxing since he was 14.</v>

1951
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 1>He got me into it three or four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

1952
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I have some friends who still spar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1953
01:26:24.981 --> 01:26:26.690
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be careful.</v>

1954
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1955
01:26:27.801 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Even though you had those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big helmets on it,</v>

1956
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:32.030
<v Speaker 1>shit hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those helmets don't really help.</v>

1957
01:26:32.031 --> 01:26:33.560
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1958
01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the brain smushing around</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the head and those helmets.</v>

1959
01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's hitting me like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1960
01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a little jolt.</v>

1961
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Even jolts like that real bad for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain sloshing around inside the head.</v>

1962
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1963
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that jet skiing can give you </v>

1964
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.870
<v Speaker 1>brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jet Skiing,</v>

1965
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:54.950
<v Speaker 1>jet skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being on a jet ski.</v>

1966
01:26:54.951 --> 01:26:57.430
<v Speaker 1>He said the bounce of a jet ski,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bullshit.</v>

1967
01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Gives people concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1968
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1969
01:27:00.351 --> 01:27:03.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't realize what a concussion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're concussed.</v>

1970
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Like the impact doesn't have to hit you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the head.</v>

1971
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:09.110
<v Speaker 1>You get a lot of concussions have from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people getting hit in the chest and then</v>

1972
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.780
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden there'll be depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their mood swings be.</v>

1973
01:27:11.781 --> 01:27:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Their cortisol levels are all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll find out that there's from the,</v>

1974
01:27:15.490 --> 01:27:18.260
<v Speaker 1>from the sort of like whiplash from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement of the impact.</v>

1975
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always heard that.</v>

1976
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I am and I know it's true in</v>

1977
01:27:22.311 --> 01:27:23.870
<v Speaker 1>boxing gloves.</v>

1978
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I know they cause more brain damage than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small gloves.</v>

1979
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I know MMA is technically safer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing is in the longterm.</v>

1980
01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>

1981
01:27:31.281 --> 01:27:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I'd actually be safer if they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No gloves.</v>

1982
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1983
01:27:35.031 --> 01:27:36.350
<v Speaker 1>No gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no risk tape.</v>

1984
01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.060
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1985
01:27:37.061 --> 01:27:42.061
<v Speaker 1>your wrist would band easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be harder to hit people hard and </v>

1986
01:27:42.061 --> 01:27:42.590
<v Speaker 1>also your hands would break because he'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pick your shots better.</v>

1987
01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Safety,</v>

1988
01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.460
<v Speaker 1>safety first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Safety first.</v>

1989
01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Even in extreme sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing,</v>

1990
01:27:50.241 --> 01:27:55.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how safe can you make it while </v>

1991
01:27:55.241 --> 01:27:55.241
<v Speaker 1>still have it be so exciting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1992
01:27:55.241 --> 01:27:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I want to go there and watch them </v>

1999

<v Speaker 1>tight.</v>

2006
01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could barely hit the thing.</v>

2007
01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I felt so stupid because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

2008
01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm at a place where I feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go to wildcard and maybe work out </v>

2009
01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.390
<v Speaker 1>and not feel like a total shit had and I</v>

2011
01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a couple of wildcard t shirts.</v>

2012
01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:41.390
<v Speaker 1>You never see me again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watching manny hit the pads.</v>

2013
01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:44.480
<v Speaker 1>A man who was hitting the pads wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

2014
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Was it with Freddie Roach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been with Freddy.</v>

2015
01:28:46.650 --> 01:28:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was with Freddy,</v>

2016
01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Freddy and another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2017
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:52.920
<v Speaker 1>and he goes through all this warm up </v>
<v Speaker 1>routines and goes through all this stuff</v>

2018
01:28:52.921 --> 01:28:57.921
<v Speaker 1>and then he starts hitting the pads </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda slow and loosens up and then </v>

2019
01:28:57.921 --> 01:28:59.300
<v Speaker 1>eventually he starts firing off these </v>
<v Speaker 1>combinations.</v>

2020
01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.120
<v Speaker 5>My mom</v>

2021
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:07.430
<v Speaker 1>and he's just firing off these ungodly </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick combinations and you just realize </v>

2022
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:08.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2023
01:29:08.371 --> 01:29:10.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference in certain people.</v>

2024
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference.</v>

2025
01:29:12.370 --> 01:29:13.580
<v Speaker 1>See Calves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2027
01:29:14.161 --> 01:29:16.290
<v Speaker 1>You said what the hell is going on over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

2028
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where his power comes from.</v>

2029
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Perez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all from his legs.</v>

2030
01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:24.050
<v Speaker 1>The pushing off of the legs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivering these lightening fast </v>

2031
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.050
<v Speaker 1>combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2032
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Did you see his last fight was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute bust?</v>

2033
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:27.390
<v Speaker 1>They lost money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2034
01:29:27.391 --> 01:29:32.391
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to see him fight if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not floyd mayweather and people were </v>

2035
01:29:32.391 --> 01:29:32.391
<v Speaker 1>really disappointed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2036
01:29:32.391 --> 01:29:33.240
<v Speaker 1>that's not totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2037
01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.150
<v Speaker 1>he just fought Tim Bradley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've this just like third fight.</v>

2038
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:39.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody really cared to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bradley's a fun guy.</v>

2039
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Tim Bradley's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this third fight.</v>

2040
01:29:41.581 --> 01:29:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>

2041
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.430
<v Speaker 1>But it was interesting to have great </v>
<v Speaker 1>welterweights out there.</v>

2042
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence Crawford the best.</v>

2043
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>

2044
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see that.</v>

2045
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:50.330
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2046
01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:53.520
<v Speaker 1>he's just inked a deal with the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victor postle.</v>

2047
01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a great fight too.</v>

2048
01:29:55.810 --> 01:29:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I think a terrence was going to win it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a.</v>

2049
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:02.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good fight and I'd love </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see the terrence Crawford isn't </v>

2050
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:05.481
<v Speaker 1>scared to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight anybody that even the best </v>

2051
01:30:05.481 --> 01:30:05.820
<v Speaker 1>terrence is something special and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he,</v>

2052
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:10.080
<v Speaker 1>he fights from the Orthodox stance but </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as good if not better for the south</v>

2053
01:30:10.081 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 1>southpaw and they'll switch up on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll like,</v>

2054
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I hate when I see guys do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2055
01:30:14.731 --> 01:30:15.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking guy.</v>

2056
01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:18.840
<v Speaker 1>But he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he's feeling you out as</v>

2057
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:21.000
<v Speaker 1>an Orthodox and then when he knows he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can fuck you up,</v>

2058
01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:22.770
<v Speaker 1>he switches over and start to lighten </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up.</v>

2059
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.390
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] he's something special.</v>

2060
01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.000
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome and I love to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is his brain work to cause?</v>

2061
01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.330
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

2062
01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.300
<v Speaker 1>He won't just go out for the knockout or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2063
01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:31.380
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays with.</v>

2064
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:33.480
<v Speaker 1>He plays with it for a few rounds while </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

2065
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Gently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2066
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:39.800
<v Speaker 1>He always plays with the person for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few rounds and then starts destroying </v>

2067
01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:39.800
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2068
01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I think he values and appreciates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skill and art of boxing,</v>

2069
01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:49.071
<v Speaker 1>the actual art of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no way he can be as good </v>

2070
01:30:49.071 --> 01:30:49.071
<v Speaker 1>as he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get to that level,</v>

2071
01:30:49.071 --> 01:30:52.251
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to reach that point where you </v>

2072
01:30:52.251 --> 01:30:52.260
<v Speaker 1>understand that it's a total art to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2073
01:30:52.261 --> 01:30:57.261
<v Speaker 1>So what he's doing is he's setting traps</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slowly dragging guys into his game </v>

2074
01:30:57.261 --> 01:30:57.820
<v Speaker 1>and then fucking them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2075
01:30:57.830 --> 01:31:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And for a guy who really appreciates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2076
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:03.150
<v Speaker 1>the skill and the subtleties of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what he's doing,</v>

2077
01:31:03.151 --> 01:31:03.750
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2078
01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching that guy said traps </v>

2079
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>chocolates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

2080
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:12.171
<v Speaker 1>Awesome too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's just watching his side to </v>

2081
01:31:12.171 --> 01:31:12.171
<v Speaker 1>side movement while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2082
01:31:12.171 --> 01:31:15.000
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like second nature for him.</v>

2083
01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More more so than anybody.</v>

2084
01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:22.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] he's just a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know the fluidity of those combinations </v>

2085
01:31:22.321 --> 01:31:27.321
<v Speaker 1>would step off to the left and crank off</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Lopez in that way where it's just </v>

2086
01:31:27.931 --> 01:31:32.580
<v Speaker 1>like perfect form and the movement is </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

2087
01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:34.410
<v Speaker 1>This is a good time for boxing right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2088
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Gennady Golovkin and another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what happens with Canelo </v>

2089
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez and I'm gon Ca Amir Khan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is coming up.</v>

2090
01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I worry about con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2091
01:31:43.891 --> 01:31:48.891
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about muscles and con </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps saying I feel stronger and he </v>

2092
01:31:48.891 --> 01:31:48.891
<v Speaker 1>looks huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks ripped.</v>

2093
01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I worry that he just will have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>stamina in the fight.</v>

2094
01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

2095
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:54.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the first time,</v>

2096
01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:57.770
<v Speaker 1>what are they finding at one 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:54</v>

2097
01:31:57.771 --> 01:31:58.170
<v Speaker 1>member.</v>

2098
01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.290
<v Speaker 1>So when mayweather and him fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fought at 1:50.</v>

2099
01:32:02.291 --> 01:32:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Was it a catch weight fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2100
01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:06.520
<v Speaker 1>You want me whether I wanted them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little small,</v>

2102
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:11.580
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe with they get you ever drank them </v>

2103
01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 1>down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get that big bruiser down,</v>

2104
01:32:12.190 --> 01:32:16.540
<v Speaker 1>but a Gennady Golovkin is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting guy because a lot of</v>

2105
01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:20.320
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his paper view got 150,000</v>

2106
01:32:20.321 --> 01:32:21.610
<v Speaker 1>buys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge bust.</v>

2107
01:32:21.611 --> 01:32:26.611
<v Speaker 1>It's a disaster for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for boxing fans like you or me or </v>

2108
01:32:26.611 --> 01:32:27.250
<v Speaker 1>like best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy to walk.</v>

2109
01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Can't wait to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still haven't seen him tested though.</v>

2110
01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so either.</v>

2111
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:33.850
<v Speaker 1>But he's going to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2112
01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:36.620
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to see him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wade.</v>

2113
01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Canelo for sure,</v>

2114
01:32:40.770 --> 01:32:42.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is he?</v>

2115
01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2116
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:45.190
<v Speaker 1>It's Wade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wade is the guy's name.</v>

2117
01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:47.230
<v Speaker 1>The mandatory challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always fighting weight right now.</v>

2118
01:32:47.231 --> 01:32:48.940
<v Speaker 1>But Andre Ward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2119
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:51.910
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go up and fight Cova love </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2120
01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:55.150
<v Speaker 1>You know that Andrea was now fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>75.</v>

2121
01:32:55.151 --> 01:32:57.220
<v Speaker 1>He had his first light heavyweight fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 75.</v>

2122
01:32:57.250 --> 01:32:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Look Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he's going to fight Koval.</v>

2123
01:32:59.171 --> 01:33:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Koval lives a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2124
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:02.070
<v Speaker 1>he's another terrifying guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2125
01:33:02.690 --> 01:33:04.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Hopkins,</v>

2126
01:33:04.601 --> 01:33:05.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2127
01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.860
<v Speaker 1>as old as he is and kind of as slowly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is with respect.</v>

2128
01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 1>He popped a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

2129
01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the Bernard Hopkins have 10 years</v>

2130
01:33:13.691 --> 01:33:14.920
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been completely different.</v>

2131
01:33:14.921 --> 01:33:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2132
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:16.760
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think if,</v>

2133
01:33:16.761 --> 01:33:18.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again it's,</v>

2134
01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:23.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing about boxing is </v>

2135
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.450
<v Speaker 1>like with the thing that's so great </v>
<v Speaker 1>about mma is they pick the best against </v>

2136
01:33:25.450 --> 01:33:27.400
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in boxing there's so much bullshit.</v>

2137
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:29.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to see these dumb fucking fights</v>

2138
01:33:29.921 --> 01:33:31.900
<v Speaker 1>with guys fighting people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2139
01:33:31.901 --> 01:33:33.940
<v Speaker 1>they can just be so easily.</v>

2140
01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Definitely too many different world </v>
<v Speaker 1>titles.</v>

2141
01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you have three different guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>called themselves the world champion and</v>

2142
01:33:38.101 --> 01:33:39.850
<v Speaker 1>they're in the same weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2143
01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:41.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that.</v>

2144
01:33:41.801 --> 01:33:42.940
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2145
01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:47.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding what a world champion is and </v>

2146
01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:50.140
<v Speaker 1>who owns the right to say world champion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their guy is or this guy is and not</v>

2147
01:33:50.141 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 1>have them fight against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rival promotions.</v>

2148
01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:57.930
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to get together and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>deals that don't wanna lose our </v>

2149
01:33:57.930 --> 01:33:57.930
<v Speaker 1>superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if,</v>

2150
01:33:57.930 --> 01:34:02.610
<v Speaker 1>what if the USC had a company that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as big as USC because that's kind </v>

2151
01:34:02.610 --> 01:34:03.340
<v Speaker 1>of essentially what happens in boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2152
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't talk about it and use it </v>

2153
01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 1>because there's no one else really can </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete,</v>

2154
01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do mma,</v>

2155
01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:08.770
<v Speaker 1>you do them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys see,</v>

2156
01:34:08.771 --> 01:34:09.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2157
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bell Torch is not quite as big,</v>

2158
01:34:11.321 --> 01:34:14.710
<v Speaker 1>but like with boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are just all these promoters,</v>

2159
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:19.960
<v Speaker 1>top ranking and Aram and that they never</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossed promote.</v>

2160
01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:20.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2161
01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:25.960
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really does a disservice to the </v>

2162
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:25.960
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2163
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly can because they know that </v>

2164
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:30.331
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a guy who can make a lot of </v>

2165
01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:32.191
<v Speaker 1>money and if that guy loses to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're fucked and they lose their </v>

2166
01:34:32.191 --> 01:34:35.341
<v Speaker 1>big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other thing I kind of </v>

2167
01:34:35.341 --> 01:34:35.341
<v Speaker 1>hate about boxing is that if you lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>one fight,</v>

2168
01:34:35.341 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 1>somehow you're tainted beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2169
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't quite understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an old school way of thinking </v>

2171
01:34:45.570 --> 01:34:45.610
<v Speaker 1>because they used to build a fighter up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get them 49 and oh,</v>

2172
01:34:45.611 --> 01:34:46.820
<v Speaker 1>and then they would fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2173
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be a big thing.</v>

2174
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:51.880
<v Speaker 1>He's undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going for the title.</v>

2175
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:56.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a guy had 10 losses and he was gone </v>

2176
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.910
<v Speaker 1>for the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody will like,</v>

2177
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:59.450
<v Speaker 1>why am I even watching this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so cool to see con fight</v>

2178
01:34:59.451 --> 01:35:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Canelo and to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2179
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:06.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see who did we just say Miguel cotto </v>

2180
01:35:06.850 --> 01:35:07.630
<v Speaker 1>who's another post dol laws?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zoning.</v>

2181
01:35:07.650 --> 01:35:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Postal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2182
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Gennady Golovkin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No postal.</v>

2183
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Terrence Crawford is calling me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so great when you actually see a </v>

2184
01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:15.880
<v Speaker 1>real fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2185
01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is awesome.</v>

2186
01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2187
01:35:16.341 --> 01:35:21.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just too much talent right now </v>

2188
01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:21.341
<v Speaker 1>in a few divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

2189
01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:25.211
<v Speaker 1>there's some unavoidable like chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>matchups and I think Canelo and Amir </v>

2190
01:35:25.211 --> 01:35:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Khan for as long as it lasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be very interesting.</v>

2191
01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Canal is just such a bruiser man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a scary puncher,</v>

2192
01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:36.580
<v Speaker 1>but he's slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little slow and pretty fast when </v>

2193
01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:38.810
<v Speaker 1>you see him against mayweather.</v>

2194
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:43.280
<v Speaker 1>When he fought mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't even catch him.</v>

2195
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2196
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:49.570
<v Speaker 1>But maybe whether it's a mother fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's such a good box on is is you could </v>

2197
01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:53.471
<v Speaker 1>argue is as fast maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he won't be losing as much weight </v>

2198
01:35:53.471 --> 01:35:55.070
<v Speaker 1>so maybe he'll be better and maybe we'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better because he fought that fight,</v>

2199
01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:00.400
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a fighter doesn't stay at the </v>

2200
01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.871
<v Speaker 1>same level of skill year after year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideally if they keep training and keep </v>

2201
01:36:01.871 --> 01:36:05.801
<v Speaker 1>learning and he's completely dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be getting better and </v>

2202
01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:07.490
<v Speaker 1>better all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confident as champion.</v>

2203
01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:12.570
<v Speaker 1>You mean that one lost to mayweather?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably learned more about </v>

2204
01:36:12.570 --> 01:36:16.451
<v Speaker 1>what can happen to him in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all those fights were beat guys </v>

2205
01:36:16.451 --> 01:36:17.150
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2207
01:36:17.591 --> 01:36:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine the pressure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canelo's under.</v>

2208
01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Canelo and Gennady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golovkin.</v>

2209
01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:24.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the fight that I want to say.</v>

2210
01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what happens.</v>

2211
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:29.630
<v Speaker 1>That's this two guys that don't like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take backward steps.</v>

2212
01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Both have ruthless power and great </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chen's.</v>

2213
01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a better boxer.</v>

2214
01:36:33.891 --> 01:36:36.260
<v Speaker 1>He's so technical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so technical.</v>

2215
01:36:36.261 --> 01:36:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I love watching him train to video him </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

2216
01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:42.650
<v Speaker 1>just like just working the head movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the clinch for like an hour,</v>

2217
01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like.</v>

2218
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:48.680
<v Speaker 1>And then he's like teaching some kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>also stopped to teach somebody.</v>

2219
01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like he loves the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell.</v>

2220
01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly does,</v>

2221
01:36:52.191 --> 01:36:54.710
<v Speaker 1>but I think Canelo does too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Canelo is,</v>

2222
01:36:54.711 --> 01:36:59.711
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a little slower and he's just such a </v>

2223
01:36:59.711 --> 01:37:01.961
<v Speaker 1>bruiser that he's got that sort of style</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them that he just loads up and bangs </v>

2224
01:37:01.961 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 1>it guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's getting better too.</v>

2225
01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he's slicker now that he's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>been before.</v>

2226
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I think also a fight like mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just such a wake up call and you could </v>

2227
01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.510
<v Speaker 1>fight a guy like me with her or hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2228
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:13.700
<v Speaker 1>He's arguably one of the greatest boxers</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2229
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.020
<v Speaker 1>The guy retires and I know they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>

2230
01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No argument.</v>

2231
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the greatest,</v>

2232
01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.600
<v Speaker 1>if not the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has this uncanny ability.</v>

2233
01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:26.210
<v Speaker 1>He has the uncanny ability to make every</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2234
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:28.730
<v Speaker 1>He fights the most boring fight you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen your life.</v>

2235
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

2236
01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:35.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kinda sucks because it's hard to get </v>

2237
01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:35.840
<v Speaker 1>your friends into boxing when it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>check it out.</v>

2238
01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:40.841
<v Speaker 1>This is supposed to be the best fight of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Millennium Pacquiao versus </v>

2239
01:37:40.841 --> 01:37:44.321
<v Speaker 1>mayweather and it's everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck can we want something </v>

2240
01:37:44.321 --> 01:37:44.321
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2241
01:37:44.321 --> 01:37:47.060
<v Speaker 1>He just fights so safe and so smart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's better.</v>

2242
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.190
<v Speaker 1>He's better at fighting that style.</v>

2243
01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Then you are dealing with that style and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when guys fight them,</v>

2244
01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:57.820
<v Speaker 1>they just can't get to them and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into this sort of defensive shell </v>

2245
01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.390
<v Speaker 1>like eight or nine rounds in where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up making it look foolish.</v>

2246
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start with swinging wildly and like </v>

2247
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.670
<v Speaker 1>you play right into this trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2248
01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:10.671
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost sucks that I want to know </v>

2249
01:38:10.671 --> 01:38:10.671
<v Speaker 1>who's going to fight next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think he's gonna fight again?</v>

2250
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2251
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:38:12.730 --> 01:38:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think at one point in time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think he's going to retire.</v>

2253
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard any real rumbling.</v>

2254
01:38:18.721 --> 01:38:23.721
<v Speaker 1>So have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just started flamboyantly saying he </v>

2255
01:38:23.721 --> 01:38:25.020
<v Speaker 1>was retiring too much for me to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real retirement.</v>

2256
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:27.270
<v Speaker 1>It just feels like more of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion,</v>

2257
01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.610
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like a stop training.</v>

2258
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:31.410
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2259
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in the gym still.</v>

2260
01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Well you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe he was waiting for the manny </v>

2261
01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:40.971
<v Speaker 1>Pacquiao fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe waiting to see if it </v>

2262
01:38:40.971 --> 01:38:43.550
<v Speaker 1>generated a lot of income and if manny </v>
<v Speaker 1>was back and people loved them because </v>

2263
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:45.740
<v Speaker 1>you got to kind of give manny a chance </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rebound like after the one man,</v>

2264
01:38:45.741 --> 01:38:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Walmart as fight we get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to give him a chance to take some</v>

2265
01:38:49.651 --> 01:38:53.190
<v Speaker 1>time off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight Against Chris Algieri look good.</v>

2266
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And then you could mark the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2267
01:38:57.170 --> 01:39:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just such a bust for me,</v>

2268
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.580
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just so,</v>

2269
01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.470
<v Speaker 1>so goddamn boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2270
01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:05.370
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2271
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I was such a manny Pacquiao fan and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see him,</v>

2272
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:12.720
<v Speaker 1>to see him come up with nothing and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it,</v>

2273
01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.730
<v Speaker 1>have the shoulder thing afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the fact got it sucked.</v>

2274
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:20.250
<v Speaker 1>While the word was before the fight that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoulder was fucked up.</v>

2275
01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People had heard about that.</v>

2276
01:39:21.841 --> 01:39:26.841
<v Speaker 1>It was bookies were talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people didn't know that her </v>

2277
01:39:26.841 --> 01:39:27.600
<v Speaker 1>shoulder was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2278
01:39:27.601 --> 01:39:29.340
<v Speaker 1>they should've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should've postpone the fight.</v>

2279
01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is that in the,</v>

2280
01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:33.750
<v Speaker 1>like some association sue them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2281
01:39:33.810 --> 01:39:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he threw punches with it.</v>

2282
01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a class action lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

2283
01:39:38.641 --> 01:39:43.641
<v Speaker 1>was was it the injury bad back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know what he did for a shop.</v>

2284
01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Cortisone shot before the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said no.</v>

2285
01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2286
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I should've just done it.</v>

2287
01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Can't ask shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just do it.</v>

2288
01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Get a bunch of buddies to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just love them and pack.</v>

2289
01:39:58.390 --> 01:40:03.390
<v Speaker 1>He's like mini Elvis flying around his </v>
<v Speaker 1>own jumbo jet with like a jumbo jet full</v>

2290
01:40:03.781 --> 01:40:06.150
<v Speaker 1>of his entourage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2291
01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.240
<v Speaker 1>he's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a whole whole giant posy and </v>

2292
01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.340
<v Speaker 1>none of them like gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was such a bummer.</v>

2293
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.040
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.490
<v Speaker 1>But that's all that religious stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2295
01:40:17.491 --> 01:40:18.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just heavy Catholic.</v>

2296
01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Catholic or not,</v>

2297
01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you hate to see somebody who's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking blessed.</v>

2298
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.910
<v Speaker 1>A tear people down and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

2299
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2300
01:40:27.401 --> 01:40:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd never paid for a manny Pacquiao </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight again because of that.</v>

2301
01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2302
01:40:31.050 --> 01:40:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2303
01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2304
01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:35.400
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

2305
01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.740
<v Speaker 1>When you get to that level and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much money,</v>

2306
01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you should know fucking better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:41.790
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's disgusting what he said.</v>

2308
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And then he said it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2309
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:47.280
<v Speaker 1>We tried to justify with the Bible God's</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

2310
01:40:49.650 --> 01:40:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2311
01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.770
<v Speaker 1>he probably didn't know the reaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to get,</v>

2312
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet in his culture he said gays are </v>

2313
01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:57.800
<v Speaker 1>less than dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than animals.</v>

2314
01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Was that the exact word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've been misquoted,</v>

2316
01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they tried to explain what he </v>

2317
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:10.990
<v Speaker 1>said based on what it says in the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aisle after the fact.</v>

2318
01:41:11.530 --> 01:41:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>

2319
01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:14.170
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was was not good.</v>

2320
01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2321
01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:20.580
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just he's too rich and too too </v>

2322
01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.720
<v Speaker 1>blessed to be bringing people down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>persecute people down.</v>

2323
01:41:22.721 --> 01:41:24.700
<v Speaker 1>There's just no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took costume,</v>

2324
01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fucking money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2325
01:41:25.691 --> 01:41:28.880
<v Speaker 1>He lost his nike sponsorship because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never get my $99.</v>

2326
01:41:28.890 --> 01:41:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Ninety five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

2327
01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not the only one.</v>

2328
01:41:33.581 --> 01:41:38.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it is a farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that many boxing fans </v>

2329
01:41:38.581 --> 01:41:38.581
<v Speaker 1>who actually care.</v>

2330
01:41:38.581 --> 01:41:40.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2331
01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.320
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be some boxing fans like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that are boxing fans,</v>

2332
01:41:44.321 --> 01:41:48.670
<v Speaker 1>but our apes maybe for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:51.270
<v Speaker 1>All those people watching or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2334
01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend bought,</v>

2335
01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:56.950
<v Speaker 1>bought the last fight and I kinda gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a little shit and he just.</v>

2336
01:41:56.951 --> 01:41:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Because of the gay stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2337
01:41:59.230 --> 01:42:04.230
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's going to be shitty blood </v>

2338
01:42:04.230 --> 01:42:04.230
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2339
01:42:04.230 --> 01:42:04.230
<v Speaker 1>why would you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2340
01:42:04.230 --> 01:42:05.230
<v Speaker 1>the poor guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all ate up with Jesus.</v>

2341
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

2343
01:42:08.650 --> 01:42:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that familiar with his culture </v>

2344
01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:17.821
<v Speaker 1>and exactly how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know for a fact a lot of </v>

2345
01:42:17.821 --> 01:42:17.821
<v Speaker 1>Catholics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2346
01:42:17.821 --> 01:42:20.740
<v Speaker 1>All the Philippines is just overwhelmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Christianity and Catholicism,</v>

2347
01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:25.150
<v Speaker 1>so he probably thought he was actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to save people some strange way,</v>

2348
01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:27.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his brainwashed mind.</v>

2349
01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of the negative </v>

2350
01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:32.160
<v Speaker 1>feedback actually gets to him though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2351
01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:32.160
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

2352
01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:32.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2353
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:34.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't think I'm saying it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mini Elvis.</v>

2354
01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:37.600
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't hear anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got shades on.</v>

2355
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:43.350
<v Speaker 1>50 people and his own jumbo jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to tell him that he's an </v>

2356
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:44.610
<v Speaker 1>asshole?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>

2357
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:47.950
<v Speaker 1>But money can last if he keeps rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Philippines.</v>

2358
01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well honestly you'd probably say his </v>

2359
01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:53.800
<v Speaker 1>money with his own check because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to have to buy 50 plane tickets.</v>

2360
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Cab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2361
01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:57.970
<v Speaker 1>If it's cost effective for him to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own jet,</v>

2362
01:42:58.150 --> 01:43:00.610
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting way to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's so beloved in this country.</v>

2363
01:43:00.611 --> 01:43:02.560
<v Speaker 1>They probably just give him a jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2364
01:43:02.561 --> 01:43:05.820
<v Speaker 1>he just held representative country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a hell of a pool player.</v>

2365
01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:06.480
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2366
01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.400
<v Speaker 1>And he's a lefty too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays really good.</v>

2367
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:12.160
<v Speaker 1>He plays like at a professional level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he?</v>

2368
01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the Philippines or it's a giant </v>

2369
01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:17.190
<v Speaker 1>place for pool.</v>

2370
01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gis brought it over there in the </v>

2371
01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.071
<v Speaker 1>fifties and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the best pool players in the </v>

2372
01:43:23.071 --> 01:43:23.071
<v Speaker 1>world to come out of the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of fact,</v>

2373
01:43:23.071 --> 01:43:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest player of all time,</v>

2374
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:26.440
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Reyes came out of the Philippines.</v>

2375
01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.590
<v Speaker 1>A logician yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2376
01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:32.110
<v Speaker 1>They have some of the best players and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting to watch them because</v>

2377
01:43:32.111 --> 01:43:33.970
<v Speaker 1>they play like they're playing a musical</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrument,</v>

2378
01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.880
<v Speaker 1>like a very gentle game for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very different.</v>

2379
01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not like stiff or hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very gentle flowing.</v>

2380
01:43:41.261 --> 01:43:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their stroke,</v>

2381
01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:46.930
<v Speaker 1>they have a very particular type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke that other players worldwide have</v>

2382
01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:49.750
<v Speaker 1>emulated the Filipino style of play </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool.</v>

2383
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2384
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:51.970

<v Speaker 1>You</v>

2385
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.500
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2386
01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:58.540
<v Speaker 3>what other countries are like embracing </v>
<v Speaker 3>American rock and Blues Music and doing </v>

2387
01:43:59.211 --> 01:44:02.090
<v Speaker 3>a good job with it today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2388
01:44:02.091 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 3>UK is always been a huge supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>

2389
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've always,</v>

2390
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:09.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

2391

<v Speaker 3>roll.</v>

2393
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Do they get good artists that are coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of there today?</v>

<v Speaker 3>T ime and then impala.</v>

2402
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Tame Impala.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make really cool records.</v>

2403
01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:32.710
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty famous now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2404
01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:37.720
<v Speaker 3>I would say they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might even be like a festival </v>

2405
01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:38.630
<v Speaker 3>headliner at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really the other big band and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>bands get noticed now?</v>

2412
01:44:58.310 --> 01:45:02.090

<v Speaker 3>from Mississippi and my studio last week</v>

2413
01:45:02.091 --> 01:45:04.160
<v Speaker 3>and that's all I was thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 3>music business.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What was the gospel singers name?</v>

2417
01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:11.690
<v Speaker 3>His name is Leo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bud Welch.</v>

2418
01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>

2421
01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.990

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2422
01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:20.660
<v Speaker 3>I had some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of my friends in and we,</v>

2423
01:45:20.661 --> 01:45:23.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just sorta like would let him start a</v>

2424
01:45:23.301 --> 01:45:25.430
<v Speaker 3>song and try to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2425
01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.770
<v Speaker 3>get him where he fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2426
01:45:28.730 --> 01:45:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we did a whole record in three days </v>

2427
01:45:33.730 --> 01:45:33.730
<v Speaker 3>with them and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2428
01:45:34.150 --> 01:45:36.230
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's incredible.</v>

2429
01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:45:38.211 --> 01:45:39.230
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's incredible.</v>

2431
01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:44.420
<v Speaker 3>He plays guitar and sings and he's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>frail and kind of hunched over.</v>

2432
01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.760
<v Speaker 3>But he keeps perfect time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we could record them by himself and</v>

2433
01:45:49.761 --> 01:45:54.650
<v Speaker 3>then you could just watch him on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with the bpm hedges right on it,</v>

2434
01:45:54.651 --> 01:45:56.240
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wild.</v>

2435
01:45:58.170 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 3>A lifetime of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2436
01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:04.340
<v Speaker 3>there's something about Old Gospel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>old blues.</v>

2437
01:46:04.341 --> 01:46:05.040
<v Speaker 3>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2438
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 3>there's a sound to like a lot of the old</v>
<v Speaker 3>south that uh,</v>

2439
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:12.590
<v Speaker 3>the inescapable soulful sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2440
01:46:12.591 --> 01:46:15.830
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some old blues like to this day,</v>

2441
01:46:15.831 --> 01:46:18.440
<v Speaker 3>like some John Lee Hooker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like boom,</v>

2442
01:46:18.441 --> 01:46:19.160
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

2443
01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Like you listen to like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is just such a special kind of</v>

2444
01:46:23.721 --> 01:46:28.721
<v Speaker 3>sound and it's instantaneous and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to know anything about it to </v>

2445
01:46:28.721 --> 01:46:28.721
<v Speaker 3>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:46:28.721 --> 01:46:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Which is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it took the world by storm.</v>

2447
01:46:31.101 --> 01:46:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean John Lee Hooker was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>influential in Africa.</v>

2448
01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Like his record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went over there and people like Ali </v>

2449
01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Farka Toure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like one of the greatest African </v>

2450
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.590
<v Speaker 3>guitar players heard his records and </v>
<v Speaker 3>inspired him.</v>

2451
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:44.090
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2452
01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:49.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that there's something about </v>

2453
01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.101
<v Speaker 3>it that's like some of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just undeniably awesome and you </v>

2454
01:46:51.101 --> 01:46:55.341
<v Speaker 3>don't really know how to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like the ingredients are so </v>

2455
01:46:55.341 --> 01:46:55.341
<v Speaker 3>minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:46:55.341 --> 01:46:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else had a guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't they make it sound like that </v>

2457
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.790
<v Speaker 3>too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2458
01:46:58.790 --> 01:47:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like there was a bunch of </v>

2459
01:47:03.230 --> 01:47:03.230
<v Speaker 3>different things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the,</v>

2460
01:47:03.230 --> 01:47:06.740
<v Speaker 3>the audience that had been exposed to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of other great music and they </v>

2461
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:12.081
<v Speaker 3>appreciated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like the experience of the </v>

2462
01:47:12.081 --> 01:47:14.190
<v Speaker 3>people that were performing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the life experience that they had behind</v>

2463
01:47:14.191 --> 01:47:19.191
<v Speaker 3>the words they had lived like sorrowful </v>
<v Speaker 3>times and expressed it legitimately and,</v>

2464
01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:20.140
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2465
01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.110
<v Speaker 3>and truly in the music.</v>

2466
01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was also just where they're from.</v>

2467
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Who they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2468
01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:30.690
<v Speaker 3>So that's who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even like that there maybe </v>

2469
01:47:30.690 --> 01:47:31.080
<v Speaker 3>their lives were so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

2470
01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:37.460
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's just such a part of who </v>

2471
01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:37.460
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2472
01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:37.460
<v Speaker 3>they would never be able to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2473
01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:42.470
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they could never teach a course on </v>

2474
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.510
<v Speaker 3>blues and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Harvard,</v>

2475
01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to live it right.</v>

2476
01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:49.191
<v Speaker 3>And you'd have to experience that vibe </v>
<v Speaker 3>from another musician to know that it's </v>

2477
01:47:49.191 --> 01:47:49.680
<v Speaker 3>possible for someone to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2478
01:47:50.970 --> 01:47:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2479
01:47:51.741 --> 01:47:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2480
01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:55.830
<v Speaker 3>there's only so much you can learn from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2481
01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:01.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a certain point you have to </v>

2482
01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:01.100
<v Speaker 3>understand that what makes them special </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because it's stem,</v>

2483
01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.790
<v Speaker 3>it comes out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't learn that.</v>

2484
01:48:02.791 --> 01:48:07.791
<v Speaker 3>You can't really take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you can take is the feeling of </v>

2485
01:48:07.791 --> 01:48:09.840
<v Speaker 3>they had their own identity and you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to find that in yourself.</v>

2486
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately get,</v>

2487
01:48:12.210 --> 01:48:17.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be influenced by all these </v>

2488
01:48:17.210 --> 01:48:18.831
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the main influence that I think you </v>

2489
01:48:18.831 --> 01:48:18.831
<v Speaker 3>should learn from the greats are that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2490
01:48:18.831 --> 01:48:20.670
<v Speaker 3>you have to find it in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2491
01:48:20.671 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 3>you can't rely on anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2492
01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:27.780
<v Speaker 3>And I think to see it in someone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>gives you that inspiration to try to </v>

2493
01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:28.380
<v Speaker 3>find it in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I used to search for it.</v>

2494
01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:30.330
<v Speaker 3>Just constant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it'd be at the library,</v>

2495
01:48:30.690 --> 01:48:32.810
<v Speaker 3>getting up vhs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2496
01:48:33.330 --> 01:48:37.230
<v Speaker 3>videos and just watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rewinding,</v>

2497
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:42.350
<v Speaker 3>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I would drive 19 hours from </v>

2498
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:45.681
<v Speaker 3>Akron to Mississippi just to like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>find a musician who I heard lived in </v>

2499
01:48:45.681 --> 01:48:47.220
<v Speaker 3>some town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2500
01:48:47.221 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Just because I wanted to see it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2501
01:48:50.611 --> 01:48:51.870
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I find,</v>

2502
01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:54.900
<v Speaker 3>when I found it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit is life changing man.</v>

2503
01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like 17 and I went to Greenville,</v>

2504
01:48:58.351 --> 01:49:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi and I just started asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around for this musician named,</v>

2505
01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:05.430
<v Speaker 3>his name was t model Ford and he made </v>
<v Speaker 3>some really cool t model Ford.</v>

2506
01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a total bad ass.</v>

2507
01:49:06.931 --> 01:49:09.720
<v Speaker 3>He played a death metal guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like really the PV.</v>

2508
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it said with the letters you put on </v>

2509
01:49:15.110 --> 01:49:15.110
<v Speaker 3>a mailbox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like said t model Ford.</v>

2510
01:49:15.110 --> 01:49:19.731
<v Speaker 3>The tail dragger had it spray painted on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his trailer that he pulled her out with </v>

2511
01:49:19.731 --> 01:49:23.871
<v Speaker 3>his Lincoln and I just go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never want to just like become </v>

2512
01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:25.760
<v Speaker 3>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2513
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:31.250
<v Speaker 3>But whether they're from Mississippi or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like a classical composer from </v>

2514
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that these all these </v>

2515
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.860
<v Speaker 3>guys have in common and it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of self,</v>

2516
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:41.070
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody I've ever met has a real.</v>

2517
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.490
<v Speaker 3>Just a confidence that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2518
01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:46.560
<v Speaker 3>even though they may not be the best at </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things,</v>

2519
01:49:46.561 --> 01:49:48.820
<v Speaker 3>they can like bring out the best in </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

2520
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:49.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that.</v>

2521
01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:51.550
<v Speaker 3>And that's like enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2522
01:49:51.670 --> 01:49:54.010
<v Speaker 3>I definitely know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>

2523
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what you mean.</v>

2524
01:49:55.481 --> 01:49:58.930
<v Speaker 3>You described it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great way of putting it.</v>

2525
01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Is it like to seeing it and other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizing it in other people and </v>

2526
01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:09.420
<v Speaker 3>trying to find it in yourself and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So seeing it in other people me and know</v>

2527
01:50:09.641 --> 01:50:12.210
<v Speaker 3>that it's real thing that inspires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2528
01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:14.000
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2529
01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:17.260
<v Speaker 3>And you see somebody like t model or any</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those guys,</v>

2530
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:21.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have any extra thing.</v>

2531
01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:27.100
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have anything like any like </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage really.</v>

2532
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a struggle just like it is for </v>

2533
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.510
<v Speaker 3>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2534
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:33.010
<v Speaker 3>but they found it in themselves I guess.</v>

2535
01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Well that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any artists you'd ever hope for them.</v>

2536
01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:41.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the number one aspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out whatever is the best part of </v>

2537
01:50:41.850 --> 01:50:41.850
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2538
01:50:41.850 --> 01:50:43.510
<v Speaker 3>How do you get your best stuff out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

2539
01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still trying.</v>

2540
01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2541
01:50:46.990 --> 01:50:49.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2542
01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.580
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want ever be too critical.</v>

2543
01:50:52.090 --> 01:50:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Self critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it to be.</v>

2544
01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:58.090
<v Speaker 3>I want to try to like have it on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the record,</v>

2545
01:50:58.930 --> 01:51:02.230
<v Speaker 3>like in it for the first couple takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it feels for me,</v>

2546
01:51:02.231 --> 01:51:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I'll feel a little bit more real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bit more genuine.</v>

2547
01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was really helpful to a </v>

2548
01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:10.120
<v Speaker 3>record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of my favorite records,</v>

2549
01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:13.540
<v Speaker 3>whether they're hip hop or whether the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock and roll or whatever.</v>

2550
01:51:13.610 --> 01:51:18.610
<v Speaker 3>There may generally made pretty quickly </v>
<v Speaker 3>big grand master pieces that were </v>

2551
01:51:18.761 --> 01:51:23.500
<v Speaker 3>labored over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't tend to listen to that much.</v>

2552
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:28.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll listen to it and it'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll hear something sonically that</v>

2553
01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 3>little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool that they did that.</v>

2554
01:51:29.441 --> 01:51:34.441
<v Speaker 3>But then like at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always go and put on that one record </v>

2555
01:51:34.441 --> 01:51:35.440
<v Speaker 3>that that one guy did in a day.</v>
