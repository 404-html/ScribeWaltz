<v Speaker 1>she introduces herself as masculine of center gender queer changes her name to</v>

38

46
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>a culture of diversity now who you would think would need diversity more than</v>

47
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>someone who is a transgender man.</v>

48
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

49
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:55.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

50
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:56.151
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

51
00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:01.151
<v Speaker 1>a very small segment of the population and they're often maligned and you know,</v>

52
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>this is a socially marginalized group and it would be nice for an open minded</v>

53
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>liberal college to accept someone like this and to recognize what a perfect</v>

54
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>person to be a part of our campaign.</v>

55
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Encouraging people to,</v>

56
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:15.450

<v Speaker 1>to be more open minded and accept people.</v>

60
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

61
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>they attacked her because now they felt that she is a white man and they don't</v>

62
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>want a white man in that position because of a white man is in that position.</v>

63
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Then they're supporting the patriarchy.</v>

64
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>So there was three other candidates for the Gig,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got a woman of color in that position.</v>

73
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of diversity there.</v>

74
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>You're good,</v>

75
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Eh?</v>

77
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.851
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

78
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>They all dropped out and then they stayed at,</v>

79
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>they started an anonymous Facebook campaign encouraging people not to vote at</v>

80
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

81
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>to keep a white man from winning the position.</v>

82
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.033
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

83
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

84
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>This is the left eating itself.</v>

85
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening.</v>

86
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>They're eating themselves.</v>

87
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>It is a feeding frenzy.</v>

88
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I used to have Paranas.</v>

89
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.913
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

90
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things about products is,</v>

91
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:13.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.280

00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>They are the most ruthless cunts.</v>

95
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.331
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

96
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>One Parana would just be,</v>

97
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have a fish tank,</v>

99
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.361
<v Speaker 1>one fish,</v>

100
00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>we'll just start swimming weird.</v>

101
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>They start swimming kind of half sideways for some reason.</v>

102
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:27.461
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>is that fish okay?</v>

104
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>And you have to look at him like what's going on with that fish?</v>

105
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>That shit didn't last in that tank,</v>

106
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

107

<v Speaker 1>they just started taking chunks out of them.</v>

110
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening here.</v>

111
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.800
<v Speaker 1>The left is the,</v>

112
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>they're turning on themselves.</v>

113
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>They've run out of outrage.</v>

114
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>They've made so many safe places.</v>

115
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't want anything to be safe anymore and they want to be able to go to</v>

116
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>war over everything.</v>

117
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>They're ferocious there.</v>

118
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:57.031
<v Speaker 1>Paranas their social idea Paranas and they're attacking a gender quail,</v>

119
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.420
<v Speaker 1>gender queer masculine of center man for not being diverse enough for being a</v>

120
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>part of the patriarchy,</v>

121
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Bardo Woven board.</v>

122
00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:10.570

127
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I makes no sense.</v>

128
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>It does make sense though.</v>

129
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense because it highlights what this movement is all about.</v>

130
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>It's socially retarded.</v>

131
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>People that are left alone to their own devices and they're just devouring each</v>

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>this is the national review.</v>

149
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>This is a goddamn onion article and it's not transgender woman can't be</v>

150
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>diversity officer because she's a white man.</v>

151
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:07.741
<v Speaker 1>Now I mixed 0 million cents makes all the sense in the world that it's not a</v>

152
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:11.741
<v Speaker 1>fake article.</v>

153
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:11.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

154
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:13.670
<v Speaker 1>that seems like 100% of fake.</v>

155
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

156
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

157
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

158
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

159
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a rose is a rose in a bad neighborhood.</v>

160
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 1>It pops out of the concrete and it comes out perfect.</v>

161
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

162
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.043
<v Speaker 1>This is art.</v>

163
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

164
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>it's the universe creating art with our own folly.</v>

165
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.333
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

166
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>It's culture.</v>

167
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.190
<v Speaker 1>It's called,</v>

168
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

169
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>it's people,</v>

170
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>there's something that happens to people when you deny reality,</v>

172
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>when you don't look at things objectively.</v>

173
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

174
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>there's I think like priests that molests kids,</v>

175
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

176
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Some of that has to be from suppression.</v>

177
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Some of it has to be probably they were abused themselves.</v>

178
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>There's probably all sorts of,</v>

179
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>but some of that perversion has got to come from suppression.</v>

180
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Catholic school girl thing that everybody knows.</v>

181
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

182
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>when I was in high school,</v>

183
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>there was no scientists in my fucking ninth grade class,</v>

184
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>but we all knew the girls who went to Catholic schools were hose and why are</v>

185
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>they host their hose?</v>

186
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody tells them they can't be a Ho.</v>

187
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's talking to them constantly about,</v>

188
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>you are going to go to hell,</v>

189
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>do not touch a man's genitals,</v>

190
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>don't you do anything?</v>

191
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Those calls were freaks.</v>

192
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>They were the biggest freaks and we all knew it.</v>

193
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.631
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

194
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

195
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 1>There was no books on it.</v>

196
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>There was no youtube videos that we could watch,</v>

197
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>but we fucking knew it.</v>

198
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

199
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.600
<v Speaker 1>We all knew it and I think it's a suppression issue and this is suppressing</v>

200
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>individual identity.</v>

201
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>This is suppressing free speech.</v>

202
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>This is suppressing objectivity.</v>

203
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to have unique or intertwined thoughts.</v>

204
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to share opinions with the left.</v>

205
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>And with the right.</v>

206
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to.</v>

207
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.891
<v Speaker 1>You have to have,</v>

208
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>and you're constantly worried about being called out.</v>

209
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly worried about being outed and doxed and called out and shamed.</v>

210
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's shaming people and attacking people.</v>

211
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's this fucking feeding frenzy.</v>

212
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.043
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

213
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>

214
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy when I read a story like this.</v>

215
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I would encourage this woman to fight to the death for her position.</v>

216
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

217
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.653
<v Speaker 1>she's a man now.</v>

218
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Fight to the death of that position.</v>

219
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

220
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>

221
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I want you to show up for school in a fucking an armor with a sword and let them</v>

222
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 1>know that you are,</v>

223
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 1>you are here because you are a warrior for diversity and you're going to,</v>

224
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take this to the very end,</v>

225
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>to the very end of time.</v>

226
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

227
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.213
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

228
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 1>This is an amazing story.</v>

229
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the greatest stories the universe has ever told cause it's,</v>

230
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:36.764
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

231
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>and it highlights that store that we were just talking about where the,</v>

232
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:40.664
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

233
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>the thing that was up on the,</v>

234
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:42.051
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 1>the thing earlier with the United States is like a powder keg.</v>

236
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 1>This is like what we're talking about like entitled ridiculous people that they</v>

237
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:51.800
<v Speaker 1>don't live in reality.</v>

238
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.001
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

239
00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:52.241
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

240
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:52.941
<v Speaker 1>you're not looking,</v>

241
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

242
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>you're concentrating on nonsense.</v>

243
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>But why are they concentrating on nonsense?</v>

244
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't have to worry about feeding themselves.</v>

245
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to worry about shelter.</v>

246
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.660
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to worry about being in Ohio,</v>

247
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 1>have no fucking power for a week and everybody has to stay alive.</v>

248
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>You can't get to work.</v>

249
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like walking back and forth to each other's house.</v>

250
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Sharon food and going out and getting firewood together and dragging it back at</v>

251
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>some little kids wagon.</v>

252
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what people do when they want to survive.</v>

253
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.650
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

254
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 1>when you want to survive,</v>

255
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>you come up with ways that you could all work together.</v>

256
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 1>When it's too easy to survive,</v>

257
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you start attacking people for nonsense and that's what the fuck is going on</v>

258
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

259
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Speaker 1>You've got a campaign to keep.</v>

260
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make sure that a white man,</v>

261
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to win this.</v>

262
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Like as if she's really a white man.</v>

263
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Why are we pretending that's a man left of Weird Gender Queer masculine of</v>

264
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:44.181
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

265
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

266
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>You're a girl,</v>

267
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>you're a girl or a guy,</v>

268
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 1>whatever you are.</v>

269
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Who cares what the fuck it was probably way more to this story.</v>

270
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:54.670
<v Speaker 1>She's just a big bitch and I like</v>

271
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>eating too much pussy on campus.</v>

272
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 1>They're all mad.</v>

273
00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>She always just too good at it.</v>

275
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>She's too good at it.</v>

276
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>But she's gender queer,</v>

277
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 1>so that means I don't think you'd do anything.</v>

278
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means.</v>

279
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think they know what it means.</v>

280
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.230
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

281
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you ever heard of Pan Sexual?</v>

282
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 1>There was a woman who was like,</v>

283
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>she was making history.</v>

284
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 1>This is hilarious.</v>

285
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>This is a hilarious story.</v>

286
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>She was making history cause she was the first Gen.</v>

287
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:19.921
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

288
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 1>she was the first pan sexual person to take office</v>

289
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

290
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.020
