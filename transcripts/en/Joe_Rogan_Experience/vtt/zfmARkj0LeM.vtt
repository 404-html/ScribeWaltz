<v Speaker 1>bump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bump,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bump,</v>

4
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>bump.</v>

5
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's double shooting me.</v>

7
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>That means we're alive with the Kido</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

8
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Kido.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been for data.</v>

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>That's your new nickname,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kiddo kid.</v>

10
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kido kid.</v>

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm just happy you're doing it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>before we get into the UFC stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brendan and I were talking before this</v>

13
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started the no sugar diet.</v>

15
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went,</v>

16
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>he went straight Kido,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy for me.</v>

17
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he's ever going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

18
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.540
<v Speaker 1>You're so addicted to candy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the straight candy man.</v>

19
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you and my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

20
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Ari Shaffir is probably the worst I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.451
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>He'll take a day off candy and he'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eat like pasta and bread all day,</v>

23
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 1>like Kit giving us body candy and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other floor.</v>

24
00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

25
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried all these diets and I've,</v>

26
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 1>and I've never got the results I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to and going,</v>

27
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I started doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's like,</v>

28
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:08.904
<v Speaker 1>be careful man.</v>

29
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>The cravings were gonna have headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have shit.</v>

30
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.021
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of fact,</v>

31
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I worked out more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it hard at all over the first couple</v>

32
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>of days?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's interesting.</v>

33
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

34
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talked to that Mark Sisson Guy,</v>

35
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>he would probably say that your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>just adapts really well to it.</v>

36
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would probably imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think like two to be sure you're</v>

37
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>even in a state of Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to measure your blood but it's</v>

38
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>going to be annoying for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like it was annoying from,</v>

39
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have to find out where's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right place to stab yourself because of</v>

40
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>the fingertips weren't working for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those little little insulin</v>

41
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>when you checking your blood sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

42
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>they weren't getting through my</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingertips.</v>

43
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm thinking of his fingers like</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas.</v>

44
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I saw all those ketalysis this is all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some serious councils up in</v>

45
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.644
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear Ya.</v>

46
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Over the last shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most guys doing their pinky.</v>

47
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I see him doing the pink yellow time.</v>

48
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>He some days a little banana thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent me one though and they</v>

49
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>said there's a legit one now for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath at the ones for the breath used</v>

50
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>to suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they have one that's legit and</v>

51
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>it shows what Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what level of it shows Jenica ketosis.</v>

52
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look into that.</v>

53
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember who sends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

54
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I just feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel good.</v>

56
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna keep doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

57
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel this is the crazy</v>

58
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to feel this way and this</v>

59
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>is how you feel now.</v>

60
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you know this thing in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day where you get tired,</v>

61
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.610
<v Speaker 1>that's going to go away and I got that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went to,</v>

62
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I went to Mexico when on vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a great,</v>

63
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>great old time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm in Mexico.</v>

65
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go off my diet.</v>

66
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burrito's.</v>

67
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tea is getting in there.</v>

68
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I had Tacos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it and then I said,</v>

69
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I'm doing that,</v>

70
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I might as well get dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

71
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:53.421
<v Speaker 1>I felt like diggity dog shit when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't done that and to know then right</v>

72
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>away crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

73
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>right away I felt terrible after eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cake and then in the day,</v>

74
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could barely stay conscious.</v>

75
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that anymore.</v>

76
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my thing was is I've always</v>

77
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do it but I never really had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a strict reason to do it.</v>

78
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Like something that just put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put me over to finally make the decision</v>

79
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>to do it and I was thinking about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much you do because I have a lot of</v>

80
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like dude,</v>

81
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting tired man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

82
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that well like I could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing better just mentally more clear</v>

83
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>and I'm working out doing all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you and I have been talking about</v>

84
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>for a while and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

85
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I might as well try it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause coffee really does nothing to me</v>

86
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could drink six gap.</v>

87
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Tina's before I go to bed and sleep just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

88
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably just get into rem sleep at all.</v>

89
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta do something and do it.</v>

90
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It's been great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

92
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.460
<v Speaker 1>When it gets these 12 step programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it gets easy because after awhile</v>

93
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>you just look at food is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

94
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>well this is what I'm supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>

95
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>That other stuff isn't food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>like you don't look at a candy bar like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

97
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>that would be good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's crazy to me.</v>

98
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were talking about how you have</v>

99
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>those Keto genic like greasy pcs or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I should give him a shout out.</v>

101
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Quest labs sent us a bunch of stuff when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found out that we were,</v>

105
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.660

<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>

106
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

107
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.090

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>it's called a key genics and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>exogenous ketones.</v>

119
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

120
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dom d'agostino had something to do with</v>

121
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.390

<v Speaker 1>So many told me I need to research it</v>

122
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are exogenous ketones.</v>

123
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>You take this and you mix that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and it puts you in a state of</v>

124
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>ketosis really rapidly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>12 carbs though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

126

<v Speaker 1>And I got knocked to my colleagues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>shelled also.</v>

136
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>You got crack the shell open?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

137
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>they're already shelled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you're saying they're not shell?</v>

138
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.851
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bull.</v>

139
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>The shell shelled meaning the shells</v>
<v Speaker 1>removed.</v>

140
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

141
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the correct term.</v>

142
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Shelled shell will shit wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

143
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.740

146
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they say shelled,</v>

147
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>meaning that they have been removed as</v>
<v Speaker 1>long goes,</v>

148
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want some shell?</v>

149
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it isn't.</v>

150
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Some shelled nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>seeds.</v>

160
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.890

<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do that man.</v>

161

186
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first few pounds that you lose.</v>

187
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I'm not a doctor or supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be just your body adjusting to this</v>

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>much water storage and your body and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

192
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>One of the coolest things is you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get those crazy hunger cravings either.</v>

193
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.340

00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We break it down.</v>

349
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The diary of feeling is super</v>

350
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

351
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.440
<v Speaker 1>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

352
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.250
<v Speaker 1>how do I know?</v>

353
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 1>How do I know that this is about to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying?</v>

354
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>My body starts sweating to brace</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

355
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were about to get active in some</v>

356
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 1>foods to some foods are just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes spicy food for whatever</v>

357
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just break stuff loose off the walls and</v>

358
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:59.430
<v Speaker 1>there's the gods at math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latch fucking much.</v>

359
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking broken.</v>

360
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Fire hydrant come out of your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated.</v>

361
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 1>We can do a podcast for three hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and shit.</v>

362
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

363
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important.</v>

364
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really it's so easy on the MCT oil</v>

365
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:19.050
<v Speaker 1>kids oral to our story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

366
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.510
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to have like at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

367
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.360
<v Speaker 1>a couple of tablespoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

368
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Don't squirt that shit drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to kill you,</v>

369
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:26.760
<v Speaker 1>but you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

370
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.150
<v Speaker 1>you will shit your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

371
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 1>You'll piss out of your ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up.</v>

372
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 1>The big combination if you really want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to clean the pipes is those hoke load</v>

373
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kale shakes that I make with mct oil in</v>

374
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

375
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Preach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

376
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I started out in coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coconut oil was nice,</v>

377
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 1>like scoop it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of 'em,</v>

378
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra virgin or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

379
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Get a nice couple of tablespoons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it in there.</v>

380
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.630
<v Speaker 1>But then I decided to go hard and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the paint called mct oil and uh,</v>

381
00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I forget the number that I use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four or five tablespoons if fucked up.</v>

382
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I use four or five tablespoons for one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those blenders</v>

383
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.150
<v Speaker 1>does bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

384
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.510
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he say that is about 16 hour,</v>

385
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.550
<v Speaker 1>not 20 ounces maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So five scoops of MCT oil?</v>

386
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Or were you thinking though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see what happens</v>

387
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 1>usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually I'm always down for more means</v>

388
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't know back then when I was,</v>

389
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:30.840
<v Speaker 1>when I first started shitting myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

390
00:16:30.841 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I knew come closest shitting myself.</v>

391
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I knew I still fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know mct oil that was doing it.</v>

392
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the intense amount of fiber from</v>

393
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:43.030
<v Speaker 1>the handshakes or from the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

394
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

395
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's cucumber in there and</v>

396
00:16:46.301 --> 00:16:51.301
<v Speaker 1>carrots and there are a salary rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ginger and garlic and usually like a</v>

397
00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>piece of fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an app or something like that.</v>

398
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Like there's so much fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just blowing everything</v>

399
00:16:56.511 --> 00:16:59.710
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a big difference between now</v>

400
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.700
<v Speaker 1>when I had the extra mct oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's,</v>

401
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like a turbo turbo engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it lubing the everything up.</v>

402
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just gets in there and wreaks havoc.</v>

403
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It just gets in there and fucking why</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it make it all come out as liquid?</v>

404
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Like what is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated.</v>

405
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>So complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does that work?</v>

406
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like it would be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

407
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Like it would be uncomfortable but like</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that would clean you out.</v>

408
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good thing probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it.</v>

409
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I hope so too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

411
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>good source of healthy fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just take it easy fucks.</v>

412
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the man.</v>

413
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:38.840
<v Speaker 1>More is not better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

414
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.090
<v Speaker 1>So a big UFC this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why we've had</v>

415
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.070
<v Speaker 1>down here and just start talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitting their pants and even 25</v>

416
00:17:46.071 --> 00:17:47.130
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

417
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 1>talking about whatever though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

418
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>a big UFC</v>

419
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 3>this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was talking to you through tax.</v>

420
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I feel like no one's really talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about [inaudible] 97 because the connor</v>

421
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 3>that straight up [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all I referred them now,</v>

422
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 3>the two best pound for pound fighters in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

423
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Universally heralded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two best pound for pound Christ John</v>

424
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Jones and Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting on a car this weekend and no</v>

425
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 3>one's talking about I ain't Anthony</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pettis is on that bitch versus Barboza.</v>

426
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Jon Jones,</v>

427
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion he's number two.</v>

428
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Not that he's not that he's not awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

429
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.340
<v Speaker 3>I just go off technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that Demetrius Johnson is on</v>

430
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:29.070
<v Speaker 3>another level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had my eye on another level</v>

431
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 3>because it's so small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what Jon Jones does and his</v>

432
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 3>risk of losing is so much higher than</v>
<v Speaker 3>mighty mouse is,</v>

433
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.400
<v Speaker 3>and he's destroying dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

434
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 3>And not training and high as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

435
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.400
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's toss that on top of it.</v>

436
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 3>You got good points there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just because you didn't train,</v>

437
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make your performances more</v>
<v Speaker 3>valid.</v>

438
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Like because you beat Daniel cormier and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did coke three weeks before,</v>

439
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.620
<v Speaker 3>you still have the same fight with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel cormier.</v>

440
00:18:54.621 --> 00:18:59.190
<v Speaker 3>It just because you went five rounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Alexander Gustafson and struggled</v>

441
00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 3>because you didn't train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still struggled.</v>

442
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 3>So although I agree that Jon Jones at</v>
<v Speaker 3>his best is the Motherfucker,</v>

443
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jon Jones at his best when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>choked out,</v>

444
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Leo Machida when he just dropped him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>walked away.</v>

445
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

446
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think get the contest because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think John,</v>

447
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:17.430
<v Speaker 3>the way he's being guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's facing tougher competition.</v>

448
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:20.070
<v Speaker 3>You could argue that and his level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his level,</v>

449
00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 3>his margin of error is so much smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's say Dj has one off night and</v>

450
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 3>someone lands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lands a big like right hand on him,</v>

451
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 3>he'll figure it out.</v>

452
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.300
<v Speaker 3>And that right hand is like Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

453
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.760
<v Speaker 3>If Jon Jones has an off night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

454
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 3>even Osp and Osp lands a huge left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>

455
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 3>So it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've very good points.</v>

456
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 3>These are very good points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And thinking about the legends,</v>

457
00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:44.090
<v Speaker 3>he's beat mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mighty mouse.</v>

458
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.390
<v Speaker 3>Next fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he gets passed,</v>

459
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 3>so Hutto he's fighting a winner of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate fighter.</v>

460
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 3>That's what the fuck we a result too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no one for him to fight.</v>

461
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Whitney five Benevidez no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

462
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 3>His next fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said if he wins this fight,</v>

463
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.570
<v Speaker 3>he's going to fight the winner of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate fighter.</v>

464
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Speaker 3>That sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

465
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 3>that's where that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's who says people,</v>

466
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.320
<v Speaker 3>tiny people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't look at those little tiny</v>

467
00:20:04.321 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucks cause he's so talented.</v>

468
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:08.820
<v Speaker 3>He's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think it's better for the</v>

469
00:20:08.821 --> 00:20:10.710
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Demetrius Johnson.</v>

470
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 3>I love Dj.</v>

471
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely love him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think he's great.</v>

472
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it's better for the sport of</v>
<v Speaker 3>pseudo wins.</v>

473
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

474
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.820
<v Speaker 3>Why do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of his,</v>

475
00:20:18.821 --> 00:20:20.180
<v Speaker 3>his upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his background,</v>

476
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Olympic gold medalists didn't go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>college,</v>

477
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 3>just pursued the Olympic straight out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>high school and one gold.</v>

478
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Speaker 3>The youngest ever doing gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

479
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 3>his Mexican roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think UFC could use more of that.</v>

480
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Dj needs a nemesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He the old like although had mcgregor,</v>

481
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those never been bigger.</v>

482
00:20:35.431 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Now we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think DJ needs a nemesis and if he</v>

483
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 3>beats them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have one.</v>

484
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:40.890
<v Speaker 3>He fights the fucking ultimate fighter</v>
<v Speaker 3>winner.</v>

485
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or unless he beats him barely,</v>

486
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows.</v>

487
00:20:44.401 --> 00:20:45.530
<v Speaker 3>But even then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

488
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 3>so who knows not to joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best wrestler in mma today,</v>

489
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean arguably that's competing in 125</v>
<v Speaker 3>pound division.</v>

490
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Who the F who's ever had more wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplishments?</v>

491
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.850
<v Speaker 3>He's an Olympic gold medalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malice mean that's the,</v>

492
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.020
<v Speaker 3>the beast of the beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

493
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 3>he's a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just a straight winner.</v>

494
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:08.730
<v Speaker 3>The real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that cut to one 25 too brutal cause</v>

495
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.590
<v Speaker 3>he's look good in his fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The scary thing to me though that he</v>

496
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 3>looked better if he didn't cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think guys would,</v>

497
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 3>I always think they would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy like him,</v>

498
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a wonder if he's got that</v>

499
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:21.970
<v Speaker 3>restless mentality to always be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest guy.</v>

500
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Look what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cutting that weight though.</v>

501
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Like he has it down to a science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So usually wrestlers are a beast at it.</v>

502
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Like DC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

503
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Pendo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

504
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about guys who never</v>
<v Speaker 3>really missed,</v>

505
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I rumbled?</v>

506
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 3>Back when he used to go down from like</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 plus,</v>

507
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 3>it was just unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One 70.</v>

508
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't saying that just unhealthy.</v>

509
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe no one was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

510
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might die.</v>

511
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then data was like,</v>

512
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this dead.</v>

513
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>

514
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

515
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't have that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they said dot.</v>

516
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 3>Only had to lose three pounds a week of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight.</v>

517
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Still hold all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just say it.</v>

518
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.640
<v Speaker 3>You better know your weight cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

519
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.610
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a lot of other issues</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on there.</v>

520
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Physically it was just wasn't prepared</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

521
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.630
<v Speaker 3>But there's a big difference between him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a guy.</v>

522
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Like just being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

523
00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:05.440
<v Speaker 3>So who does the fucking best in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>business?</v>

524
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:07.450
<v Speaker 3>He's a master at weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just look at his,</v>

525
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wins all submission.</v>

526
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

527
00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions.</v>

528
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 3>His level of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dj,</v>

529
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 3>I think he's number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pound for pound.</v>

530
00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck,</v>

531
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:17.670
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

532
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a motherfucker.</v>

533
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.320
<v Speaker 3>He's an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

534
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:24.370
<v Speaker 3>He's my favorite guy to watch because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just don't get to hit him.</v>

535
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:25.700
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

536
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.210
<v Speaker 3>it works well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How it works is he's going to be moving.</v>

537
00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be reacting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna think he's gonna go left.</v>

538
00:22:30.821 --> 00:22:32.500
<v Speaker 3>He's going to go right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to punch you in the face</v>

539
00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:35.260
<v Speaker 3>while he's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to circle out leg kick you on</v>

540
00:22:35.261 --> 00:22:37.990
<v Speaker 3>the way out and then enter when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think he's going to exit.</v>

541
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Go to the right when you think he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go to the left and constantly</v>

542
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 3>switch between takedowns and punches and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets you up against the cage and he</v>

543
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 3>drops down for doubles and comes up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>an elbow and it's all creative.</v>

544
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.200
<v Speaker 3>This is all flowing together and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one with better skills than him now,</v>

545
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that makes him the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best fighter.</v>

546
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a good if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some still think if I'm Dj,</v>

547
00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna sit there and God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

548
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.300
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck can I become a draw?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tiny.</v>

549
00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 3>People don't give a fuck about tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

550
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one guy who's beat me,</v>

551
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.680
<v Speaker 3>dominick Cruz is a massive star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to go up in weight and fight</v>

552
00:23:08.681 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Dominic Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight.</v>

553
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Well grab the mic after beat so Hutto</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go dominic,</v>

554
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.660

<v Speaker 3>You're the last guy to beat me.</v>

555
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 3>Especially in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before that it was a homeboy,</v>

556
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.210
<v Speaker 3>the fricking Irish cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget his name.</v>

557
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just needs to get on the Mike and go</v>

558
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.740
<v Speaker 3>yo the last guy to beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prick.</v>

559
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.271
<v Speaker 3>Picket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

563
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 3>Loved that guy might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he just needs to get on the mic and</v>

564
00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:40.330
<v Speaker 3>create some sort of hype like you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pseudo thing till the common fan.</v>

565
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.910
<v Speaker 3>These are two tiny dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard,</v>

566
00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 3>but to stay at one 25 it ain't man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to become mainstream.</v>

567
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Knocked can become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to make a lot of money.</v>

568
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I wonder though.</v>

569
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause if so who don't beat him then</v>

570
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got a little bit of drama.</v>

571
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we'll see.</v>

572
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Looks it's not outside the realm of</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

573
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:05.120
<v Speaker 3>So he knows this thing for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So hutto beats them and talk some shit.</v>

574
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:06.860
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of back and forth fight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they fight again.</v>

575
00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:10.100
<v Speaker 3>We'll watch that three match or let's</v>
<v Speaker 3>say just destroy.</v>

576
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:12.530
<v Speaker 3>So Huda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Hutto don't wait for the ultimate</v>

577
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:14.340
<v Speaker 3>fighter winner.</v>

586
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

587
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone else does not.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love that dude.</v>

589
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two ways of looking at it as</v>

590
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 3>excitement junkie and as a fan of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>art form.</v>

591
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.820
<v Speaker 3>For me as a fan of the art form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see dj with as many different</v>

592
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:54.821
<v Speaker 3>tests as possible because I'm a big fan</v>
<v Speaker 3>of technique and movement and I think</v>

593
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.180
<v Speaker 3>he's the highest expression of technique</v>
<v Speaker 3>and movement today cause this is</v>

594
00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:01.350
<v Speaker 3>combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way he went away,</v>

595
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.250
<v Speaker 3>he stifled Dodson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't stifle Dodson.</v>

596
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Dotson's a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got cows flying around your yard.</v>

597
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.370
<v Speaker 3>You know the fucking satellite dish.</v>

598
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 3>We'll take your head off as it comes off</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roof.</v>

599
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so fast.</v>

600
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:16.170
<v Speaker 3>How about with the bag of teen off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he fought off,</v>

601
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.080
<v Speaker 3>he out cardio at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on a pos on epo on the owl</v>

602
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.310
<v Speaker 3>carney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five pounds and he out cardio to him.</v>

603
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.320
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck teen offs got that style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that Russian style that sometimes</v>

604
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes it doesn't fucking,</v>

605
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.220
<v Speaker 3>it's really those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can see the shots.</v>

606
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.690
<v Speaker 3>Tents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every punches.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It works at heavier weight.</v>

608
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.083
<v Speaker 3>He buckets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's from a purist point it's like</v>

00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:53.010

<v Speaker 3>at what's best for him cause he's gonna</v>

614
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 3>fight right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just keep fine.</v>

615
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 3>How can we make the most money and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>you the most fame and the best</v>

616
00:25:58.281 --> 00:25:59.114
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

617
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Dominick Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

618
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 3>It's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>best matchup in that they're virtually</v>

619
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.700
<v Speaker 3>identical sidewalk in size wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only 10 pounds off.</v>

620
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're both talking about world</v>

621
00:26:09.951 --> 00:26:11.750
<v Speaker 3>champions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the highest level and what type of a</v>

622
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:14.240
<v Speaker 3>super fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not that far off 10 pounds at one</v>

623
00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:17.390
<v Speaker 3>25 though it was actually quite a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight because it was a hundred pounds.</v>

624
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 3>It'd be 10% there's a lot of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they could figure it out.</v>

625
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could risk that for that big of</v>

626
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:25.190
<v Speaker 3>a payday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well or if Mickey Mouse has fought at</v>

627
00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:27.000
<v Speaker 3>that weight before and if he just did</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

628
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 3>if they gave him like six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give them six months,</v>

629
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:33.020
<v Speaker 3>we can do some squats or dead lifts or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

630
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 3>And the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue is,</v>

631
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:36.080
<v Speaker 3>is cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

632
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:39.020
<v Speaker 3>so it's cruise has uriah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say he beats you or I,</v>

633
00:26:39.021 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 3>if we go with the vegas odds he beat</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uriah but then he has tj.</v>

634
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Well I think is going to go with Dodson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had a gas like what the big fight</v>

635
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 3>is at one 35 rematching Tj and Dotson</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause that was the finals of the</v>

636
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 3>ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundred a percent and both guys are</v>

637
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 3>light years past where they were them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see how dots and deals</v>

638
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:03.981
<v Speaker 3>with the champion Tj because Tj lost a</v>
<v Speaker 3>razor close decision to dominic.</v>

639
00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:04.854
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agreed.</v>

640
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Very critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually had tj winning very fucking</v>

641
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 3>close fight and you know dominick Cruz</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a master.</v>

642
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:14.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean he is just a mass straight master</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching him move and it's footwork</v>

643
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 3>inside the octagon and the way he mixes</v>
<v Speaker 3>things up.</v>

644
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:20.100
<v Speaker 3>You're like this fucking kid has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>out essentially for four years except</v>

645
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 3>for one fight nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

646
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Not One fight was like a minute</v>
<v Speaker 3>something and just stuffed stormed</v>

647
00:27:25.441 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Mitsui Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're watching this guy move around.</v>

648
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a guy who hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>performed under the pressure of the</v>

649
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:34.530
<v Speaker 3>cameras for all this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still puts on this mass to pull</v>

650
00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best brain in MMA that I've ever</v>

651
00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:40.590
<v Speaker 3>been as a wizard as far as him talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think you so,</v>

652
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 3>but you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you got to keep tj active yet keep</v>

653
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:47.150
<v Speaker 3>dominic af active but dodson and and Tj</v>
<v Speaker 3>is um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but for,</v>

656
00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:54.270
<v Speaker 3>for the the guy who's going to be left</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and fighting a no name or ultimate</v>

<v Speaker 3>Almost positive.</v>

660
00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:04.530

664
00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a weird thing to make up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually I'm right on this stuff.</v>

665
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.400

<v Speaker 3>But you can emulate a version of it.</v>

692
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Like Rico Verhoeven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rico Verhoeven is very technical,</v>

693
00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:35.370
<v Speaker 3>has incredible cardio and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fantastic kickboxer and he's a</v>

694
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.740
<v Speaker 3>big motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

695
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.650
<v Speaker 3>MMA now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

696
00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:38.484

<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

697
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Good luck finding him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

698
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 3>And he's trained at Aka.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

699
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck's to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

700
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 3>the only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only problem mobilizes in the</v>

701
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:48.220
<v Speaker 3>beginning of their career.</v>

702
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 3>They're susceptible to punches during</v>
<v Speaker 3>like takedown exchanges.</v>

703
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Like remember when random and knocked</v>
<v Speaker 3>out cro cop.</v>

704
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

706
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Cop was looking for the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>true and random and came at him with a</v>

707
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 3>punch and just leapt at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they can't ground lease their hands</v>

708
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gloves are so small.</v>

709
00:30:03.821 --> 00:30:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

710
00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:07.430
<v Speaker 3>in kickbox he can get away with a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>more or even in glory,</v>

711
00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:09.910
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like your boy Pat Schilling,</v>

712
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he should be merck in some of these</v>

713
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 3>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Oh,</v>

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.900
<v Speaker 3>showing you jo Shawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

715
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Shy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

716
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Palestinians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

717
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 3>who's this pat fellow with Joe Shoen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he his standup,</v>

718
00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:21.800
<v Speaker 3>some of the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

719
00:30:21.801 --> 00:30:23.290
<v Speaker 3>you seem fight mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not this.</v>

720
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.400
<v Speaker 3>He can't fight the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's worried about the takedown and so</v>

721
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.840
<v Speaker 3>he's opened a knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll see me get knocked out by a</v>

722
00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:28.990
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

723
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.890
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

724
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 3>if there was no takedowns he would fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>you up.</v>

725
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% feel like yelling at another crowd.</v>

726
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he's only doing that now.</v>

727
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:40.150
<v Speaker 3>I think he's going straight kickboxing</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

728
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.580
<v Speaker 3>It's smart man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quit messing with M and ms in his</v>

729
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.050
<v Speaker 3>thirties to you in your thirties the</v>
<v Speaker 3>game and it's full of grapplers known</v>

730
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 3>standing with your crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

731
00:30:47.771 --> 00:30:52.771
<v Speaker 3>you might find yourself across the cage</v>
<v Speaker 3>from some Ncaa Division One national</v>

732
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:56.840
<v Speaker 3>champion and you are not stopping the</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

733
00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 3>You're not only your time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't give a fuck about</v>

734
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.610
<v Speaker 3>exciting fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He will ride you for 15 minutes and</v>

735
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 3>loved every minute of it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't care.</v>

736
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Face was elbows and the only problem to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to get up.</v>

737
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.610
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a big difference.</v>

738
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:13.090
<v Speaker 3>She's standing up with someone or guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>are used to slipping and moving and</v>

739
00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:17.620
<v Speaker 3>anticipating angles and someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally holding your fucking face down</v>

740
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.880
<v Speaker 3>and force feeding you elbows.</v>

741
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Head has nowhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also with,</v>

742
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 3>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Schilling,</v>

743
00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:29.160
<v Speaker 3>it's more of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't see the payoff for it boss.</v>

744
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.150
<v Speaker 3>So there's not a lot of money in kickbox</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what he's doing.</v>

745
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:36.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping Bela Tarr brings it up cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got Bella kickboxing now and a UFC</v>

746
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:38.380
<v Speaker 3>now has glory so that UFC has glide</v>
<v Speaker 3>paths,</v>

747
00:31:38.381 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

748
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Fight Pass is they're carrying glory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Espn is also carrying glory.</v>

749
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're smart man.</v>

750
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.980
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucking awesome product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just right now people don't know</v>

751
00:31:47.981 --> 00:31:49.960
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to tell the guy's story.</v>

752
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to be invested in these guys</v>

753
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.440
<v Speaker 3>that would fucking Joe Schilling</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

754
00:31:54.441 --> 00:31:57.100
<v Speaker 3>It's great man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we have to be invested in care about</v>

755
00:31:57.101 --> 00:31:59.590
<v Speaker 3>the guy fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise it's just two guys kickboxing.</v>

756
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.110
<v Speaker 3>I think if someone like Hbo got Ahold of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

757
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.210
<v Speaker 3>if they did it the way they do hbo</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>

758
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:09.270
<v Speaker 3>if they had like a Simon Marcus versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Schilling title fight like two guys</v>

759
00:32:09.671 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 3>who have gone to war and have this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>history behind them where marcus stopped</v>

760
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 3>him in one fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Joe Schilling Stop Marcus in</v>

761
00:32:16.271 --> 00:32:19.540
<v Speaker 3>the fourth round of this insane fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

762
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you there in La for that fight?</v>

763
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 3>I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was not there in person.</v>

764
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.950
<v Speaker 3>You I supposed to go with you actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Mooglie when he uncorked that</v>

765
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:30.370
<v Speaker 3>right hand and you see Simon Marcus go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

766
00:32:30.371 --> 00:32:33.460
<v Speaker 3>you're like holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was in the fourth round.</v>

767
00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:38.250
<v Speaker 3>When there's that moment when these guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to fight three rounds and if the</v>

768
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 3>fight is draw at the</v>

769
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.520
<v Speaker 1>end of the third round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go to a final final debt.</v>

770
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.510
<v Speaker 1>What do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they going nation don't call it</v>

771
00:32:47.511 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 1>sudden death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

772
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.253
<v Speaker 1>he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tough.</v>

773
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.640
<v Speaker 1>That's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with the current debt.</v>

774
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.060
<v Speaker 1>So they go to this one more round and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

775
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 1>when the one more round he'd see polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys are exhausted,</v>

776
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.440
<v Speaker 1>tired and sign and Marcus had spit his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece out a couple times.</v>

777
00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 1>He got a point taken away from him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and uh,</v>

778
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.840
<v Speaker 1>it was looking like Joe Schilling was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to probably win.</v>

779
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:13.640
<v Speaker 1>So Simon Marcus is going after him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Shelley just uncorked beautiful</v>

780
00:33:13.641 --> 00:33:18.641
<v Speaker 1>right hook that just completely shuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light out on shot outside.</v>

781
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I think if Hbo got Ahold of that and did</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 24,</v>

782
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:24.490
<v Speaker 1>seven day honey Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me more than amy,</v>

783
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:25.363
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do,</v>

784
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 1>if they do a 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

785
00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:27.500
<v Speaker 1>I will buy anything.</v>

786
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know the two Mexican boxers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm so invested.</v>

787
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:31.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

788
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I cannot wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

789
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 1>they do a better job than anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could smell the tacos and hear the</v>

790
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 1>music and you feel whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he going to warm to when they get</v>

791
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:41.390
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those things,</v>

792
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.280
<v Speaker 1>they do it the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one does it better than him.</v>

793
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what else they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

794
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:46.370
<v Speaker 1>That I like when they do that thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

795
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

796
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the face offs with less Kellerman yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With Max will they sit across the table</v>

797
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 1>and they both talk about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough if they don't speak English</v>

798
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:58.070
<v Speaker 1>though cause a delay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit like with Canelo</v>

799
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 1>with Canelo and Amir Khan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching like,</v>

800
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:01.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

801
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 1>You can see his air piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little tough.</v>

802
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 1>How much English is can no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

807
00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 1>They all want to come over here for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

808
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:14.810
<v Speaker 1>I would think you would just learn a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of English.</v>

809
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Nothing makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you want,</v>

810
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get big brands over here.</v>

811
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Those shows though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a showtime has those ones they did</v>

812
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 1>for mayweather's fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they call them?</v>

813
00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:25.560
<v Speaker 1>All access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

814
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

815
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.740
<v Speaker 1>those are big men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're good,</v>

816
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 1>but they're just not the same as it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the original 24 sevens.</v>

817
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can fuck with a 20 verse seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ufc has done some pretty God damn good</v>

818
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:36.470
<v Speaker 1>ones embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're good.</v>

819
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 1>They're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one on when cowboy fought,</v>

820
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm Rafael dos Anjos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

821
00:34:41.691 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 1>they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like,</v>

822
00:34:42.921 --> 00:34:43.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the run went there.</v>

823
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you man.</v>

824
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 1>You're bat shit crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been an entry on 20.7 what do you</v>

825
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:51.160
<v Speaker 1>think they got the idea and that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice and leaf is elite.</v>

826
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Shriver's</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's steal that guy and bring him the</v>

827
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

828
00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Who Do they use for the EOC voice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

829
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Liev Schreiber guys.</v>

830
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Weird because you don't recognize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his voice because his voice is</v>

831
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.610
<v Speaker 1>somewhat in distinctive in some weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

832
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.710
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just like Liam Neeson.</v>

833
00:35:09.711 --> 00:35:12.470
<v Speaker 1>If Liam Neeson was doing a voiceover for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

834
00:35:12.471 --> 00:35:15.710
<v Speaker 1>you would know it's Liam Neeson and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would kind of be distracting.</v>

835
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with Liev Schreiber,</v>

836
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:18.531
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

837
00:35:18.531 --> 00:35:22.070
<v Speaker 1>this guy is smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fuck like God damn it's it.</v>

838
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 1>It's how you get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For that guy,</v>

839
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I would literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know him.</v>

840
00:35:25.431 --> 00:35:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I do anything for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

841
00:35:26.861 --> 00:35:29.180
<v Speaker 1>That's all he'd get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He smooth.</v>

842
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean UFC could get someone else.</v>

843
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Well if you like a Morgan Freeman would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

844
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that brings up the thing that's going on</v>

845
00:35:36.381 --> 00:35:37.560
<v Speaker 1>this week with Mcgregor.</v>

846
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got caught off guard last episode.</v>

847
00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I were talking and just out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere,</v>

848
00:35:43.171 --> 00:35:45.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just breaking news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jamie brought it up to conor,</v>

849
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:48.330
<v Speaker 1>announced his retirement and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was trawling and I had the</v>

850
00:35:48.331 --> 00:35:49.950
<v Speaker 1>exact same reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

851
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.060
<v Speaker 1>he's trolling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking around.</v>

852
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:52.820
<v Speaker 1>It's all weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't,</v>

853
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.850
<v Speaker 1>he'd be more eloquent than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be,</v>

854
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.790
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he blew it up,</v>

855
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.240
<v Speaker 1>put it out better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

856
00:35:58.241 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 1>And then the news started coming out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also started thinking,</v>

857
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

858
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe something happened in training or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was because of that guy that</v>

859
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:10.170
<v Speaker 1>died recently and people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

860
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.380
<v Speaker 1>they were shocked that I didn't know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>full details and the guy's dad,</v>

861
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.200
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with things like this,</v>

862
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:16.741
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

863
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:20.010
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unavoidable.</v>

864
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.890
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of risk</v>

865
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.650
<v Speaker 1>involved in any extreme sport.</v>

866
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Plus that's the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

867
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

868
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is like seeing mad at peanut butter</v>

869
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:32.430
<v Speaker 1>when someone dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

870
00:36:32.431 --> 00:36:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm still gonna need peanut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

871
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 1>it is exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was waiting for all the details</v>

872
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:37.290
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they've done an autopsy</v>

873
00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:38.610
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think they know.</v>

874
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and I,</v>

875
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that with connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if this is,</v>

876
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's sharing too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

877
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.270
<v Speaker 1>When Khan and I had lunch together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just talked to and he kept bringing up</v>

878
00:36:50.271 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 1>as a reoccurring theme when we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

879
00:36:52.051 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media man,</v>

880
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:55.320
<v Speaker 1>like for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a beast.</v>

881
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.030
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've done interviews before,</v>

882
00:36:57.031 --> 00:36:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

883
00:36:58.351 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not a guy where when any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters sit down and do an interview,</v>

884
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.930
<v Speaker 1>they're really not selling the fight.</v>

885
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.180
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about th their camp and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing the same thing over and</v>

886
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:08.370
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connor's up fucking master that we've</v>

887
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:11.670
<v Speaker 1>never seen do it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's coming up with original content</v>

888
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.930
<v Speaker 1>nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on,</v>

889
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>

890
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.200
<v Speaker 1>when he came on our podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

891
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was done.</v>

892
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 1>He did the whole car wash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was exhausted and we came down.</v>

893
00:37:20.641 --> 00:37:23.820
<v Speaker 1>You could tell him he was thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just start spitting out gold.</v>

894
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 1>He's just a beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

895
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.010
<v Speaker 1>So to have that guy fly around the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do all this shit,</v>

896
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

897
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:33.810
<v Speaker 1>we got to remember this is a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the wwe.</v>

898
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 1>So to keep putting on the spectacle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's similar to wwe at some point</v>

899
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:39.264
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

900
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 1>what these guys do is it's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

901
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.610
<v Speaker 1>we're in the HERP business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to focus man.</v>

902
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And I just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think connor's to blame too,</v>

903
00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to blame.</v>

904
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I think both of them just need to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if connor before it's bad</v>

905
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:54.330
<v Speaker 1>planning on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad planning on Dana,</v>

906
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.660
<v Speaker 1>if he just went to listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sold this flight more than anyone.</v>

907
00:37:57.661 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is nuts.</v>

908
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I lose this next fight,</v>

909
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm screwed though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A problem is it sets a precedent.</v>

910
00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm looking at it from a,</v>

911
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:06.990
<v Speaker 1>as a businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was,</v>

912
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.550
<v Speaker 1>if I was a businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend,</v>

913
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.360
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

914
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I would say this sets a precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't let someone decide what press</v>

915
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:15.150
<v Speaker 1>they do and press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do like you have an</v>

916
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:20.070
<v Speaker 1>obligation to fulfill certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities like with the media for</v>

917
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:20.760
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

918
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 1>like create hype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the question is,</v>

919
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:27.770
<v Speaker 1>but the question is like when do those</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities move into like a purely</v>

920
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:33.120
<v Speaker 1>digital realm and when do those</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities only in showing up</v>

921
00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically old school going places.</v>

922
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Because like there's nothing wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the occasional press conference,</v>

923
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

924
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.690
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also you can accomplish way more</v>

925
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:46.120
<v Speaker 3>with a few fucking viral videos than you</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever could.</v>

926
00:38:46.121 --> 00:38:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Going to some weird interview with two</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that aren't mma fans.</v>

927
00:38:50.711 --> 00:38:53.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think he made a really good point</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that doing this fucking these</v>

928
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 3>morning shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make them go do where you know,</v>

929
00:38:56.831 --> 00:39:00.040
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows who the guy is or the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't give a shit about MNA.</v>

930
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

931
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.070
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to talk to them the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk to him or I want to</v>

932
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 3>talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when I'm talking to connor like</v>

933
00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 3>before a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to find out what's going on</v>

934
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.890
<v Speaker 3>in the head of a guy who's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>engage.</v>

935
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 3>One of the most exciting things that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to see all year.</v>

936
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going on a morning show</v>

937
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.650
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

938
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.020
<v Speaker 3>How about that cauliflower?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

939
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:18.640
<v Speaker 3>How'd you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up.</v>

940
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:23.170
<v Speaker 3>But also I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but congress is a guy where he's crossed</v>

941
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:25.300
<v Speaker 3>over into pop culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such a big star now.</v>

942
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 3>A tweet from him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll hype the fight if I guarantee if</v>

943
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:31.090
<v Speaker 3>connor and Dana had conversation and Dan</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

944
00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:32.710
<v Speaker 3>all right man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand it's a big fight cause you</v>

945
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:34.450
<v Speaker 3>gotta remember if you were to lose this</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

946
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 3>now you're losing your golden boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest star by far by far.</v>

947
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he could just focus,</v>

948
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 3>let's just let him focus a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why I also feel like the magnitude of</v>

949
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:47.800
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dilemma that's in front of him and</v>

950
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Nate Diaz is also very apparent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a guy you can have ass.</v>

951
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:56.670
<v Speaker 3>And even if you are 100% ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've never even fought him at 100% Oh,</v>

952
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.450
<v Speaker 3>you fought him when he had 11 days.</v>

953
00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Notice what he'd been drinking in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>

954
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean he poses typical matchup man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you want to fly him on a plane.</v>

955
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Did anyone think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

956
00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.880
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking at them with three</v>
<v Speaker 3>months away though,</v>

957
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.120
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still connor's exhausted man from</v>

958
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 3>doing all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>

959
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see some fighters go,</v>

960
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.290
<v Speaker 3>it's our obligation to do these press</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious slowly roll homie.</v>

961
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.450
<v Speaker 3>You're not conor Mcgregor press</v>
<v Speaker 3>conference.</v>

962
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big difference.</v>

963
00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.180
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

964
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.650
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost to him.</v>

965
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:29.350
<v Speaker 3>You're talking millions and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the UFC,</v>

966
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 3>if I'm looking at as a businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

967
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right man.</v>

968
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.790
<v Speaker 3>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna do a press conference,</v>

969
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:36.340
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to come to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did anyone think to do that?</v>

970
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

971
00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:40.750
<v Speaker 3>connor is one of the most charismatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

972
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 3>seriously of all time in all sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No doubt about it.</v>

973
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is a fucking marketing machine.</v>

974
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just the quotes and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>style.</v>

975
00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:51.730
<v Speaker 3>His tweet player interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his tweet,</v>

976
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.460

<v Speaker 3>Is the biggest tweet by an athlete this</v>

977
00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.890
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beat Kobie Bryant's retirement tweet and</v>

978
00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:59.200
<v Speaker 3>you want me to go do a fucking interview</v>
<v Speaker 3>for espn?</v>

979
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know the sport.</v>

980
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch ESPN every morning.</v>

981
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.840
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about Lebron James The</v>
<v Speaker 3>playoff game tonight.</v>

982
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.480
<v Speaker 3>They interrupted this shit with breaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>news cub out.</v>

983
00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Connor's not retiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how big he is now.</v>

984
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:14.770
<v Speaker 3>The PR team at UFC could not get this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could not get this sort of</v>

985
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:16.000
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if they want to.</v>

986
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:17.880
<v Speaker 3>Connor can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different age,</v>

987
00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:19.340
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those old interviews,</v>

988
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.140
<v Speaker 3>that old press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a legit fucking superstar man</v>

989
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.080
<v Speaker 3>who makes more money than anyone dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gates totally forgot what I was gonna</v>

990
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.620
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Series points.</v>

991
00:41:28.621 --> 00:41:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Sorry brother.</v>

992
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.780
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I just go now what you need</v>

993
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.381
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>

994
00:41:32.381 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 3>you have all good points are all valid</v>
<v Speaker 3>points and I get this contracts,</v>

995
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I get stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there has to be where you can't have</v>

996
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:40.040
<v Speaker 3>a pissing contest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say,</v>

997
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:41.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to run it like a business</v>

998
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:42.320
<v Speaker 3>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then not this time.</v>

999
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:46.280
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's good for the company with</v>
<v Speaker 3>conor Mcgregor and this big of a fight.</v>

1000
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.040
<v Speaker 3>If he wins this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how much more money you're</v>

1001
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:51.260
<v Speaker 3>gonna make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the fucking press conference.</v>

1002
00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.490
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're absolutely right that he's won</v>

1003
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:58.510
<v Speaker 3>the most charismatic guys of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Nate Diaz right now is God damn</v>

1004
00:41:58.971 --> 00:42:00.640
<v Speaker 3>gigantic and I think we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>reel.</v>

1005
00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 3>It was not as big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of close,</v>

1006
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 3>but he's God damn gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's huge.</v>

1007
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.390
<v Speaker 3>And see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of that fight.</v>

1008
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Part of that fight is that connor is</v>
<v Speaker 3>also fighting another mercurial</v>

1009
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 3>superstar character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1010
00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Especially now after the first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree Joe,</v>

1011
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:20.840
<v Speaker 3>but let's say connor doesn't fight at</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC 200 and uh,</v>

1012
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 3>let's say nate fights woodley or Robbie</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawler.</v>

1013
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Let me know how this rating scale fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one seven animals.</v>

1014
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Let's say at one 55,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say fights.</v>

1015
00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Dos Anjos let me know how those ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because here's where it won't be as</v>

1016
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:35.030
<v Speaker 3>close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might even be a quarter of it.</v>

1017
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be close.</v>

1018
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the power sense though.</v>

1019
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.950
<v Speaker 3>Maybe half half makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but half would still be pretty</v>

1020
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:44.020
<v Speaker 3>spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1021
00:42:44.021 --> 00:42:46.810
<v Speaker 3>at not even half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being generous when he left.</v>

1022
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Now he's the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt about it.</v>

1023
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 3>He's the Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Well who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all speculation.</v>

1025
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:55.340
<v Speaker 3>But here's what's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They offered the fight apparently to</v>

1026
00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:57.680
<v Speaker 3>normal go madoff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can't take it because it's only</v>

1027
00:42:57.681 --> 00:43:00.630
<v Speaker 3>four days after Ramadan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1028
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.340
<v Speaker 3>So he's very religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he does that whole fascinating.</v>

1029
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:07.280
<v Speaker 3>I had a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Concow alelee from back in</v>

1030
00:43:07.281 --> 00:43:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to do that shit.</v>

1031
00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.880
<v Speaker 3>He would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1032
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 3>he would fast when he was training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

1033
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:16.720
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1034
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.100
<v Speaker 3>you have certain rules where you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to eat any what?</v>

1035
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.740
<v Speaker 3>How's it go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to eat anything or</v>

1036
00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:23.360
<v Speaker 3>drink any sun up sun down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1037
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1038
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't,</v>

1039
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.640
<v Speaker 3>there's no food or water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something Sunday,</v>

1040
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.900
<v Speaker 3>crazy at like 6:00 PM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this feast,</v>

1041
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can weaken you and so he'd be upset.</v>

1042
00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:34.670
<v Speaker 3>It would have a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a real problem if you had a</v>

1043
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four or five rounds.</v>

1044
00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.940
<v Speaker 3>I get it and I would love to see that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1045
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Habibi Nigga Murdoch verse Nate Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such a beast,</v>

1046
00:43:42.651 --> 00:43:43.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's phenomenal.</v>

1047
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To us who are balls deep in the UFC</v>

1048
00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:47.900
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1049
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.561
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1050
00:43:48.561 --> 00:43:50.300
<v Speaker 3>ESPN covering that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1051
00:43:50.301 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 3>you should start a promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at you.</v>

1052
00:43:51.801 --> 00:43:52.790
<v Speaker 3>You're a goddamn promoter.</v>

1053
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 3>You know how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1054
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I've been through it and when I see a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like conor comes in once in a</v>

1055
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:58.840
<v Speaker 3>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think there'd be another conor</v>

1056
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're bat shit crazy.</v>

1057
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.540
<v Speaker 3>I think when we invest in arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC,</v>

1058
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:03.830
<v Speaker 3>the keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're crazy.</v>

1059
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I think conor is a special dude and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's a few other,</v>

1060
00:44:07.221 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I think Brock Lesnar was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Rhonda has theirs.</v>

1061
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 3>There's very few players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that this is a calculated</v>

1062
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:18.350
<v Speaker 3>gamble based on not thinking he has</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough time to prepare for nate?</v>

1063
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think some possible impulses is</v>

1064
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just a matter of digging your</v>

1065
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 3>heels into the ground and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

1066
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.200
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I can do this much proud</v>
<v Speaker 3>of percent.</v>

1067
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I think he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1068
00:44:30.171 --> 00:44:31.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want on this world tour?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Can I please get ready for this?</v>

1070
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not the wwe man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>

1071
00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:36.721
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask,</v>

1072
00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:40.500

<v Speaker 3>know you see you.</v>

1073
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:42.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Lebron,</v>

1074
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.750
<v Speaker 3>any of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these superstars in Sports Rinaldo gone.</v>

1075
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:48.530
<v Speaker 3>These world tours not get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sell the fight when like,</v>

1076
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 3>and put my social media will cover way</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than this.</v>

1077
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Go Fuck Yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we have no one fighting like he,</v>

1078
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.860
<v Speaker 3>he can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say anything.</v>

1079
00:44:55.861 --> 00:44:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got pulled from the car.</v>

1080
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:01.350
<v Speaker 3>So more is not better is a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount,</v>

1081
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.930
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do well at a certain amount.</v>

1082
00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 3>You're doing it for the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing it for the conor</v>

1083
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:08.030
<v Speaker 3>mcgregor brand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing for the fighters brand.</v>

1084
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:11.130
<v Speaker 3>You think by him going to espn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna get more followers.</v>

1085
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Would you think that there's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain consideration that</v>

1086
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:18.840
<v Speaker 3>looked like it looks good to have file a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters show up on espn.</v>

1087
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.050
<v Speaker 3>He's been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on,</v>

1088
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 3>he's on breaking news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1089
00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:21.980
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1090
00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.970
<v Speaker 3>he's been doing it maybe the week</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1091
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:26.220
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when he wants to prepare for a camp</v>

1092
00:45:26.221 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 3>and you have a guy of his magnitude</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming off a loss and he's like,</v>

1093
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think doing all this press and</v>

1094
00:45:32.281 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff has fucked with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities to be a fight.</v>

1095
00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.960
<v Speaker 3>I need to get back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you please let me focus?</v>

1096
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.280
<v Speaker 3>It makes it very hype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fight.</v>

1097
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 3>It totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you can't have exceptions.</v>

1098
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.311
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1099
00:45:41.311 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can cause you do make exceptions</v>

1100
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.980
<v Speaker 3>because you have certain people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC roster where they can't,</v>

1101
00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:48.540
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where they pick and choose when they</v>

1102
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:50.340
<v Speaker 3>fight or who they fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are exceptions.</v>

1103
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's another thing to take into</v>

1104
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:54.360
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most important things that</v>

1105
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:56.610
<v Speaker 3>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any athlete does while they're in</v>

1106
00:45:56.611 --> 00:45:58.080
<v Speaker 3>training is get proper rest.</v>

1107
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most important things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what fucks up when you go traveling</v>

1108
00:46:02.311 --> 00:46:03.600
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your rest.</v>

1109
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.790
<v Speaker 3>So number one thing that wrecks you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1110
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:07.400
<v Speaker 3>let me think how much you travel too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1111
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.240
<v Speaker 3>I just flew in from Seattle this</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

1112
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I got up at five this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flew here,</v>

1113
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.220
<v Speaker 3>got right off the plane and drove right</v>
<v Speaker 3>in here.</v>

1114
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1115
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.110
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1116
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:17.400
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body gets a,</v>

1117
00:46:17.401 --> 00:46:19.650
<v Speaker 3>your immune system gets jack from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm good.</v>

1118
00:46:19.651 --> 00:46:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I just think of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is great for the sports,</v>

1119
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.720
<v Speaker 3>a good discussion to have because now</v>
<v Speaker 3>future superstars will say,</v>

1120
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:25.531
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only doing this,</v>

1121
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:27.540
<v Speaker 3>may interviews this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this much before the fight.</v>

1122
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe when all this and to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's a debate.</v>

1123
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.490
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the debate could be held as to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1124
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.010
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the amount that you need to do</v>

1125
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:37.860
<v Speaker 3>once the amount that you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1126
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:40.050
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you have it set up and what would</v>

1127
00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:42.120
<v Speaker 3>be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be the best way for the</v>

1128
00:46:42.121 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 3>performance of the athlete?</v>

1129
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.510
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consideration of their,</v>

1130
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their time and focus to put 100% effort</v>

1131
00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:52.410
<v Speaker 3>into something and not leave anything on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the table because they really weren't</v>

1132
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 3>rested enough cause we were or</v>
<v Speaker 3>distracted too much.</v>

1133
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause they're doing too much press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But who's it,</v>

1134
00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:00.660
<v Speaker 3>who's it helping the end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The UFC and Dana white paper view.</v>

1135
00:47:00.661 --> 00:47:03.450
<v Speaker 3>If they have pay per view buys and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a percentage of the buys and it</v>

1136
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.010
<v Speaker 3>helps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it helps everyone.</v>

1137
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 3>But if the fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it should be a direct,</v>

1138
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a direct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a fighter as a percentage of pay per</v>

1139
00:47:09.841 --> 00:47:11.340
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which guy like conor does.</v>

1140
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more pay paper view deals or maybe</v>

1141
00:47:14.191 --> 00:47:17.880
<v Speaker 3>he does it a title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what his deal is.</v>

1142
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.770
<v Speaker 3>So I'm talking about the for you buys</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1143
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I would have smacked her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1144
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I would shown yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1145
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:26.700
<v Speaker 3>but so the more press he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more things get sold,</v>

1146
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 3>the more money he makes.</v>

1147
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:32.980
<v Speaker 3>But in his point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tweets and things that he's doing</v>

1148
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 3>right now are getting more attention to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it than any of these stupid interview</v>

1149
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 3>going to pay for this kind of publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't argue with that.</v>

1150
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the question is like where?</v>

1151
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1152
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:49.740
<v Speaker 3>there should be like a contract and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>contract should state from x to y,</v>

1153
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick a date and time.</v>

1154
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I would be left alone if you sought or</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to get me.</v>

1155
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 3>I'll be up in Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freezing my dick off thrown sidekicks,</v>

1156
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 3>come get me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

1157
00:47:59.021 --> 00:48:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I think this whole thing is a misspeak</v>
<v Speaker 3>miscommunication.</v>

1158
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 3>I see Dana side and I see connor side</v>
<v Speaker 3>right as a fight.</v>

1159
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I definitely see connor side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a miscommunication.</v>

1160
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:09.550
<v Speaker 3>I think if before all this came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if conner was like,</v>

1161
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:10.920
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be doing all this fucking,</v>

1162
00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you have Dana was sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1163
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 3>There would be no miscommunication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

1164
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he would agree that it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a miscue communication.</v>

1165
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 3>I think he would say the connor just</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to do the press.</v>

1166
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 3>And I just want to say what you gotta do</v>
<v Speaker 3>the press.</v>

1167
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 3>And to me that's a miscommunication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But can I get some miscommunications,</v>

1168
00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:27.640
<v Speaker 3>a disagreement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1169
00:48:27.641 --> 00:48:31.000
<v Speaker 3>I disagree because I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is why Joe,</v>

1170
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 3>because I think after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

1171
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.470
<v Speaker 3>even though we fought Aldo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he expressed,</v>

1172
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:35.931
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need,</v>

1173
00:48:35.931 --> 00:48:37.840
<v Speaker 3>she'll on these interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1174
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.740
<v Speaker 3>he beats a nate diaz or he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nate does again.</v>

1175
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:42.161
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1176
00:48:42.161 --> 00:48:44.890
<v Speaker 3>this fucking press is killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's been voice in it.</v>

1177
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if his camp has had the</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion with Dana,</v>

1178
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.230
<v Speaker 3>but at some point maybe they haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1179
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this is totally speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would say this communication down and</v>

1180
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:55.490
<v Speaker 3>come up with a schedule.</v>

1181
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Like you've got to leave me alone for</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks,</v>

1182
00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.110
<v Speaker 3>but eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what if,</v>

1183
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.140
<v Speaker 3>what if Dana and connor had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation right now,</v>

1184
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.960
<v Speaker 3>man to man and Congos listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'll do,</v>

1185
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.540
<v Speaker 3>I'll film videos every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do this,</v>

1186
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after my practices.</v>

1187
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.230
<v Speaker 3>I'll put all this social media out for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys.</v>

1188
00:49:11.231 --> 00:49:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Craig this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one has the pull that I do and I can</v>

1189
00:49:14.441 --> 00:49:16.930
<v Speaker 3>create this many views for millions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions.</v>

1190
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 3>No other fighter can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't pay me for it.</v>

1191
00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Just don't make me travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think Dana and the USC would</v>

1192
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:23.280
<v Speaker 3>agree to any of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

1193
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.210
<v Speaker 3>I bet they'd be open to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1194
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Kevin Hart,</v>

1195
00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:28.660
<v Speaker 3>he was like one of the biggest stars in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

1196
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1197
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.910
<v Speaker 3>comedians ever as far as like sales and</v>
<v Speaker 3>volume,</v>

1198
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 3>like not eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one even close.</v>

1199
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he crushes it.</v>

1200
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.080
<v Speaker 3>He sells out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what'd he say?</v>

1201
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Like 50,000 dateless soldier field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts.</v>

1202
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not important.</v>

1203
00:49:43.961 --> 00:49:46.690
<v Speaker 3>What's important is he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1204
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.560
<v Speaker 3>he's like gigantic on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super active,</v>

1205
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.680
<v Speaker 3>and he does it all himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if he does a movie,</v>

1206
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 3>like he'll do a movie and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh great,</v>

1207
00:49:56.381 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 3>and you can use your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1208
00:49:57.911 --> 00:50:02.460
<v Speaker 3>5.8 million social media followers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1209
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 3>it'll boost up the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>

1210
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:04.271
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1211
00:50:04.271 --> 00:50:04.631
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1212
00:50:04.631 --> 00:50:06.070
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's mine.</v>

1213
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.270
<v Speaker 3>That's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1214
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.390
<v Speaker 3>if you want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1215
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.060
<v Speaker 3>And we've got to talk about that first</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

1216
00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.430
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like that.</v>

1217
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.460
<v Speaker 3>All the people that were in those movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>meetings must be like,</v>

1218
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then the rock goes,</v>

1219
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1220
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:23.881
<v Speaker 3>because there's a giant difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between a guy like the rock,</v>

1221
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:29.030
<v Speaker 3>like what he can do to sell a movie with</v>
<v Speaker 3>media and the average person,</v>

1222
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 3>the average actor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>

1223
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.690
<v Speaker 3>he's constantly on it.</v>

1224
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 3>He has a dedicated loyal fan base</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's really funny and self</v>

1225
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:38.390
<v Speaker 3>deprecating follows us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>works hard.</v>

1226
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:40.130
<v Speaker 3>So he's showing pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alarm clock,</v>

1227
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:43.550
<v Speaker 3>it says like four 15 in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's up there fucking doing dead lifts.</v>

1228
00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 3>He's an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1229
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 3>So a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a business on the side,</v>

1230
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.820
<v Speaker 3>that's his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's his,</v>

1231
00:50:49.821 --> 00:50:54.821
<v Speaker 3>like he's got a hype business as well as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a business to promote himself,</v>

1232
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:58.040
<v Speaker 3>but he can also hype things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1233
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:01.200
<v Speaker 3>he's not a promotion once he gets some</v>
<v Speaker 3>money can be hard.</v>

1234
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 3>When he does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's got it worked.</v>

1235
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:05.870
<v Speaker 3>It was talking about it and it's got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work to the movies now.</v>

1236
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.651
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1237
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 3>if you want a part of the Kevin Hart</v>
<v Speaker 3>money machine that I put together,</v>

1238
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.550
<v Speaker 3>well you gotta give me something bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she can't be any different.</v>

1239
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.240
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right in that respect as as,</v>

1240
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.190
<v Speaker 3>as a superstar now not by fiber can pull</v>
<v Speaker 3>that card.</v>

1241
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 3>You legitimately have to be able to sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>out giant stadiums and be a superstar.</v>

1242
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he certainly can,</v>

1243
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.890
<v Speaker 3>especially if you give them the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>match ups,</v>

1244
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you give connor the right match up at</v>

1245
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:35.051
<v Speaker 3>one 45 like I think honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm excited about this nate diaz</v>

1246
00:51:35.421 --> 00:51:38.450
<v Speaker 3>fight cause I like watching them fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like watching Nate Diaz fight.</v>

1247
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.100
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I love the attention he's getting.</v>

1248
00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:42.470
<v Speaker 3>But if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was in connor's camp,</v>

1249
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:45.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean I understand that he's obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wants to get right back at it.</v>

1250
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:51.010
<v Speaker 3>I would say go fight Frankie Edgar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go fight Max Holloway.</v>

1251
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Have a rematch of Max Holloway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit would be epic.</v>

1252
00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I if all doe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever Aldo does,</v>

1253
00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they mix it all up.</v>

1254
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Fight a rematch with all dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those been talking mad shit about</v>

1255
00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:02.450
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1256
00:52:02.451 --> 00:52:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I think although genuine and genuinely</v>
<v Speaker 3>believes that he fucked up and if he</v>

1257
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:08.810
<v Speaker 3>gets a hold of this dude this time he</v>
<v Speaker 3>get punished them,</v>

1258
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 3>which is awesome.</v>

1259
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Fight and awesome stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see it.</v>

1260
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I want to see homeowners can't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sites are still gonna be there if he</v>

1261
00:52:14.601 --> 00:52:16.700
<v Speaker 3>loses nate Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it takes some of the,</v>

1262
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot of the star power already</v>
<v Speaker 3>got taken away.</v>

1263
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Too much of a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just way too much power got taken</v>

1264
00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that second fight,</v>

1265
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:25.550
<v Speaker 3>not 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not 100%,</v>

1266
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:27.810
<v Speaker 3>he's still the biggest draw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was uh,</v>

1267
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:30.720
<v Speaker 3>an assassin before that fight on two</v>
<v Speaker 3>span.</v>

1268
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.440
<v Speaker 3>There was many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether s there was something going on,</v>

1269
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 3>like when he flatlined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although with one punch and then did it,</v>

1270
00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 3>like it was nothing and smiled and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was talking to him in the</v>

1271
00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:40.650
<v Speaker 3>interview and he's just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1272
00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.680
<v Speaker 3>no power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1273
00:52:42.681 --> 00:52:44.350
<v Speaker 3>just put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it right where it's the nurse,</v>

1274
00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.320
<v Speaker 3>anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1275
00:52:45.321 --> 00:52:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean the way he gobbled up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure and the way he controlled the</v>

1276
00:52:49.011 --> 00:52:49.844
<v Speaker 3>shit talking.</v>

1277
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:50.780
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1278
00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never had a guy of his</v>

1279
00:52:52.701 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Speaker 3>capabilities and his mass appeal goat</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1280
00:52:55.971 --> 00:52:58.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do this like everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>else has jumped through these hoops.</v>

1281
00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:00.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to fucking train,</v>

1282
00:53:00.381 --> 00:53:01.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>

1283
00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm already big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never had a guy really do this.</v>

1284
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:07.310
<v Speaker 3>He's also a guy where I think if he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to,</v>

1285
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.980
<v Speaker 3>if he was involved with the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say Dana,</v>

1286
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 3>which would never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut Goes,</v>

1287
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 3>go do what the fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sick.</v>

1288
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:15.650
<v Speaker 3>You go do what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could sell out a giant arena in</v>

1289
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Dublin against dot 5,000 every Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how powerful he is.</v>

1290
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think literally making</v>
<v Speaker 3>just make more and more money.</v>

1291
00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that because I think</v>

1292
00:53:23.661 --> 00:53:26.850
<v Speaker 3>part of the excitement about was</v>
<v Speaker 3>building up to that Aldo fight.</v>

1293
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.930
<v Speaker 3>That was part of the man who would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>king story was that he was going to</v>

1294
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 3>fight the longtime king and when he flat</v>
<v Speaker 3>lined the longtime king,</v>

1295
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.890
<v Speaker 3>he reached this level of legendary</v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity.</v>

1296
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 3>There does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens once in a hundred generations</v>

1297
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:43.700
<v Speaker 3>when it comes with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>

1298
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.840
<v Speaker 3>there's this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this boom,</v>

1299
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 3>how many guys reached that moment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when he flatlined Alto with one</v>

1300
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:53.280
<v Speaker 3>punch and then it was in 13 seconds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole world was like,</v>

1301
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.190
<v Speaker 3>he fucking did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The answer is none did it?</v>

1302
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>

1303
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was epic.</v>

1304
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:03.390
<v Speaker 3>But the lustre gets taken off by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nate Diaz fight and if he loses to nate</v>

1305
00:54:03.391 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a very good point that,</v>

1306
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't lose because he wasn't given</v>

1307
00:54:08.971 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 3>the right amount of opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to present or to,</v>

1308
00:54:11.941 --> 00:54:13.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to prepare himself because he had to do</v>

1309
00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:14.970
<v Speaker 3>all this prep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like right now,</v>

1310
00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:18.270
<v Speaker 3>the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg Fan base and guys hugging his nuts,</v>

1311
00:54:18.271 --> 00:54:20.520
<v Speaker 3>which I might be one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1312
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going well you know nate Diaz,</v>

1313
00:54:22.861 --> 00:54:25.350
<v Speaker 3>it's way bigger and he kind of caught</v>
<v Speaker 3>him off guard.</v>

1314
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that good and there's a little</v>

1315
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:28.440
<v Speaker 3>asterisk I guess if you're this conor</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

1316
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:33.000
<v Speaker 3>well now if he loses again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no more excuses because the fuck</v>

1317
00:54:33.001 --> 00:54:35.220
<v Speaker 3>there's no asterik.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nate had 11 nights.</v>

<v Speaker 3>length and deceptive boxing skills.</v>

1361
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think it was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they put a prison there.</v>

1362
00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Cause they didn't think people could</v>
<v Speaker 1>swim.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker is a stoner and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

<v Speaker 1>money is George Saint Pierre Grc pr.</v>

1370

00:57:06.491 --> 00:57:08.740
<v Speaker 1>go through a camp and decide whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not he could do it.</v>

1374
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:10.090
<v Speaker 1>At the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done it.</v>

1375
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.340

<v Speaker 1>the prep camp?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know he's been training a shit load</v>

1379
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.210
<v Speaker 1>and I know he doesn't care about belts</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything.</v>

1380
00:57:20.211 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to take the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the holdup is?</v>

1381
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Why Reebok?</v>

1382
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:26.600
<v Speaker 1>That's awful.</v>

1383
00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:27.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sponsored by under armour.</v>

1385
00:57:30.211 --> 00:57:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And then how many fights do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Reebok's and were like,</v>

00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm George Saint Pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's saying either the USC has to</v>

1390
00:57:40.501 --> 00:57:43.620
<v Speaker 1>make up for it in his purse or reebok</v>
<v Speaker 1>has make up for it.</v>

1391
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.660
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a money thing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1392
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:48.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what you hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the inside scoop?</v>

1393
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we just scooped a shit out of</v>

1394
00:57:50.851 --> 00:57:52.470
<v Speaker 1>this hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I hear.</v>

1395
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been hearing rumblings of</v>

1396
00:57:54.931 --> 00:57:57.180
<v Speaker 1>negotiations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1397
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things you don't want</v>

1398
00:57:59.161 --> 00:58:00.600
<v Speaker 1>to hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to just wait.</v>

1399
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.030
<v Speaker 1>But also I was the only guy you can save</v>
<v Speaker 1>the card.</v>

1400
00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Well he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would most certainly save the card.</v>

1401
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1402
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:12.480
<v Speaker 1>it would be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would be him and connor.</v>

1403
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's fucking that Tammy Connor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madison Square Garden to what you would,</v>

1404
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.690
<v Speaker 1>it was not enough seats there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1405
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:24.830
<v Speaker 1>there'd be full of just fucking GSP</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus it looked like the Oscars is just</v>

1406
00:58:24.831 --> 00:58:27.750
<v Speaker 1>be as crowded full of celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regular folk can afford the tickets,</v>

1407
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:32.750
<v Speaker 1>especially if you get angry GSP GSP that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to punish Bj Penn GSP.</v>

1408
00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really tough to bring him</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1409
00:58:35.631 --> 00:58:38.760
<v Speaker 1>But you didn't like about rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1412
00:58:40.911 --> 00:58:45.140
<v Speaker 1>GSP was one of the weirder guys because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was such a nice guy.</v>

1413
00:58:45.141 --> 00:58:47.930
<v Speaker 1>At all times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when guys fucked with him,</v>

1414
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.380
<v Speaker 1>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this switch that would go off in that</v>

1415
00:58:51.381 --> 00:58:55.280
<v Speaker 1>head and he would go on seek and destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode and he was so good at it.</v>

1416
00:58:55.281 --> 00:58:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fucked up,</v>

1417
00:58:56.181 --> 00:58:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Bj fucked up Fitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1418
00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.140
<v Speaker 1>you wash those fights and you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is arguably the greatest</v>

1419
00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:04.190
<v Speaker 1>welterweight of all time.</v>

1420
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mean his ability to mix up the</v>

1421
00:59:07.731 --> 00:59:10.250
<v Speaker 1>strikes and the takedowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never knew what the fuck was going</v>

1422
00:59:10.251 --> 00:59:11.030
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

1423
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:14.540
<v Speaker 1>his constant victories in a scrambles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:59:14.541 --> 00:59:17.360
<v Speaker 1>and the Bj fight to where he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing Bj,</v>

1425
00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.280
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to punish him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he,</v>

1426
00:59:19.281 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 1>when he beat him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't stop them and then walked over</v>

1427
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 1>to the wall and fucking punched it</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

1428

<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1438
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:52.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm assuming they're not letting</v>
<v Speaker 1>him cut any corners.</v>

1441
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:57.950
<v Speaker 1>there's no cutting corners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do your skin,</v>

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what frankie can do now.</v>

1489
01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>The new and improved frank and me too</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then although I feel like it's</v>

1490
01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>declined a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the Chad Mendez fight,</v>

1491
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>the second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't look as good as he had looked</v>

1492
01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>in the past and then obviously he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming off of a big loss.</v>

1493
01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>My favorite fighter of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great fight.</v>

1494
01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And Tate versus Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on son.</v>

1495
01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>She's needle mover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1496
01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun one needle mover in my mind.</v>

1497
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>My needle's moving right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might need aligns Moose for tate in my</v>

1498
01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>mind and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1499
01:02:11.591 --> 01:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

1500
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.480
<v Speaker 1>That's more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1501
01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good fight.</v>

1502
01:02:16.281 --> 01:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Nunez is super dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the early rounds.</v>

1503
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She tends to tire a little bit.</v>

1504
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>She tends to tire Lou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She blows it out,</v>

1505
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got some pop.</v>

1506
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You've got a serious right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real dangerous Moy Tai.</v>

1507
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Then you got travis versus cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a motherfucker,</v>

1508
01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>the heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a motherfucker.</v>

1509
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1510
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>The thing to me with cane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like at what point all these</v>

1511
01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>injuries and him come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At what point do we see him age?</v>

1512
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Like we've seen Rashad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1513
01:02:45.101 --> 01:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Come after amenities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rashad doesn't look the same.</v>

1514
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>There's sometimes when guys come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1515
01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same guy anymore.</v>

1516
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>At what point do we see k not come back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true,</v>

1517
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>but keynes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mother fucker,</v>

1518
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>if he does come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

1519
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stylistic wise,</v>

1520
01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Travis Brown's up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker form great takedown</v>

1521
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:03.480
<v Speaker 1>defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously great at striking and he's</v>

1522
01:03:03.481 --> 01:03:06.350
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big boy too.</v>

1523
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good striking long wide base.</v>

1524
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Good footwork and movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

1525
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a good fight to really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think he looked great in the material</v>

1526
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1527
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:20.880
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the best fight for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1528
01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:22.400
<v Speaker 1>but neither was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1529
01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:25.710
<v Speaker 1>they're all osteophyte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a more disappointing fight I</v>

1530
01:03:25.711 --> 01:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>think when he got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 1>But it was also even the trash brown</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1532
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.950
<v Speaker 1>it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even in the mitre owned one,</v>

1533
01:03:31.951 --> 01:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>cause we saw them for longer rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1534
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crazy.</v>

1535
01:03:35.491 --> 01:03:37.170
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a guy like Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1536
01:03:37.171 --> 01:03:39.840
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker to Travis Browne mature on</v>

1537
01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so unfortunate because the AI</v>

1538
01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.273
<v Speaker 1>pokes.</v>

1539
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fucking,</v>

1540
01:03:43.561 --> 01:03:44.970
<v Speaker 1>and that was doing well in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

1541
01:03:44.971 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Then we got poked in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a little tough.</v>

1542
01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>It was bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms. I was horrible the way they handled</v>

1543
01:03:49.381 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked Matt.</v>

1544
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's got a lawsuit,</v>

1545
01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:54.570
<v Speaker 1>doesn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fire suit and you should.</v>

1546
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.030
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just kind of let you know how</v>

1547
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>fight even goes down if they go three</v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds that,</v>

1548
01:03:58.241 --> 01:04:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying Matt with a one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>travis definitely won the fight.</v>

1549
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.030
<v Speaker 1>That was a great fight up until that</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

1550
01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:04.980
<v Speaker 1>But whenever a guy gets poked in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eye,</v>

1551
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.830
<v Speaker 1>like the outcome is marred and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting a monster with one eye,</v>

1552
01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a tough fucking night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>But I tell you why I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>

1554
01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Traps is shot here against cane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's that big of an</v>

1555
01:04:14.911 --> 01:04:17.490
<v Speaker 1>underdog and if he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the odds are but I</v>

1556
01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:19.740
<v Speaker 1>mean travis has that one punch knockout</v>
<v Speaker 1>power knees.</v>

1557
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1558
01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 1>we really don't know how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1559
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:26.100
<v Speaker 1>of a toll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these injuries have taken on cane</v>

1560
01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:29.570
<v Speaker 1>and the time off me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only saw him that one fight with vre</v>

1561
01:04:29.571 --> 01:04:34.530
<v Speaker 1>doom where we blamed it and he did as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well on the lack of training at</v>

1562
01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:36.480
<v Speaker 1>altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes side of my face right now.</v>

1563
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't buy it.</v>

1564
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's we in it.</v>

1565
01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1566
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to his level and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh altitude.</v>

1567
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I got tired cause out dude bitch you</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew for four months when we find out</v>

1568
01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:48.450
<v Speaker 1>that altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's here for his cardio.</v>

1569
01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just overestimated his own cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that Paul?</v>

1570
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone in his camp was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1571
01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:53.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty high up there.</v>

1572
01:04:53.671 --> 01:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>We should probably go where Javier said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was his fault.</v>

1573
01:04:56.011 --> 01:04:57.570
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have forced him to go early.</v>

1574
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:00.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes guys just don't want to leave.</v>

1575
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:01.710
<v Speaker 1>He just got beat by the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1576
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.780
<v Speaker 1>It could be that don't buy that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be that too.</v>

1577
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 1>He definitely looked tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he the greatest of all time,</v>

1578
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.090
<v Speaker 1>100% just had an off night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1579
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:13.170
<v Speaker 1>verdomme is a big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's tall and long and he's striking has</v>

1580
01:05:13.171 --> 01:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>come a long way in his Jujitsu is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best in the business.</v>

1581
01:05:16.531 --> 01:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>He's also browsers up for Cain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to tell his teacher wise,</v>

1582
01:05:19.571 --> 01:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take them,</v>

1583
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:22.121
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take them down.</v>

1584
01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>You got to get strangled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with that.</v>

1585
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>And he's also not going to knock him</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1586
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>So he gets [inaudible] and virgin can</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump to guard,</v>

1587
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:29.460
<v Speaker 1>jump half guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fuck it.</v>

1588
01:05:29.461 --> 01:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible matchup for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1589
01:05:31.601 --> 01:05:32.820
<v Speaker 1>he lost two gears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1590
01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm really bummed out that we didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chance to see the rematch.</v>

1591
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to see that rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to see it after this.</v>

1592
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:39.001
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1593
01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a bit funny nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1594
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a huge,</v>

1595
01:05:42.941 --> 01:05:45.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe huge maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what man,</v>

1596
01:05:45.171 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>when I saw that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough fight for Kane and Steve Bay's a</v>

1597
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.570
<v Speaker 1>tough fight for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1598
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay is gonna fight for doom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough fight for [inaudible].</v>

1599
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay's No fucking joke man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's no joke him and yeah,</v>

1600

1601
01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>that the odds are stacked against them</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying down to Brazil and fighting Berdo</v>

1602
01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odds are stats,</v>

1603
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:06.820
<v Speaker 1>a tough place to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's a geared up dude.</v>

1604
01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:09.490
<v Speaker 1>He's ready to rock and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming off of that big one,</v>

1605
01:06:09.491 --> 01:06:12.130
<v Speaker 1>punch knockout of overeem or of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1606
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Orlowski he looked good in that fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look great,</v>

1607
01:06:14.651 --> 01:06:15.940
<v Speaker 1>you look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he looked angry.</v>

1608
01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.140
<v Speaker 1>He's got momentum behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to seeing and he</v>

1609
01:06:20.141 --> 01:06:22.960
<v Speaker 1>will go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw that in that five round fight</v>

1610
01:06:22.961 --> 01:06:25.630
<v Speaker 1>with Dosantos jds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

1611
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.200
<v Speaker 1>he took junior dos Santos to the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a fun fight.</v>

1612
01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:31.720
<v Speaker 1>That was a wild ass fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight could've went either way.</v>

1613
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.600
<v Speaker 1>It could have went either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that he's right up there and</v>

1614
01:06:34.601 --> 01:06:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1615
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to see you in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but put up that Cardigan because a,</v>

1616
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.110
<v Speaker 1>there was some other shit we weren't to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>

1617
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Look at this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're saucy and Brunson people didn't</v>

1618
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.710
<v Speaker 1>bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your boy hendricks and need to win so</v>

1620
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.760

<v Speaker 1>And that's a tough fight to men.</v>

1621
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Kelvin is a good are becoming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guns blazing cause he lost a magnate</v>

1622

<v Speaker 1>last time and then also hendrix getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped by wonderboy is going to charge</v>

1623
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:03.543
<v Speaker 1>Kelvin up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1626
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.900
<v Speaker 1>he's got excellent footwork and tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>matchup.</v>

1627
01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Real light on his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking johnny comes with his aide game.</v>

1628
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a rough night for Kelvin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think yacht.</v>

1629
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Well it could be or who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1630
01:07:20.981 --> 01:07:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Calvin could realize that he's got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it up to 10 constantly in camp and</v>

1631
01:07:25.931 --> 01:07:29.170
<v Speaker 1>reach his full potential and that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an opportunity to really erase the</v>

1632
01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:32.740
<v Speaker 1>magnet fight and to get a victory over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>former world champion.</v>

1633
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1634
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:38.440
<v Speaker 1>You got Diego Sanchez and Joe lows at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that throwback son.</v>

1635
01:07:38.441 --> 01:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>We call that throwback Thursday match</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1636
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:44.620
<v Speaker 1>This is the better fucking clean the</v>
<v Speaker 1>canvas special.</v>

1637
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I agree to be some blood in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1638
01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early too.</v>

1639
01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So all those other guys are gonna have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to walk around that glut.</v>

1640
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I used to hate that when there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody fight before and there'd be blood</v>

1641
01:07:54.281 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>on the mat and you know when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first get any take that flap</v>

1642
01:07:57.821 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 1>around the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

1643
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:01.420
<v Speaker 1>We know what they do during the Fox</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

1644
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 1>They spray paint over the blood type</v>
<v Speaker 1>move like Grace Gross.</v>

1645
01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:09.700
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting there doing the commentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talking about some stuff and they're</v>

1646
01:08:09.701 --> 01:08:14.701
<v Speaker 1>spraying like full bore paint booth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing a Chevelle 10 feet</v>

1647
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.090
<v Speaker 3>from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1648
01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like that bloodsport when there's</v>

1649
01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:22.520
<v Speaker 3>blood he's like scraping the mat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the next day comes out,</v>

1650
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:23.900
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they spray painted,</v>

1651
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:26.940
<v Speaker 3>they walk around and spray paint over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blood and you're like,</v>

1652
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.200
<v Speaker 3>are you fucking shitting me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody like the,</v>

1653
01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:32.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the camera guys are covering their faces</v>

1654
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.550
<v Speaker 3>with shirts and feel like in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>better solution.</v>

1655
01:08:34.551 --> 01:08:39.440
<v Speaker 3>It's probably illegal masks on and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that shit.</v>

1656
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:43.400
<v Speaker 3>You can't just blow it and can hound</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking is 15,000 people sit in the</v>

1657
01:08:43.401 --> 01:08:43.911
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1658
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really important is we deny what</v>

1659
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:49.160
<v Speaker 3>we're involved with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a little spray paint on this</v>

1660
01:08:49.161 --> 01:08:50.630
<v Speaker 3>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to assume your blood</v>

1661
01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:53.630
<v Speaker 3>blood's inside of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need blood to stay alive.</v>

1662
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes he's a bloody business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't want to look at it.</v>

1663
01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.500
<v Speaker 3>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.090
<v Speaker 3>They're like airbrushing nipples over</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1665
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop it.</v>

1666
01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Did you say that's only on Fox or on</v>
<v Speaker 3>paper view or it happens all the toe.</v>

1667
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:07.410
<v Speaker 3>It's only on Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would never do it on paper.</v>

1668
01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:10.250
<v Speaker 3>You the UFC knows exactly what it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling for sure.</v>

1669
01:09:10.251 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not scared of blood.</v>

1670
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people like it shouldn't be scared</v>

1671
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:15.104
<v Speaker 3>of it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1672
01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 3>What's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got in bed with the most exciting</v>

1673
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:21.190
<v Speaker 3>sport in the fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happened,</v>

1674
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.880
<v Speaker 3>so give it a blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>

1675
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.670
<v Speaker 3>And during Fox fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not supposed to talk about blood.</v>

1676
01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:27.350
<v Speaker 3>His mom's supposed to take it down a</v>
<v Speaker 3>notch.</v>

1677
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.940
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to non-manager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they fucked up town.</v>

1678
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.580
<v Speaker 3>You</v>
<v Speaker 3>see there's a little thing you mean?</v>

1679
01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:35.414
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1680
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:38.540
<v Speaker 3>I fucking go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I shouldn't.</v>

1681
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no need to exaggerate it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no need to dwell on it.</v>

1682
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.410
<v Speaker 3>But if it's overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if it's over one guys like that</v>

1683
01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.660
<v Speaker 3>blood's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

1684
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:51.440
<v Speaker 3>the descriptives that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I believe to descriptives</v>

1685
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:56.420
<v Speaker 3>that I use during a fight half to match</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I feel about the moment that gives</v>

1686
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:59.120
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving a bear better narrative of</v>

1687
01:09:59.121 --> 01:10:02.570
<v Speaker 3>what I think is going on in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I see Diego Sanchez face hanging</v>

1688
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:05.810
<v Speaker 3>off of his head as he's chasing after</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin Kampmann.</v>

1689
01:10:05.811 --> 01:10:07.610
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this looks like a scene from a horror</v>

1690
01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:09.710
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cause that's what it really feels</v>

1691
01:10:09.711 --> 01:10:11.210
<v Speaker 3>like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I don't say that,</v>

1692
01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.120
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing my job as what you're</v>

1693
01:10:14.121 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fans at this service.</v>

1694
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.480
<v Speaker 3>You'd also not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1695
01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.110
<v Speaker 3>that's why we love listening to Joe</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogan.</v>

1696
01:10:18.111 --> 01:10:22.110
<v Speaker 3>If you start [inaudible] boxes and want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know you're going to do it because</v>

1697
01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.920
<v Speaker 3>that's how you get to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going to wear a condom.</v>

1698
01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Everybody said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is not on but not anti Fox.</v>

1702
01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I'd love that day of the UFC on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's amazing.</v>

1703
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.180
<v Speaker 3>It's great for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think you've gotta stop.</v>

<v Speaker 1>successful right now.</v>

1769
01:13:30.091 --> 01:13:32.970

1826
01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:56.650
<v Speaker 1>That shit will make you question what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing with your life.</v>

1827
01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it on a plane before Brian.</v>

1828
01:15:59.081 --> 01:16:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I had one of our live fire the kids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fucked me up man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How much of is based on reality and how</v>

1831
01:16:06.911 --> 01:16:08.370
<v Speaker 1>much of it is a dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked,</v>

1832
01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I looked into it afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1833
01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:10.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see.</v>

1834
01:16:10.961 --> 01:16:13.150
<v Speaker 1>For the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they exaggerate stuff as far as the guys</v>

1835
01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:14.650
<v Speaker 1>dying in the head trauma and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1836
01:16:14.651 --> 01:16:17.260
<v Speaker 1>That's all real band and the NFL hiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1837
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:19.750
<v Speaker 1>That's all real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the lawsuit,</v>

1838
01:16:19.751 --> 01:16:22.060
<v Speaker 1>that's why all the NFL guys or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit because they went,</v>

1839
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:23.890
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all fake.</v>

1840
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no brain trauma caused by</v>

1841
01:16:26.261 --> 01:16:30.640
<v Speaker 1>football and they hit all of this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by this doctor finding this stuff</v>

1842
01:16:30.641 --> 01:16:32.530
<v Speaker 1>and trying to rebuild it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal it.</v>

1843
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.820
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to fuck him over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1844
01:16:33.821 --> 01:16:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts and that's all real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All real.</v>

1845
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:40.300
<v Speaker 1>See that's where it's crazy because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NFL still in business.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:16:43.241 --> 01:16:44.290
<v Speaker 1>The doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still around.</v>

1849
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.220
<v Speaker 1>He's still around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1850
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.660

<v Speaker 1>but he didn't want to be involved in the</v>

1851
01:16:46.661 --> 01:16:49.120
<v Speaker 1>NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They offered him a full time Gig to help</v>

1852
01:16:49.121 --> 01:16:50.230
<v Speaker 1>him out and he's like,</v>

1855
01:16:55.601 --> 01:16:56.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched him.</v>

1856
01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I went fucked.</v>

1860
01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Brian started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

1861
01:17:05.241 --> 01:17:06.220
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1862
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.660
<v Speaker 1>watch concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1865
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:13.370
<v Speaker 1>20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever listen to Brian.</v>

1866
01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever think that something might</v>

1867
01:17:15.051 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 1>be wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

1868
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Never go to Brian because Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

1869
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The house burned down,</v>

1870
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:22.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's because you know it's still the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place on it.</v>

1871
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to camper for a few years.</v>

1872
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:27.350
<v Speaker 1>That's Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell her you love her man.</v>

1873
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 1>But Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man did that movie up.</v>

1874
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Fucking some guys have made it through</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a superbowl careers,</v>

1875
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:35.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when they,</v>

1876
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:40.210
<v Speaker 1>when they test former football players</v>
<v Speaker 1>for cte and alarming number show signs,</v>

1877
01:17:41.331 --> 01:17:43.370
<v Speaker 1>a ct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alarming number.</v>

1878
01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:46.100
<v Speaker 1>My only question is what you think was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>

1879
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:47.631
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1880
01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we knew it to this degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same time,</v>

1881
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:53.750
<v Speaker 1>like when I would run faith verse in</v>
<v Speaker 1>another giant man,</v>

1882
01:17:53.751 --> 01:17:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1883
01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.610
<v Speaker 1>it can't be healthy for my brain.</v>

1884
01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.653
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1885
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.630
<v Speaker 1>but like the way they talked about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>concussion is if you put like a,</v>

1886
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:03.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an apple and a water bottle and you</v>

1887
01:18:03.711 --> 01:18:07.940
<v Speaker 1>shake it like there's water in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like your brain where most like</v>

1888
01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:08.301
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1889
01:18:08.301 --> 01:18:10.250
<v Speaker 1>those rams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that head butt each other like a</v>

1890
01:18:10.251 --> 01:18:13.010
<v Speaker 1>woodpecker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have mechanisms in their head that</v>

1891
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:15.290
<v Speaker 1>absorb that shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but humans don't.</v>

1892
01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we run into each other,</v>

1893
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 1>your brain is smacking against this wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we're not meant to do that.</v>

1894
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:22.550
<v Speaker 1>We're not meant to punch each other in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face and run into each other with</v>

1895
01:18:22.551 --> 01:18:24.080
<v Speaker 1>helmets on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just not built for that.</v>

1896
01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:25.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't.</v>

1897
01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:29.360
<v Speaker 1>We haven't really developed the ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to absorb punishment or if we had that</v>

1898
01:18:29.361 --> 01:18:30.440
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lost it.</v>

1899
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:33.680
<v Speaker 1>That's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at neanderthals,</v>

1900
01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:35.810
<v Speaker 1>they were built very different than us.</v>

1901
01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were very short and thick.</v>

1902
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I think the only word like a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>over five feet tall and they weighed</v>

1903
01:18:42.261 --> 01:18:45.440
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds and he's this big ass bones,</v>

1904
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 1>big thick bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had bigger brains in ours too.</v>

1905
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:51.050
<v Speaker 1>So they were built different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1906
01:18:51.051 --> 01:18:53.450
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were just dealing with shit all</v>

1907
01:18:53.451 --> 01:18:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they find them,</v>

1908
01:18:54.441 --> 01:18:58.820
<v Speaker 1>they're always finding ones with broken</v>
<v Speaker 1>bones and fucking spearpoints lodge and</v>

1909
01:18:58.821 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 1>their spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1910
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:02.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a day in the life of a caveman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1911
01:19:02.451 --> 01:19:04.790
<v Speaker 1>not a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our brains today,</v>

1912
01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:07.940
<v Speaker 1>like this body today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like floating also you see like people</v>

1913
01:19:07.941 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 1>are becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem like,</v>

1914
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at people's like bone</v>

1915
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:16.520
<v Speaker 1>structure in comparison to obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal,</v>

1916
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:19.920
<v Speaker 1>which is a different species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people retain some percentage</v>

1917
01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 1>and the inner tall DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you would assume that as people go</v>

1918
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:27.680
<v Speaker 1>further and further away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient hominins,</v>

1919
01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:30.560
<v Speaker 1>the ancient monkeys and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting softer and weaker,</v>

1920
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:32.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming more and more,</v>

1921
01:19:32.631 --> 01:19:33.740
<v Speaker 1>more softer for sure.</v>

1922
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:36.620
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're involved in like football's the</v>

1923
01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 1>biggest sport in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well definitely the biggest sport in the</v>

1924
01:19:38.901 --> 01:19:40.400
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not The big sport in the world,</v>

1925
01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:41.830
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's our biggest in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1926
01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.150
<v Speaker 1>If I fought a o two days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday and Sunday,</v>

1927
01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:45.170
<v Speaker 1>which is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

1928
01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:46.460
<v Speaker 1>and when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's a super bowl,</v>

1929
01:19:46.461 --> 01:19:48.800

<v Speaker 1>almost a national holiday.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Super Bowl Sunday is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows it.</v>

1932
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.240

<v Speaker 1>Like the world series can come and go</v>

1933
01:19:56.241 --> 01:19:58.820
<v Speaker 1>and people might miss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't miss superbowl son.</v>

<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1938
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:09.210
<v Speaker 1>The athletes getting bigger and faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stronger.</v>

1939
01:20:09.211 --> 01:20:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Like they're getting way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1940
01:20:10.551 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Speaker 1>The a 300 pound linemen in 1988 it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1941
01:20:13.411 --> 01:20:14.430
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big boy.</v>

1942
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know her bitch?</v>

1943
01:20:15.661 --> 01:20:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Get outta here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step your game up.</v>

1944
01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what that is still wrong.</v>

1945
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they test in four?</v>

1946
01:20:22.501 --> 01:20:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Did they test for a shit in the NFL?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1947
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but you know you shits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's once a year.</v>

1948
01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends.</v>

1949
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you,</v>

1950
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.280
<v Speaker 1>unless you've been caught before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're in a program where you</v>

1951
01:20:32.281 --> 01:20:34.230
<v Speaker 1>getting tested all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well why would they catch them?</v>

1952
01:20:34.231 --> 01:20:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Why would they try to catch him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what did I agree to approve?</v>

1953
01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Sports.</v>

1954
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.410
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sport is safe.</v>

1955
01:20:40.411 --> 01:20:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're testing everyone.</v>

1956
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't,</v>

1957
01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:45.510
<v Speaker 1>that just makes you recover slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1958
01:20:45.511 --> 01:20:47.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird dynamic.</v>

1959
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.100
<v Speaker 1>It is a weird dynamic because you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to be gigantic and no one for</v>

1960
01:20:51.101 --> 01:20:52.200
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one talks about this.</v>

1961
01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it,</v>

1962
01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you know the WB fans are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthless.</v>

1963
01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:00.330
<v Speaker 1>But how many wwe athletes die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like China just died.</v>

1964
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.190
<v Speaker 1>But last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two nights ago we had the big girl,</v>

1965
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:05.210
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just died like it kind of alarm</v>

1966
01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:06.540
<v Speaker 1>cause they're not a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1967
01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.310
<v Speaker 1>But when they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they die.</v>

1968
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 1>What did China die from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1969
01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I think she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old was she died in her house.</v>

1970
01:21:15.451 --> 01:21:20.130
<v Speaker 1>She 45 and 45 not that old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was on a fear factor.</v>

1971
01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1972
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Before she was bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as a,</v>

1973
01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.140
<v Speaker 1>as big man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a celebrity.</v>

1974
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's she doing on there?</v>

1975
01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:30.360
<v Speaker 1>She did some gross shit eating like</v>
<v Speaker 1>snails and,</v>

1976
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:33.030
<v Speaker 1>but she did one thing and after she got</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of this thing,</v>

1977
01:21:33.031 --> 01:21:35.490
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the man?</v>

1978
01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck that flax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She made the most muscular thing I've</v>

1979
01:21:39.811 --> 01:21:40.471
<v Speaker 1>ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Laos.</v>

1980
01:21:40.471 --> 01:21:44.570
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't trying to be sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying as victorious.</v>

1981
01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Who's the man went into porn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>

1982
01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that as she hawked triple</v>
<v Speaker 1>x.</v>

1983
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:50.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1984
01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:51.721
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why no,</v>

1985
01:21:51.721 --> 01:21:53.280
<v Speaker 1>the typical one idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask.</v>

1986
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when people don't have a whole</v>

1987
01:21:55.201 --> 01:21:57.740
<v Speaker 1>lot of options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start getting real desperado and</v>

1988
01:21:57.741 --> 01:22:01.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be l Desperado doing she</v>

1989
01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:02.790
<v Speaker 1>hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaa,</v>

1990
01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:04.983
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

1991
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's you.</v>

1992
01:22:05.461 --> 01:22:07.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's you and her son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at her muscles.</v>

1993
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Look how skinny I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel like she would have fucked you up</v>

1994
01:22:10.561 --> 01:22:13.980
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck her up too quick.</v>

1995
01:22:13.981 --> 01:22:14.814
<v Speaker 1>And my piece.</v>

1996
01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:20.430
<v Speaker 1>That's sad though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's find out what happened.</v>

1997
01:22:20.431 --> 01:22:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Was it pills?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

1998
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know man.</v>

1999
01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Super Nice man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real friendly.</v>

2000
01:22:26.410 --> 01:22:29.220
<v Speaker 1>She's real nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She followed me on twitter.</v>

2001
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Nice to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on the set and everything like</v>

2002
01:22:31.681 --> 01:22:32.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bomber man.</v>

2003
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.240
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's conversation to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the substance they put in their</v>

2004
01:22:36.241 --> 01:22:39.210
<v Speaker 1>bodies and you look at their schedule</v>
<v Speaker 1>being on the road 300 days a year,</v>

2005
01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.220
<v Speaker 1>constantly falling uppers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>downers.</v>

2006
01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I know it's not legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not a legit sport compared</v>

2007
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:48.000
<v Speaker 1>to the NFL UFC stuff and nbl or all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

2008
01:22:48.001 --> 01:22:51.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta talk about it because these</v>

2009
01:22:51.151 --> 01:22:52.890
<v Speaker 1>guys are passing away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no,</v>

2010
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:56.490
<v Speaker 1>there's no regulatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no one's making sure there's no</v>

2011
01:22:56.491 --> 01:22:57.330
<v Speaker 1>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2012
01:22:57.331 --> 01:22:59.730
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of people think of</v>

2013
01:22:59.731 --> 01:23:02.450
<v Speaker 1>them as athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of like a Cirque du Soleil type</v>

2014
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:02.670
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2015
01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Like they're doing a performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they think of them as in a sport so</v>

2016
01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:08.800
<v Speaker 1>they don't look to try to regulate it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>change it.</v>

2017
01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>They look at it as sort of like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment thing.</v>

2018
01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:12.820
<v Speaker 1>These people were doing night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2019
01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2020
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're taking some performance</v>

2021
01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:19.480
<v Speaker 1>enhancing supplements that a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro athletes are taking even more cell,</v>

2022
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their schedules are way crazy.</v>

2023
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

2024
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:24.670
<v Speaker 1>So when they pass away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there has to be some sort of</v>

2025
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.250
<v Speaker 1>plan in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2026
01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.313
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

2027
01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:31.960
<v Speaker 1>the problem is she hasn't worked for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a long time.</v>

2028
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.900
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then second thing is if she was</v>

2029
01:23:34.901 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>doing pills or she was abusing other</v>
<v Speaker 1>substances,</v>

2030
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.550
<v Speaker 1>they're not really responsible for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't,</v>

2031
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:43.090
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how much of what she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing she was doing just because she was</v>

2032
01:23:43.091 --> 01:23:46.090
<v Speaker 1>in a recreational drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was obviously some steroids.</v>

2033
01:23:46.091 --> 01:23:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm referring to the steroid show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2034
01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you think that did it to her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a pill.</v>

2035
01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.311
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pill.</v>

2036
01:23:51.311 --> 01:23:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2037
01:23:52.571 --> 01:23:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm pretty sure she overdosed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2038
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying she overdosed on</v>

2040
01:23:56.411 --> 01:23:57.430
<v Speaker 1>testosterone some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2041
01:23:57.431 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

2042
01:23:58.331 --> 01:23:58.921
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

2043
01:23:58.921 --> 01:24:00.830
<v Speaker 1>she was still on pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2044
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty positive.</v>

2045
01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:03.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2046
01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:04.203
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were saying,</v>

2047
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:07.050
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was on the open gym not too long</v>

2048
01:24:07.051 --> 01:24:08.790
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She had just came back from Japan where</v>

2049
01:24:08.791 --> 01:24:10.290
<v Speaker 5>I think she had been living for the last</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of years.</v>

2050
01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.570
<v Speaker 5>Teaching English.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2051
01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:14.070
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting away from the craziness of</v>

2052
01:24:14.071 --> 01:24:15.990
<v Speaker 5>American.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was just coming back to get back</v>

2053
01:24:15.991 --> 01:24:20.220
<v Speaker 5>into life and entertainment and she was</v>
<v Speaker 5>found dead after not talking to anybody</v>

2054
01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:21.630
<v Speaker 5>for six days or something like that.</v>

2055
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:24.570
<v Speaker 1>She went dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sucks man.</v>

2056
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's something to look into</v>

2057
01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.800
<v Speaker 1>with the Dojo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys,</v>

2058
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:31.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a discussion to fucking have at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least,</v>

2059
01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they must be having it.</v>

2060
01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

2061
01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:41.040
<v Speaker 1>ben Wa again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one of those guys who goes off</v>

2062
01:24:41.041 --> 01:24:44.070
<v Speaker 1>the rails like that and does something</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific and you gotta wonder like,</v>

2063
01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.250
<v Speaker 1>was that in that Guy Anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he have issues already?</v>

2064
01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Did it have something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling?</v>

2065
01:24:48.931 --> 01:24:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Did it have something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>substance abuse and Kushans they get</v>

2066
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:54.360
<v Speaker 1>shemozzle concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a lot of different factors.</v>

2067
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:56.370
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely something to look into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2068
01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:59.790
<v Speaker 1>it's so rare that someone goes that far</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the rails like he did.</v>

2069
01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2070
01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at what they're doing to</v>

2071
01:25:02.821 --> 01:25:05.850
<v Speaker 1>their bodies and have a discussion about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to maybe to make it safer.</v>

2072
01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:07.470
<v Speaker 1>So to prevent it from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2073
01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dammit.</v>

2074
01:25:09.090 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2075
01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Captain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save a hoe over here.</v>

2076
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Trying to save everybody.</v>

2077
01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Keep the want to do flips off the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>

2078
01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 1>What new possible overdose or natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>death where that natural at 46 no one</v>

2079
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.990
<v Speaker 1>finds that fishy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem to make a lot of</v>

2080
01:25:27.991 --> 01:25:30.240
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead on her bed after receiving a call</v>

2081
01:25:30.241 --> 01:25:31.074
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2082
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.810
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to read all the rest on</v>

2083
01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.410
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a very nice person.</v>

2084
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.390
<v Speaker 1>So rest in peace buns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi know.</v>

2085
01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Nice Lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least get it on a good note.</v>

2086
01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:45.200
<v Speaker 1>How about your boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Henderson going for the triple Crown</v>

2087
01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Bella tour?</v>
<v Speaker 1>WC UFC belt.</v>

2088
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:50.020
<v Speaker 1>No one's talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Nothing.</v>

2089
01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Who was he fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting this rushing cat and I</v>

2090
01:25:52.561 --> 01:25:55.080
<v Speaker 1>wish I could remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've even trained with them some even</v>

2091
01:25:55.081 --> 01:25:56.700
<v Speaker 1>bigger prick for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2092
01:25:56.701 --> 01:25:59.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough fight for Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's beat better guys with the top.</v>

2093
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not a walk in the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it's weird that no one's bringing</v>

2094
01:26:02.401 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 1>it up at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's the disadvantage</v>

2095
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:05.980
<v Speaker 3>of signing with Bella tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2096
01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Because imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if he was doing this in the UFC.</v>

2097
01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:12.140
<v Speaker 3>It'd be fucking everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all of course golf.</v>

2098
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know what's interesting is,</v>

2099
01:26:13.971 --> 01:26:15.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even,</v>

2100
01:26:16.050 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch half of the Bela Tarr</v>

2101
01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even watch half of them.</v>

2102
01:26:19.701 --> 01:26:20.481
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2103
01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:22.700
<v Speaker 3>They're probably pretty good fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch them if them,</v>

2104
01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.000
<v Speaker 3>if they're the major ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like obviously I'll watch bands,</v>

2105
01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.090
<v Speaker 3>Phil King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mo,</v>

2106
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:28.310
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these guys that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

2107
01:26:28.311 --> 01:26:31.190
<v Speaker 3>what is missing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is missing from even drawing me in?</v>

2108
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:33.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost feel like detached from it</v>

2109
01:26:33.381 --> 01:26:36.050
<v Speaker 3>because I feel insulted by the freak</v>
<v Speaker 3>show element.</v>

2110
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it was a slap in my face.</v>

2111
01:26:38.271 --> 01:26:38.811
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2112
01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:39.890
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you set us back,</v>

2113
01:26:39.891 --> 01:26:42.050
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a dummy for watching to</v>

2114
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:43.220
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2115
01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2116
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like I don't feel like that if I</v>

2117
01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:49.030
<v Speaker 3>watched glory or if I watch anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellow or if I watch one FC,</v>

2118
01:26:49.031 --> 01:26:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm getting,</v>

2119
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:54.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting shit on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're putting the other nonsense</v>

2120
01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:57.320
<v Speaker 3>might sound weird to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost feel like I'm cheating on the</v>

2121
01:26:57.321 --> 01:26:58.850
<v Speaker 3>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I watched and I talked about,</v>

2122
01:26:58.851 --> 01:27:00.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2123
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Is that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good to have competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important.</v>

2125
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I agree with they have a ways to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do,</v>

2126
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.810
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ended up good stuff too though.</v>

2127
01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.400
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

2128
01:27:10.401 --> 01:27:12.740
<v Speaker 3>if they did the right thing and promoted</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right way,</v>

2129
01:27:12.741 --> 01:27:17.060
<v Speaker 3>they went for like big ratings on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of these weird fights which the</v>

2130
01:27:17.061 --> 01:27:22.061
<v Speaker 3>UFC did to sort of in the early 2000</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] tank habit came back.</v>

2131
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2132
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:25.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a few of those times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2133
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.420
<v Speaker 3>you had to do that back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean started,</v>

2134
01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.610
<v Speaker 3>they did some fights back then that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>in comparison,</v>

2135
01:27:31.611 --> 01:27:33.620
<v Speaker 3>silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people didn't consider a sport</v>

2136
01:27:33.621 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was coming along.</v>

2137
01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.230
<v Speaker 3>But the sports already established now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they're taking advantage of these</v>

2138
01:27:39.231 --> 01:27:44.090
<v Speaker 3>old veterans like hoists and Ken</v>
<v Speaker 3>shamrock and having that fight and it's</v>

2139
01:27:44.091 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 3>going to draw in the casual nostalgic</v>
<v Speaker 3>viewer that remembers UFC one and</v>

2140
01:27:48.381 --> 01:27:49.760
<v Speaker 3>they're going to go and they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it.</v>

2141
01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Snow s sustainability with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not,</v>

2142
01:27:52.311 --> 01:27:55.070
<v Speaker 3>there is no sustainability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other problem is that for</v>

2143
01:27:55.071 --> 01:27:56.750
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the reason is.</v>

2144
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:59.690
<v Speaker 3>You're not hearing a lot of noise about</v>
<v Speaker 3>their champs,</v>

2145
01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:01.910
<v Speaker 3>you know and you kind of should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

2146
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.910
<v Speaker 3>We'll brooks is a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Chandler is a bad mother fucker</v>

2147
01:28:05.911 --> 01:28:06.240
<v Speaker 3>fucker.</v>

2148
01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.510
<v Speaker 3>They got some great fighters over that</v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy pit bulls.</v>

2149
01:28:08.511 --> 01:28:11.000
<v Speaker 3>A bad mother fosters man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good fighters.</v>

2150
01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:13.880
<v Speaker 3>So it just seems like whatever they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>done wrong,</v>

2151
01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:15.650
<v Speaker 3>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben was on espn.</v>

2152
01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.620
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on espn talking.</v>

2153
01:28:18.621 --> 01:28:20.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad they're given it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some press look,</v>

2154
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.360
<v Speaker 3>they definitely need like the UFC could</v>
<v Speaker 3>use competition and I think it would</v>

2155
01:28:25.761 --> 01:28:28.490
<v Speaker 3>boost the sport whereas make the sport</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>

2156
01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that bell toward its</v>
<v Speaker 3>current state is competition.</v>

2157
01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:37.520
<v Speaker 3>They're taking a lot of fighters that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are past their prime except for Benson</v>

2158
01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.810
<v Speaker 3>Benson going over there as the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 3>coup.</v>

2159
01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phil's big.</v>

2160
01:28:40.341 --> 01:28:41.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not past his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2161
01:28:41.571 --> 01:28:43.850
<v Speaker 3>but phil had been beaten soundly by</v>
<v Speaker 3>rumble.</v>

2162
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.710
<v Speaker 3>He did have that really good fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>against glover.</v>

2163
01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Clover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beat Machida as true.</v>

2164
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:51.200
<v Speaker 3>If I was super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super close still though,</v>

2165
01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:53.660
<v Speaker 3>it's still a can speak Gustafson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2166
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:55.460
<v Speaker 3>But he strangled them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:28:55.650 --> 01:29:00.110
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing about Phil as Phil Phil is</v>

2168
01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:01.280

2174
01:29:15.961 --> 01:29:17.790
<v Speaker 1>a new organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's one of the best fighters in the</v>

2175
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And going over there.</v>

2176

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2181
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.330
<v Speaker 1>he texted me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so scared.</v>

2182
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>

2183
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.360
<v Speaker 1>It's paying off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2184
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Because it was fat now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.280
<v Speaker 1>And Now ben Henderson and they got mitre</v>
<v Speaker 1>owned.</v>

2186
01:29:34.281 --> 01:29:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Mitchell is a little older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least a heavyweight Smith's young</v>

2187
01:29:36.481 --> 01:29:40.680
<v Speaker 1>can be champions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are three completely legit guys</v>

2188
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:41.630
<v Speaker 1>that they've acquired.</v>

2189
01:29:41.630 --> 01:29:42.850
<v Speaker 1>A stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Well he would have been interesting if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got fade or it would have been</v>

2191
01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:48.540
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Won't fingers playing grab ass and he's</v>

2192
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:50.990
<v Speaker 1>fighting a on dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2193
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what type.</v>

2194
01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have to look at Jamie.</v>

2195
01:29:55.381 --> 01:29:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it's on fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What his fate or might be on fight pass.</v>

2196
01:29:59.131 --> 01:30:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I thought that fight really versus all</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denato rise in risen is on fight pass.</v>

2197
01:30:03.451 --> 01:30:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I crazy here?</v>

2198
01:30:04.801 --> 01:30:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2199
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know this Keto genic died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just my brain on another level.</v>

2200
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It would be funny if you really nailed</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2201
01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2202
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:20.820
<v Speaker 1>he's been saying lately that he's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in talks to the UFC at it and I think</v>

2203
01:30:20.821 --> 01:30:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you'd give it a good go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you look at the state of the</v>

2204
01:30:22.921 --> 01:30:24.570
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's old as fuck.</v>

2205
01:30:24.570 --> 01:30:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't you get your fossils?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think they put them</v>

2206
01:30:26.461 --> 01:30:29.160
<v Speaker 1>immediately with vre doom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that matchup.</v>

2207
01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I liked her match of too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you have to do it that way,</v>

2208
01:30:31.771 --> 01:30:32.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

2209
01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:37.670
<v Speaker 1>He can't toss them like some young dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what young dude do we even have?</v>

2210
01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:38.910
<v Speaker 1>We don't have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2211
01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 1>We don't really have a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2212
01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't name one third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying for him,</v>

2213
01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:46.020
<v Speaker 1>like there's a resurgence of all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>older fighters.</v>

2214
01:30:46.021 --> 01:30:50.970
<v Speaker 1>We get Rothwell or Lawsky fucking hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir candy just lost with all these</v>

2215
01:30:50.971 --> 01:30:54.150
<v Speaker 1>guys are hold his fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fate or there's hope.</v>

2216
01:30:54.151 --> 01:30:55.800
<v Speaker 1>My man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd still do it.</v>

2217
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.830
<v Speaker 1>He never know man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that skinny fat bill just fucking dudes</v>

2218
01:30:58.831 --> 01:31:01.890
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he still has that motivation and</v>

2219
01:31:01.891 --> 01:31:04.550
<v Speaker 1>there's drug testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he did something to say</v>

2220
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:04.860
<v Speaker 1>bright.</v>

2221
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I hate to Piss on the pride days but I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>just saying it ain't the wild wild west.</v>

2222
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:11.490
<v Speaker 1>We have to see your Dick this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah we don't know.</v>

2223
01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:14.920
<v Speaker 1>We're just speculating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it is.</v>

2224
01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Total fights are different as he looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>different but he doesn't weight train</v>

2225
01:31:19.411 --> 01:31:20.910
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll let me know what steroids do</v>

2226
01:31:20.911 --> 01:31:22.500
<v Speaker 1>you are taking cause I would never touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>them</v>

2227
01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:27.900
<v Speaker 1>because physically I'm going for look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he got,</v>

2228
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:31.530
<v Speaker 1>he got thicker again before his most</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent comeback.</v>

2229
01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Like there was all sorts of posts about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2230
01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:34.381
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

2231
01:31:34.381 --> 01:31:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I saw some photos of him training and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked thicker back to the old days like</v>

2232
01:31:38.551 --> 01:31:41.050
<v Speaker 1>throwing around logs and shit look</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than their kettlebells.</v>

2233
01:31:41.051 --> 01:31:43.050
<v Speaker 1>We Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely looked like he had been</v>

2234
01:31:43.051 --> 01:31:46.290
<v Speaker 1>doing some weightlifting cause there</v>
<v Speaker 1>would come a time in his career where it</v>

2235
01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:48.210
<v Speaker 1>looked like the weightlifting days</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling agree.</v>

2236
01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Like the early days he was way thicker</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bigger.</v>

2237
01:31:51.151 --> 01:31:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And then as he got older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he concentrated more on skills and less</v>

2238
01:31:54.811 --> 01:31:57.030
<v Speaker 1>on strength and conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not him.</v>

2239
01:31:57.230 --> 01:32:00.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think what I think you need both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think especially this day and age,</v>

2240
01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 1>but when he was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

2241
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I think he just put a lot of emphasis on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it striking in particular and his</v>

2242
01:32:07.241 --> 01:32:10.870
<v Speaker 1>ability to explode with combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go like to the Tim Silvia fight,</v>

2243
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.820
<v Speaker 1>the speed of combinations and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting guys with and his hips powerness</v>

2244
01:32:15.821 --> 01:32:16.990
<v Speaker 1>hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2245
01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he has a legit shot shot to do</v>

2246
01:32:20.231 --> 01:32:23.440
<v Speaker 1>some work in the heavyweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're his age and come back to</v>

2247
01:32:23.441 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>55 70 you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's agent heavyweight.</v>

2248
01:32:26.591 --> 01:32:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Hell son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What age is he?</v>

2249
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:33.040
<v Speaker 1>36 now he has to be at least 38 39</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2250
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Or we'll find out if he him verse</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barnett something.</v>

01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:39.090
<v Speaker 1>So back son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think he's that.</v>

2252
01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's that old.</v>

2253
01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:43.780
<v Speaker 1>39 wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2254

<v Speaker 1>That's my brain firing.</v>

2255
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.860

2270
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I might buy that reebok kit if it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>white and red shade on the back.</v>

2281
01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 1>It might be the best collaborator in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2282
01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the best.</v>

2283
01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:02.830
<v Speaker 1>One of the best results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever had any occupation might be</v>

2284
01:34:02.831 --> 01:34:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best joe after that,</v>

2285
01:34:04.631 --> 01:34:05.351
<v Speaker 1>if someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2286
01:34:05.351 --> 01:34:06.790
<v Speaker 1>let's just kind of move on from here.</v>

2287
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:07.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

2288
01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:11.650
<v Speaker 1>If he was showing me a crystal ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all right from here,</v>

2289
01:34:11.651 --> 01:34:15.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'll just move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of Osp and Jon Jones?</v>

2290
01:34:15.730 --> 01:34:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think o s p he's an explosive guy,</v>

2291
01:34:22.481 --> 01:34:23.380
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

2292
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:25.780
<v Speaker 1>just too smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too long to get caught.</v>

2293
01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2294
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate saying this because Ospi such</v>

2295
01:34:30.581 --> 01:34:32.200
<v Speaker 1>good athlete and he's ranked in the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 or whatever,</v>

2296
01:34:32.201 --> 01:34:35.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good tuneup fight for John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2297
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>

2298
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:39.640
<v Speaker 1>My number's six light heavyweight is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good tuneup fight for you.</v>

2299
01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Light heavyweight is struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

2300
01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

2301
01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:45.820
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's so much possibility</v>

2302
01:34:45.821 --> 01:34:47.240
<v Speaker 1>there in the top five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.620
<v Speaker 1>What glow over just did to Rashad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Man.</v>

2304
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:54.250
<v Speaker 1>That was hard to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to watch because you know</v>

2305
01:34:54.251 --> 01:34:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Rashad was super tentative and it was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside.</v>

2306
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:59.080
<v Speaker 1>It was moving away from glover and</v>
<v Speaker 1>clover.</v>

2307
01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Just close the distance and close the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>

2308
01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.230
<v Speaker 1>The terminator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there couldn't be a worse match up for</v>

2309
01:35:05.231 --> 01:35:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Rashad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just wish and I get it,</v>

2310
01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get well,</v>

2311
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:10.120
<v Speaker 1>fighters fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that man,</v>

2312
01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:14.330
<v Speaker 1>but it was Rashad's stage in his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you got to have a man to go,</v>

2313
01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:15.181
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clovers,</v>

2314
01:35:15.181 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 1>a foe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does everything better than you right</v>

2315
01:35:16.761 --> 01:35:18.200
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure something else out,</v>

2316
01:35:18.201 --> 01:35:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What w I mean you win this one.</v>

2317
01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to fight for the title?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

2318
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I think you've got to take whoever he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2319
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:25.220
<v Speaker 1>You know it looks so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what we got here.</v>

2320
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:27.140
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

2321
01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie Johnson and glover Hamas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at clover called for it.</v>

2322
01:35:33.711 --> 01:35:36.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the best fighter in the UFC right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2323
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Please make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's one fight that could give me</v>

2324
01:35:40.341 --> 01:35:41.840
<v Speaker 1>go to UFC fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be that.</v>

2325
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno who the fuck to bed on me.</v>

2326
01:35:44.301 --> 01:35:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Neither about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Need,</v>

2327
01:35:45.721 --> 01:35:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you should give be chaos in both</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions.</v>

2328
01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I think if it goes past first round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glover takes over maybe.</v>

2329
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.680
<v Speaker 1>But that first rounds can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucka first round is like one of</v>

2330
01:35:54.681 --> 01:35:58.580
<v Speaker 1>those scenes in a movie where we're like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a building explodes and you have to run</v>

2331
01:35:58.581 --> 01:36:00.850
<v Speaker 1>through the rubble without hitting you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the head on a,</v>

2332
01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.880
<v Speaker 1>you got a a minefield to navigate when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting rumble because one</v>

2333
01:36:06.081 --> 01:36:08.750
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that doesn't get you crunk,</v>

2334
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:13.220
<v Speaker 1>you're an idiot and it's Gustafson</v>
<v Speaker 1>retiring.</v>

2335
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I come in here and that Gustafson</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to find it.</v>

2336
01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw an interview you did where he's</v>

2337
01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:19.460
<v Speaker 1>saying he's like lost the passion for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2338
01:36:19.461 --> 01:36:22.280
<v Speaker 1>So he came to San Diego hoping he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>find it and I'm not sure if he did,</v>

2339
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.270
<v Speaker 1>but when you start talking like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to look at the top three</v>

2340
01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:29.990
<v Speaker 1>because Glover Anthony and John Jones</v>
<v Speaker 1>will rip your Dick off and they want</v>

2341
01:36:29.991 --> 01:36:30.980
<v Speaker 1>this more than anything.</v>

2342
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:33.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably time to maybe give it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2343
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:38.000
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that bater well I guess</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bader beat over and St Pru so he should</v>

2344
01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 1>be ranked above them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

2345
01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:44.000
<v Speaker 1>And then Rashad shoguns still in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mix,</v>

2346
01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:44.631
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2347
01:36:44.631 --> 01:36:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

2348
01:36:45.561 --> 01:36:47.090
<v Speaker 1>If you think light heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2349
01:36:47.690 --> 01:36:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Well Shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kio gets me on another love on him.</v>

2350
01:36:52.821 --> 01:36:57.821
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is look past six.</v>

2351
01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

2352
01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Well Vince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2353
01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Rashad Shogun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Manoa,</v>

2354
01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy man guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Mattawa is a guy that just was not</v>

2355
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 1>in martial arts that long before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting top level guys to mma who</v>

2356
01:37:13.431 --> 01:37:16.790
<v Speaker 1>utilize a sick athlete with ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

2357
01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:20.780
<v Speaker 1>And I just for games changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one gives a fuck cause now you have</v>

2358
01:37:20.781 --> 01:37:21.920
<v Speaker 1>real fighters.</v>

2359
01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:24.620
<v Speaker 1>You're fast getting and punch out power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2360
01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought rumble humble man when he</v>

2361
01:37:27.561 --> 01:37:28.394
<v Speaker 1>fought rumble.</v>

2362
01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gustafson stopped him before the rumble</v>

2363
01:37:31.371 --> 01:37:33.910
<v Speaker 1>fight in a very important fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they do them like that?</v>

2364
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Here's rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's guts the same?</v>

2365
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2366
01:37:38.961 --> 01:37:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Double whammy of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting a guy that's boxing you</v>

2367
01:37:43.821 --> 01:37:47.240
<v Speaker 1>up for another zip code and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fuck.</v>

2368
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:48.470
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2369
01:37:48.471 --> 01:37:52.670
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC you bitch and then you fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rumble Dude's got literal nuclear</v>

2370
01:37:52.671 --> 01:37:54.390
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pride at the end of his hand,</v>

2371
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:59.410
<v Speaker 1>they got shogun and little Nog in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top 10 that's a hard sell.</v>

2372
01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Especially especially in little little</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nog is a hard sells a top 10 guy.</v>

2373
01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good argument that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one,</v>

2374
01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:07.681
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

2375
01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:10.930
<v Speaker 1>like you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the heavier divisions and</v>

2376
01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 1>like at heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's fun.</v>

2377
01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Matchups everyone's old as fuck though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really man.</v>

2378
01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:16.590
<v Speaker 1>And they look at light heavyweight.</v>

2379
01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot going on out to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

2380
01:38:18.211 --> 01:38:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the top five and in the top five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexander does he know if he wants to do</v>

2381
01:38:21.481 --> 01:38:24.000
<v Speaker 1>it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important.</v>

2382
01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:24.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

2383
01:38:24.721 --> 01:38:26.490
<v Speaker 1>very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why do you think that,</v>

2384
01:38:26.491 --> 01:38:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think these bigger athletes</v>

2385
01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:31.800
<v Speaker 1>aren't gravitating towards mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts?</v>

2386
01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's that or if it just</v>

2387
01:38:33.961 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 1>comes in waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2388
01:38:35.431 --> 01:38:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes you have a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones and they create a bit of a</v>

2389
01:38:38.821 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 1>bottleneck because they're so good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't forget about cornea of course.</v>

2390
01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So just in that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got John Jones and Cormier</v>

2391
01:38:45.181 --> 01:38:46.980
<v Speaker 1>cormier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's as good as anybody in the world.</v>

2392
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 1>He got Anthony Johnson who can knock out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tree.</v>

2393
01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You got Glover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got Gustafson,</v>

2394

<v Speaker 1>85 for awhile.</v>

2410

<v Speaker 1>One 85 was struggling for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see,</v>

01:39:24.331 --> 01:39:27.330
<v Speaker 1>one 95 one 85 now you've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2412
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once Anderson loss and Weidman came in,</v>

2413
01:39:29.731 --> 01:39:32.910

<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what they're going to</v>

2414
01:39:32.911 --> 01:39:36.000
<v Speaker 1>do with Yoel Romero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I understand is that he has a</v>

2415
01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:37.990
<v Speaker 1>very small window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2416
01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:40.740
<v Speaker 1>where they're going to ban him for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>only like five months.</v>

2417
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:41.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2418
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.430
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he did was totally,</v>

2419
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:47.160
<v Speaker 1>he was actually honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got the stuff independently off the</v>

2420
01:39:47.161 --> 01:39:51.870
<v Speaker 1>shelf that he said that he took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took that stuff and they tested it</v>

2421
01:39:51.871 --> 01:39:54.810
<v Speaker 1>and it had low levels of whatever this</v>
<v Speaker 1>peptide is.</v>

2422
01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:58.380
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to grow testosterone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body or something like that.</v>

2423
01:39:58.690 --> 01:40:02.160
<v Speaker 1>So he really didn't take anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't supposed to take.</v>

2424
01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:05.460
<v Speaker 1>He took something that had something in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that wasn't supposed to be in it,</v>

2425
01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:07.440
<v Speaker 1>and he proved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Joel,</v>

2426
01:40:07.441 --> 01:40:09.480
<v Speaker 1>even if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go through middleweight look,</v>

2432
01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.730
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2433
01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Musashi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy lead.</v>

2434
01:40:23.361 --> 01:40:25.260
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not Dan Henderson's in there.</v>

2435
01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:28.590
<v Speaker 1>How has Musashi ranked above Uriah Hall</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're riding hauled jumps,</v>

2436
01:40:28.591 --> 01:40:30.840
<v Speaker 1>spitting back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked him in the face and stopped him?</v>

2437
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Whoever votes on this thinks it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flu.</v>

2438
01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Those are ridiculous people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a ridiculous ranking.</v>

2439
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:41.280
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones writing articles that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can not be two steps above a guy.</v>

2440
01:40:41.281 --> 01:40:43.440
<v Speaker 1>When the guy stopped you in your last</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2441
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:44.970
<v Speaker 1>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot,</v>

2442
01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I wish our boy Tim Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just an,</v>

2443
01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:51.330
<v Speaker 1>that's an arrogant assessment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's ability in comparison to</v>

2444
01:40:51.331 --> 01:40:53.770
<v Speaker 1>someone else's ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not based on facts.</v>

2445
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:57.280
<v Speaker 1>You have to base individual interactions</v>
<v Speaker 1>between two fighters.</v>

2446
01:40:57.281 --> 01:40:59.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to base them on facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very black and white.</v>

2447
01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.570
<v Speaker 1>It's very black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

2448
01:41:01.571 --> 01:41:04.450
<v Speaker 1>The uriah hall proved himself to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>better fighter.</v>

2449
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Gay Garden was saucy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took him down and control them in the</v>

2450
01:41:06.731 --> 01:41:09.420
<v Speaker 1>first round and the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uriah Hall Jumps,</v>

2451
01:41:09.421 --> 01:41:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Spinning back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked him in the face and knocked him</v>

2452
01:41:12.101 --> 01:41:13.390
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that that is,</v>

2453
01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no more definitive ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an insult to him to have him at</v>

2454
01:41:16.961 --> 01:41:18.730
<v Speaker 1>number 10 and half gay guard at number</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

2455
01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.250
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you can do with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>riders,</v>

2456
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:23.200
<v Speaker 1>so cause it's basically a popularity</v>
<v Speaker 1>contest,</v>

2457
01:41:23.201 --> 01:41:24.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If guy keeps winning a popularity</v>

2458
01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:26.620
<v Speaker 1>contest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the chance he can't deny it right</v>

2459
01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:28.600
<v Speaker 1>though the champion one and two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

2460
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:29.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no honey dick.</v>

2461
01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:34.120
<v Speaker 1>You see one Brazilian writer put fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>notorious mma.</v>

<v Speaker 1>knocked out Aldo.</v>

2463
01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:39.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:43.300
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck could you do that?</v>

2466
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how,</v>

2467
01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:47.080

<v Speaker 1>But that's why.</v>

2468
01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:50.140
<v Speaker 1>How could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might not like connor,</v>

2469
01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:53.650
<v Speaker 1>you might think the connor's a brash guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he insulted your champion and he</v>

2470
01:41:53.651 --> 01:41:55.960
<v Speaker 1>insulted your country and Blah Blah</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blah.</v>

2471
01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And then he smashes him with one punch</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 13 seconds.</v>

2472
01:41:59.010 --> 01:42:01.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just not professional and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

01:43:57.261 --> 01:43:59.150
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See a lot of guys get stopped as part of</v>

2520
01:43:59.151 --> 01:44:01.700
<v Speaker 1>the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else is on this weekend?</v>

2521
01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Go back to this weekend's card</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that Brazil cars.</v>

2522
01:44:06.021 --> 01:44:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leslie Smith,</v>

2523
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:10.760
<v Speaker 1>that salty record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight and six sign up to fight Cyborg.</v>

2524
01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how Cyborg is going to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the one 40 cut her first time I</v>

2525
01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:20.340
<v Speaker 1>dropped on onto one 40 inches faces off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone should fucking run</v>

2526
01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.500
<v Speaker 1>every girl in the divisions like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I hope they give her a one 45 pound</v>

2527
01:44:24.501 --> 01:44:26.000
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she deserves it.</v>

2528
01:44:26.001 --> 01:44:28.790
<v Speaker 1>They've had that division to Invicta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an established division.</v>

2529
01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:30.290
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of girls out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will,</v>

2530
01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:34.520
<v Speaker 1>that'll fight at one 45 and that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not dying trying to make the</v>

2531
01:44:34.521 --> 01:44:34.850
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

2532
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:38.300
<v Speaker 1>She's a big girl man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is how many big girls are</v>

2533
01:44:38.301 --> 01:44:39.860
<v Speaker 1>there that they like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it sustainable,</v>

2534
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:42.170
<v Speaker 1>sustainable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>

2535
01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Gina Carano did it and strike force.</v>

2536
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the whole thing or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead Xc,</v>

2537
01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it strikeforce a leader because he</v>

2538
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:51.260
<v Speaker 1>is the leading city lead ECC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was her whole thing.</v>

2539
01:44:51.261 --> 01:44:53.510
<v Speaker 1>She was fighting one 45 Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at my face.</v>

2540
01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can build,</v>

2541
01:44:55.670 --> 01:44:59.150
<v Speaker 1>you can build a division around Gina</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carano and she looks like you can build</v>

2542
01:44:59.151 --> 01:45:01.820
<v Speaker 1>a division around Cyborg when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashing checks.</v>

2543
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.160

<v Speaker 1>I firmly believe you can build a</v>

2544
01:45:04.161 --> 01:45:05.420
<v Speaker 1>division around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign up for it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you catch it.</v>

2546

<v Speaker 1>She wanna have her fight this fight.</v>

2556

<v Speaker 1>brave enough to take that challenge.</v>

2558
01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:40.930

<v Speaker 1>them in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what do you do with her then you make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make her fight at one 40 we don't</v>

2562
01:45:46.881 --> 01:45:49.010
<v Speaker 1>even know how well her body is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle that,</v>

2563
01:45:49.230 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say she does decent though,</v>

2564
01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:54.290
<v Speaker 1>but all your superstars at one 35 so let</v>
<v Speaker 1>me just do these super fight.</v>

2565
01:45:54.291 --> 01:45:58.250
<v Speaker 1>The one 40 where Misha could be champ at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 35 or one 40 right?</v>

2566
01:45:58.251 --> 01:46:01.550
<v Speaker 1>And you have this monster at one 40 but</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least she's fighting Misha tate and</v>

2567
01:46:01.551 --> 01:46:03.860
<v Speaker 1>getting that coverage of Ronda Rousey</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Holly Holm,</v>

2568
01:46:03.970 --> 01:46:04.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2569
01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.870
<v Speaker 1>If you do one 45 okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we've got to find a 145 bad ass is</v>

2570
01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.370
<v Speaker 1>at one 45 girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2571
01:46:10.371 --> 01:46:15.371
<v Speaker 1>the real fight at one 40 is holly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's fought as high as I want to say.</v>

2572
01:46:16.341 --> 01:46:19.420
<v Speaker 1>She fought it like one 50 before inbox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2573
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:24.430
<v Speaker 1>At 1:50 AM one 52 so that would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight because first of all,</v>

2574
01:46:25.881 --> 01:46:30.200
<v Speaker 1>she was without a doubt the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced striker in all of the UFC.</v>

2575
01:46:30.201 --> 01:46:34.910
<v Speaker 1>It's women's divisions as far as boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition and in a competition and</v>

2576
01:46:34.911 --> 01:46:36.200
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2577
01:46:36.201 --> 01:46:38.960
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a 19 time boxing champion.</v>

2578
01:46:38.961 --> 01:46:41.540
<v Speaker 1>She's won kickboxing titles and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted the UFC crown.</v>

2579
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I think she's the only female in the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can beat Cyborg.</v>

2580
01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.870
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a fance fascinating fight</v>

2581
01:46:47.871 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>because she's got that style of</v>

2582
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 3>like counter striking and moving away</v>
<v Speaker 3>and almost a karate base with a lot of</v>

2583
01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:57.930
<v Speaker 3>athleticism and footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And cyborg is just a destroyer.</v>

2584
01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.030
<v Speaker 3>But what happens when you go forward on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly?</v>

2585
01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:04.290
<v Speaker 3>You get fucking murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the girl like Cyborg coming forward</v>

2586
01:47:04.291 --> 01:47:07.440
<v Speaker 3>is tailor made for Holly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these other girls enjoy that.</v>

2587
01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe enjoy frank the tank Brazilian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know.</v>

2588
01:47:10.321 --> 01:47:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she's bigger and stronger.</v>

2589
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:14.940
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she can take a punishment.</v>

2590
01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:18.330
<v Speaker 3>She did a lot of punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the [inaudible] barge fight</v>

2591
01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 3>in lion fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>

2592
01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:22.010
<v Speaker 3>She fought Sharina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2593
01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:26.070
<v Speaker 3>it was a fucking months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She lost Cyborg gas boss' decision.</v>

2594
01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Well she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it Tko no,</v>

2595
01:47:27.481 --> 01:47:30.600
<v Speaker 3>she lost by decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she got punted in the face.</v>

2596
01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:32.610
<v Speaker 3>She got teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>face face.</v>

2597
01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Barsh is no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2598
01:47:34.261 --> 01:47:36.810
<v Speaker 3>She's one of the best Muay Thai fighters</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the planet world champ.</v>

2599
01:47:36.810 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 3>She's so slick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her style is so good and you know she</v>

2600
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:43.170
<v Speaker 3>has none of the physical attributes at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cyborg has cyborgs,</v>

2601
01:47:43.171 --> 01:47:45.660
<v Speaker 3>just so strong and so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2602
01:47:45.661 --> 01:47:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it's tailor made for Holly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>

2603
01:47:47.391 --> 01:47:49.560
<v Speaker 3>any other girl is fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2604
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that any other girls get</v>

2605
01:47:51.481 --> 01:47:52.650
<v Speaker 3>her titties ripped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2606
01:47:52.730 --> 01:47:55.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I don't want to see.</v>

2607
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:59.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see cyborg fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>diminished so much from the weight cut</v>

2608
01:47:59.911 --> 01:48:01.260
<v Speaker 3>that we don't get to see the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>cyborg.</v>

2609
01:48:01.290 --> 01:48:04.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't these you've been bending enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>draw to create an entire division four</v>

2610
01:48:04.770 --> 01:48:08.980
<v Speaker 3>and breathe out and try cause we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to build up one 15 one 25 right?</v>

2611
01:48:08.981 --> 01:48:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I think there are 35 see I think if</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody's going to do it,</v>

2612
01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:13.500
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a woman who knocks</v>
<v Speaker 3>women out.</v>

2613
01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.810
<v Speaker 3>I think anybody's going to bring light</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the division.</v>

2614
01:48:15.811 --> 01:48:17.310
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be someone that just not</v>
<v Speaker 3>working.</v>

2615
01:48:17.311 --> 01:48:17.761
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2616
01:48:17.761 --> 01:48:19.470
<v Speaker 3>if she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how young prospect,</v>

2617
01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:23.040
<v Speaker 3>I think you invest doesn't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>the level that she's adding comparison</v>

2618
01:48:23.041 --> 01:48:24.990
<v Speaker 3>to the level the other girls are at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

2619
01:48:25.010 --> 01:48:27.990
<v Speaker 3>it's very high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that would change is if</v>

2620
01:48:27.991 --> 01:48:31.200
<v Speaker 3>one of those Moitai checks started</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at Cyborg and went,</v>

2621
01:48:31.230 --> 01:48:32.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2622
01:48:32.521 --> 01:48:34.020
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be so okay.</v>

2623
01:48:34.290 --> 01:48:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is,</v>

2624
01:48:35.251 --> 01:48:36.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not going to take you down.</v>

2625
01:48:36.961 --> 01:48:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Most likely she's going to try to stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

2626
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:42.150
<v Speaker 3>If these girls like really concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the grappling and they really</v>

2627
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:42.960
<v Speaker 3>constant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2628
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.880
<v Speaker 3>six months sprawl training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2629
01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:47.910
<v Speaker 3>now we're years out from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe you got to invest.</v>

2630
01:48:47.911 --> 01:48:49.950
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to invest in that whole trend.</v>

2631
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:52.130
<v Speaker 3>But look at a girl like tiff time bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2632
01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:53.580
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's starting MMA now.</v>

2633
01:48:53.581 --> 01:48:55.260
<v Speaker 3>You know that strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2634
01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Well if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during a prime like Miriam Knock Bodo</v>

2635
01:48:59.490 --> 01:49:04.200
<v Speaker 3>like someone somewhat along those lines</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the really high level female Moy</v>

2636
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Thai champions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be Merkin checks and mm sure.</v>

2637
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:08.400
<v Speaker 3>If they could just keep the fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing.</v>

2638
01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Did there's levels out there and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of striking that we just really</v>

2639
01:49:12.091 --> 01:49:14.840
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of with a,</v>

2640
01:49:14.841 --> 01:49:16.490
<v Speaker 3>with some of the women fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2641
01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:19.620
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's what we saw in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bars fight with Cyborg.</v>

2642
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.950
<v Speaker 3>We saw that super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super high level Moy Tai against the</v>

2643
01:49:22.951 --> 01:49:26.700
<v Speaker 3>marauding style of Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I watched that fight and I said</v>

2644
01:49:26.701 --> 01:49:27.391
<v Speaker 3>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2645
01:49:27.391 --> 01:49:31.350
<v Speaker 3>one amazed at Cyborg has the guts to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take that fight because it's a dangerous</v>

2646
01:49:31.351 --> 01:49:33.120
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wanted to fight bars for like</v>

2647
01:49:33.121 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 3>three fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't get a fight.</v>

2648
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:39.510
<v Speaker 3>And then how off the fact that signboard</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes tremendous punishment and keeps</v>

2649
01:49:39.511 --> 01:49:43.080
<v Speaker 3>going after I was thinking how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people in this division would</v>

2650
01:49:43.081 --> 01:49:43.940
<v Speaker 3>fight this girl?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2651
01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:46.470
<v Speaker 3>holly and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and keep getting knocked down and keep</v>

2652
01:49:46.471 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>jumping back up and attacking.</v>

2653
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of female MMA fighters would</v>

2654
01:49:50.731 --> 01:49:55.731
<v Speaker 1>have been able to even stand in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] only her striking kid bill.</v>

2655
01:49:56.150 --> 01:49:58.700
<v Speaker 1>She's literally the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every other girl with her head would</v>

2656
01:49:58.701 --> 01:50:00.520
<v Speaker 1>have been kicked into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course John Jay check.</v>

2657
01:50:00.521 --> 01:50:02.450
<v Speaker 1>But she's a smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is too small.</v>

2658
01:50:02.451 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

2659
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd think a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the 45 pound division man,</v>

2660
01:50:06.271 --> 01:50:08.740
<v Speaker 1>it could open it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women Only having two division I think</v>

2661
01:50:08.741 --> 01:50:10.360
<v Speaker 1>is weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2662
01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:13.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the time start to 45.</v>

2663
01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:13.840
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2664
01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.950
<v Speaker 1>the inaugural fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2665

<v Speaker 1>I'm not sidebar goes out puts on a show</v>
<v Speaker 1>against Leslie Smith,</v>

2666
01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:20.340
<v Speaker 1>knocks her face off or doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

2667
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:23.200
<v Speaker 1>She loses you don't have a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if she does,</v>

2668
01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:24.340
<v Speaker 1>if she wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

01:52:44.441 --> 01:52:46.060
<v Speaker 1>be expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2735
01:52:46.061 --> 01:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's the biggest star in the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and I hope they work that out</v>

2736
01:52:50.511 --> 01:52:52.980
<v Speaker 1>for UFC 200 would be even better story</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it worked out.</v>

2737
01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:57.080
<v Speaker 1>They do guarantee they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would almost guarantee they do or they</v>

2738
01:52:57.081 --> 01:53:00.200
<v Speaker 1>do a GSP nate diaz fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we got honey dick and then some</v>

2739
01:53:00.201 --> 01:53:02.330
<v Speaker 1>smells fishy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something smells fishy for sure.</v>

2740
01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:04.190
<v Speaker 1>If gsps like what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2741
01:53:04.191 --> 01:53:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I've been training or if they come with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cash that come with that fucking</v>

2742
01:53:07.491 --> 01:53:11.770
<v Speaker 1>reebok makeup money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you I bet you a reebok that was a</v>

2743
01:53:11.771 --> 01:53:16.771
<v Speaker 1>set of reebok pumps and 6 million shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go push it in for this shit in.</v>

2744
01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:20.000
<v Speaker 1>We're all in for GSP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>

2745
01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I bet they figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2746
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Bet Yukon or ends up fighting in UFC</v>

2747
01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:24.523
<v Speaker 1>200</v>

2748
01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:27.910
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I believe in and that's,</v>

2749
01:53:27.911 --> 01:53:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I think Dana and the UFC brass is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure it out.</v>

2750
01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I think GSP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz takes its place and they use</v>

2751
01:53:33.911 --> 01:53:37.090
<v Speaker 1>it as a negotiating tool because the pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>per view numbers are bigger than any of</v>

2752
01:53:37.091 --> 01:53:40.780
<v Speaker 1>the connor fights because the UFC has in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact grown through their strategy.</v>

2753
01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:43.330
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the numbers beat Connors.</v>

2754
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:45.400
<v Speaker 1>What if they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you get then,</v>

2755
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:48.130
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then connor's GSP and nate Diaz that</v>

2756
01:53:48.131 --> 01:53:48.820
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2757
01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:49.950
<v Speaker 1>connor fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2758
01:53:49.951 --> 01:53:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'd beat those numbers</v>

2759
01:53:53.321 --> 01:53:56.200
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So osps best chance for this weekend.</v>

2760
01:53:56.201 --> 01:53:59.080
<v Speaker 1>He's got to win by knockout first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

2761
01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That first round,</v>

2762
01:54:00.041 --> 01:54:02.080
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have to fucking caution in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind.</v>

2763
01:54:02.230 --> 01:54:06.070
<v Speaker 1>If he tried to sit there and fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2764
01:54:06.071 --> 01:54:09.280
<v Speaker 1>like on the outside and out technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Jones,</v>

2765
01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be interesting to see</v>

2766
01:54:11.771 --> 01:54:14.410
<v Speaker 1>John with such a long layoff too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of pressure on them.</v>

2767
01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.540
<v Speaker 1>But I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I think's going to happen.</v>

2768
01:54:16.541 --> 01:54:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just me speculating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2769
01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:22.330
<v Speaker 1>and I've trained with both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think John Will.</v>

2770
01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:25.690
<v Speaker 1>They'll feel each other out early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John's going to get ahold of them,</v>

2771
01:54:25.691 --> 01:54:28.540
<v Speaker 1>trip them down the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crucify him and tk on with elbows.</v>

2772
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:31.490
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2773
01:54:31.590 --> 01:54:33.760

<v Speaker 1>I bet John Finch to them on the ground.</v>
