<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends that like legitimately lost their mind.</v>

6
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk to them anymore.</v>

7
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

8
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>like you would talk to them about events and his version of events were just</v>

9
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:11.971
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

10
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>so not what actually happened.</v>

11
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

12
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

13
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>this is the person that's lost their marbles.</v>

14
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

16
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:18.691
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

17
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>You can temporarily lose your marbles remanent luncheon or permanently.</v>

18
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>But I think that like,</v>

20
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

21
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.201
<v Speaker 1>yes permanently.</v>

22
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's like,</v>

23
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

24
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying through psychedelics either.</v>

25
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.063
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

26
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.671
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>

27
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Just saying people that just can't keep it together anymore and for whatever</v>

28
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

29
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a combination of life,</v>

30
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>stress and biological situation,</v>

31
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they've got going on,</v>

32
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>uniquely in their own brain.</v>

34
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>But some people just all of a sudden not there anymore.</v>

35
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Not keeping it together.</v>

36
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Do they think they're keeping it together?</v>

37
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.781
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

38
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's broad,</v>

40
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.203
<v Speaker 1>broad range,</v>

41
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of,</v>

43
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

44
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:52.881
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

45
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:53.701
<v Speaker 1>it sucks man.</v>

46
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:54.241
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

47
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>the brain is an organ and it malfunctions and,</v>

48
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you go nuts.</v>

49
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

50
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>and you get stigmatized for it,</v>

51
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>which really sucks because if you like,</v>

52
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>because that just adds to the problem.</v>

53
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

54
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

56
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>you see somebody in a cast and you're like,</v>

57
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.711
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

58
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:11.521
<v Speaker 1>what happened to your arm?</v>

59
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.091
<v Speaker 1>And they'll tell you,</v>

60
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:12.331
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

61
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:12.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:12.901
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

63
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.734
<v Speaker 1>I fell down.</v>

64
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.151
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

65
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:14.351
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

66
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>you talked to someone who's been like hospitalized for a few weeks and they tell</v>

67
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>you I had to go to the hospital.</v>

68
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I had a nervous breakdown.</v>

69
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I went crazy shit,</v>

70
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>my pants and through my dog throw window,</v>

71
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.913
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

72
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

73
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

75
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.531
<v Speaker 1>you'll want,</v>

76
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>you want to be compassionate,</v>

77
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>but there's some part of you that's like,</v>

78
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

79
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>now this is a crazy person.</v>

80
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

81
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just something happened.</v>

82
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>The operating system temporarily crashed.</v>

83
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And quite often I think that could be a very good thing.</v>

84
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that having your,</v>

85
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.600
<v Speaker 1>your personality or your ego or crash can often mean that you were trying to be</v>

86
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>somebody that you aren't.</v>

87
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And some people invest so much energy,</v>

88
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>so much energy into trying to find me.</v>

89
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>They just want to be some thing.</v>

91
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>You know they they it,</v>

92
00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>since there were a kid there,</v>

93
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>mother was telling them,</v>

94
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>you should be like this,</v>

95
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>and then they try to be like this and they hold up this thing.</v>

96
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>They're always working to hold up this giant tail feather and a,</v>

97
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>their arms start shaking and that they can't hold it up and that's when they</v>

98
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 1>have like anger outbursts are suddenly like their friends are like you.</v>

99
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>You turned into someone that I've never met.</v>

100
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know who that is.</v>

101
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.581
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

102
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

103
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.961
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

104
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you met them.</v>

105
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>You met underneath the tail feather,</v>

106
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>the seeding.</v>

107
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:31.071
<v Speaker 1>See anger and disappointment and sadness that you met.</v>

108
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>That thing that they're trying to avoid by looking up at this mask,</v>

109
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>they're holding up to the world,</v>

110
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>but that fucking seeding,</v>

111
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>see of disappointment,</v>

112
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>anger and horror and sadness.</v>

113
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's at,</v>

114
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

115
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>You got to go into that thing and it's for some people,</v>

116
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>the only way they can go into that is by having a full scale nervous breakdown</v>

117
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>because then they can have permission to dive into that,</v>

118
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>into that awful vortex of darkness because underneath that vortex of darkness is</v>

119
00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.643
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>

120
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Underneath that that's love and happiness and joy and connection and tranquility</v>

121
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff and everyone's thinks that the way to get to that point is by</v>

122
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:13.561
<v Speaker 1>avoiding this awful black forest that surrounds the garden of Eden,</v>

123
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>which is inside everybody.</v>

124
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It's inside everybody.</v>

125
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.253
<v Speaker 1>It's there,</v>

126
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>it's there and it doesn't matter.</v>

127
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>You know you can work out and that will definitely give you a temporarily</v>

128
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>temporary good feeling,</v>

129
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>but until you address the internal structures that you haven't acknowledged,</v>

130
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>you're always going to go back to that place where you find yourself morose and</v>

131
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>depressed and angry and you don't know why.</v>

132
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>You always go back to that place until you sit with the sadness inside of you.</v>

133
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to do that.</v>

134
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>What you're describing is coming out of the closet.</v>

135
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

136
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of people that is what it is.</v>

137
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:47.261
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

138
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>it's coming out of the closet and there's a lot of closets and there's not just</v>

139
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.200
<v Speaker 1>the gay closet,</v>

140
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

141
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of closet.</v>

142
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>There's the artists closet.</v>

143
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Some people are fucking accountants.</v>

144
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>They're wearing suits and their ties on tight and they're fucking like organized</v>

145
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and disciplined.</v>

146
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>But inside they're probably painters.</v>

147
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>They probably want to fucking paint.</v>

148
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>They want to paint Dayglo mountains down at the beach.</v>

149
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what they really are.</v>

150
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>But their daddy or their mommy wanted them to be a good little businessman.</v>

151
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So they became this thing that's the opposite of what they are.</v>

152
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>This is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita.</v>

153
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.731
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

154
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>forgive me cause I've quoted it way too many times,</v>

155
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

156
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be an honest street sweeper than a dishonest king.</v>

157
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>It's better to be a happy guy brushing fucking leafs up the street than it is to</v>

158
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>be some zillionaire who inside is dying or numb or miserable.</v>

159
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Mostly Numb,</v>

160
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.841
<v Speaker 1>numbs the word.</v>

161
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:38.674
<v Speaker 1>Most people are just,</v>

162
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Speaker 2>as long as these people can quantify on paper,</v>

163
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I still have a x million dollar home.</v>

164
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:48.420
<v Speaker 2>My car is still cost x thousand dollars this suit is an ex suit.</v>

165
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I am still ahead.</v>

166
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I am not going to abandon all these things.</v>

167
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 2>As long as they don't see through the bullshit of the game,</v>

168
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 2>they think they're winning.</v>

169
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 2>They have to fall.</v>

170
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.570
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you have to fall to,</v>

172
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.630
<v Speaker 2>to really,</v>

173
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.920
<v Speaker 2>that's what you got to appreciate those moments when it all falls apart on you</v>

174
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.230
<v Speaker 2>because that means you've got an opportunity to try it again.</v>

175
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

176
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.660
<v Speaker 2>let's take a new fresh perspective.</v>

177
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>This is the cool thing that at this retreat I went to this Guy Jack Cornfield's</v>

178
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:13.911
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

179
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:15.650
<v Speaker 1>which I really loved and a great name by the way.</v>

180
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>With a k not a c,</v>

182
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Jack Kornfield,</v>

183
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.380
<v Speaker 1>mortal Kombat k Jack Cornfield.</v>

184
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.041
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

185
00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:22.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 1>he's really cool man.</v>

187
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>But he was cool with the kid.</v>

188
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.770
<v Speaker 1>He's like the cigarettes.</v>

189
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

190
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.230
<v Speaker 1>this guy was awesome.</v>

191
00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Speaker 1>And he was one of the things he talked about his in some religious tradition,</v>

192
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.530
<v Speaker 1>how they like hold the scriptures a rabbi.</v>

193
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:36.741
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

194
00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:39.260
<v Speaker 1>how does students hold the scriptures over their heart?</v>

195
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.041
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

196
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:40.874
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.400
<v Speaker 1>when they were memorizing them and they would say,</v>

198
00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:44.211
<v Speaker 1>why do we do this?</v>

199
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:44.571
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

200
00:05:44.571 --> 00:05:45.740
<v Speaker 1>so that when your heartbreaks,</v>

201
00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:46.640
<v Speaker 1>they'll fall in.</v>

202
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's a beautiful idea,</v>

203
00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:52.010
<v Speaker 1>which is that heartbreak is actually your ego cracking.</v>

204
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 1>And the moment that cracks,</v>

205
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.580
<v Speaker 1>you're in the experience of truth.</v>

206
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in the experience of,</v>

207
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>that's when you can really become who you are.</v>

208
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

209
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>but to get to who you are,</v>

210
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.111
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you know,</v>

211
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>on a bone heals the wrong way.</v>

212
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what a lot of people's entire personality is.</v>

213
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bone that grew the wrong way and that needs a fucking</v>

214
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.060
<v Speaker 2>check,</v>

215
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.740
<v Speaker 2>a snap or a crack,</v>

216
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:14.551
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

218
00:06:14.551 --> 00:06:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you get that through slot,</v>

219
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.981
<v Speaker 2>you need that,</v>

220
00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:18.270
<v Speaker 2>that initial fucking thing.</v>

221
00:06:18.271 --> 00:06:20.610
<v Speaker 2>And it's a beautiful analogy and it hurts.</v>

222
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.691
<v Speaker 1>It hurts.</v>

223
00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:23.250
<v Speaker 1>But we're paying avoiding creatures.</v>

224
00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:24.040
<v Speaker 1>So we think that,</v>

225
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.070
<v Speaker 1>so we're always running away from this pain.</v>

226
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.220
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is as we're running away from pain,</v>

227
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.740
<v Speaker 1>we're still exactly in pain.</v>

228
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.040
<v Speaker 1>It's basically like being on fire and running away from water.</v>

229
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.110
<v Speaker 1>You're just running away from the water because you,</v>

230
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.811
<v Speaker 2>for some,</v>

231
00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:38.171
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

232
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:41.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid analogy actually for great.</v>

233
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Up until that,</v>

234
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.533
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

235
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot of great points.</v>

236
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.850
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

237
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.770
<v Speaker 2>You know there's the monster in the dark and the faster you run,</v>

238
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:50.500
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you are to run into something that's actually going to hurt you</v>

239
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.210
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to turning around and saying,</v>

240
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.751
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

241
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:53.584
<v Speaker 2>There is no monster,</v>

242
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.211
<v Speaker 2>no monster.</v>

243
00:06:54.211 --> 00:06:54.401
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

244
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:56.950
<v Speaker 2>But you're never get to know that until you stop and turn around.</v>

245
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.560
<v Speaker 2>In some cases people don't have the discipline or the the assistance or the</v>

246
00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 2>balls to stop and turn around so they have to trip over something and then</v>

247
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

248
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.843
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

249
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.410
<v Speaker 2>that's the classic story.</v>

250
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Classic story of someone hiding a secret and going completely out of control</v>

251
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:14.050
<v Speaker 2>because of the pressure of hiding that.</v>

252
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the Ted Haggerty who's the secretly gay guy who's preaching against</v>

253
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:19.780
<v Speaker 2>gay people.</v>

254
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Ted Haggard and Colorado.</v>

255
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I was snorting meth off his gay lovers.</v>

256
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

257
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

258
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.410
<v Speaker 2>We was just going so far the other way.</v>

259
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:32.190
<v Speaker 2>He just so off the rails crazy himself.</v>

260
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 2>He's being himself.</v>

261
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.130
<v Speaker 2>He was a guy who likes to snort math off of Cox.</v>

262
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I still a little math and he likes to,</v>

263
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

264
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a few Cox,</v>

265
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.380
<v Speaker 2>but I would say he wasn't being himself.</v>

266
00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:42.970
<v Speaker 2>What I would say is that his,</v>

267
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:48.030
<v Speaker 2>his behavior was so extreme because he was seeking balance between that and the</v>

268
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.650
<v Speaker 2>other bull shit in his life.</v>

269
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if he weren't living that,</v>

270
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.560
<v Speaker 2>he'd be right in the middle,</v>

271
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

272
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Well to give,</v>

274
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.020
<v Speaker 1>but to get to the middle,</v>

275
00:07:56.021 --> 00:07:59.470
<v Speaker 1>you know the way to get to the middle weirdly is whatever the behavior is that</v>

276
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:03.520
<v Speaker 1>you're doing that you're so horrified about and terrified of sometimes that</v>

277
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.050
<v Speaker 1>they're really weird ideas.</v>

278
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>This is like something that I liked that Ron says,</v>

279
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:08.891
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

280
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>

281
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.180
<v Speaker 1>If you don't feel like meditating,</v>

282
00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:11.014
<v Speaker 1>don't meditate.</v>

283
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.071
<v Speaker 1>Don't force it.</v>

284
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Don't impose this on yourself.</v>

285
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Keep doing the thing you're doing that's upsetting you so much.</v>

286
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Have the balls to keep doing the fucking thing that you're doing.</v>

287
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Keep doing it.</v>

288
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.050
<v Speaker 1>If society is going to tell you,</v>

289
00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:24.010
<v Speaker 1>don't be like this,</v>

290
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.180
<v Speaker 1>stop being like this.</v>

291
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:26.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to change.</v>

292
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what your parents always say.</v>

293
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.320
<v Speaker 1>The idea is like no,</v>

294
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.890
<v Speaker 1>sink into what you are right now.</v>

295
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Just be that thing.</v>

296
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Stop resisting exactly where you are right now is perfect.</v>

297
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:43.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's a hard truth to grasp because you think right away,</v>

298
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:43.991
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>

299
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:44.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

300
00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:45.910
<v Speaker 1>What about fucking Jeffrey Dahmer?</v>

301
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Is he perfect?</v>

302
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

303
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:48.490
<v Speaker 1>what about the leopard?</v>

304
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.130
<v Speaker 1>When you're seeing a leopard rip apart a creature?</v>

305
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Is that thing per,</v>

306
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.380
<v Speaker 1>is that a perfect moment?</v>

307
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:54.671
<v Speaker 1>It fucks them.</v>

308
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:55.504
<v Speaker 1>And then him.</v>

309
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

310
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.491
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

311
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:57.324
<v Speaker 2>Ducks do.</v>

312
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Docs or necrophilia acts.</v>

313
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Are they fucking evil creatures?</v>

314
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.523
<v Speaker 2>We think they are.</v>

315
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 2>They are made that Phil Robertson Guy,</v>

316
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 2>very famous person,</v>

317
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.010
<v Speaker 2>cause he invented a call for them.</v>

318
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 2>And now poor gay people have to hear that a man's anus is not as good as a</v>

319
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 2>woman's vagina.</v>

320
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if you made the choice for a man's anus and you hear this</v>

321
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 2>fucking big bearded Fashionista with his,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

323
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Cammo on a Bandana is absolutely fascinating.</v>

324
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.781
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>

325
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of that.</v>

326
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Big bearded Christian Bible Slang Fashionista.</v>

327
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

328
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 2>he tells you that your choice was incorrect.</v>

329
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:29.911
<v Speaker 2>That in fact,</v>

330
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 2>the woman's vagina is the better choice.</v>

331
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 2>The man's anus.</v>

332
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:33.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

333
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 2>come on guys,</v>

334
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 2>but how can you say that if you haven't experienced it?</v>

335
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:38.651
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

336
00:09:38.651 --> 00:09:39.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

337
00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I think he has a,</v>

338
00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:40.351
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

339
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 2>the balance theory,</v>

340
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I think he's so outspoken on that issue.</v>

341
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Like most of these homophobes are because they're home jerking off to gay porn,</v>

342
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

343
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you just don't give a shit.</v>

344
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't actually matter.</v>

345
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:53.064
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

346
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't come up in a GQ interview duffing thing.</v>

347
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:56.281
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

348
00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:56.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like Duh.</v>

349
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Already.</v>

350
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 2>If you really care if people are gay,</v>

351
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Duh,</v>

352
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:00.881
<v Speaker 2>you really care.</v>

354
00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 2>The two guys love each other and that you are you against love.</v>

355
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

356
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Love if it's a man and a woman.</v>

357
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:05.821
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

358
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:06.930

00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:08.184
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

361
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.760
<v Speaker 2>it's done.</v>

362
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.870
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about men's anuses in Gq,</v>

363
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.381
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

364
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:15.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe you've got some issues to think about.</v>

365
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't we just be talking about ducks,</v>

366
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.151
<v Speaker 2>ducks,</v>

367
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 2>any this season that your whole,</v>

368
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:20.274
<v Speaker 2>she knows the ducks.</v>

369
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 2>You shoot ducks all the time.</v>

370
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:23.071
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

371
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 2>That's your thing.</v>

372
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's just talk about murdering ducks.</v>

373
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:25.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

374
00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Why you got to talk about men's asshole ragging this in the blood stacks.</v>

375
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

376
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 2>the only way you can live that fake life as if it's fake.</v>

377
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.741
<v Speaker 2>The actual,</v>

378
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

379
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:35.551
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

380
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:35.910
<v Speaker 2>this I,</v>

381
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 2>this puritanical ideal that they've held up.</v>

382
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not natural and they haven't been really living in any way they've been</v>

383
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be living.</v>

384
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 2>It would be freaks in this sort of a rebound sort of a way to balance everything</v>

385
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

386
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think that ultimately that's being exposed over and over and over and over</v>

387
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 2>again to the point where it's not going to be a viable option anymore.</v>

388
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Like powdered wigs aren't a viable option and you can't wear a fucking powdered</v>

389
00:10:58.441 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 2>wig.</v>

390
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.671
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

391
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 2>and you can't pretend you're this,</v>

392
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:02.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

393
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Rick Santorum,</v>

394
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:04.404
<v Speaker 2>guy that you know,</v>

395
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 2>just as a good man who believes in the Bible and doesn't want to see gays</v>

396
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:09.204
<v Speaker 2>getting married,</v>

397
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to ruin the institution of marriage with homosexual activity that's</v>

398
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 2>been shunned upon in the Bible quote.</v>

399
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

400
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.000
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

401
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.870
<v Speaker 2>fucking crime.</v>

402
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>

403
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.191
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

404
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

405
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 2>What's going on behind the scenes with you cat?</v>

406
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.850
<v Speaker 2>What is in your head then I keep waiting for it to get to that point where</v>

407
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:31.851
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's got a big problem with homosexuality is by default admitting to</v>

408
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 2>their own homosexual life.</v>

409
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 2>But I've been waiting 30 years for America to go,</v>

410
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:37.591
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

411
00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 2>This is too silly to be real.</v>

412
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:39.961
<v Speaker 2>Ronald Reagan,</v>

413
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:40.590
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding?</v>

414
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>That guy was such a joke.</v>

415
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.411
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

416
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>he's St Ronald and the seeds planted 30 years ago.</v>

417
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

418
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.023
<v Speaker 2>even then,</v>

419
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 2>even then,</v>

420
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 2>there was voted for him.</v>

421
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.431
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

422
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 2>do you remember the criticism though?</v>

423
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:54.910
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty open.</v>

424
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of people that didn't like him.</v>

425
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.310
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he was an odd,</v>

426
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.880
<v Speaker 2>not enough that he didn't win 49 out of 50 states in Israel election.</v>

427
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

428
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:02.681
<v Speaker 2>well listen man,</v>

429
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

430
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

431
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>he didn't dominate the vast majority of the,</v>

432
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:07.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

433
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:07.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

434
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of idiots back then,</v>

435
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 2>but the difference between the way people look at them now and the way people</v>

436
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:15.110
<v Speaker 2>looked at him then now it's almost all glowing when people talk about ranking,</v>

437
00:12:15.111 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 2>and I hardly ever hear any criticism.</v>

438
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

439
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:21.440
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear about Iran Contra Nicaragua and El Salvador and all of the crazy</v>

440
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.653
<v Speaker 2>all over north,</v>

441
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 2>all over and all that craziness.</v>

442
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:25.114
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

443
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.343
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

444
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.401
<v Speaker 2>But my point,</v>

445
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 2>my point is that this idea of it suddenly we're going to wake up and realize how</v>

446
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous it is.</v>

447
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

448
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Rick Santorum is too ridiculous to be real fucking what's her name's Sarah</v>

449
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Pailin.</v>

450
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

451
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

452
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I am amazed that how flexible the reality muscle seems to be,</v>

453
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 2>that people are willing to accept this stuff that Frank Zappa was laughing about</v>

454
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:49.594
<v Speaker 2>40 years ago.</v>

455
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

456
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they are accepting it though.</v>

457
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:52.091
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

458
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that you watch these shows enough and it creates the illusion of</v>

459
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:55.864
<v Speaker 1>acceptance.</v>

460
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>But then if you,</v>

461
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.140
<v Speaker 1>if w anywhere on the internet or any,</v>

462
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you just see this constant rebellion against that kind of,</v>

463
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

464
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.361
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

465
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:05.111
<v Speaker 1>square,</v>

466
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:05.921
<v Speaker 1>mainstream,</v>

467
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:06.820
<v Speaker 1>homophobic,</v>

468
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.530
<v Speaker 1>angry personality and,</v>

469
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 1>but you watch Fox News and yeah,</v>

470
00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 1>you watch Fox News.</v>

471
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Are you watching anything on TV?</v>

472
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's an illusion.</v>

473
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:14.651
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

474
00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 1>you watch the commercials,</v>

475
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:17.320
<v Speaker 1>everything's is big illusion.</v>

476
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:21.720
<v Speaker 1>You watch the commercials and it's like people go in and buy a car and make it</v>

477
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.421
<v Speaker 1>seems normal.</v>

478
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:26.200
<v Speaker 1>It seems totally normal that people are going in to get deeply in debt to the</v>

479
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:26.591
<v Speaker 1>banks.</v>

480
00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>That all seems incredibly normal.</v>

481
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>But then more and more on the Internet you see like,</v>

482
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

483
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 1>people rebelling against this and showing how the bankers,</v>

484
00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:39.270
<v Speaker 1>like the whole system is this fucked up thing and emerging things like bitcoin.</v>

485
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 1>What's your like slowly moving the energy away from it?</v>

486
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:43.121
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

487
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what you mean.</v>

488
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to be a sudden thing.</v>

489
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be more like a,</v>

490
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>just a gradual shift is people just stop watching TV.</v>

491
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:52.181
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

492
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen.</v>

493
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:54.040
<v Speaker 1>People are just gonna you know,</v>

494
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I drive down the street billboards for fucking,</v>

495
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

496
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 1>like amazon.com shows,</v>

497
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:00.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

498
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 1>like billboards for shows that aren't really controlled by these big networks.</v>

499
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.041
<v Speaker 1>Netflix,</v>

500
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:05.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

501
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

502
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

503
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.780
<v Speaker 1>But it's an Amazon,</v>

504
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:09.070
<v Speaker 1>just another big network.</v>

505
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

506
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if it's a network or it's an international conglomerate or</v>

508
00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:14.711
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

509
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>It's big money.</v>

510
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.031
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

511
00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>but you're right,</v>

512
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:17.690
<v Speaker 2>but that's just the bill.</v>

513
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

514
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.070
<v Speaker 2>The reality is it's that,</v>

515
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.661
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

516
00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:21.321
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

517
00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:23.750
<v Speaker 2>it's not right because the media is a very different thing.</v>

518
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.580
<v Speaker 2>The media where you talking about television,</v>

519
00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:28.220
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a very hard thing to get into the medium.</v>

520
00:14:28.221 --> 00:14:29.060
<v Speaker 2>When you're talking about an inner,</v>

521
00:14:29.061 --> 00:14:31.370
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about an incredibly easy thing to get into.</v>

522
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Literally open to almost anyone with an internet connection.</v>

523
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.430
<v Speaker 2>You can make a youtube video doesn't cost you a god damn dime.</v>

524
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

525
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.080
<v Speaker 2>You have a laptop that has a camera on it.</v>

526
00:14:39.081 --> 00:14:39.711
<v Speaker 2>You talk into it,</v>

527
00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:41.390
<v Speaker 2>you make a youtube video that,</v>

528
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:41.811
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

529
00:14:41.811 --> 00:14:42.590
<v Speaker 2>that's a big change.</v>

530
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.330
<v Speaker 2>That's not just a big change.</v>

531
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.490
<v Speaker 2>That might be the biggest change in human history.</v>

532
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.860
<v Speaker 2>It might be the biggest change since a monkey ate a mushroom.</v>

533
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

534
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Certainly since the printing,</v>

535
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>the printing press was a major for sure.</v>

536
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Giant,</v>

537
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:55.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

538
00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:55.181
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

539
00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:56.680
<v Speaker 2>and similar in the sense that it,</v>

540
00:14:56.681 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 2>it took the power of communication away from very few and gave it to a lot more</v>

541
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.650
<v Speaker 2>right in,</v>

542
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.940
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of one of the more fascinating things about this is that there is,</v>

543
00:15:06.941 --> 00:15:07.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

544
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 2>even if Amazon does,</v>

545
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.190
<v Speaker 2>but something online,</v>

546
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 2>it's no better than I Justine who has like,</v>

547
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:13.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

548
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:16.120
<v Speaker 2>45 fucking billion followers and she,</v>

549
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 2>every video she put there,</v>

550
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 2>there's people like that that just became famous for the Internet.</v>

551
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

552
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Jenna marbles is another one,</v>

553
00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

554
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

555
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 2>she's got like millions and millions and millions of hits.</v>

556
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.101
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

557
00:15:26.101 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

558
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:26.911
<v Speaker 1>Here's what it is.</v>

559
00:15:26.911 --> 00:15:27.391
<v Speaker 1>Here's what it is.</v>

560
00:15:27.391 --> 00:15:27.721
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>

561
00:15:27.721 --> 00:15:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd just been reading Sheldrake's new book,</v>

562
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

563
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.890
<v Speaker 1>science set free and he talks about morphic resonance or something.</v>

564
00:15:34.891 --> 00:15:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And I know you have some,</v>

565
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I think you've,</v>

566
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 1>you're skeptical about Sheldrake,</v>

567
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

568
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

569
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

570
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you've just have TV,</v>

571
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.960
<v Speaker 1>TV's a tuning fork and when there was no internet and it was just TV and it was</v>

572
00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:47.820
<v Speaker 1>a depiction of here's what a family looks like,</v>

573
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.110
<v Speaker 1>here's what people tend to,</v>

574
00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a corporation saying here's what people do when they're healthy.</v>

575
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.360
<v Speaker 1>And that creates a tuning fork effect,</v>

576
00:15:54.361 --> 00:15:54.811
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

577
00:15:54.811 --> 00:15:55.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're watching it enough,</v>

578
00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:00.000
<v Speaker 1>you're going to either resonate with or are in and feel like,</v>

579
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:00.331
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

580
00:16:00.331 --> 00:16:01.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing great.</v>

581
00:16:01.141 --> 00:16:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I have a wife and a house and a car and a job and that's great.</v>

582
00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm in tune with what everyone else is doing.</v>

583
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.160
<v Speaker 1>But that's an illusion.</v>

584
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.140
<v Speaker 1>That's never been what everyone else is doing.</v>

585
00:16:10.141 --> 00:16:13.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just what massive conglomerates are sending out there.</v>

586
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

587
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.090
<v Speaker 1>either in the form of hypnotic content that keeps you glued to your seat.</v>

588
00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:21.690
<v Speaker 1>As you watch corporations try to get you in debt to buy cars.</v>

589
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

590
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:22.381
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

591
00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:22.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

592
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.401
<v Speaker 1>it's generally,</v>

593
00:16:23.401 --> 00:16:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

594
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:24.331
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

595
00:16:24.331 --> 00:16:24.631
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

596
00:16:24.631 --> 00:16:25.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

597
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.520
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is just,</v>

598
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:26.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

599
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

600
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.550
<v Speaker 1>tuning all of society,</v>

601
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

602
00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:33.210
<v Speaker 1>in a way that society maybe isn't meant to be tuned at all.</v>

603
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And so with the Internet now you have all these different smaller tuning forks.</v>

604
00:16:37.321 --> 00:16:37.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

605
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.630
<v Speaker 1>your podcast is a tuning fork.</v>

606
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.440
<v Speaker 1>People tune in to the stuff that you talk about and the different people that</v>

607
00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you bring on the podcast,</v>

608
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.230
<v Speaker 1>send out information that causes a new kind of tuning to start happening.</v>

609
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's why when you watch like Huckabee,</v>

610
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.740
<v Speaker 1>you'd really feel like you're like listening to somebody sing off key cause</v>

611
00:16:55.741 --> 00:16:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you're not resonating,</v>

612
00:16:56.611 --> 00:16:57.450
<v Speaker 1>you're not resonating.</v>

613
00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:59.340
<v Speaker 1>You've been tuned into a whole different thing,</v>

614
00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:00.390
<v Speaker 1>which is what the internets,</v>

615
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the major things the Internet has done,</v>

616
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:03.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

617
00:17:03.601 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 1>you get these communities read it,</v>

618
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.860
<v Speaker 1>you can get tuned into the reddit frequency quite easily,</v>

619
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.810
<v Speaker 1>where suddenly it all just starts making sense.</v>

620
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And that is why the,</v>

621
00:17:11.401 --> 00:17:11.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:17:11.761 --> 00:17:15.390
<v Speaker 1>the duck dynasty guy or any of these Weirdos who are,</v>

623
00:17:15.391 --> 00:17:16.224
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

624
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

625
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.140
<v Speaker 1>are just ultimately just angry people.</v>

626
00:17:19.141 --> 00:17:22.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why they seem so fucking crazy.</v>

627
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Or they play angry people on TV.</v>

628
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:26.251
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

629
00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think a lot of these people aren't even,</v>

630
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:28.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

631
00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:30.700
<v Speaker 2>like in politics dynasty guy,</v>

632
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.760
<v Speaker 2>the duck dynasty guy has been giving speeches like that for years that these</v>

633
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.140
<v Speaker 2>biblical retreats and stuff,</v>

634
00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:36.800
<v Speaker 2>he's been doing that for this video.</v>

635
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

636
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.020
<v Speaker 2>this is real schtick.</v>

637
00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:39.850
<v Speaker 2>He's not fire and brimstone.</v>

638
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.140
<v Speaker 2>God fearing Christian man who was living on the wrong side of the law and Jesus</v>

639
00:17:44.141 --> 00:17:47.350
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time and then turn it all around and wants to let everybody know</v>

640
00:17:47.351 --> 00:17:48.550
<v Speaker 2>about the evils of sin.</v>

641
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 2>He's an old dummy.</v>

642
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.993
<v Speaker 2>That's what he is.</v>

643
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.880
<v Speaker 2>He's an old dominion.</v>

644
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Loved their scientific name for him.</v>

645
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 2>He's an old dummy to probably just one time,</v>

646
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 2>sucked a dick and liked it way too much.</v>

647
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 2>If someone sucked his dick and it's his favorite moment.</v>

648
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

649
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 2>it looks back on his childhood and he's turned it into,</v>

650
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

651
00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:04.600
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

652
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I bet he was hunting ducks when it happened.</v>

653
00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I bet he was hiring that duck blind.</v>

654
00:18:08.111 --> 00:18:10.750
<v Speaker 1>They're all liquored up and moonshine and cozy hunting ducks.</v>

655

<v Speaker 2>Need to kill ducks.</v>

673
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something like that happened,</v>

674
00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:48.711
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

675
00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that happen,</v>

676
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:51.180
<v Speaker 1>but you know man,</v>

677
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.060
<v Speaker 1>like what you do with with,</v>

678
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.440
<v Speaker 1>sex at dawn creates a resonance where it's like it's a,</v>

680
00:18:57.441 --> 00:18:59.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a shame reliever.</v>

681
00:18:59.511 --> 00:19:00.111
<v Speaker 1>It's a shame.</v>

682
00:19:00.111 --> 00:19:00.821
<v Speaker 1>Reduce her man.</v>

683
00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:01.654
<v Speaker 1>Because your book,</v>

684
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it has been,</v>

685
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.740
<v Speaker 1>it's such a compassionate book for people who are stuck in monogamous</v>

686
00:19:06.741 --> 00:19:11.450
<v Speaker 1>relationships and feel guilty about the fact that they are attracted to other</v>

687
00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:15.890
<v Speaker 1>people and that's like that guilt used to be a normal guilt that was actually</v>

688
00:19:15.891 --> 00:19:16.460
<v Speaker 1>considered like,</v>

689
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:16.581
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

690
00:19:16.581 --> 00:19:18.560
<v Speaker 1>something must be going wrong with your relationship.</v>

691
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking about fucking other people and your book,</v>

692
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.700
<v Speaker 1>it show us like,</v>

693
00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:23.061
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

694
00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:26.300
<v Speaker 1>actually that's just nature happening through you.</v>

695
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to feel guilty about it or like something's off balance in you.</v>

696
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:31.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just completely normal.</v>

697
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you have to go and fuck other people,</v>

698
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.460
<v Speaker 1>but at least now you don't have to feel like I must not love or anymore or she</v>

699
00:19:37.461 --> 00:19:38.780
<v Speaker 1>must not love me anymore.</v>

700
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.590
<v Speaker 2>What's that have to do with fucking docs,</v>

701
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.030
<v Speaker 2>country music songs.</v>

702
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the glue,</v>

703
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:49.370
<v Speaker 2>the glue that connects these two fucking ducks and the sadness you have for not</v>

704
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:50.620
<v Speaker 2>wanting to be monogamy.</v>

705
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the glue that keeps it all together.</v>

706
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 2>It's the glue that holds the,</v>

707
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.990
<v Speaker 2>that's why you need listen to Phil Robertson and that,</v>

708
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.990
<v Speaker 2>that God damn communist and he that puts them on,</v>
