5
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're allowed to fuck in front of a camera.</v>

6
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're Amish.</v>

7

<v Speaker 1>I had some issues.</v>

43
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:04.101
<v Speaker 1>I had some situations in my life and I like to put numbers on things and based</v>

44
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>on these factors and experiences and thought processes,</v>

45

51
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you just said.</v>

52
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>What you just said was a statement that would really work if everybody knew what</v>

53
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.494
<v Speaker 1>you were saying,</v>

54

00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:29.904
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

58
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean you're 10% gay?</v>

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's also based on when you were in the Philippines or a Taiwan,</v>

75
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.453
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it's actually not that much.</v>

150
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

151
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that.</v>

152
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.290
<v Speaker 1>So they have a few areas like that.</v>

153
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.640
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the westerners hang out and go there.</v>

154
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.241
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>

155
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:03.991
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

156
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:04.650
<v Speaker 1>It's simple,</v>

157
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

158
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.150
<v Speaker 1>It's simple.</v>

159
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And then you go upstairs and then it's a little different.</v>

160
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>You're getting a little like,</v>

161
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.850
<v Speaker 1>well that looks a little different in there that the bone structure's</v>

162
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.431
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

163
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>But I see some other people dancing.</v>

164
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this one club that you go in and it's like,</v>

165
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I guess the best one up there.</v>

166
00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

167
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.790
<v Speaker 1>they're having a party.</v>

168
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:27.810
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

169
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.320
<v Speaker 1>The girls look like girls.</v>

170
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>But you can tell like maybe some are guys I gas,</v>

171
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but it was one of these lady boy bars and were hanging out there having fun and</v>

172
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.811
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

173
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:40.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:40.680
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

175
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.121
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

176
00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:42.330
<v Speaker 1>they will touch you.</v>

177
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>They're very forward.</v>

178
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>They will touch your leg.</v>

179
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:46.830
<v Speaker 1>But they looked like girls.</v>

180
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.180
<v Speaker 1>They smell like girls.</v>

181
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.100
<v Speaker 1>They look like girls.</v>

182
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Dave had the treatments and you're sitting there and you're alone by yourself.</v>

183
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:56.791
<v Speaker 1>You're in,</v>

184
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>you're in Bangkok,</v>

185
00:04:58.111 --> 00:05:00.060
<v Speaker 1>you're working on hangover too.</v>

186
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.070
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

187
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>touch and it,</v>

189
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.551
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

190
00:05:05.551 --> 00:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>it's normal.</v>

191
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 1>They get aroused.</v>

192
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.130
<v Speaker 1>And it was interesting.</v>

193
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:16.131
<v Speaker 1>And I knew I was 16 hours away time zone from America and I know Comedians have</v>

194
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:18.960
<v Speaker 1>gone down to Brazil or Thailand.</v>

195
00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:20.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole history of it,</v>

196
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't really pursue it there,</v>

197
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 1>but I thought about it and then maybe I came back on another night.</v>

198
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:27.031
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

199
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:27.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>people thought I was waiting.</v>

201
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 2>You said maybe no,</v>

202
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:33.560
<v Speaker 2>you came back right while I was there for like two weeks in Thailand.</v>

203
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Can you saying maybe I came back my maybe you're making the story confusing.</v>

204
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

205
00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 2>well I want one.</v>

206
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.830
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

207
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I came back another night.</v>

208
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.570
<v Speaker 2>I said maybe I will come back this solid.</v>

209
00:05:44.571 --> 00:05:46.790
<v Speaker 2>You said it's a reason why I stopped too,</v>

210
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.410
<v Speaker 2>so I want this to be for,</v>

211
00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:53.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean at that point I'd probably 3% gay and that's based off I</v>

212
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.600
<v Speaker 1>getting picked on as a kid like Brody,</v>

213
00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you walk a girl,</v>

214
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you understand</v>

215
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rolling up in Tarzana.</v>

216
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I got picked on a lot.</v>

217
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>You saying that someone can make you homosexual by if they picked on you enough.</v>

218
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.880
<v Speaker 2>3% would be a hundred no,</v>

219
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 2>3% wouldn't make it a 100 but if somebody as a child,</v>

220
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 2>you're in third grade and there's a group of girls,</v>

221
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:15.621
<v Speaker 2>or even guys,</v>

222
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

223
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.251
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

224
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:16.761
<v Speaker 2>look at Brodie.</v>

225
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:16.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

226
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.744
<v Speaker 2>he walks,</v>

227
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 2>he looks like he's gay.</v>

228
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 2>You walk like a gay gay kid.</v>

229
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 2>You're always smiling.</v>

230
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:22.241
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

231
00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 2>it was a nice kid.</v>

232
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I guess because of a tilted pelvis,</v>

233
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I walked weird and he got picked on for that.</v>

234
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 2>So I always felt like,</v>

235
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.071
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

236
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I guess I think I,</v>

237
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay.</v>

238
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

239
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

240
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.391
<v Speaker 2>get some gay,</v>

241
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

242
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.441
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

243
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:36.981
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

244
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>So there is this like the secret is this,</v>

245
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>the power of suggestion is that one of those things I,</v>

246
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a power of being bullied.</v>

247
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 2>So being bullied can turn you homosexual.</v>

248
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.120
<v Speaker 2>It didn't wait 3% 3% yes.</v>

249
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 2>If they're saying it,</v>

250
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 2>if enough people are saying,</v>

251

254
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I would think skywalks a little gay.</v>

255
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.561

<v Speaker 2>if he,</v>

257
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 2>if you think that,</v>

258
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you change your walk?</v>

259
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.111
<v Speaker 2>I tried.</v>

260
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:12.571
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

261
00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 2>How I tried to get like in my shoe,</v>

<v Speaker 2>which side is tilted?</v>

263
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.861

267
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you know for sure?</v>

268
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Is this just go to a Voodoo doctor?</v>

269
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.791
<v Speaker 2>It's not a food.</v>

270
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're almost being a chiropractor.</v>

271
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.920
<v Speaker 2>The chiropractor.</v>

272
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 2>This is like a physical thing.</v>

273
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Chiropractors are a lot like Voodoo doctors.</v>

274
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.400
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot of chiropractors that just fucking move your neck around,</v>

275
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.263
<v Speaker 2>take your money.</v>

276
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot going on.</v>

277
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I've been there,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What just happened?</v>

280
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Did I just give that guy $60 to rub my neck for 15 seconds?</v>

281
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's what it feels like.</v>

282
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:47.391
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

283
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:48.760

285
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 2>your [inaudible] throw some terms at you that are like completely unnecessary</v>

286
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 2>and very verbose and long.</v>

287
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 2>And then the cracking that grow couldn't crack crack and it kinda feels good.</v>

288
00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.451
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

289
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 2>and they correct the neck.</v>

290
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:00.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

291
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>It kind of feels good when they crack your neck.</v>

292
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.133
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

293
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.160

357
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 1>This is my big opportunity</v>

358
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>and I really didn't do that much and I had the chance.</v>

359
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't do that much.</v>

360
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 2>You said you got to Bangkok,</v>

00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you knew they were lady boys and you went back.</v>

364
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 2>When you say you would have to say you went a little gayer than you were when</v>

365
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:11.630
<v Speaker 2>you got there.</v>

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I like to check this experience out.</v>

373
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.163
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

374
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

375
00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 1>what do you define as a gay experience?</v>

376
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy in you.</v>

377
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:30.381

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

381
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.450
<v Speaker 2>it's way closer to a guy than me.</v>

382
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

383
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.610

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Does he make any sense?</v>

385
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys for you to listen to be bold?</v>

386
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 2>You don't even listen to people.</v>

387
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

388
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 2>I made and made an error.</v>

389
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

390
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.890
<v Speaker 2>is it a transsexual guy?</v>

391
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.041
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

392
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:51.860
<v Speaker 2>it's not as close to a guy's me.</v>

393
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.733
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

394
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 2>It's more a woman eliminate as a man.</v>

395
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 2>It looked and felt like a woman.</v>

396
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Here's the reality of transsexuals did just the cold hard reality.</v>

397
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just chromosomal.</v>

398
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.143
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

399
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.330
<v Speaker 2>And as far as like behavior and appearance and maybe even like,</v>

400
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 2>like sex,</v>

401
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 2>like you might enjoy certain aspects of sex,</v>

402
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:18.021
<v Speaker 2>more the transsexual than you would an angry overweights cigarette smoking woman</v>

403
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:20.220
<v Speaker 2>who's got a head like a frying pan,</v>

404
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

405
00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:21.954
<v Speaker 2>if you found,</v>

406
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.430
<v Speaker 2>what does that transgender woman,</v>

407
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 2>this is the picture that goes with why it's Brian.</v>

408
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:27.801

412
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 2>You're going to ruin everything for every buddy.</v>

413
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:34.921
<v Speaker 2>Keep going.</v>

414
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:39.921
<v Speaker 2>My point is I would rather have a sexual experience with a transgender that was</v>

415
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:46.461
<v Speaker 2>really sexy and sweet rather than a big angry woman that's built like a football</v>

416
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>

420
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:51.361
<v Speaker 2>if you're a man,</v>

421
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 2>most likely you want to have a sexual experience with something feminine.</v>

422
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

423
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 2>And the reality of femininity versus masculinity.</v>

424
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a line where shit gets blurry.</v>

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

426
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.450

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.660
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

440
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.493
<v Speaker 2>you're alone.</v>

441
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Tiny Thailand.</v>

442
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not a Thailand,</v>

443
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.701
<v Speaker 2>if you're anywhere,</v>

444
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 2>if it's the only three people on the planet,</v>

445
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>

446
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 2>the the Thai lady boy and the big Fred Flinstone looking angry.</v>

447
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.381
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

448
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 2>she's on her way now I'm going to meet with a Fred Flintstone or boogers in your</v>

449
00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:33.221
<v Speaker 2>nose.</v>

450
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I won't be,</v>

451
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I won't be breath.</v>

452
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll let her give me a massage.</v>

453
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Her feet smell,</v>

454
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:38.500
<v Speaker 2>ugh.</v>

455
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Why is this going to transgender on the regular girl that there was those two,</v>

456
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 2>you could probably cut out a nice young ones he thinks.</v>

457
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be,</v>

458
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 2>a different thing.</v>

460
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I think also there's the feeling of exploitation that comes with having a,</v>

461
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

462
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 2>having a sexual experience with a prostitute that's a female that you don't get</v>

463
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 2>if it's a prostitute that's a male,</v>

464
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a female prostitute,</v>

466
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 2>like there's this thing where,</v>

467
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

468
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 2>if you think about the concept of prostitution,</v>

469
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you think that women are being exploited.</v>

470
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 2>That's like one of the main negative aspects of prostitution.</v>

471
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 2>And then also as a father you start thinking,</v>

472
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:13.121
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

473
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 2>why are they prostitutes?</v>

474
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Most likely because they didn't have a good family structure.</v>

475
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have a good father figure.</v>

476
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have a good mother.</v>

477
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:20.643
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it was,</v>

478
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>

479
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Most likely there could be some weird people that just enjoy sacks and don't</v>

480
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.570
<v Speaker 2>mind getting paid for it because it's better than being a waitress.</v>

481
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 2>That's possible too.</v>

482
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 2>But when you think about a woman,</v>

483
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:36.210
<v Speaker 2>most likely you're thinking about someone being sexually manipulated and some of</v>

484
00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:41.211
<v Speaker 2>them being taken advantage of and objectified and you think of a bad situation,</v>

485
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 2>but you don't think about that with a guy.</v>

486
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:44.321
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

487
00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Especially a guy that used to be a guy who used to be a guy and then became a</v>

488
00:13:49.151 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Speaker 2>girl like and decided to do it because he wanted to do it.</v>

489
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Like he made the choice wanting to do it,</v>

490
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 2>felt like that's who he is.</v>

491
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:57.830
<v Speaker 2>He's better suited to,</v>

492
00:13:57.831 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 2>made me want it to be.</v>

493
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Or did he like made a choice that you definitely make the choice to have surgery</v>

494
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.070
<v Speaker 2>and you feel it almost like you have to get it done?</v>

495
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell.</v>

496
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no way I could tell you what they feel,</v>

497
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 2>but I would assume that they're telling the truth.</v>

498
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 2>And when I've talked to,</v>

499
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:18.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean we had bucking Joel on the podcast who's a transgender woman to man and</v>

500
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:19.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:22.600
<v Speaker 2>he says that he's always known inside that he should to be a man.</v>

502
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean his personality was always,</v>

503
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 2>and that's the only time he was ever happy was when he was allowed to be a man.</v>

504
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.490
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

505
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 2>This person feel real.</v>

506
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Brody went out,</v>

507
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.060
<v Speaker 2>call eight from the path here.</v>

508
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Let's not deviate from the path here because I think what we're talking about is</v>

509
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.740
<v Speaker 2>actually a very important subject.</v>

510
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 2>You have to define it very clearly.</v>

511
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

512
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.861
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

513
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

514
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>

515
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 2>You have to define this is the pee.</v>

516
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.171
<v Speaker 2>Go Pee pee.</v>

517
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:44.381
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

518
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Can we come right back now we're not gonna let you back in this door out there</v>

519
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.323
<v Speaker 2>punching a code.</v>

520
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that any one of us can tell someone what they feel inside their</v>

521
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:56.211
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

522
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 2>And I've talked to way too many people that say that they,</v>

523
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.790
<v Speaker 2>they know that they should have been a man or they know that they should have</v>

524
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:02.624
<v Speaker 2>been a woman.</v>

525
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>

526
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:05.240
<v Speaker 2>if they're saying that you,</v>

527
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:05.421
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

528
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

529
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.370
<v Speaker 2>you can't argue with that.</v>

530
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:07.690
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

531
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 2>the host,</v>

532
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the spectrum of human fuckups,</v>

533
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

534
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:16.391
<v Speaker 2>the genetic and Amalities de variations in color of skin and color of hair and</v>

535
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 2>the size of teeth and all the different variations of human beings.</v>

536
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

537
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 2>some people were supposed to be boys and didn't come out.</v>

538
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Boys absolutely no doubt about it.</v>

539
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.980
<v Speaker 2>And I think one day they're going to be able to do something where they give</v>

540
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 2>these people some sort of a genetic manipulation and they're going to literally</v>

541
00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 2>turn them into double x chromosome women.</v>

542
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

543
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that's not the thing,</v>

544
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 2>that's the beginning of like the ability to manipulate the human genome,</v>

545
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:48.230
<v Speaker 2>the ability to change a person's DNA,</v>

546
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.671
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

547
00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:50.300
<v Speaker 2>til then what do they have?</v>

548
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:51.134
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

549
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.381
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

550
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:51.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

551
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 2>they have surgery and they have a hormonal,</v>

552
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

553
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 2>hormone hormonal treatments.</v>

554
00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 2>But if you had to choose between a guy who did that,</v>

555
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:00.890
<v Speaker 2>a fee,</v>

556
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:05.890
<v Speaker 2>a male born male who did that and became like a really sexy transgender or</v>

557
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.310
<v Speaker 2>disgusting angry woman who hates men,</v>

558
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.170
<v Speaker 2>discussing,</v>

559
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.760
<v Speaker 2>discussing angry women that hates women.</v>

560
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:13.840
<v Speaker 2>He would go with that.</v>

561
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.330

580
00:16:56.021 --> 00:16:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Most likely I'd kill myself.</v>

581
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.241
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>

582
00:16:58.241 --> 00:16:59.110
<v Speaker 2>It's three people on the planet.</v>

583
00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to the highest fucking mountain.</v>

584
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stand there and look at it and I'm going to say fuck it and take a</v>

585
00:17:03.671 --> 00:17:06.040
<v Speaker 2>swan dive and then we're going to have to start fresh.</v>

586
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'll be the last bail on the planet.</v>

587
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.480
<v Speaker 2>There'll be no impregnated people and those two people are going to die.</v>

588
00:17:10.481 --> 00:17:11.261
<v Speaker 2>And that's going to be a wrap.</v>

589
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Unless they milk my balls for sperm when they find my dead body within 24 hour</v>

590
00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:17.170
<v Speaker 2>period and my sperm staying alive,</v>

591
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.410
<v Speaker 2>most likely the human species ends there.</v>

592
00:17:19.411 --> 00:17:19.851
<v Speaker 2>Brian's,</v>

672
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the episode the man show that we did with that?</v>

673
00:18:58.391 --> 00:19:00.370
<v Speaker 2>A transgender woman who is beautiful.</v>

674
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Her name was like vanity or something like that.</v>

675
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Vaguely.</v>

676
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Remember that dude.</v>

677
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 2>She was like really pretty like,</v>

678
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.731
<v Speaker 2>like Whoa,</v>

679
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:14.500
<v Speaker 2>like stunningly beautiful and was born a man and we did a segment where the guy</v>

680
00:19:14.501 --> 00:19:15.610
<v Speaker 2>got strapped to a table,</v>

681
00:19:15.611 --> 00:19:17.910
<v Speaker 2>it's called make me hard and we put a,</v>

682
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I was strapped to a table,</v>

683
00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:23.140
<v Speaker 2>we put a light box over his dick with a light bulb go off when he got an</v>

684
00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:23.974
<v Speaker 2>erection.</v>

685
00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.200
<v Speaker 2>So of course we controlled the button,</v>

686
00:19:26.201 --> 00:19:27.720
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be like whenever like major,</v>

687
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.930
<v Speaker 2>it's where eating bananas or we have this transgender get out and the</v>

688
00:19:31.931 --> 00:19:35.800
<v Speaker 2>transgender does a dance for this guy and then she puts a whip cream on her</v>

689
00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 2>nipples and the guy sucks the whipped cream off her tests.</v>

690
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.530
<v Speaker 2>She had big fake tits and then she pulls out a peanut.</v>

691
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I remember that she pulls out a penis at the end of this and the fucking light,</v>

692
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.130
<v Speaker 2>the light starts flashing.</v>

693
00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:45.531
<v Speaker 2>May May,</v>

694
00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:45.741
<v Speaker 2>may,</v>

695
00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:45.931
<v Speaker 2>may,</v>

696
00:19:45.931 --> 00:19:49.120
<v Speaker 2>may was saying that her penis looked like,</v>

697
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.153
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

698
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.350
<v Speaker 2>like a primate penis that had been poisoned.</v>

699
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Like if you took a champ and you poisoned the champ and he saw his dick after he</v>

700
00:19:57.941 --> 00:19:59.050
<v Speaker 2>was dying of poisons.</v>

701
00:19:59.051 --> 00:19:59.884
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask a question.</v>

702
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.880
<v Speaker 3>What happens to the penis was just a regular looking penis on a beautiful woman</v>

703
00:20:04.881 --> 00:20:05.900
<v Speaker 3>with breasts.</v>

704
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Good skin issue.</v>

705
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.473
<v Speaker 3>Hair.</v>

706
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

707
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 2>The penis would be an issue for sure.</v>

708
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:13.110
<v Speaker 2>If you had to do something with it.</v>

709
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Like if the deal was like gotta like she,</v>

710
00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.041
<v Speaker 2>she's beautiful,</v>

711
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 2>but she's got a deck and she's going to blow you,</v>

712
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:20.040
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to blow her.</v>

713
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.953
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

714
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.223

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:35.870
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

727
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess sometimes we second you.</v>

728
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

729
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.510
<v Speaker 1>so you know it's a he,</v>

730
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.501
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

731
00:20:42.501 --> 00:20:43.370
<v Speaker 1>So you sitting there?</v>

732
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

733
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

734
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.811
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

735
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

736
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

737
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>did</v>

738
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

739
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 2>were there any of them in,</v>

740
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 2>they're actually born women or was it all lady boys?</v>

741
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

742
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>

743
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean most likely all lady running the place was a,</v>

744
00:20:58.241 --> 00:20:58.931
<v Speaker 2>was a woman,</v>

745
00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:01.850
<v Speaker 2>but I think most of the dancers were,</v>

746
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.220
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

747
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 2>were male at birth and um,</v>

748
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's part of that culture just to let you know,</v>

749
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:12.001
<v Speaker 2>it's very accepted to see ladyboys all around working at Starbucks,</v>

750
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 2>walking down the street.</v>

751
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that is?</v>

752
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:15.641
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

753
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:16.181
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

754
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

755
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.561
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

756
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:19.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a different culture over there,</v>

757
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 2>but is it a cultural choice or is it a genetic thing where there's a great</v>

758
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 2>percentage of people that feel like they should have been a woman?</v>

759
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something about genetics.</v>

760
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about the,</v>

761
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if like Asians are the Thai people are more,</v>

762
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:33.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

763
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.060
<v Speaker 2>apt to having that chain.</v>

764
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I would wonder if there's some stats for that as far as like women to men,</v>

765
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 2>transgenders like buck,</v>

766
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.313
<v Speaker 2>buck angel.</v>

767
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there's some stats that show,</v>

768
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.380
<v Speaker 2>like what countries have more transgender women to men.</v>

769
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.570
<v Speaker 2>If Thailand question,</v>

770
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:49.571
<v Speaker 2>I would have talent.</v>

771
00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Does Thailand actually have more transgender men?</v>

772
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.190
<v Speaker 2>An accepted part of the culture?</v>

773
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean I bet you down in Brazil there's a lot and it's accepted and may be</v>

774
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 2>accepted down there.</v>

775
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

776
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

777
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 2>you can tell us as much as you want about this experience or you could end right</v>

778
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:05.320
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

779
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I I'm willing to talk.</v>

780
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.730
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I'm thinking about is I don't want to give too much away on the</v>

781
00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 2>show and I going to see the show.</v>

782
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Keep going.</v>

783
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 2>People are going to see the show anyway.</v>

784
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be awesome.</v>

785
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.460
<v Speaker 2>You've actually already said it on a podcast before and we got you up to 12% gay</v>

786
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 2>when you brought him up to 12 yeah,</v>

787
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 2>we got him up to 12 because there was something else that he does like Pr.</v>

788
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I got confused.</v>

789
00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 2>He'll sell peer pressure.</v>

790
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you guys go down a couple more questions and we'll bullied them into</v>

791
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:33.760
<v Speaker 2>an extra percentage of being gay.</v>

792
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 2>That's how he eat here.</v>

793
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 2>He said he got bullied and to be in three and then you might've bought it how it</v>

794
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:39.640
<v Speaker 2>was walking.</v>

795
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it was because you still like pot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's something I would never ever do and it's something that</v>

818
00:23:37.011 --> 00:23:38.470
<v Speaker 2>See Brokeback mountain.</v>

819
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there were.</v>

820
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they saw two guys making love in the movie or whatever and they</v>

821
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.244
<v Speaker 2>actually</v>

822
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.310
<v Speaker 3>felt good about knowing these guys loved each other and it may even aroused a</v>

823
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:57.140
<v Speaker 3>straight guy knowing that two guys were passionately in love with each other.</v>

824
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you from here.</v>

828
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:00.434
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

829
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 2>if you felt that from watching a movie,</v>

830
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:06.140
<v Speaker 2>it means you don't have a sense of humor and you probably weren't there with</v>

831
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 2>another man who also has a sense of humor.</v>

832
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Because if you did as soon as the Jake Ellenberger,</v>

833
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.620
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.071
<v Speaker 2>All,</v>

<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

838
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:15.194

839
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.440
<v Speaker 2>who's an MMA fighter.</v>

840
00:24:16.441 --> 00:24:17.430

841
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.650

<v Speaker 2>It's a professional mixed martial arts fighter.</v>

843
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Gillen Hall spits on his hand and then shoves his Dick Right into that.</v>

844
00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Into that.</v>

845
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right into heath.</v>

847
00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:30.590
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think you would.</v>

848
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.790
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to laugh a little.</v>

849
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

850
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see the movie.</v>

851
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:34.610
<v Speaker 2>We're only human.</v>

852
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying somebody got aroused by that.</v>

853
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Who is not gay Su boy,</v>

854
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I agree with you there.</v>

855
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I think give that,</v>

856
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.120
<v Speaker 2>that scene a rouse you,</v>

857
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I think you're probably good</v>

858
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.320
<v Speaker 3>saying the scene arouse you,</v>

859
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.600
<v Speaker 3>maybe that to humans are and so love together</v>

860
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.480
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

861
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.940
<v Speaker 3>it's passionate and it's almost wrong.</v>

862
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.220
<v Speaker 3>It's taboo.</v>

863
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.143
<v Speaker 3>Taboo.</v>

864
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.113
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

865
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.940
<v Speaker 3>It's almost taboo to say that.</v>

866
00:25:03.941 --> 00:25:04.774
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

867
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.520

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I looked,</v>

982
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it.</v>

983
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.113
<v Speaker 1>How close?</v>

984
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:29.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

985
00:28:29.691 --> 00:28:29.881
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

986
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:30.101
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

00:28:30.101 --> 00:28:30.934
<v Speaker 1>Her scope.</v>

988
00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:31.610
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

989
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

990
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

991
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.623
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

992
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Three feet?</v>

993
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Two and a half feet from the ass or the Dick looked at the penis.</v>

994
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I said difference because if you're three feet from the Dick,</v>

995
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a safe judgment time you can use left.</v>

996
00:28:47.121 --> 00:28:47.511
<v Speaker 1>He can move,</v>

997
00:28:47.511 --> 00:28:47.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

998
00:28:47.751 --> 00:28:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

999
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Three feet from the ass.</v>

1000
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1001
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there.</v>

1002
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.663
<v Speaker 1>You're basically there.</v>

1003
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1007
00:28:53.511 --> 00:28:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Timeout.</v>

1008
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.561
<v Speaker 1>Timeout.</v>

1009
00:28:54.561 --> 00:28:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying three feet?</v>

1010
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about my face.</v>

1011
00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:58.731
<v Speaker 1>Your face.</v>

1012
00:28:58.731 --> 00:29:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Three feet from his dick or his ass.</v>

1013
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Can I say another thing?</v>

1014
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:02.931
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1015
00:29:02.931 --> 00:29:03.800
<v Speaker 1>You can see whatever you want.</v>

1016
00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Never did.</v>

1017
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Nor do I want to take my face and put it in the the man's ass.</v>

1018
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1019
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Can I go on record saying that now we know if there was any debate before it's</v>

1020
00:29:16.941 --> 00:29:17.690
<v Speaker 1>been squashed.</v>

1021
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.523
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1022
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.000
<v Speaker 1>now your turn it around and I'm in Bangkok and I go,</v>

1023
00:29:23.001 --> 00:29:25.250
<v Speaker 1>well people say I'm gay.</v>

1024
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:27.703
<v Speaker 1>Turn around,</v>

1025
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.830
<v Speaker 1>let me look at it.</v>

1026
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1027
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.713
<v Speaker 1>how far away?</v>

1028
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.593
<v Speaker 1>How far away?</v>

1029
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Three feet from the deck?</v>

1030
00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:36.831
<v Speaker 1>What's it look like?</v>

1032
00:29:36.831 --> 00:29:37.311
<v Speaker 1>Is it hard?</v>

1033
00:29:37.311 --> 00:29:39.650
<v Speaker 1>At least I'll tell you what.</v>

1034
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1035
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1036
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.780
<v Speaker 2>it was what you described.</v>

1037
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:44.561
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't normal.</v>

1038
00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Something happened to,</v>

1039
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:46.980
<v Speaker 2>it has been poisoned.</v>

1040
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:47.801
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

1041
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Speaker 2>There's some calc,</v>

1042
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:48.680
<v Speaker 2>chem,</v>

1043
00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.430
<v Speaker 2>you start injecting your body with estrogen.</v>

1044
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I would assume your Dick shrivels up.</v>

1045
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessary anymore and it knows it.</v>

1046
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Just like when you inject your body with testosterone.</v>

1047
00:29:58.151 --> 00:29:58.781
<v Speaker 2>If you're a woman,</v>

1048
00:29:58.781 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to have men's levels of testosterone.</v>

1049
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Plus those women in bodybuilders,</v>

1050
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:03.601
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1051
00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:04.650
<v Speaker 2>they grow dicks.</v>

1052
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:04.990
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1053
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 2>their clinic stands.</v>

1054
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like when do you find like a dead body hanging for like that's been there</v>

1055
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:09.701
<v Speaker 2>for a week.</v>

1056
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:10.950
<v Speaker 2>It's stretched and different.</v>

1057
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.793
<v Speaker 2>Dank,</v>

1058
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.753
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

1059
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:14.531
<v Speaker 2>Different thing.</v>

1060
00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:15.364
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

1061
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:16.631
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1062
00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:18.640
<v Speaker 2>so the Dick was soft.</v>

1063
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.930
<v Speaker 2>We didn't touch it.</v>

1064
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.291
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1065
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:20.771
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>

1066
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 2>when you tapped it just to see what it's like to be touched,</v>

1067
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:27.110
<v Speaker 2>it will never touched a man's penis ever.</v>

1068
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

1069
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.250
<v Speaker 2>how do you even know that you're in a dream unless you touch it,</v>

1070
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1071
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.241
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1072
00:30:31.241 --> 00:30:31.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1073
00:30:31.551 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I just touched with no stimulation at all.</v>

1074
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like that thing that you do when you're lucid dreaming.</v>

1075
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1076
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.890
<v Speaker 2>the way you PR like practice lucid dreaming is by walking around your house.</v>

1077
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And every time you get to a door knob or doorway,</v>

1078
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.640
<v Speaker 2>you knock in the doorway.</v>

1079
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.893
<v Speaker 2>Am I dreaming?</v>

1080
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not dreaming you,</v>

1081
00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you feel it.</v>

1082
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.010
<v Speaker 2>You knock on the door.</v>

1083
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:51.791
<v Speaker 2>But if you're dreaming,</v>

1084
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 2>your hand just goes right through.</v>

1085
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.471
<v Speaker 2>And he'd go,</v>

1086
00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 2>oh my goodness,</v>

1087
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.233
<v Speaker 2>I'm dreaming.</v>

1088
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you lucid dream.</v>

1089
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a meditative device.</v>

1090
00:31:00.071 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 2>So whenever you see a Dick,</v>

1091
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 2>she should thump it and go,</v>

1092
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:04.170
<v Speaker 2>am I dreaming?</v>

1093
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:04.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1094
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.533
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1095
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I got set up here.</v>

1096
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.710
<v Speaker 2>All just got set up.</v>

1097
00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:10.510
<v Speaker 2>We all dream about day.</v>

1098
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Joe Is our day.</v>

1099
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.450
<v Speaker 2>God knows Dick.</v>

1100
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it.</v>

1101
00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.361
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to,</v>

1102
00:31:16.361 --> 00:31:16.961
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1103
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:18.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what to want to touch it.</v>

1104
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.293
<v Speaker 2>But you did,</v>

1105
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:20.040
<v Speaker 2>but you did.</v>

1106
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I touch is a doctor,</v>

1107
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.260
<v Speaker 2>but touch as a doctor when she gets it,</v>

1108
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.180
<v Speaker 2>digested it to officially say I've done it too.</v>

1109
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.390
<v Speaker 2>What did you do your residency?</v>

1110
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.270
<v Speaker 2>She's my Miami state.</v>

1111
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.831
<v Speaker 2>Arizona.</v>

1112
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Stan joy itch.</v>

1113
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.291
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1114
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:35.741
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

1115
00:31:35.741 --> 00:31:36.340
<v Speaker 2>please continue.</v>

1116
00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.173
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1117
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.240
<v Speaker 2>there was no kissing.</v>

1118
00:31:40.241 --> 00:31:40.981
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it put.</v>

1119
00:31:40.981 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 2>This guy smelled like she smells good.</v>

1120
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.943
<v Speaker 2>She smelled.</v>

1121
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 2>It was a girl.</v>

1122
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:45.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1123
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:46.420
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1124
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 2>What point in time,</v>

1125
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.333
<v Speaker 2>here's the question.</v>

1126
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 2>When you become a transgender,</v>

1127
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.030
<v Speaker 2>when do we decide to call you a girl?</v>

1128
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Is it when you make the choice?</v>

1129
00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Because if you still have a penis,</v>

1130
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.980
<v Speaker 2>it's becomes very,</v>

1131
00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have to buy your penis cut off.</v>

1132
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have to be on certain him,</v>

1133
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.021
<v Speaker 2>certain,</v>

1134
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:08.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1135
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1136
00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 2>medication hormones.</v>

1137
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just at,</v>

1138
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.450
<v Speaker 2>for a courtesy.</v>

1139
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just the person's choice.</v>

1140
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Like if you decided tomorrow that you want it to be a Eustace is the other</v>

1141
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:23.374
<v Speaker 2>girl's name.</v>

1142
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:25.203
<v Speaker 2>What's the girl's name?</v>

1143
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Becky.</v>

1144
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Becky.</v>

1145
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Warren Stephens?</v>

1146
00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:28.773
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1147
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.470

1148
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.303
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1149
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.390
<v Speaker 2>you decided to be a woman.</v>

1150
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1151
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.531
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1152
00:32:32.531 --> 00:32:32.861
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1153
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:33.131
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1154
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:33.964
<v Speaker 2>Becky Stephens,</v>

1155
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I would start calling you a woman.</v>

1156
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.400
<v Speaker 2>I would start calling you her.</v>

1157
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1158
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 2>She respect out of respect and I'm taking hormones out of respect,</v>

1159
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.981
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

1160
00:32:41.981 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's queer.</v>

1161
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you know a queers?</v>

1162
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Those are like gay guys.</v>

1163
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Like who've taken the word over.</v>

1164
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:49.483
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1165
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:49.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1166
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:54.941
<v Speaker 2>and that all Lbtq t what does fucking has lesbians,</v>

1167
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 2>bisexuals,</v>

1168
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 2>a gay,</v>

1169
00:32:57.741 --> 00:32:58.780
<v Speaker 2>transgender,</v>

1170
00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.960
<v Speaker 2>queer.</v>

1171
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:01.281
<v Speaker 2>The queer ones.</v>

1172
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 2>A strange one.</v>

1173
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.700
<v Speaker 2>And the queer one is they want to be whatever they want to be.</v>

1174
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:05.511
<v Speaker 2>They want to be a man.</v>

1175
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:06.350
<v Speaker 2>They want to be a woman.</v>

1176
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:06.990
<v Speaker 2>They want to be,</v>

1177
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.880
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to be?</v>

1178
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.030
<v Speaker 2>They like want to be they or they want to be it.</v>

1179
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:11.983
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1180
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 2>they have different designations.</v>

1181
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:15.360
<v Speaker 2>15% queer,</v>

1182
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.050
<v Speaker 2>but they choose 10% gay,</v>

1183
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.280
<v Speaker 2>but 15% queer.</v>

1184
00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

1185
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1186
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.021
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

1187
00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:22.280
<v Speaker 2>We're moving close to our goal.</v>

1188
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I feel like home shopping network and I'm selling queer.</v>

1189
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 1>We're moving closer to the goal of 86% gay by the end of the podcast.</v>

1190
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:31.851
<v Speaker 1>We can do it,</v>

1191
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:32.481
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

1192
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:34.130
<v Speaker 1>All we need is more stories.</v>

1193
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 1>We got more Brodie coming up right after this.</v>

1194
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Look at the design of this.</v>

1195
00:33:37.821 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 1>We get this from China,</v>

1196
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:42.020
<v Speaker 1>but let me assure you the quality is remarkable.</v>

1197
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.820
<v Speaker 1>His lips are soft for any cock.</v>

1198
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:44.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1199
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:45.051
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1200
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:45.261
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1201
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:45.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1202
00:33:45.531 --> 00:33:46.190
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1203
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Come on Brian.</v>

1204
00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:48.141
<v Speaker 1>Asshole.</v>

1205
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:48.441
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1206
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 1>you're ruining everything.</v>

1207
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.020
<v Speaker 1>We're so close to getting him up to 25% I'd say,</v>

1208
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.820
<v Speaker 1>which is I think the real numb Joe.</v>

1209
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:55.131
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1210
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:55.910
<v Speaker 1>it isn't.</v>

1211
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.151
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1212
00:33:56.151 --> 00:33:57.130
<v Speaker 1>it isn't saying.</v>

1213
00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:57.973
<v Speaker 1>That's not</v>

1214
00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.240
<v Speaker 1>25% here's why.</v>

1215
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 1>This is what I said at that.</v>

1216
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest with you at that moment.</v>

1217
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.471
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1218
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:10.161
<v Speaker 1>At the moment,</v>

1219
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 1>where's that guy is sucking on your</v>

1220
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.193
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

1221
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I happened to in person all the time.</v>

1222
00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I think you're at 40% gay.</v>

1223
00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>

1224
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.553
<v Speaker 1>Are you</v>

1225
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.373
<v Speaker 1>moment?</v>

1226
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:21.551
<v Speaker 1>This could mess.</v>

1227
00:34:21.551 --> 00:34:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh my hell for that moment when I'm offering you is a fluctuating scale of</v>

1228
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:27.124
<v Speaker 1>gayness,</v>

1229
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:32.920
<v Speaker 1>but you brought me all the way to go as high as 40 when you come in a man's</v>

1230
00:34:32.921 --> 00:34:33.310
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>

1231
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.920
<v Speaker 1>he's giving an f being very generous,</v>

1232
00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 1>very generous by often you 40 but for most of the population when you come into</v>

1233
00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.021
<v Speaker 1>man's mouth,</v>

1234
00:34:41.021 --> 00:34:44.380
<v Speaker 1>you hit a hundred and you hit a hundred yes you do.</v>

1235
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:44.861
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1236
00:34:44.861 --> 00:34:45.251
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>

1237
00:34:45.251 --> 00:34:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You say if you were in prison,</v>

1238
00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you got locked prison.</v>

1239
00:34:48.221 --> 00:34:48.641
<v Speaker 1>Brody.</v>

1240
00:34:48.641 --> 00:34:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't plan on going to prince like just a nice guy.</v>

1241
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't break any fucking laws.</v>

1242
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I di,</v>

1243
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I defy you</v>

1244
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.870
<v Speaker 1>to find me like Joe if you want with prison,</v>

1245
00:34:58.871 --> 00:34:59.580
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

1246
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.440
<v Speaker 1>because that's the only place we have no options as sexual part.</v>

1247
00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1248
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I had no options at night.</v>

1249
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't go to prison.</v>

1250
00:35:06.071 --> 00:35:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Brodie.</v>

1251
00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a dumb thing to bring up for.</v>

1252
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't go to prison and when they walk upstairs on their own without</v>

1253
00:35:13.721 --> 00:35:14.560
<v Speaker 1>a security guard,</v>

1254
00:35:14.561 --> 00:35:18.700
<v Speaker 1>having them shackled risk to and cuff you like pretending they had,</v>

1255
00:35:18.701 --> 00:35:20.470
<v Speaker 1>they brought me to the mess hall and they suck my deck.</v>

1256
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.550
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happened.</v>

1257
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1258
00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.230
<v Speaker 1>go back to me.</v>

1259
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Go back to me being able to go back to that or that they didn't blow the buzzer</v>

1260
00:35:27.971 --> 00:35:31.510
<v Speaker 1>and give your one hour outside to play basketball and you wind up getting your</v>

1261
00:35:31.511 --> 00:35:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Dick sucked.</v>

1262
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.071
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happened.</v>

1263
00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Brody.</v>

1264
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.260
<v Speaker 1>He made a choice to go up those stairs.</v>

1265
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.310
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with it,</v>

1266
00:35:36.311 --> 00:35:37.900
<v Speaker 1>but you're able to about 40% gap.</v>

1267
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe those numbers.</v>

1268
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:40.201
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

1269
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Speaker 1>what do you think when you come in the guy's mouth?</v>

1270
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:42.750
<v Speaker 1>What are we up to?</v>

1271
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I think he just say I did that.</v>

1272
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just assuming he's done.</v>

1273
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I would say definitely 25 I don't like your numbers Brian.</v>

1274
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a shocker.</v>

1275
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.070
<v Speaker 1>You've never brought that number up to me.</v>

1276
00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I cannot believe that Joe said 40% 40% cause I love you.</v>

1277
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I should've said a hundred man came and a man's mouth.</v>

1278
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Can I say something I did almost immediately gaze.</v>

1279
00:36:01.981 --> 00:36:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Fuck can I do other than fucking the garden,</v>

1280
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.190
<v Speaker 1>the TD,</v>

1281
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.210
<v Speaker 1>spit it back into your mouth.</v>

1282
00:36:06.211 --> 00:36:07.044
<v Speaker 1>Brody,</v>

1283
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 1>what is more gay?</v>

1284
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.990
<v Speaker 1>What does more given us say something to you?</v>

1285
00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:12.973
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say</v>

1286
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.880
<v Speaker 1>we'll move on and know what's gay or if you think of 40% gay,</v>

1287
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>

1288
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.880
<v Speaker 1>86 is our goal,</v>

1289
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.200
<v Speaker 1>but you're playing games.</v>

1290
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.460
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I said.</v>

1291
00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 1>I never said how you were you a fluctuating skin.</v>

1292
00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get hammered.</v>

1293
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:31.520
<v Speaker 1>He wrote,</v>

1294
00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:32.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1295
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.031
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1296
00:36:33.031 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be really tough to me.</v>

1297
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I love you and America loves you.</v>

1298
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>

1299
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll be universally protected.</v>

1300
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.000
<v Speaker 1>The only people that will despise you because of this are assholes.</v>

1301
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Fuck down.</v>

1302
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.860
<v Speaker 1>What do you perfect.</v>

1303
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 1>You're perfect sexually.</v>

1304
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.781
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1305
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:47.130
<v Speaker 1>You could keep your room clean.</v>

1306
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:48.111
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1307
00:36:48.111 --> 00:36:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1308
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.360
<v Speaker 1>You give Brody Stevens a hard time for being an 86% gay.</v>

1309
00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I say percent</v>

1310
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 1>right now we're at 40 stops.</v>

1311
00:36:55.981 --> 00:37:00.981
<v Speaker 1>The moment you decide he is release the hounds and it's down the hatch of a</v>

1312
00:37:01.351 --> 00:37:02.131
<v Speaker 1>man's throat.</v>

1313
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Probably cigarette brand new fucking stubble and I don't think that's so bad.</v>

1314
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.950
<v Speaker 1>If you feel stubble on your balls and hit balls are clean shaven,</v>

1315
00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.000
<v Speaker 1>it probably is a stimulant guarantee you,</v>

1316
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:15.820
<v Speaker 1>there's at least 10 comedians that have gone down to Brazil and had their penis</v>

1317
00:37:15.821 --> 00:37:16.160
<v Speaker 1>suck</v>

1318
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.390
<v Speaker 2>by a transvestite.</v>

1319
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Every time you try to rationalize what you've done by comparing yourself to the</v>

1320
00:37:21.801 --> 00:37:24.410
<v Speaker 2>acts of others that are also ridiculous,</v>

1321
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.320
<v Speaker 2>you get another 10% gay stop.</v>

1322
00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:31.360
<v Speaker 2>So we're now at 35% gay or goal is 86 we got at least 20 minutes left to this</v>

1323
00:37:31.881 --> 00:37:32.714
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

1324
00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.020
<v Speaker 2>We can do this Brody while if I talk more,</v>

1325
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1326
00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I would probably come very close to hitting your thing here.</v>

1327
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Nothing written.</v>

1328
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.883
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1329
00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.070
<v Speaker 2>you'd come very close to hitting 86 if you tried.</v>

1330
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:47.331
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

1331
00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:51.730
<v Speaker 2>if you're on ecstasy and you are with the perfect ladies on x,</v>

1332
00:37:51.731 --> 00:37:52.070

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.030
<v Speaker 2>like vanity,</v>

1334
00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.830
<v Speaker 2>like vanity from the man show.</v>

1335
00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Remember her?</v>

1336
00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:55.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1337
00:37:55.701 --> 00:37:56.534
<v Speaker 2>she was fine.</v>

1338
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I've pushed it to the limit and I know a race car driver roadie.</v>

1339
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:02.763
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1340
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Stop saying like you breaking in new tires.</v>

1341
00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.780
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to figure out these compounds when we hit the skid pad.</v>

1342
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:09.770
<v Speaker 2>That's not what's going on.</v>

1343
00:38:09.771 --> 00:38:11.120
<v Speaker 2>When you say and you push it to the limit,</v>

1344
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.500
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying?</v>

1345
00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.820
<v Speaker 2>What's with the euphemisms?</v>

1346
00:38:13.821 --> 00:38:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Brody?</v>

1347
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Let's get real with America because America loves you and they love you the most</v>

1348
00:38:18.411 --> 00:38:19.160
<v Speaker 2>when you're telling the truth.</v>

1349
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:19.970
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1350
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.890
<v Speaker 2>let's see how far I can go.</v>

1351
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.210
<v Speaker 2>That's 35% gay,</v>

1352
00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.093
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1353
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.270
<v Speaker 2>We agree.</v>

1354
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1355
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.951
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1356
00:38:27.951 --> 00:38:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Let's be real.</v>

1357
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1358
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:29.923
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1359
00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It might be a 35% gay thought worth.</v>

1360
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It's worth.</v>

1361
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 1>We have only 4% where are we at the moment?</v>

1362
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean is what's going on here.</v>

1363
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:41.260
<v Speaker 1>She's sucking your Dick,</v>

1364
00:38:41.261 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 1>but as she tickling your balls,</v>

1365
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 1>like is she probably,</v>

1366
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 1>does she know her thing?</v>

1367
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Does she know what the fuck she's doing?</v>

1368
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:46.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1369
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:47.261
<v Speaker 1>they're decent,</v>

1370
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but if you feel like a girl is doing it or do you feel like a guy's doing it?</v>

1371
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:51.071
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

1372
00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about a guy.</v>

1373
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.480
<v Speaker 1>You're not thinking about a guy she looks like a girl may cost the hounds smell,</v>

1374
00:38:57.671 --> 00:38:58.710
<v Speaker 1>feel rast.</v>

1375
00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Sexy phantoms.</v>

1376
00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:02.603
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1377
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that.</v>

1378
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 1>When you release the hounds,</v>

1379
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 1>is there any feeling of regret?</v>

1380
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any if that even from what my recollection,</v>

1381
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.460
<v Speaker 1>recollection what,</v>

1382
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1383
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:18.451
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1384
00:39:18.451 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 1>you stone cold sober.</v>

1385
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I was probably on a hookah and beer.</v>

1386
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I think we hit 86% no,</v>

1387
00:39:24.491 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 1>we didn't [inaudible] pretty good about right.</v>

1388
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.620
<v Speaker 1>That's I want to say this jail on.</v>

1389
00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Talk about whatever you want regarding this.</v>

1390
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest,</v>

1391
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 1>it is a subject that does make me uncomfortable.</v>

1392
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1393
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.620
<v Speaker 1>For just a couple of reasons.</v>

1394
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 1>The other reasons that it is so public and so what I know,</v>

1395
00:39:42.701 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's getting some why makes her unconscious is going to be on comedy central</v>

1396
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:46.630
<v Speaker 1>and it freaks me out.</v>

1397
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1398
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:48.124

00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:52.240
<v Speaker 1>It's who you are and who you are as awesome.</v>

1402
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 1>We love you.</v>

1403
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I ain't,</v>

1404
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.030
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter if you're 86% gay,</v>

1405
00:39:55.031 --> 00:39:55.411
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1406
00:39:55.411 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh percent like everybody else,</v>

1407
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.450
<v Speaker 1>but here it doesn't matter.</v>

1408
00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Let me say this,</v>

1409
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.000
<v Speaker 1>on this podcast,</v>

1410
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:05.980
<v Speaker 1>you allow me to kind of explain everything and allowed to express yourself and I</v>

1411
00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:08.260
<v Speaker 1>feel like maybe on this show,</v>

1412
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not blaming anybody,</v>

1413
00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:11.710
<v Speaker 1>it could be my own neuroses.</v>

1414
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it comes across that way.</v>

1415
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Kind of how we explained it.</v>

1416
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a TV show and I know this is a podcast,</v>

1417
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.770
<v Speaker 1>but that's where some of my anxiety lies.</v>

1418
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.000
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that we just talked about this here does make me feel better.</v>

1419
00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And knowing that you have my back,</v>

1420
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.660
<v Speaker 1>no matter if you're 100% gay,</v>

1421
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.670
<v Speaker 1>which not a hundred a lot of people</v>

1422
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.610
<v Speaker 1>when you come in the guy's mouth,</v>

1423
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:37.361
<v Speaker 1>you're 100% gay.</v>

1424
00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people who've said that I don't agree with,</v>

1425
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 1>so I don't agree with them.</v>

1426
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with them.</v>

1427
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.453
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1428
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.421
<v Speaker 1>But your third year,</v>

1429
00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:44.490
<v Speaker 1>86% um,</v>

1430
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.620
<v Speaker 1>at that night,</v>

1431
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I debate you on that.</v>

1432
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I said 40 before,</v>

1433
00:40:48.221 --> 00:40:49.031
<v Speaker 1>but it's because I love you.</v>

1434
00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:49.781
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't know you,</v>

1435
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd say 100% but I do and I love you and I don't care.</v>

1436
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I think you're 100% awesome.</v>

1437
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it matters if you're a 10% gay or 25% gay who gives a shit and</v>

1438
00:40:59.411 --> 00:40:59.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1439
00:40:59.711 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what lady boy,</v>

1440
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to a gate a man.</v>

1441
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

1442
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.180
<v Speaker 1>if it was a dude who looked like don Barris and he had a full beard and he was</v>

1443
00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:07.811
<v Speaker 1>sucking your Dick,</v>

1444
00:41:07.811 --> 00:41:09.010
<v Speaker 1>that be a completely different,</v>

1445
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.340
<v Speaker 1>exactly that God doesn't appreciate.</v>

1446

<v Speaker 1>It does appreciate it.</v>

1447
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Choking him.</v>

1448
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.130
<v Speaker 1>God made gay people and that's how the Christians conundrum.</v>

1449
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Who is he exactly out there?</v>

1450
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:21.550
<v Speaker 1>You had to come out his nose.</v>

1451
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:22.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1452
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:23.464
<v Speaker 1>How much time I,</v>

1453
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:24.550
<v Speaker 1>there was a condom.</v>

1454
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.413
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1455
00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Good move.</v>

1456
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise he'd get the super aids.</v>

1457
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.040
<v Speaker 1>They probably had to let you know.</v>

1458
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to get reckon.</v>

1459
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.171
<v Speaker 1>I don't wreck it.</v>

1460
00:41:32.171 --> 00:41:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to you guys.</v>

1461
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>We'll</v>

1462
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.810
<v Speaker 2>take the Tarzana hat off and you're all set.</v>

1463
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1464
00:41:36.351 --> 00:41:37.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be ridiculed.</v>

1465
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 2>It could be your move like Larry the cable guy.</v>

1466
00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't have that fucking shirt on,</v>

1467
00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:41.330
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to know who he is.</v>

1468
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1469
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.070
<v Speaker 2>That's a very clever move on his hat.</v>

1470
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Wear a baseball hat and wear a shirt that way when he's not,</v>

1471
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:49.730
<v Speaker 2>when he wants to dress up and go to a restaurant and we know why he looks like a</v>

1472
00:41:49.731 --> 00:41:52.700
<v Speaker 2>regular fucking redneck slides right in under the door.</v>

1473
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:53.991
<v Speaker 2>So go on.</v>

1474
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:54.824
<v Speaker 2>How much did you come</v>

1475
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.580
<v Speaker 2>to look?</v>

1476
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.191
<v Speaker 2>If it says,</v>

1477
00:41:58.191 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 2>if it sounds wrong the way I'm asking you,</v>

1478
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:00.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1479
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:01.304
<v Speaker 2>correct me.</v>

1480
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm new to this game.</v>

1481
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:04.751
<v Speaker 2>It was in a,</v>

1482
00:42:04.751 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1483
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I did it and that was it.</v>

1484
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 2>I pushed it and it was a good,</v>

1485
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it was good.</v>

1486
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1487
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.240
<v Speaker 2>well I did it.</v>

1488
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:18.783
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1489
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:19.783

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.420
<v Speaker 2>is that like eating and Kentucky Fried Chicken or is that like taking a really</v>

1491
00:42:23.421 --> 00:42:24.254
<v Speaker 2>good shit?</v>

1492
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I had more lean towards Kentucky Fried Chicken,</v>

1493
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:28.640

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:30.343
<v Speaker 2>It's good stuff.</v>
