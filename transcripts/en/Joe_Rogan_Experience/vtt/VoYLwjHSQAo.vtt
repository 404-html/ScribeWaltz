<v Speaker 1>I was in Singapore like 48 hours ago.</v>

12
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Did they make that special shiny silver one for you?</v>

13
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Because that looks like this design for you know it's,</v>

14
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.761

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

16
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it does Kinda look like it's designed for me,</v>

17
00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>which is why I wanted that.</v>

18
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a rock and roll.</v>

20
00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>One Championship.</v>

21
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>One AFC championship.</v>

22
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>So what's it like over there man?</v>

23
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain to everybody.</v>

24
00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:34.630
<v Speaker 1>One FC is like the Asian version of the UFC.</v>

25
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a gigantic organization that has been going on for how long now?</v>

26
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>2011 so solid seven years and really high level fights over there.</v>

28
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.681
<v Speaker 1>Amazing,</v>

29
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:45.411
<v Speaker 1>amazing fight.</v>

30
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Singapore itself is wild.</v>

31
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>So I went over there to chat with them.</v>

32
00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>So chat tree,</v>

33
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.143
<v Speaker 1>city of tongue,</v>

34
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Robinson and he and I had been chatting and,</v>

35
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>and I love kind of how they see martial arts.</v>

36
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>So they don't call it even fc anymore.</v>

37
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:01.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just one championship.</v>

38
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>They don't even use the word fighting.</v>

39
00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

40
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It's martial arts.</v>

41
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And the way I see it and the way I studied martial arts and share it is an art</v>

42
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>form like painting or yoga or you know,</v>

43
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

44
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>things of that nature.</v>

45
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.281
<v Speaker 1>Less spectacle.</v>

46
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>That's always how I've seen it and I was how I love it and that's how they see</v>

47
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>it and that's how they present it.</v>

48
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

49
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it's presented from this sort of inspirational own your history kind of way in</v>

50
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Asia.</v>

51
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And that was what attracted me to them right away.</v>

52
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.303
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

53
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely an art form.</v>

54
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>It's values based,</v>

55
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>like they're kind of seeking to inspire people through these athletes and</v>

56
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:38.291
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>

57
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking cool.</v>

58
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

59
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>what's motivating them to take this a sort of radical approach?</v>

60
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>So it's wild that you say that because to me this is the approach.</v>

61
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>So I think what we do or the way that we presented in North America is radical.</v>

62
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I think martial arts is an art form.</v>

63
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts is this inspiring thing.</v>

64
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean you take,</v>

65
00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>say for example on loud song,</v>

66
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>he is there 185 pound and 205 pound champion.</v>

67
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>He's from me and Mar,</v>

68
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.890
<v Speaker 1>they have never had a world champion in any sport ever in their history.</v>

69
00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they've had a gold medalist in the Olympics.</v>

70
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>They've never had that.</v>

71
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a two division champion that will,</v>

72
00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>and that when I talked to [inaudible] about it and he was talking sort of about</v>

73
00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 1>why he sees it this way and why he's proud to present it this way.</v>

74
00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:29.230
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

75
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>he knows without question that there are kids.</v>

76
00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:36.811
<v Speaker 1>And he won his 205 pound title in me and mark in a stadium in Myanmar and he</v>

77
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

78
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>he knows without question there's a kid in,</v>

79
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>they're going to become a lawyer one day because of that.</v>

80
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 1>And they can feel it and it's real.</v>

81
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:43.774
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

82
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a marketing strategy.</v>

83
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Like this is how they see martial arts and it's how martial arts is viewed in</v>

84
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Asia.</v>

85
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.593
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts,</v>

86
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I get to travel so much now it's viewed different in Russia.</v>

87
00:02:55.301 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>It's few different in Brazil.</v>

88
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

89
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.263
<v Speaker 1>Viewed in Russia.</v>

90
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Russia is wild man.</v>

91
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

92
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.110
<v Speaker 2>got to work for uh,</v>

93
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.033
<v Speaker 2>ACB,</v>

94
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.274
<v Speaker 2>ACB.</v>

96
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

97
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Not Organization,</v>

98
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.861
<v Speaker 2>big organizations.</v>

99
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.861
<v Speaker 2>So in Russia it's very masculine and it's about about victory and about showing</v>

100
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 2>your power and your strength and it really,</v>

101
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:14.511
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

102
00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>and Russia is like that,</v>

103
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 2>it's a reflection kind of of Russia.</v>

105
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

106
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

107
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 3>the martial art thing,</v>

108
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely agree with you on that.</v>

109
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 3>It is an art form,</v>

110
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 3>but I also think it's a fight like Gilbert Melendez versus Diego Sanchez.</v>

111
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

112
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 3>That's an art form.</v>

113
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 3>But it's a fight that was,</v>

114
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 3>that was a fucking wild fight.</v>

115
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 3>And there's no way that's just art.</v>

116
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.650
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

117
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 3>that's art and a fight.</v>

118
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 3>It's both things.</v>

119
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Is that a fight is hard.</v>

120
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.163
<v Speaker 2>It's a way.</v>

121
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 2>It is in a way.</v>

122
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Speaker 2>It's an expression of your personality,</v>

123
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:51.320
<v Speaker 2>your individuality.</v>

124
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.841
<v Speaker 2>It's heart.</v>

125
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Your fearlessness.</v>

126
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.240
<v Speaker 2>100% but it's a fight.</v>

127
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not scared of the word fight.</v>

128
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.951
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

129
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not</v>

130
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.561
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

131
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

132
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 3>I like that word.</v>

133
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 3>But it is an art form.</v>

134
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

135
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.553
<v Speaker 3>Fights are art.</v>

136
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.981
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

137
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:03.341
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

138
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:07.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean like Anderson Silva's second fight with shale son,</v>

139
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 3>the way he landed that need of the body on the ground with that is just art.</v>

140
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.673
<v Speaker 3>That's art,</v>

141
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.131
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

142
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:12.964
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

143
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.301
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

144
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 3>you go back to Leo Machida just landing that front kick on Vitor Belfort,</v>

145
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.560
<v Speaker 3>that's our into is,</v>

146
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 3>it's especially for someone who practices</v>

147
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.923
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>

148
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you see the beauty in that you're like,</v>

149
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.121
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

150
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:29.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like a flower blossoming or sunrise or just something perfect.</v>

151
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.950
<v Speaker 2>The impossibility of it is what's so beautiful.</v>

152
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys are so unwilling partners and they have such like a desire to</v>

153
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.280
<v Speaker 2>accomplish what they want to accomplish.</v>

154
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.310
<v Speaker 2>To kick that guy in the face from that position with Victoria has a lifetime of</v>

155
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:47.364
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

156
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.460
<v Speaker 2>a lifetime of being able to not let you do that and for you to first be willing</v>

157
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:54.840
<v Speaker 2>to be free enough to try it,</v>

158
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:55.951
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

160
00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:56.784
<v Speaker 2>and to,</v>

161
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.800
<v Speaker 2>to express it in that moment.</v>

162
00:04:58.801 --> 00:04:59.760
<v Speaker 2>It is definitely hard,</v>

163
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:00.051
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

164
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:00.601
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

165
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Fight doesn't intimidate me at all.</v>

166
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.201
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

167
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:05.610
<v Speaker 2>a fight is a beautiful thing.</v>

168
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:08.400
<v Speaker 2>A fight is we fight for things all the time.</v>

169
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

170
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.040
<v Speaker 2>it's a metaphor for life itself when you fight.</v>

171
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

172
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 3>bull rightly so,</v>

173
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.360
<v Speaker 3>are concerned with the idea of violence against someone who's an unwilling</v>

174
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 3>participant.</v>

175
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's how they think of fighting.</v>

176
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 3>They think of it as this thing that they want nothing to do with.</v>

177
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 3>They don't want any violence in their life.</v>

178
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 3>They don't want anybody to hurt them.</v>

179
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 3>And I completely understand that.</v>

180
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 3>I understand that position.</v>

181
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 3>But that's not what it is.</v>

182
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 3>When it's a competition.</v>

183
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

184
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.821
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

185
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a tired expression because I've said it too many times,</v>

186
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 3>but my perception of what fighting is is high level problem solving with dire</v>

187
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:45.420
<v Speaker 3>physical consequences.</v>

188
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

189
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Time.</v>

190
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.570
<v Speaker 2>And then the physical consequences are what make it so special.</v>

191
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

192
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.153
<v Speaker 2>No question,</v>

193
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.203
<v Speaker 2>no question.</v>

194
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Times make the good times better,</v>

195
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

196
00:05:56.571 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

197
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

198
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

199
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.710
<v Speaker 3>the possibility that bad things can happen to you and do sometimes happen even</v>

200
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 3>to the great ones,</v>

201
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

202
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:04.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

203
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 3>you see great fighters had been KOD and come back and you know,</v>

204
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

205
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.321
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

206
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that where you realize like,</v>

207
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:11.661
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

208
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 3>even fade or it can get knocked out.</v>

209
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.331
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

210
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:14.661
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

211
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>

212
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

213
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva can get play cocky and get caught by that.</v>

214
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Chris Weidman left hook.</v>

215
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

216
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 3>this is just,</v>

217
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 3>this is just the game</v>

218
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

219
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I think in Asia in particular,</v>

220
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's different pockets of,</v>

221
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>of how these this is viewed and how the philosophy of,</v>

222
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>of connecting to martial arts and fighting is viewed.</v>

223
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And in Asia you would see a certain amount of the fighters would see being</v>

224
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>losing badly is,</v>

225
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:42.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

226
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

227
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.233
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>

228
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>a chance because to come back and win again or to come back and show that you're</v>

229
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>able and you,</v>

230
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>you were given the gift of trying and failing.</v>

231
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.863
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

232
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you know you man,</v>

233
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.120
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

234
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

235
00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:56.770
<v Speaker 3>That's a great way to approach it.</v>

236
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a great way to look at it.</v>

237
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

238
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 3>That there really is a lesson that the average person can take in their life.</v>

239
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Like every time a person does have a bad thing happen to them,</v>

240
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 3>it's an that dead terrible feelings and opportunity to rise from the ashes.</v>

241
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And winning when it's,</v>

243
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>when you're just winning at everything.</v>

244
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>And things come easily to you that I'm sure it still feels good,</v>

245
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>but when you've gone through really hard times or when you've been challenged by</v>

246
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 1>something or do you drop lower,</v>

247
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>the high of the success is so much higher.</v>

248
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 1>It's so much of a longer journey.</v>

249
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.293
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

250
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 1>when we've spoke before and when we talked about cm punk,</v>

251
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 1>when he was fighting the first time,</v>

252
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

253
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.210
<v Speaker 1>this is stupid.</v>

254
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

255
00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 1>and this guy is,</v>

256
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 1>is pushing,</v>

257
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>stacking himself into a position to try to not fail by making the challenge so</v>

258
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>difficult that even if he fails,</v>

259
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:48.854
<v Speaker 1>you don't really,</v>

260
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>but this is fully different now,</v>

261
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.383
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm,</v>

262
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm cheering for him because he was humiliated like he was.</v>

263
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>He didn't just fail.</v>

264
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.440
<v Speaker 1>He was humiliated.</v>

265
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

266
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>he in front of everybody was shown to be,</v>

267
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>people would judge them as weak or people the judgment that he would feel his</v>

269
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>bad and he sat,</v>

270
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I'll go do it again.</v>

271
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.403
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

272
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 1>we are now in a completely different context because that's a guy who epically</v>

273
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>failed in front of everybody and then dealt with that and now says,</v>

274
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I will try the journey again and this will make me a better person and I now I</v>

275
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 1>fully endorse this,</v>

276
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm cheering for him.</v>

277
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:28.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

278
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:32.320
<v Speaker 3>he's now fighting a fighter who's commensurate in talent and there's nothing</v>

279
00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:34.900
<v Speaker 3>wrong with being a beginner in martial arts,</v>

280
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.830
<v Speaker 3>but there's something wrong with thinking that you can be a beginner and fight</v>

281
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Micky gall big time.</v>

282
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

283
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 3>It was a foolish venture and I,</v>

284
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:42.880
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

285
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.560
<v Speaker 3>I wa my approach to it was this is going to be a very good lesson for people</v>

286
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.770
<v Speaker 3>that are fans of positive thinking and they think that's enough.</v>

287
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.160
<v Speaker 3>That shit is not enough.</v>

288
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 3>If you weigh 110 pounds,</v>

289
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.731
<v Speaker 2>you get positive.</v>

290
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Think your way to the bank.</v>

291
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Frances and Ganos still gonna Punch your brains out.</v>

292
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way around it.</v>

293
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.030
<v Speaker 2>And a guy who has really very little experience in martial arts and has</v>

294
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 2>rudimentary control of his body.</v>

295
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

296
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 2>that's what I saw when I saw him training.</v>

297
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.211
<v Speaker 2>When I saw him training,</v>

298
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

299
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

300
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 2>he's getting killed</v>

301
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 2>in that context.</v>

302
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.870
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

303
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 2>but he belongs here.</v>

304
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

305
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.283
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

306
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 2>and everything's contextual.</v>

307
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

308
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 2>just because I thought that was stupid.</v>

309
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 2>It was stupid.</v>

310
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>It was stupid.</v>

311
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean in this context,</v>

312
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I can't look and go.</v>

313
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy who didn't need to,</v>

314
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't need to come back.</v>

315
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:37.920
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't need to try again.</v>

316
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't need to go into the gym.</v>

317
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:39.864
<v Speaker 2>And I've been there.</v>

318
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.710
<v Speaker 2>You're in the gym and everyone's gone out,</v>

319
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:41.911
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

320
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>

321
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.103
<v Speaker 2>You did good.</v>

322
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do guy fucking failed miserably in front of everybody.</v>

323
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 2>And then show up there cleaning the mats and work really hard and said,</v>

324
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try it again.</v>

325
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

326
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

327
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 2>that fight still him and this guy still should take place somewhere else.</v>

328
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.241
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

329
00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:57.200
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent sure.</v>

330
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

331
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't even be on the Tuesday night contender show.</v>

332
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

333
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:00.571
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

334
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't.</v>

335
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Should be in some amateur event somewhere because that's really what they are</v>

336
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:05.770
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

337
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 2>They're guys learning how to compete.</v>

338
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

339
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

340
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.100
<v Speaker 2>during the first fight in the paper view.</v>

341
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

342
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking crazy.</v>

343
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 2>But that has nothing to do with them.</v>

344
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.120
<v Speaker 2>That is a reflection on the company that's on a perception on,</v>

345
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 2>on the choices that the machine makes.</v>

346
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

347
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.420
<v Speaker 2>and we also gave them a juicy contract.</v>

348
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.283
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

349
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.140
<v Speaker 2>make that valid or viable right to make money off it.</v>

350
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 2>But that again,</v>

351
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes,</v>

352
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 2>it makes it deeper and harder and more chances to fail epically and,</v>

353
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 2>and I lost twice in a row and then still want it to fight again and still</v>

354
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

355
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 2>I really want it to,</v>

356
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.400
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

357
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 2>and it was important to me and it meant something to me and I was going to</v>

358
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:48.660
<v Speaker 2>change as a human being by doing it.</v>

359
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.980
<v Speaker 2>And I was ridiculed.</v>

360
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I can relate to what he's going through,</v>

361
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 2>but I did it on a little show and in Winnipeg,</v>

362
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:55.074
<v Speaker 2>Manitoba,</v>

363
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.973
<v Speaker 2>we know what I mean.</v>

364
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I would never have put myself in that place to look bad,</v>

365
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 2>but here he is and here it is and I'm cheering for him as a store,</v>

366
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:09.951
<v Speaker 2>as a human being in a weird situation that has been put himself into a deep dark</v>

367
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:16.920
<v Speaker 2>hard spot and saying my way out of this is to try really hard and really go in</v>

368
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:17.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

369
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 2>and the chance all of that I would want for him if I knew them and he was my</v>

370
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:26.550
<v Speaker 2>friend is to fight your way through some adverse situations to be able to be in</v>

371
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 2>it and find when it's hard you discover,</v>

372
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah I can handle it when it's hard,</v>

373
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

374
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 2>I can get up when I've been dropped or I can fight through not being able to</v>

375
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:35.310
<v Speaker 2>breathe.</v>

376
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 2>If he loses and does that,</v>

377
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 2>it will have been worth it for him.</v>

378
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 2>No matter how much ridicule he'll take,</v>

379
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 2>it will have been worth it for him.</v>

380
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.140
<v Speaker 2>What was really weird watching him walk to the cage was that he was approaching</v>

381
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 2>and liga pro wrestling fight cause he had done so many of these pro wrestling</v>

382
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 2>matches that he was walking to the cage with like pro wrestling,</v>

383
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 2>mannerisms,</v>

384
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

385
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.830
<v Speaker 3>And I all,</v>

386
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.480
<v Speaker 3>I was watching this and I,</v>

387
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

388
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 3>I did like an internal head shake.</v>

389
00:11:58.661 --> 00:11:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck yeah,</v>

390
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.040
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>

391
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.873
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

392
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 3>it was a terrible idea.</v>

393
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Like whoever his side said that he could fight Micky Gall,</v>

394
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:09.880
<v Speaker 3>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

395
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Watch that kid fight once a kid is very good on the ground,</v>

396
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>

397
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Big and strong young standups.</v>

398
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Not bad either.</v>

399
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

400
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 3>and he's tough as shit and he's smart,</v>

401
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 3>he's clever and he's mean.</v>

402
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 3>He's mean fucker.</v>

403
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 3>And that is at that stage he was maybe one to know,</v>

404
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:26.891
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

405
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:26.951
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

406
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:27.784
<v Speaker 3>maybe too,</v>

407
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the lowest level that there is in the entire elite world of</v>

408
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:32.381
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>

409
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Not that it didn't matter the way.</v>

410
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

411
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.190
<v Speaker 3>like you saw it,</v>

412
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 3>you saw the way it took that guy's back and the way sinks hooks in when he was</v>

413
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.050
<v Speaker 3>on top and just delivering that type.</v>

414
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

415
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

416
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 3>and you're 100% right.</v>

417
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 3>What if somebody is watching that?</v>

418
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 3>That is the reality of thinking I won't really war I,</v>

419
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll put myself in a situation that I can't win,</v>

420
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 3>but I've got guts and heart and I believe I'm going to do it.</v>

421
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 3>You get the metaphorical version of that punch in the face.</v>

422
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 3>If you go through life like that,</v>

423
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 3>yes you do and you know what?</v>

424
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't do it in fighting because you don't want those punches in the face</v>

425
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 3>if you can't avoid them.</v>

426
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.693
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

427
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a situation where you're,</v>

428
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 3>you want to prove your toughness and you want to be battled against someone</v>

429
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 3>who's of your skill level and try to figure your way through the maze of this</v>

430
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 3>contest,</v>

431
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

432
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 3>What doesn't make sense is getting punched in the face unnecessarily.</v>

433
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 3>And when you fight,</v>

434
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.233
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

435
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 3>when I looked at that fight,</v>

436
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

437
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 3>Mickey galls going to smash him.</v>

438
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Speaker 3>This is just how it's going to go.</v>

439
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.980
<v Speaker 3>There's very few fights where I can tell you this is absolutely gonna happen.</v>

440
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

441
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example.</v>

442
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Ropy Hofeld dose on Joe's,</v>

443
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:39.851
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

444
00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:40.321
<v Speaker 3>against,</v>

445
00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

446
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Colby Covington.</v>

447
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck's happened.</v>

448
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.210
<v Speaker 3>No idea how to,</v>

449
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

450
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:43.751
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

451
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:44.441
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get in there.</v>

452
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna throw it down.</v>

453
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

454
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.773
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

455
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 3>Micky gall versus,</v>

456
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

460
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Phil Jackson.</v>

461
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 3>No apartment.</v>

462
00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.370

466
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Jamie Brooks.</v>

467
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Brooks.</v>

468
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Brooks.</v>

469
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.473
<v Speaker 3>Phil Brooks.</v>

470
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:04.991
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

471
00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Phil.</v>

472
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.453
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

473
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.211
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

474
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:07.361
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

475
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:07.541
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

476
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 3>this is a terrible idea because he's just going to get,</v>

477
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.070
<v Speaker 3>you can only get punched in the face so many times in your life.</v>

478
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

479
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 3>And you have a number,</v>

480
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 3>whatever the number is,</v>

481
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:15.184
<v Speaker 3>everybody's different.</v>

482
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Mark Hunt's number seems to be extraordinarily high.</v>

483
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

484
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.703
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

485
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.520
<v Speaker 3>there's some people that could just take it and this is true,</v>

486
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

487
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 3>you don't want it when you can't avoid it.</v>

488
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.571
<v Speaker 3>And he could,</v>

489
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:28.760
<v Speaker 3>he's not gonna avoid it in that fight and I'm just going to get smashed and less</v>

490
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 3>make,</v>

491
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 3>he caught a crazy armbar early in the fight and that was what he gave him.</v>

492
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

493
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

494
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Other than that he's getting his face smashed in and you should not do that if</v>

495
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:37.954
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to.</v>

496
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:38.883
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

497
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 3>I remember when we spoke about it,</v>

498
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:45.871
<v Speaker 3>it's unconscious incompetence and that if you don't know what you don't know,</v>

499
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 3>like it's a really fucking weird place to be.</v>

500
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>And we go through life that way a lot of times</v>

501
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of different contacts until you find out,</v>

502
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

503
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 1>conscious incompetence where like,</v>

504
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.101
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

505
00:14:58.101 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about this.</v>

506
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And he wasn't even at that point.</v>

507
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Now he's at that point and he has a lower level thing.</v>

508
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

509
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

510
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>

511
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a mistake to start down this road.</v>

512
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>But you're down at now.</v>

513
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.303
<v Speaker 1>You're on it now.</v>

514
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.203
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

515
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

516
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.690
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that,</v>

517
00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:14.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

518
00:15:14.531 --> 00:15:15.610
<v Speaker 3>he's taken,</v>

519
00:15:15.611 --> 00:15:15.911
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

520
00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:17.500
<v Speaker 3>two years since that fight.</v>

521
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

522
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.660
<v Speaker 3>It's been about two years getting there and we've subsequently got to see Micky</v>

523
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Gall and some contests against some really tough guys age.</v>

524
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

525
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

526
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Beat some good guys.</v>

527
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.381
<v Speaker 3>And we got to see like,</v>

528
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:29.651
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

529
00:15:29.651 --> 00:15:31.060
<v Speaker 3>this kid is fucking for real,</v>

530
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:33.250
<v Speaker 3>which is what we suspected all along.</v>

531
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.040
<v Speaker 3>But we don't know anything about Phil.</v>

532
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.390
<v Speaker 3>We haven't seen him spar,</v>

533
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 3>we haven't seen retrained.</v>

534
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.480
<v Speaker 3>But from what I saw when I first saw him training the,</v>

535
00:15:42.481 --> 00:15:43.180
<v Speaker 3>the first,</v>

536
00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:43.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

537
00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:45.570
<v Speaker 3>when I first saw him sparring and moving around,</v>

538
00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:46.200
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

539
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.771
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

540
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:47.920
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of work to be done.</v>

541
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

542
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

543
00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:51.250
<v Speaker 3>like first steps of Everest work to be done.</v>

544
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:51.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

545
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.331
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

546
00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:52.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

547
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.340
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about a guy who has like a deep background in martial arts,</v>

548
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.610
<v Speaker 3>like a Brock Lesnar wrestling is absolutely a martial art.</v>

549
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.870
<v Speaker 3>He was a legit top of the food chain amateur wrestler.</v>

550
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:05.610
<v Speaker 3>He was a fucking</v>

551
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.620
<v Speaker 1>monster and a physical monster.</v>

552
00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

553
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

554
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.410
<v Speaker 1>that and a psychological monster,</v>

555
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.630
<v Speaker 1>like fighting his skills for sure.</v>

556
00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:14.760
<v Speaker 1>But it's your body and it's your mind.</v>

557
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.970
<v Speaker 1>And when you are a heavy competitor,</v>

558
00:16:17.971 --> 00:16:19.140
<v Speaker 1>when you focus,</v>

559
00:16:19.141 --> 00:16:22.140
<v Speaker 1>when you're able to focus in the deepest,</v>

560
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.000
<v Speaker 1>most fearful conditions,</v>

561
00:16:24.001 --> 00:16:24.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

562
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:24.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

563
00:16:24.481 --> 00:16:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar did that,</v>

564
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

565
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.233
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

566
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.590
<v Speaker 1>physically when you're aware,</v>

567
00:16:28.591 --> 00:16:29.071
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

568
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:32.180
<v Speaker 1>we are aware of where your body is in space and how to control it.</v>

569
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.810
<v Speaker 1>That can take a lifetime.</v>

570
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.420
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a weird one,</v>

571
00:16:36.421 --> 00:16:36.880
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

572
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 3>something you also develop as a child,</v>

573
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:39.950
<v Speaker 3>as a young kid.</v>

574
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're in your developmental years,</v>

575
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.180
<v Speaker 3>1314,</v>

576
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:44.601
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

577
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 3>you're body's growing and it's growing into whipping kicks and punches and</v>

578
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:50.450
<v Speaker 3>shooting takedowns and landing chokes.</v>

579
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Your body develops that way.</v>

580
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 3>When you're a full grown man in your thirties and then you're starting to throw</v>

581
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.430
<v Speaker 3>roundhouse kicks in front kicks and you're,</v>

582
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 3>your body's all goofy and shit and it doesn't,</v>

583
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.150
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to listen.</v>

584
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:02.511
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

585
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:03.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not pliable.</v>

586
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:04.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not elastic.</v>

587
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.070
<v Speaker 3>It says that you're a different animal.</v>

588
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.080
<v Speaker 1>You can still learn anything.</v>

589
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.790
<v Speaker 1>You at 50 years old,</v>

590
00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:13.620
<v Speaker 1>you can take up anything in the world.</v>

591
00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 1>You'd take up anything and you should,</v>

592
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:15.581
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

593
00:17:15.581 --> 00:17:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you should be shitting,</v>

594
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 1>go in the NFL with it.</v>

596
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Or if you start playing piano when you're 50 you should learn to play piano and</v>

597
00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:24.060
<v Speaker 1>show all your friends that you know the song or,</v>

598
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but you can't go like,</v>

599
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:26.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

600
00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:29.670
<v Speaker 1>be in a concert piano scenario where you're going to fail and,</v>

601
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.020
<v Speaker 1>and doing it and saying,</v>

602
00:17:31.021 --> 00:17:31.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:17:31.171 --> 00:17:36.171
<v Speaker 1>I believe doesn't make a difference when you can't physically or mentally or</v>

604
00:17:36.421 --> 00:17:37.710
<v Speaker 1>psychologically do these things.</v>

605
00:17:37.711 --> 00:17:42.420
<v Speaker 1>But I still think learning and growing and chasing things and self improvement</v>

606
00:17:42.421 --> 00:17:43.620
<v Speaker 1>is the root of who we are.</v>

607
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

608
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:44.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

609
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:45.680
<v Speaker 3>I think it is too.</v>

610
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 3>But you can't be a 34 year old man has never boxed a day your life and have a</v>

611
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 3>goal</v>

612
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.440
<v Speaker 2>to in 12 months fight Loma Chanko no,</v>

613
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.033
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

614
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to happen.</v>

615
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 2>And if it does happen,</v>

616
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a disaster.</v>

617
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:04.190
<v Speaker 2>And that there are giant exceptions like one in a million of things where people</v>

618
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:05.221
<v Speaker 2>do things,</v>

619
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 2>but there's always some other explanation.</v>

620
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 2>And often it is as a youth,</v>

621
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 2>they created the neural pathways and the physicality and the connection to their</v>

622
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:14.880
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

623
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

624
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

625
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

626
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I did gymnastics when I was a kid and I loved it.</v>

627
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 2>It's great base.</v>

628
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:19.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

629
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:20.551
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

630
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:20.761
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

631
00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:21.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

632
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

633
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 2>it helps you physically understand where your body is.</v>

634
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.930
<v Speaker 2>And so later on in life,</v>

635
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I was always at least okay at sports because I understood how to move my body in</v>

636
00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 2>space and I understood where my hand was compared to my foot and how I balanced</v>

637
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:36.060
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

638
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 2>and to learn that as a child,</v>

639
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 2>somebody who was a master of something as a kid who at 30 picks up another thing</v>

640
00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 2>and has some really advanced learning abilities.</v>

641
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.870
<v Speaker 2>There are exceptions that we see rare exceptions,</v>

642
00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:49.410
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

643
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.041
<v Speaker 2>but you're right,</v>

644
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean reality still reality.</v>

645
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:52.831
<v Speaker 2>I wonder too,</v>

646
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 2>if those exceptions are genetic,</v>

647
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if like maybe perhaps someone in their family was a great athlete and</v>

648
00:18:58.021 --> 00:18:59.640
<v Speaker 2>it's transferred through their genes,</v>

649
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 2>which I am as I get older,</v>

650
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 2>a firm believer in,</v>

651
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

652
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think we know enough about what transfers through genes.</v>

653
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.210
<v Speaker 2>But there's some freaky shit I see in my kids in particular where I go,</v>

654
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:12.541
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

655
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:14.520
<v Speaker 2>that is my fucking personality.</v>

656
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:17.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the something and I'm not teaching her to do this.</v>

657
00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:19.140
<v Speaker 2>This is something that's in her like this,</v>

658
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 2>the repetitive g like exercise,</v>

659
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 2>like doing things over and over again,</v>

660
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.790
<v Speaker 2>obsessively like there's,</v>

661
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.200
<v Speaker 2>there's some weird shit that like,</v>

662
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

663
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's a neural pathway that's passed down through the DNA.</v>

664
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just seems like there could be a person who's never engaged in</v>

665
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:38.371
<v Speaker 2>athletics,</v>

666
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 2>but maybe their grandfather was like a world champion boxer and then one day</v>

667
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:46.100
<v Speaker 2>they put on the gloves and then they just sorta like start moving around and the</v>

668
00:19:46.101 --> 00:19:46.561
<v Speaker 2>coach was like,</v>

669
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

670
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on here?</v>

671
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you learn how to throw a jab like that?</v>

672
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm forgetting.</v>

673
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Francis and Ghana's coach's name,</v>

674
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name is Fernando Lopez.</v>

675
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

676
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.070
<v Speaker 2>He's a wonderful guy.</v>

677
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 2>A smart guy.</v>

678
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.141
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

679
00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:04.230
<v Speaker 2>He's been around like the best of the best through Europe,</v>

680
00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 2>so and Cameroon to France and these areas.</v>

681
00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 2>And he's seen the best of the best that that genetic crop of humans has to</v>

682
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:12.774
<v Speaker 2>offer.</v>

683
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 2>And then Francis and got it walks into his gym and you talk to Y'all next time</v>

684
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you see for an end to ask them about this cause you see his eyes light up like</v>

685
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.570
<v Speaker 2>that thing where this like a color in the eye and he's like,</v>

686
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

687
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:25.950
<v Speaker 2>I just knew,</v>

688
00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:26.850
<v Speaker 2>like he said,</v>

689
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:31.350
<v Speaker 2>I watched him do things in his awareness of his body and how he could physically</v>

690
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:31.981
<v Speaker 2>express himself.</v>

691
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.140
<v Speaker 2>He said he had just never seen anything like it and this is,</v>

692
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

693
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>week one in the gym,</v>

694
00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:37.320
<v Speaker 2>he said first sparring session.</v>

695
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 2>He didn't really know how to fight yet,</v>

696
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.740
<v Speaker 2>but he said he saw him adapting and learning within the round against somebody</v>

697
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 2>who knew how to fight and you see it in his eyes.</v>

698
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:46.200
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

699
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>he literally found fucking Unicorn</v>

700
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.310
<v Speaker 1>just strolled in off the street and came in.</v>

701
00:20:51.311 --> 00:20:52.144
<v Speaker 1>And then he was like,</v>

702
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.451
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

703
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 1>if he's had some work ethic,</v>

704
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:54.724
<v Speaker 1>if he is like,</v>

705
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

706
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 1>if he's passionate about this,</v>

707
00:20:57.371 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 1>if he can commit and learn and all that,</v>

708
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 1>it goes physically,</v>

709
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 1>genetically speaking,</v>

710
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.770
<v Speaker 1>this human being,</v>

711
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 1>the length of his bones,</v>

712
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:04.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

713
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.130
<v Speaker 1>the speed of his neurology,</v>

714
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 1>all of these things he said you just knew and you see it in his face.</v>

715
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

716
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.051
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

717
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:12.250
<v Speaker 1>That must have been wild.</v>

718
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Like it must have been wild to,</v>

719
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.830
<v Speaker 1>to experience that when you have a lifetime of seeing.</v>

720
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:19.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

721
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like that scene in the color of money.</v>

722
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you ever saw the movie of course with Paul Move Paul Newman and</v>

723
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cruise when a Paul Newman,</v>

724
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:29.680
<v Speaker 3>here's Tom Cruise,</v>

725
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 3>break the balls for the first time.</v>

726
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:31.871
<v Speaker 3>It turns a rose.</v>

727
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is going on over here?</v>

728
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 3>And he looks over and he sees his kid.</v>

729
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.191
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

730
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 3>there's certain people that just have this crazy talent and when someone has</v>

731
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:45.031
<v Speaker 3>been around for a long time as a coach and had a bunch of untalented or</v>

732
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 3>reasonably talented are very talented people.</v>

733
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:47.891
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

734
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:52.600
<v Speaker 3>this big stew of humans coming to their gym and you see that one unicorn that</v>

735
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 3>steps in and he's also case where his father,</v>

736
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:56.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean he doesn't have a backer,</v>

737
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.590
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have a background in martial arts before he started training,</v>

738
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.240
<v Speaker 3>but his father was a great street fighter and it's entirely possible that</v>

739
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:06.930
<v Speaker 3>something was carried on through him or</v>

740
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 1>something was present in both.</v>

741
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:12.760
<v Speaker 1>That allowed them both to be capable of doing that rather than the learn to</v>

742
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:13.271
<v Speaker 1>pass.</v>

743
00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause we don't know how that passes genetically from,</v>

744
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.800
<v Speaker 1>from behavior.</v>

745
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.430
<v Speaker 1>We know that genetically we may behave similar to our parents,</v>

746
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:22.080
<v Speaker 1>our kids,</v>

747
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.250
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

748
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 1>When we don't know if that came from that.</v>

749
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.503
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

750
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

751
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hoe this weirdly uncomfortable thinking about genetics because I don't</v>

752
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that we're limited by them.</v>

753
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And I know that we're not on some level,</v>

754
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.391
<v Speaker 1>but we are,</v>

755
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

756
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 1>but then I'm not going to play basketball.</v>

757
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 1>He has since Lebron James.</v>

758
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:46.780
<v Speaker 1>But if we identified no,</v>

759
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

760
00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:47.914
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>

761
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

762
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Where we do,</v>

763
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.031
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to go.</v>

764
00:22:50.031 --> 00:22:50.471
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

765
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

766
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

767
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:51.720
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

768
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some truths.</v>

769
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:55.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

770
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm five foot six on a tall day.</v>

771
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that is a genetic limitation that is undeniable.</v>

772
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

773
00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

774
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.730
<v Speaker 1>but if we're looking at things and we decide that our genes,</v>

775
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.890
<v Speaker 1>have you seen the movie Gattica they ever seen them?</v>

776
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:09.280
<v Speaker 1>We've been,</v>

777
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I did see that movie a long time ago.</v>

778
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why my favorite movies ever.</v>

779
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.653
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

780
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Ethan Hawke.</v>

781
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Train hoc.</v>

782
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

783
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I always think of him as Uma Thurman.</v>

784
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

785
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.613
<v Speaker 1>she's in it.</v>

786
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.221
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

787
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 1>but I think of him cause he used to be married to her.</v>

788
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:24.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

789
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:24.641
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

790
00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 1>that's Uma Thurman Thurman.</v>

791
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.021
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>

792
00:23:28.021 --> 00:23:28.854
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

793
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>In that movie,</v>

794
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 1>his brother is genetically superior to him,</v>

795
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.520
<v Speaker 1>but he beats his brother in the swimming contests all the time.</v>

796
00:23:36.521 --> 00:23:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And at the end his brother is like,</v>

797
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing this?</v>

798
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:39.671
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

799
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I never saved anything for the swim back.</v>

800
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to swim to the other side.</v>

801
00:23:43.251 --> 00:23:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And his brothers,</v>

802
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>like there is no fucking other side.</v>

803
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.910
<v Speaker 1>But it was a [inaudible].</v>

804
00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:46.743
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a movie,</v>

805
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was a mindset.</v>

806
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

807
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.960
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that's like talent.</v>

808
00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:51.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

809
00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>So you're talented at certain things and Jamie's talents a certain things.</v>

810
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Francis and Ghana.</v>

811
00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Talented talent multiplied by effort equals skill.</v>

812
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

813
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Then skill multiplied by effort equals accomplishment.</v>

814
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.060
<v Speaker 1>So effort counts twice,</v>

815
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

816
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

817
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>for counts fucking twice.</v>

818
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.920
<v Speaker 3>But then you get effort with a talented guy with freak genetics,</v>

819
00:24:13.921 --> 00:24:18.921
<v Speaker 3>like a Lebron James or a Michael Jordan or Brock Lesnar and then you get some</v>

820
00:24:19.081 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 3>crazy</v>

821
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.030
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

822
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

823
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

824
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.230
<v Speaker 1>big time.</v>

825
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.780
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who doesn't have the,</v>

826
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.660
<v Speaker 1>the talent but had effort twice,</v>

827
00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 1>effort was applied twice.</v>

828
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:33.200
<v Speaker 1>We'll go as far as the man or woman will go as far as they possibly could to</v>

829
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:37.040
<v Speaker 1>actualize their true potential by committing themselves to,</v>

830
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.070
<v Speaker 1>to effort and not going,</v>

831
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:40.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

832
00:24:40.221 --> 00:24:40.791
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

833
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 1>So forget it.</v>

834
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.060
<v Speaker 1>By applying effort over and over and over again.</v>

835
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And then once you've developed talent,</v>

836
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 1>more effort to take that talent and do something that twice used effort,</v>

837
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 1>we'll get you as far as you possibly can.</v>

838
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.761
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>

839
00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:52.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

840
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gifted,</v>

841
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:54.771
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talented,</v>

842
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:56.270
<v Speaker 1>so I won't put in any effort.</v>

843
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.740
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea how far you can go.</v>

844
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.860
<v Speaker 1>So I absolutely cannot beat Francis in Ghana,</v>

845
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:06.020
<v Speaker 1>but by not thinking that I'm too limited by my jeans and continuing to apply</v>

846
00:25:06.021 --> 00:25:06.291
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>

847
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:07.460
<v Speaker 1>regardless of my jeans,</v>

848
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I can get to the best possible place I can as an individual.</v>

849
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

850
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.150
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that on some,</v>

851
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.920
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go down some road that you cannot be accomplished,</v>

852
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.640
<v Speaker 1>but you also don't want to not go down roads because you're not genetically</v>

853
00:25:22.641 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 1>predisposed to them.</v>

854
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I think African get you somewhere.</v>

855
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.190
<v Speaker 3>It definitely can get you somewhere.</v>

856
00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:29.550
<v Speaker 3>But I think what we're talking about here is what I love about life is that it's</v>

857
00:25:29.551 --> 00:25:30.384
<v Speaker 3>messy.</v>

858
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

859
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.561
<v Speaker 3>That there's not,</v>

860
00:25:31.561 --> 00:25:33.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not one plus one is two,</v>

861
00:25:33.361 --> 00:25:33.700
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

862
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.130
<v Speaker 3>There's not as Zeros and ones.</v>

863
00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:35.581
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

864
00:25:35.581 --> 00:25:36.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of factors.</v>

865
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Does a lot of shit going on,</v>

866
00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:38.880
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

867
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's why when something magical takes place,</v>

868
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.271
<v Speaker 3>when you get,</v>

869
00:25:42.271 --> 00:25:42.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

870
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:43.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

871
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:43.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

872
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:44.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

873
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.210
<v Speaker 3>George Saint Pierre,</v>

874
00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:45.901
<v Speaker 3>or when you,</v>

875
00:25:45.901 --> 00:25:47.340
<v Speaker 3>you get a mighty mouse,</v>

876
00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:48.540
<v Speaker 3>when you get someone who's like,</v>

877
00:25:48.541 --> 00:25:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

878
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.950
<v Speaker 3>look at that,</v>

879
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.430
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

880
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.700
<v Speaker 3>there's so many factors that lead you to be,</v>

881
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

882
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:54.421
<v Speaker 3>Gennady.</v>

883
00:25:54.421 --> 00:25:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Golovkin yeah.</v>

884
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.350
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different things have to fall into place.</v>

885
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.450
<v Speaker 3>Or here's a guy,</v>

886
00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:00.690
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

887
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.890
<v Speaker 3>how about Michael Bisping?</v>

888
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisping is just one of the toughest motherfuckers ever example.</v>

889
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

890
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.720
<v Speaker 3>But you found the perfect,</v>

891
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

892
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisbing is one of the toughest motherfuckers ever.</v>

893
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.000
<v Speaker 3>He's not extraordinarily talented in any one form of MMA.</v>

894
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.100
<v Speaker 3>He's not like the fastest guy.</v>

895
00:26:20.101 --> 00:26:21.450
<v Speaker 3>He's not the strongest guy.</v>

896
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.350
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have this great background in Brazilian Jujitsu where he's just a</v>

897
00:26:25.351 --> 00:26:26.670
<v Speaker 3>worldclass strangler.</v>

898
00:26:26.671 --> 00:26:27.720
<v Speaker 3>And if he gets your back,</v>

899
00:26:27.721 --> 00:26:28.554
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

900
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.700
<v Speaker 3>There's none of those things.</v>

901
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.860
<v Speaker 3>He's just tough as fuck.</v>

902
00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:34.410
<v Speaker 3>And he's one of the most mentally strong guys.</v>

903
00:26:34.411 --> 00:26:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Like even Tim Kennedy who was here the other day,</v>

904
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.321
<v Speaker 3>Tim Kenny,</v>

905
00:26:37.321 --> 00:26:37.740
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

906
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:37.981
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

907
00:26:37.981 --> 00:26:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I hate to give him a compliment.</v>

908
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:39.381
<v Speaker 3>Police.</v>

909
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:41.070
<v Speaker 3>So fucking tough can't,</v>

910
00:26:41.071 --> 00:26:41.940
<v Speaker 3>you can't deny them.</v>

911
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:42.160
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

912
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:42.630
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

913
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

914
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:43.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

915
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and that goes right back to this,</v>

916
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:49.911
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is at the root of questions about life because Michael Bisbing</v>

917
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 1>genetically tough.</v>

918
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Is he genetically mentally tough or did he work really hard and just push</v>

919
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 1>himself through things?</v>

920
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 1>And that one day when it got really fucking tough,</v>

921
00:26:58.441 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 1>he didn't give up,</v>

922
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:01.080
<v Speaker 1>which taught him that he shouldn't give up,</v>

923
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:02.520
<v Speaker 1>which taught him to go even further,</v>

924
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.780
<v Speaker 1>which made him push himself or was it in all likelihood it's both.</v>

925
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.930
<v Speaker 1>But Michael Bisping free of that effort to continue to because um,</v>

926
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

927
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

928
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Think of the mentally toughest guy that,</v>

929
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

930
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

931
00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I have a thing with names sometimes,</v>

932
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:19.470
<v Speaker 1>even names I know I'll describe.</v>

933
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Guy's got a chain and he's howling and he's does it power slam.</v>

934
00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:23.890
<v Speaker 1>But I can't think of ramping up.</v>

935
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of rampage,</v>

936
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:25.720
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

937
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

938
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:26.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

939
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:27.780
<v Speaker 1>big elbows.</v>

940
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:29.520
<v Speaker 1>You've had him probably on the podcast,</v>

941
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.200
<v Speaker 1>a tough hairy chest.</v>

942
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

943
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

944
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:34.661
<v Speaker 1>who am I thinking?</v>

945
00:27:34.661 --> 00:27:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm hundred and 70 pounds fought Damien Maia,</v>

946
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

947
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Matt Brown.</v>

948
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

949
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.240
<v Speaker 1>But that's an example.</v>

950
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I can literally say,</v>

951
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 1>she could literally say all these things,</v>

952
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 1>but the name will escape me.</v>

953
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing happens to me.</v>

954
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I worked with John Early in the morning,</v>

955
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

956
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I worked with John Ramm Dean for you.</v>

957
00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 1>This is one of my best friends.</v>

958
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 1>And he would literally just see it in my eyes,</v>

959
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:03.270
<v Speaker 1>just like I won't have the name and I'll throw out one or two of those factoids.</v>

960
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:04.021
<v Speaker 1>And he always had it.</v>

961
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:04.854
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like Matt Brown.</v>

962
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's why having good friends with his great,</v>

963
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 1>you'll know your pants.</v>

964
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

965
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

966
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 1>But we've talking to Matt Brown and on the phone,</v>

967
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

968
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:13.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

969
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.431
<v Speaker 1>doing an interview with them.</v>

970
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

971
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the mentally toughest guys there is.</v>

972
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:17.694
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

973
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I am.</v>

974
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

975
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.900
<v Speaker 1>if I think I'm mentally tough for one moment,</v>

976
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I will not do all of the things necessary to walk in mentally tough.</v>

977
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

978
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:27.620
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

979
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Ma,</v>

980
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I am not mentally tough.</v>

981
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 1>The mental toughness is a result of all of the hard work and preparation that I</v>

982
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 1>have done to be able to do it in that moment.</v>

983
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And you heard it in his voice.</v>

984
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:40.050
<v Speaker 1>He had no doubt that this was so,</v>

985
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's right.</v>

986
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I think he's right.</v>

987
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.451
<v Speaker 4>I think he's right too.</v>

988
00:28:44.451 --> 00:28:47.540
<v Speaker 4>But he's also mentally tough him because he also does those things.</v>

989
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things that about Matt Brown that separates him is that that guy</v>

990
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.480
<v Speaker 4>empties out in the cage.</v>

991
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.670
<v Speaker 4>He separates himself from the pack because he,</v>

992
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.990
<v Speaker 4>he's so for Roche bus like that guys for Roche's remember when,</v>

993
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:02.750
<v Speaker 4>when he stepped into the cage we were watching,</v>

994
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.310
<v Speaker 4>I think we're doing a fight companion,</v>

995
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.490
<v Speaker 4>but we're um,</v>

996
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:11.050
<v Speaker 4>maybe we were wearing it anyway when he stepped into the cage and fought Diego</v>

997
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.360
<v Speaker 4>Sanchez when he,</v>

998
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.860
<v Speaker 4>when he stepped into the octagon and screamed and roared,</v>

999
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.630
<v Speaker 4>it was literally like an animal.</v>

1000
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:18.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>

1001
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:23.060
<v Speaker 4>it was far verocity defined and that's just how we fights man.</v>

1002
00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:25.040
<v Speaker 4>That kind of just empties out.</v>

1003
00:29:25.041 --> 00:29:26.450
<v Speaker 4>Like whatever the fuck he's guy.</v>

1004
00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:27.710
<v Speaker 4>He's not holding anything back,</v>

1005
00:29:27.711 --> 00:29:27.921
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1006
00:29:27.921 --> 00:29:28.021
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1007
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:29.090
<v Speaker 4>he goes for it.</v>

1008
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think when we were talking about fight an art,</v>

1009
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.880
<v Speaker 1>to me that's an art of human expression.</v>

1010
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:36.091
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1011
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I think that is to be a capable,</v>

1012
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:39.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1013
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:40.790
<v Speaker 1>whether you're um,</v>

1014
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.000
<v Speaker 1>you're doing jazz or punk rock,</v>

1015
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.290
<v Speaker 1>it's human expression.</v>

1016
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Whether are Matt Brown or your some elegant mover.</v>

1017
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 1>It's still the same art at its root.</v>

1018
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.570
<v Speaker 1>But you remember that elbow he fired on Diego Sanchez and that's fine.</v>

1019
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.500
<v Speaker 1>It was there and there.</v>

1020
00:29:55.501 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1021
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 1>these moments are there a lot when you're analyzing,</v>

1022
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 1>fighting and looking at it from that other perspective,</v>

1023
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.240
<v Speaker 1>these fight ending moments are there.</v>

1024
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:03.641
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1025
00:30:03.641 --> 00:30:06.400
<v Speaker 1>there are way more often than these guys realize,</v>

1026
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 1>but when they spot them like Matt did in that moment,</v>

1027
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.150
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1028
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I have a free shot from an angle.</v>

1029
00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Time has slowed down enough that I see it.</v>

1030
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I can see the little red arc of where it's going and I'm going to put this,</v>

1031
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to end this fight.</v>

1032
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1033
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1034
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a visceral like,</v>

1035
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.950
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

1036
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 1>it's period is when people look at you see it,</v>

1037
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.173
<v Speaker 1>see?</v>

1038
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1039
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Just like that is fucking art to me.</v>

1040
00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>But watch the lefthand,</v>

1041
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.710
<v Speaker 1>the reach and the hold and it's like,</v>

1042
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 1>there is no doubt with what's happening here.</v>

1043
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.043
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt.</v>

1044
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:43.900
<v Speaker 4>Diego Sanchez is another curious example because he's also a guy who is</v>

1045
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 4>ferocious,</v>

1046
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 4>like a ferociously tough guy.</v>

1047
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:52.590
<v Speaker 4>But there's always been something about his movements that makes him come up</v>

1048
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 4>short against the best of the best.</v>

1049
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 4>And I mean you're talking about a guy who's so fucking mentally tough as well.</v>

1050
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Like I always bring his fight against Jake Ellenberger who is a brutal knockout</v>

1051
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:06.220
<v Speaker 4>artists at one 70 and Diego really,</v>

1052
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean Diego fought at one 45 remember?</v>

1053
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.480
<v Speaker 4>And Diego really is a tweener.</v>

1054
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 4>He's like a little too small for 55.</v>

1055
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the fuck he made it to one 45.</v>

1056
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:19.210
<v Speaker 4>He basically starved his body away and probably did some error,</v>

1057
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.530
<v Speaker 4>irreversible damage.</v>

1058
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 4>But he will was like,</v>

1059
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 4>his movements are always just shy of elite.</v>

1060
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.260
<v Speaker 4>And I've always wondered what is that like?</v>

1061
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like even if you see that,</v>

1062
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 4>go back to that clip again,</v>

1063
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:34.211
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to.</v>

1064
00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>

1065
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Speaker 4>But there's something about even the way he steps,</v>

1066
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:38.300
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1067
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.390
<v Speaker 4>he's not stepping the way,</v>

1068
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:40.541
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1069
00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Tj Dillashaw steps.</v>

1070
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.331
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1071
00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:44.164
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1072
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I see it as his sort of intention.</v>

1073
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It's his over into,</v>

1074
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:49.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1075
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 1>that is so nasty,</v>

1076
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 1>nasty and so perfect.</v>

1077
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.070
<v Speaker 1>But I see he wants it badly.</v>

1078
00:31:54.071 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Like he is,</v>

1079
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.200
<v Speaker 1>he's over engaged.</v>

1080
00:31:56.201 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's psychological as much as anything I would say in Albuquerque.</v>

1081
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1082
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 1>The placement of the left hand there,</v>

1083
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 1>there's just no doubt where this is going.</v>

1084
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And it is the moment that Matt Brown created,</v>

1085
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 1>like he created that moment.</v>

1086
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.293
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1087
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.370
<v Speaker 1>see hair chest to her charts.</v>

1088
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

1089
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.860
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my reminder cues,</v>

1090
00:32:17.861 --> 00:32:18.694
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1091
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1092
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:19.661
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1093
00:32:19.661 --> 00:32:20.494
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1094
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1095
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I watched Diego train in Albuquerque and I love the guy.</v>

1096
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1097
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I was there doing interviewing Cobb,</v>

1098
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 1>who is my favorite artists probably to watch for many reasons.</v>

1099
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really sure exactly why people can't tell you why their favorite band is</v>

1100
00:32:34.991 --> 00:32:35.561
<v Speaker 1>their favorite band.</v>

1101
00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:36.160
<v Speaker 1>But I can all,</v>

1102
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.710
<v Speaker 1>there are many things I can describe it,</v>

1103
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 1>but I was there to interview for Monster Zim Itsm a,</v>

1104
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:46.410
<v Speaker 1>a website in South Korea that when I became a freelancer,</v>

1105
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:47.060
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1106
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.800
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to give you some work.</v>

1107
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.071
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1108
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:49.904
<v Speaker 1>well that'd be amazing.</v>

1109
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.923
<v Speaker 1>We'd like you to go.</v>

1110
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.370
<v Speaker 1>He just fought do whole choice.</v>

1111
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 1>We'd like you to go interview Mr Cub Swanson.</v>

1112
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:54.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1113
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:55.250
<v Speaker 1>this is bad ass.</v>

1114
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like my favorite fighter.</v>

1115
00:32:56.251 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send me to Albuquerque.</v>

1116
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.890
<v Speaker 1>And then I hung out in the gym and analyze them and watched and made notes about</v>

1117
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:05.891
<v Speaker 1>what I could and Diego try and super intense and he like does everything super</v>

1118
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 1>intense and and as much as he loves yoga and the different types of Yoga and</v>

1119
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 1>meditation has allowed him to do it differently,</v>

1120
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 1>that hyper intensity,</v>

1121
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that doesn't allow the sort of soft relaxation that's necessary to</v>

1122
00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 1>really do what you're describing.</v>

1123
00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.083
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1124
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.920
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>

1125
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Like the one of the things that people don't understand about striking hard and</v>

1126
00:33:27.141 --> 00:33:31.490
<v Speaker 3>like having real power is that you're not fully tense through the entire</v>

1127
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:31.941
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

1128
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:36.710
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of parts of striking where the momentum starts and you're almost</v>

1129
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 3>like completely loose,</v>

1130
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:43.300
<v Speaker 3>like up until instance before the point of contact and then it's playing.</v>

1131
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:44.900
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>

1132
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.900
<v Speaker 3>there's this weird thing that real knockout artists have that you don't see in</v>

1133
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:53.750
<v Speaker 3>these fucking tense windmill guys.</v>

1134
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Windmill guys are too tight.</v>

1135
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1136
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 3>But a guy like Ray Robinson will throw up.</v>

1137
00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.511
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a,</v>

1138
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:03.980
<v Speaker 3>there was a gene Fullmer ray Robinson Kao clip from the other night.</v>

1139
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1140
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.560
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1141
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I was watching online.</v>

1142
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I must have washed it like 13 times in a row.</v>

1143
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.870
<v Speaker 3>But you watch them Landis,</v>

1144
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a left hook,</v>

1145
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.210
<v Speaker 3>but you watched the punch land like cheeses,</v>

1146
00:34:13.211 --> 00:34:15.380
<v Speaker 3>like the snap that that guy had.</v>

1147
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 3>But that snap is not,</v>

1148
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:18.643
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1149
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 3>it's not fully tense.</v>

1150
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Here it is right here.</v>

1151
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Like look how nice and soft ts.</v>

1152
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:26.300
<v Speaker 3>Soft.</v>

1154
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Look at that lead.</v>

1155
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.670
<v Speaker 3>That left Hook right there.</v>

1156
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.121
<v Speaker 3>That one's,</v>

1157
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:29.871
<v Speaker 3>softens them up,</v>

1158
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:30.704
<v Speaker 3>ties him up.</v>

1159
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 3>But everything is like the way it's flowing.</v>

1160
00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:33.700
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1161
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:34.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1162
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.993
<v Speaker 3>he's swimming.</v>

1163
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:34:35.271 --> 00:34:36.104
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

1165
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 3>he was a amazing boxer,</v>

1166
00:34:38.391 --> 00:34:38.691
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1167
00:34:38.691 --> 00:34:42.470
<v Speaker 3>And you're talking about a guy who had like a hundred and something fights,</v>

1168
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1169
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1170
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.290
<v Speaker 3>he's almost gentle.</v>

1171
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:44.661
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1172
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:46.070
<v Speaker 3>he's soft is the right word.</v>

1173
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 3>There's a suppleness.</v>

1174
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:47.740
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

1175
00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a calmness,</v>

1176
00:34:48.731 --> 00:34:50.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a relaxation and mentally too,</v>

1177
00:34:50.651 --> 00:34:54.710
<v Speaker 1>like you know that idea of there's a storm going on and in the middle of their,</v>

1178
00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:55.600
<v Speaker 1>this calm area,</v>

1179
00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.740
<v Speaker 1>that gentleness,</v>

1180
00:34:56.741 --> 00:34:57.000
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1181
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.580
<v Speaker 1>that calmness has to be in your mind to allow you to do this.</v>

1182
00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's where Diego is.</v>

1183
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.503
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

1184
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>

1185
00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Just look at this,</v>

1186
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:06.350
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1187
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.880
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking incredible.</v>

1188
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:08.461
<v Speaker 3>And I left,</v>

1189
00:35:08.461 --> 00:35:09.021
<v Speaker 3>took right here.</v>

1190
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:09.854
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

1191
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1193
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:15.670
<v Speaker 3>and even just to create that moment and to see that moment and to set it up and</v>

1194
00:35:16.191 --> 00:35:20.030
<v Speaker 3>lay traps and see when the guys moving his hands down,</v>

1195
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.320
<v Speaker 3>see when he's coming forward.</v>

1196
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 3>See is patterns and 10 they can do those things.</v>

1197
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1198
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

1199
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1200
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.810
<v Speaker 3>But it's that kind of power in that left hook that does not come from,</v>

1201
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.313
<v Speaker 3>that's just a,</v>

1202
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.890
<v Speaker 3>that's just this little twist that he does.</v>

1203
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:37.811
<v Speaker 3>Like come on.</v>

1204
00:35:37.811 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>But here</v>

1205
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 1>it is right here in slow Mo Bang.</v>

1206
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's just hip and there's like,</v>

1207
00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.170
<v Speaker 1>so I did,</v>

1208
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you saw it or I think you saw it.</v>

1209
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I did a little breakdown of your kicks.</v>

1210
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.293
<v Speaker 1>I did see that.</v>

1211
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:48.871
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

1212
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was zooming in on was this double pulse and that's real.</v>

1213
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 1>That's daddy is the neurology of high athletic performance.</v>

1214
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1215
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 1>so I have these friends that I've developed that I've gathered over the years</v>

1216
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.120
<v Speaker 1>and I love what I do,</v>

1217
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:03.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1218
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm happy every single day.</v>

1219
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.640
<v Speaker 1>And a big part of it is I've met these people that I have these conversations</v>

1220
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:14.280
<v Speaker 1>with and sometimes they're very long and deep and,</v>

1221
00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.490
<v Speaker 1>and they've some,</v>

1222
00:36:15.491 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that are a phd psychologist and this one guy doctor Stu McGill.</v>

1223
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who he is?</v>

1224
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.631
<v Speaker 1>His name?</v>

1225
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:21.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard that name.</v>

1227
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure somebody has mentioned it because you're around different athletic</v>

1228
00:36:26.011 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 1>types of all types.</v>

1229
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.650
<v Speaker 1>He is the world's foremost expert in the spinal cord,</v>

1230
00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:33.390
<v Speaker 1>in neurology of athletic performance,</v>

1231
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.380
<v Speaker 1>spinal cord,</v>

1232
00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 1>the spinal cord and how and your neurology and your nerves and how your nervous</v>

1233
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 1>system and George St Pierre has worked with him a lot.</v>

1234
00:36:42.031 --> 00:36:42.540
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1235
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 1>if you ask him about him this week,</v>

1236
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.960
<v Speaker 1>he would talk about them extensively.</v>

1237
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:50.961
<v Speaker 1>So doctor Stu and I became friends and it's a big compliment because he sought</v>

1238
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:56.091
<v Speaker 1>me out based on seeing my work and saying that guy knows some things I want to</v>

1239
00:36:56.101 --> 00:36:56.491
<v Speaker 1>talk to him,</v>

1240
00:36:56.491 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 1>which was a plaque and deep compliment to me.</v>

1241
00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:02.040
<v Speaker 1>And now we became friends and we chat all the time and one of the things we</v>

1242
00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:06.810
<v Speaker 1>constantly talk about is the double pulse and neurology and people talk about a</v>

1243
00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:08.580
<v Speaker 1>fast twitch fiber.</v>

1244
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fiber as that's just terms we've started to hear.</v>

1245
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a fast twitch and neurology.</v>

1246
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.461
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1247
00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:16.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a base,</v>

1248
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.360
<v Speaker 1>a fast ball hitters have it.</v>

1249
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:19.111
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1250
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:24.111
<v Speaker 1>That neurology where you you there's a pulse of tension and then a complete</v>

1251
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:27.780
<v Speaker 1>relaxation until the pulse of tension.</v>

1252
00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1253
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.590
<v Speaker 1>the Bruce Lee's one inch punch was the simple example of them.</v>

1254
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:36.620
<v Speaker 1>But that is how that is the neurology of high athletic performance and that's</v>

1255
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:39.120
<v Speaker 1>what I zoomed in I when I was looking at your kick cause you can see it quite</v>

1256
00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

1257
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 1>There's the moment,</v>

1258
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:41.604
<v Speaker 1>there's the relaxing,</v>

1259
00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:41.950
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

1260
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.380
<v Speaker 1>and it ends up being more of a whip.</v>

1261
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.040
<v Speaker 1>And stew,</v>

1262
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Stu has all these incredible analogies because he's examined this in so</v>

1263
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 1>many different angles and layers,</v>

1264
00:37:50.491 --> 00:37:53.100
<v Speaker 1>which is the beauty of analyzing anything for years.</v>

1265
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And he'll use terms like you can't shoot a,</v>

1266
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.010
<v Speaker 1>a cannon out of a canoe and you think about that and you're like,</v>

1267
00:37:59.011 --> 00:38:00.250
<v Speaker 1>of course we can use all walk,</v>

1268
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:04.350
<v Speaker 1>but if it's tense and then shoots or you can't push a rope,</v>

1269
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:04.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1270
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You push a rope,</v>

1271
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1272
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:06.841
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1273
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:08.820
<v Speaker 1>but you can whip a rope through tension,</v>

1274
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:10.800
<v Speaker 1>relaxation and tension again.</v>

1275
00:38:10.801 --> 00:38:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And that neurology is the neurology of high performance.</v>

1276
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:15.263
<v Speaker 1>And George,</v>

1277
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:16.890
<v Speaker 1>you talked to George about neurology.</v>

1278
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:21.210
<v Speaker 1>He'll go deep down some shit to George Saint Pierre because he studied this to</v>

1279
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:24.360
<v Speaker 1>understand himself and what he was doing at a high level with doctors too.</v>

1280
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1281
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 1>but it is a fascinating thing because when you think,</v>

1282
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 1>we often will say,</v>

1283
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1284
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.480
<v Speaker 1>fighting is 90% mental sipping.</v>

1285
00:38:33.481 --> 00:38:35.620
<v Speaker 1>This cop is 100% mental.</v>

1286
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.843
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1287
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.170
<v Speaker 1>my brain told my body to reach out and do it.</v>

1288
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 1>My brain made this choice.</v>

1289
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I activated everything.</v>

1290
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:44.921
<v Speaker 1>Use,</v>

1291
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 1>it's all your brain,</v>

1292
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.050
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1293
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.510
<v Speaker 1>And once you get to a high level of performance,</v>

1294
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.500
<v Speaker 1>you know how to punch and kick and you train like crazy and you make the things</v>

1295
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 1>happen by themselves almost by training so much,</v>

1296
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 1>they take so little attention in decision making.</v>

1297
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.730
<v Speaker 1>It becomes about maximizing your nervous system,</v>

1298
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.050
<v Speaker 1>how your nervous system.</v>

1299
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's true of almost anything.</v>

1300
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the steer right there.</v>

1301
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:07.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:10.090
<v Speaker 1>That Susie training with the charge and doctors too.</v>

1304
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see his face looks like a bar graph and to be honest,</v>

1305
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1306
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:18.850
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1307
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:19.571
<v Speaker 1>that is got,</v>

1308
00:39:19.571 --> 00:39:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm whipping the ball around.</v>

1309
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1310
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure exactly what he's doing or why they're dumbbell presses,</v>

1311
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'll put you in touch with them often.</v>

1312
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.720
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a,</v>

1313
00:39:27.721 --> 00:39:31.080
<v Speaker 4>it looks like he's got some heavy weight at the end of a rope.</v>

1314
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:31.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:39:31.831 --> 00:39:34.860
<v Speaker 1>And I guess engaging the core through the use of,</v>

1316
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:35.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1317
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:39.360
<v Speaker 1>probably asking him to only engage certain things to counter balance the</v>

1318
00:39:39.361 --> 00:39:40.194
<v Speaker 1>movement</v>

1319
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.721
<v Speaker 4>prize,</v>

1320
00:39:40.721 --> 00:39:41.890
<v Speaker 4>to see George waring,</v>

1321
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.020
<v Speaker 4>your typical a running shoe when he's training with the,</v>

1322
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 4>the thick heel.</v>

1323
00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:48.100
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1324
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm still surprised to this day when I see,</v>

1325
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1326
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:55.270
<v Speaker 4>we're going to talk about neurology and activating muscles and tissues.</v>

1327
00:39:55.271 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 4>Like there's so many athletes is still train with those big cushy bottomed</v>

1328
00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:00.664
<v Speaker 4>running shoes.</v>

1329
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:01.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1330
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.880
<v Speaker 4>I think that is crazy victim.</v>

1331
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:03.783
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1332
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:04.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1333
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.391
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

1334
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:04.631
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1335
00:40:04.631 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 4>you should be doing that kind of shit barefoot,</v>

1336
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.510
<v Speaker 4>especially a fighter.</v>

1337
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.800
<v Speaker 4>You fight barefoot.</v>

1338
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.020
<v Speaker 4>You should be wearing nothing on your feet.</v>

1339
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:15.020
<v Speaker 1>The only thing connecting you to a stable surfaces your foot.</v>

1340
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1341
00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100%.</v>

1342
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1343
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.690
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when we're trying to make sense of these things,</v>

1344
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:25.610
<v Speaker 1>we go to multiple different sort of perspectives of it.</v>

1345
00:40:25.611 --> 00:40:28.340
<v Speaker 1>So I'll take what I learned from Doctor Stu and,</v>

1346
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1347
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.750
<v Speaker 1>he's just my friend now as well.</v>

1348
00:40:29.751 --> 00:40:33.020
<v Speaker 1>So I like hanging out and chatting with him about like way out there,</v>

1349
00:40:33.021 --> 00:40:33.980
<v Speaker 1>aspects of these things.</v>

1350
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:35.780
<v Speaker 1>But you talked to Irwin [inaudible] as well,</v>

1351
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.370
<v Speaker 1>who has a different sphere of connecting to this kind of thing and Irwin starts</v>

1352
00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:44.870
<v Speaker 1>with the foot and you've had our one on the and he starts with the foot and</v>

1353
00:40:44.871 --> 00:40:45.591
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

1354
00:40:45.591 --> 00:40:46.251
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense,</v>

1355
00:40:46.251 --> 00:40:46.431
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1356
00:40:46.431 --> 00:40:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I got to throw a punch and the important part is going to be my foot through the</v>

1357
00:40:50.751 --> 00:40:51.141
<v Speaker 1>leg,</v>

1358
00:40:51.141 --> 00:40:51.831
<v Speaker 1>through the hip,</v>

1359
00:40:51.831 --> 00:40:52.661
<v Speaker 1>through the core,</v>

1360
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:52.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1361
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.190
<v Speaker 1>and relaxed until the moment that it hits.</v>

1362
00:40:55.191 --> 00:40:56.270
<v Speaker 1>But it all starts on</v>

1363
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 4>nick.</v>

1364
00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.170
<v Speaker 4>Nick's,</v>

1365
00:40:59.170 --> 00:40:59.531
<v Speaker 4>excuse me.</v>

1366
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:02.470
<v Speaker 4>When I asked Nick Curse on about training athletes,</v>

1367
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.453
<v Speaker 4>like what's the,</v>

1368
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.530
<v Speaker 4>the thing that he thinks fighter should work on the most?</v>

1369
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:06.430
<v Speaker 4>He's like foot strength.</v>

1370
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.601
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1371
00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:07.991
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1372
00:41:07.991 --> 00:41:08.824
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

1373
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:09.521
<v Speaker 4>And I thought about it.</v>

1374
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:09.701
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1375
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:09.970
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1376
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.541
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

1377
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1378
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.250
<v Speaker 4>That's how you push off.</v>

1379
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:13.270
<v Speaker 4>That's how you move.</v>

1380
00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:13.720
<v Speaker 4>I'll give,</v>

1381
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.190
<v Speaker 4>your feet are weak and they get tired.</v>

1382
00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:16.120
<v Speaker 4>He can't move well,</v>

1383
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 4>which I've experienced.</v>

1384
00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've experienced,</v>

1385
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1386
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.980
<v Speaker 4>when your feet are weak and tired,</v>

1387
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:21.581
<v Speaker 4>like if you,</v>

1388
00:41:21.581 --> 00:41:25.030
<v Speaker 4>if you don't run and then you try to run one of the first things you get tired</v>

1389
00:41:25.031 --> 00:41:25.620
<v Speaker 4>of your feet.</v>

1390
00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1391
00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:31.340
<v Speaker 1>The very worst injury I've ever had in my life by far was plantar fasciitis of</v>

1392
00:41:32.101 --> 00:41:32.820
<v Speaker 1>both feet.</v>

1393
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh my last fight.</v>

1394
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And I was through training and everything.</v>

1395
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.720
<v Speaker 1>And then I had my fight in Montreal and the whole strategy was put,</v>

1396
00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 1>getting to a place where I could be safe and use better knowledge of the</v>

1397
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 1>situation to fatigue the other guy.</v>

1398
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:49.881
<v Speaker 1>So the whole,</v>

1399
00:41:49.881 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the seven or eight minutes of the fight took place with me,</v>

1400
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:54.530
<v Speaker 1>pressuring him against the fence,</v>

1401
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 1>just driving off both feet,</v>

1402
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.610
<v Speaker 1>pressuring against the fence to try to land things are make,</v>

1403
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 1>create lines for different weapons.</v>

1404
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's only eight minutes,</v>

1405
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:04.640
<v Speaker 1>but eight minutes of intense drive from my feet.</v>

1406
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 1>And then we went on vacation the very next day and that night we grabbed</v>

1407
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Margarita's and we walked around the resort and in my feet were destroyed for</v>

1408
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 1>acutely,</v>

1409
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 1>for three or four days.</v>

1410
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't walk.</v>

1411
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And the inflammation was so unbelievably bad.</v>

1412
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It was like bricks.</v>

1413
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.461
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1414
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1415
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:27.730
<v Speaker 1>even for months after it was visualized him tried to ice ice or I would get in</v>

1416
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:30.920
<v Speaker 1>immediately into the cold pool and spend the day in the cold pool drinking</v>

1417
00:42:30.921 --> 00:42:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Tequila and hopes that it would help.</v>

1418
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:33.104
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of,</v>

1419
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:35.663
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1420
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.900
<v Speaker 4>foot pain is,</v>

1421
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.210
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things that are hurt.</v>

1422
00:42:39.211 --> 00:42:44.211
<v Speaker 4>Dominick Cruz in his comeback fight when he fought Tj Dillashaw you notice he</v>

1423
00:42:44.791 --> 00:42:46.020
<v Speaker 4>was like kind of limping a little.</v>

1424
00:42:46.021 --> 00:42:47.820
<v Speaker 4>We were attributing it to the leg kicks.</v>

1425
00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.260
<v Speaker 4>He said that's not the case.</v>

1426
00:42:49.261 --> 00:42:53.340
<v Speaker 4>He said what was going on was he had plantar fasciitis because you know he had</v>

1427
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:58.430
<v Speaker 4>multiple injuries that he was re re recovering from during that training camp.</v>

1428
00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:03.740
<v Speaker 4>And when he got knee surgery and he came back from that and he tore his groin,</v>

1429
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 4>he tried to like really ramp up as training,</v>

1430
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:09.780
<v Speaker 4>who's doing a lot of sprinting and a lot of different things with his feet.</v>

1431
00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:10.021
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1432
00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:13.650
<v Speaker 4>cause obviously he's very footwork intensive with his fighting and he fucked his</v>

1433
00:43:13.651 --> 00:43:14.011
<v Speaker 4>feet up.</v>

1434
00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:14.251
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1435
00:43:14.251 --> 00:43:17.910
<v Speaker 4>His feet just weren't and conditioned to do the kind of stuff that he used to be</v>

1436
00:43:17.911 --> 00:43:18.744
<v Speaker 4>able to do.</v>

1437
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.050
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing he got was plantar fasciitis shop had it too.</v>

1438
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:22.790
<v Speaker 4>He told me it was.</v>

1439
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.540
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the worst things he's ever had.</v>

1440
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Think of this for the big picture meaning of this far Dominic.</v>

1441
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 1>So you got somebody else and they're going about fighting and their their career</v>

1442
00:43:35.671 --> 00:43:36.930
<v Speaker 1>as a martial artist,</v>

1443
00:43:36.931 --> 00:43:40.950
<v Speaker 1>a competitive fighter one way and Dominic goes about it a different way and</v>

1444
00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:42.330
<v Speaker 1>through Dominic's choices,</v>

1445
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.200
<v Speaker 1>moving training,</v>

1446
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.053
<v Speaker 1>footwork,</v>

1447
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.270
<v Speaker 1>he avoids a lot of the damage that these guys will take,</v>

1448
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.040
<v Speaker 1>but you can't avoid,</v>

1449
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.420
<v Speaker 1>something's going to go right.</v>

1450
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So instead of taking,</v>

1451
00:43:52.591 --> 00:43:55.260
<v Speaker 1>getting kicked a lot and punched in the head and taking all those things,</v>

1452
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:59.460
<v Speaker 1>the training necessary to make that not happen fucks up something else.</v>

1453
00:43:59.461 --> 00:44:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't get away from it.</v>

1454
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.780
<v Speaker 1>You're going to work yourself until your body gives up.</v>

1455
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Even dom brilliantly finding a way to work outside of taking the damage that</v>

1456
00:44:09.031 --> 00:44:12.120
<v Speaker 1>they take still could not get away from damaging his body.</v>

1457
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Tj Dillashaw versus Cody Garbrandt.</v>

1458
00:44:14.191 --> 00:44:16.920
<v Speaker 4>The rematch is one of the most intriguing fights of the year for me.</v>

1459
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:17.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm really,</v>

1460
00:44:17.911 --> 00:44:22.560
<v Speaker 4>really curious about that fight because I know those guys were tightly matched</v>

1461
00:44:22.561 --> 00:44:27.150
<v Speaker 4>in the gym and I know that Cody correct him with a big right hand before TJ put</v>

1462
00:44:27.151 --> 00:44:27.930
<v Speaker 4>him away.</v>

1463
00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:28.763
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1464
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:29.590
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>

1465
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:30.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1466
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.590
<v Speaker 4>he was stunned and he rocked.</v>

1467
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 4>And I believe when Cody cracked and it was towards the end of the round,</v>

1468
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

1469
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.991
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1470
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:39.420
<v Speaker 4>And so he had an opportunity to recover.</v>

1471
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:39.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1472
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:43.500
<v Speaker 4>who knows if he had caught that right hand the first minute of the round what</v>

1473
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:44.334
<v Speaker 4>had gone on.</v>

1474
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:49.140
<v Speaker 4>But when Tj recovered from that and then lend that head kick and then you know,</v>

1475
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.730
<v Speaker 4>knocked him out and put him away,</v>

1476
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.540
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1477
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 4>you got to see like,</v>

1478
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:53.490
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1479
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:57.510
<v Speaker 4>what a high level high stakes game these two guys are playing.</v>

1480
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1481
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:01.860
<v Speaker 4>Tj has through bang,</v>

1482
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:05.790
<v Speaker 4>Ludwig has really radically improved his movement,</v>

1483
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 4>his footwork,</v>

1484
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:07.681
<v Speaker 4>his angles,</v>

1485
00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:08.514
<v Speaker 4>his approach.</v>

1486
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.630
<v Speaker 4>He's so versatile with his ability to switch stances,</v>

1487
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.441
<v Speaker 4>his ability,</v>

1488
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:13.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1489
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:18.300
<v Speaker 4>he's constantly cutting angles and striking as he switching stances.</v>

1490
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 4>And there's so much information coming at you.</v>

1491
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 4>If you're fighting him,</v>

1492
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:22.740
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1493
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.300
<v Speaker 4>your brain's overloaded.</v>

1494
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:27.660
<v Speaker 4>If you're not used to that and even the guys who used to train with them,</v>

1495
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:30.570
<v Speaker 4>I believe in Alpha male are not used to what he's doing now.</v>

1496
00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.660
<v Speaker 4>I agree because it's a,</v>

1497
00:45:31.661 --> 00:45:32.494
<v Speaker 4>it's at a,</v>

1498
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 4>at a far higher level that said,</v>

1499
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 4>Cody still has a fucking missile in his right hand.</v>

1500
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 4>It's so goddamn fast.</v>

1501
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 4>His hand speed is so fast and his,</v>

1502
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.160
<v Speaker 4>his fluidity and efficiency in his boxing is so good.</v>

1503
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 4>It's just a very,</v>

1504
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 4>very interesting fight for me.</v>

1505
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.110
<v Speaker 1>That's about as good as it gets right now,</v>

1506
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 1>like from the raw materials of those guys and the skills that they have.</v>

1507
00:45:57.191 --> 00:46:00.440
<v Speaker 1>But I am definitely with you as far as that,</v>

1508
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.500
<v Speaker 1>my deep curiosity of the choices of the coaches and because,</v>

1509
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.050
<v Speaker 1>and you talk to some of them different ones,</v>

1510
00:46:08.051 --> 00:46:08.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1511
00:46:08.231 --> 00:46:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I've got a few key friends that I talk to on a very regular basis and so what it</v>

1512
00:46:13.091 --> 00:46:13.924
<v Speaker 1>will take,</v>

1513
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.230
<v Speaker 1>what we would decide to do to train to make our guy the best in the world or try</v>

1514
00:46:18.231 --> 00:46:19.750
<v Speaker 1>to be the best in the world in 10 months.</v>

1515
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.380
<v Speaker 1>If we take a different strategy and we start to build them to be the best in the</v>

1516
00:46:23.381 --> 00:46:24.550
<v Speaker 1>world in three years,</v>

1517
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a different game.</v>

1518
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Dwayne,</v>

1519
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne is sad.</v>

1520
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 1>We will and it's,</v>

1521
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.640
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard work for Dwayne to like,</v>

1522
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:37.000
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that people won't necessarily appreciate.</v>

1523
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:37.331
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

1524
00:46:37.331 --> 00:46:37.441
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1525
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:38.320
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant coach.</v>

1526
00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.520
<v Speaker 1>That's nonstop,</v>

1527
00:46:39.521 --> 00:46:44.521
<v Speaker 1>constant searching and examining and trial and error and reinterpreting his</v>

1528
00:46:45.461 --> 00:46:47.650
<v Speaker 1>language of understanding where the,</v>

1529
00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.140
<v Speaker 1>where the chaos is and understanding,</v>

1530
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:50.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1531
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:54.790
<v Speaker 1>can we make this guy believes something's happening or are we too deep in it</v>

1532
00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:56.710
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't think that and it fails.</v>

1533
00:46:56.711 --> 00:47:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Like what levels of misdirection or too deep,</v>

1534
00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.090
<v Speaker 1>how good is he?</v>

1535
00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:03.340
<v Speaker 1>And when I talked to them leading up to that one,</v>

1536
00:47:03.341 --> 00:47:04.174
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1537
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:04.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1538
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:09.780
<v Speaker 1>the conversation was about making Cody believe in,</v>

1539
00:47:09.911 --> 00:47:11.320
<v Speaker 1>anticipate something wrong.</v>

1540
00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's the root of all of all combat,</v>

1541
00:47:13.541 --> 00:47:13.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1542
00:47:13.751 --> 00:47:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you make me think this is coming and I do this and he took me in the body.</v>

1543
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.520
<v Speaker 1>And the layers,</v>

1544
00:47:18.521 --> 00:47:19.390
<v Speaker 1>the multiple layers,</v>

1545
00:47:19.391 --> 00:47:20.200
<v Speaker 1>like you just said,</v>

1546
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.090
<v Speaker 1>overloading the ability to,</v>

1547
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to catalog what's coming and how you chunk that,</v>

1548
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1549
00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:28.150
<v Speaker 1>we don't necessarily understand.</v>

1550
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.590
<v Speaker 1>So your brain be going,</v>

1551
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:29.801
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1552
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:31.390
<v Speaker 1>this is all the stuff from the left,</v>

1553
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:33.730
<v Speaker 1>which happens when this happened or the,</v>

1554
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:34.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1555
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:38.620
<v Speaker 1>the legs are doing this or you're running algorithms in your brain and we don't</v>

1556
00:47:38.621 --> 00:47:38.830
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1557
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what yours is.</v>

1558
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you categorize my threats.</v>

1559
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether you categorize anything from my right hand or anything in</v>

1560
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 1>combination or if you're watching the patterns of my shoulders,</v>

1561
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1562
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:54.030
<v Speaker 1>So Dwayne and anybody else playing with this concept is trying to figure out how</v>

1563
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you'll read this and use that against you.</v>

1564
00:47:58.690 --> 00:47:59.171
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>

1565
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:00.004
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

1566
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:04.150
<v Speaker 1>the layer of complete mind blowing nature that like,</v>

1567
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 1>what did you say?</v>

1568
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Chess with dire consequences or problem.</v>

1569
00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:07.874
<v Speaker 1>Solvable problems.</v>

1570
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.431
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hard.</v>

1571
00:48:09.431 --> 00:48:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Those problems are now how many there are.</v>

1572
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:12.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the game.</v>

1573
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:13.010
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1574
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:16.210
<v Speaker 1>and it can be done at this level because their skills are so good.</v>

1575
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.230
<v Speaker 1>They're minds are so good.</v>

1576
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:18.340
<v Speaker 1>They're physically so good,</v>

1577
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.121
<v Speaker 1>they're capable,</v>

1578
00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:19.811
<v Speaker 1>they're fearless,</v>

1579
00:48:19.811 --> 00:48:20.561
<v Speaker 1>they're confident,</v>

1580
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 1>they have all of those raw materials and now we're playing a game that most of</v>

1581
00:48:24.581 --> 00:48:29.581
<v Speaker 1>us cannot comprehend and they've also sparred countless hours to those each</v>

1582
00:48:29.851 --> 00:48:32.930
<v Speaker 1>other and they've told each other lies for long periods of time.</v>

1583
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Lies on lies.</v>

1584
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I one time went with a,</v>

1585
00:48:37.121 --> 00:48:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I worked for a company called the score fighting series.</v>

1586
00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.530
<v Speaker 1>It was really a brilliant show.</v>

1587
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Like it was kind of Canada's Bella tour,</v>

1588
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.500
<v Speaker 1>like it was on the same network and they aired Bella tour and it was very,</v>

1589
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 1>very good developmental league stuff.</v>

1590
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And that company brought in Forrest Griffin and then a bunch of poker players</v>

1591
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and they were on a train together and and contest winners on the thing.</v>

1592
00:48:58.481 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Got To ride on this train with Forrest Griffin and a bunch of poker pup but high</v>

1593
00:49:02.051 --> 00:49:03.210
<v Speaker 1>level pro poker players.</v>

1594
00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:06.010
<v Speaker 1>And I was there and that was the first time I met Forrest.</v>

1595
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 1>And this is a killer,</v>

1596
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:07.984
<v Speaker 1>smart dude.</v>

1597
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.710
<v Speaker 1>But you watch these poker players who are all riding together and they all know</v>

1598
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:14.530
<v Speaker 1>each other and they are just telling each other lies all the time,</v>

1599
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:18.280
<v Speaker 1>trying to tell stories about things that represent the fact that they are,</v>

1600
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1601
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.360
<v Speaker 1>conservative when really they're risk takers are trying to tell each other</v>

1602
00:49:22.361 --> 00:49:24.010
<v Speaker 1>things that make them think they're crazy.</v>

1603
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 1>But really they're calculating like they are telling each other lies ongoing and</v>

1604
00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 1>they're gambling with each other and shit.</v>

1605
00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:30.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely dejected,</v>

1606
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.113
<v Speaker 1>generative,</v>

1607
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.740
<v Speaker 1>but that's the kind of thing that's happening on some level with these,</v>

1608
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 1>the high level fighters to making them think certain things about what they will</v>

1609
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:43.120
<v Speaker 1>do or believe they'll do almost everything they say.</v>

1610
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1611
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 1>we should,</v>

1612
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:49.980
<v Speaker 1>the fans and the audience we should assume is a game chip is like a something to</v>

1613
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:50.530
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

1614
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:53.110
<v Speaker 1>The other one believes something that might in that moment,</v>

1615
00:49:53.111 --> 00:49:54.310
<v Speaker 1>let me land that kick.</v>

1616
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 1>If he thinks that I'm,</v>

1617
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:56.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1618
00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:56.561
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1619
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:56.850
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1620
00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:01.850
<v Speaker 1>It's manipulative stuff and at that level that is just so unbelievably</v>

1621
00:50:02.021 --> 00:50:02.830
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

1622
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1623
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:04.131
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1624
00:50:04.131 --> 00:50:05.710
<v Speaker 1>In the stakes are so high and you know,</v>

1625
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:07.270
<v Speaker 1>the kick lands your hero,</v>

1626
00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the kick misses and you get caught with a left hook,</v>

1627
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:10.294
<v Speaker 1>you're a loser.</v>

1628
00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:10.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1629
00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:14.920
<v Speaker 1>there's just so much at stake with every single choice you make and all,</v>

1630
00:50:14.921 --> 00:50:19.690
<v Speaker 1>all those choices have to be almost subconscious or semi-conscious because</v>

1631
00:50:19.691 --> 00:50:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be in the Zen state,</v>

1632
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:21.970
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be flowing.</v>

1633
00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:23.920
<v Speaker 1>So everything has to be prepared.</v>

1634
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:24.963
<v Speaker 1>You have to have,</v>

1635
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1636
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:27.740
<v Speaker 1>while you're in there,</v>

1637
00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>you have</v>

1638
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.090
<v Speaker 4>to have no regrets.</v>

1639
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:32.720
<v Speaker 4>You have to be able to just flow and you have to be able to capitalize on any</v>

1640
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 4>movement,</v>

1641
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.501
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>

1642
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:34.311
<v Speaker 4>any opening.</v>

1643
00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:37.850
<v Speaker 4>You say you got to pounce and they have to be in condition to execute all these</v>

1644
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:38.390
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1645
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:42.030
<v Speaker 4>So you have to have had the physical discipline and the mental fortitude to push</v>

1646
00:50:42.031 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 4>yourself through training to a level that you probably didn't think you could</v>

1647
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:45.884
<v Speaker 4>get to.</v>

1648
00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:46.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1649
00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.540
<v Speaker 1>and I want to pounce with the opening,</v>

1650
00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.070
<v Speaker 1>but what if it's a lie?</v>

1651
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1652
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.141
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1653
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1654
00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.750
<v Speaker 1>what if Matt Brown slot line on that thing was actually,</v>

1655
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:56.290
<v Speaker 1>that one would be hard to be alive,</v>

1656
00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:59.310
<v Speaker 1>but there are other ones where it feels like that one little opening but instead</v>

1657
00:50:59.311 --> 00:51:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Tj is going to catch you or Cody's lined you up to draw you into something.</v>

1658
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:06.750
<v Speaker 4>So God damn fast to his hand speed is so ridiculous.</v>

1659
00:51:06.751 --> 00:51:07.111
<v Speaker 4>He fasts,</v>

1660
00:51:07.111 --> 00:51:10.650
<v Speaker 4>I go back to the Tom saw modified and Almeda has really never been the same</v>

1661
00:51:10.651 --> 00:51:11.390
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1662
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:13.710
<v Speaker 4>I'll made it going into that fight was undefeated,</v>

1663
00:51:13.711 --> 00:51:17.460
<v Speaker 4>was thought to be the dark horse of the division like w look or future world</v>

1664
00:51:17.461 --> 00:51:18.210
<v Speaker 4>champion.</v>

1665
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.340
<v Speaker 4>And Cody lit him up like a Christmas tree.</v>

1666
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:24.870
<v Speaker 4>And the way he did it was so definitive that you like Jesus.</v>

1667
00:51:24.871 --> 00:51:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Like there could be no doubt this guy has real world championship potential.</v>

1668
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:29.641
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1669
00:51:29.641 --> 00:51:34.641
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the Duane Ludwig factor is so fucking huge or really,</v>

1670
00:51:34.861 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 4>really do.</v>

1671
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:36.280
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1672
00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:36.600
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1673
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.150
<v Speaker 4>I've seen Dwayne's work in like Dwayne,</v>

1674
00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:45.170
<v Speaker 4>unlike a lot of guys has notebooks like binders full of ideas and his system is</v>

1675
00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:48.460
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1676
00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.030
<v Speaker 4>it's a very declared system.</v>

1677
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:53.270
<v Speaker 4>It's not like loosely based work.</v>

1678
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.780
<v Speaker 4>We always work off the jab.</v>

1679
00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.820
<v Speaker 4>We've got good footwork,</v>

1680
00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.100
<v Speaker 4>none.</v>

1681
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:56.760
<v Speaker 4>There's none of that.</v>

1682
00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.310
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1683
00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a system to his,</v>

1684
00:51:59.401 --> 00:52:04.401
<v Speaker 4>like he has a belt system to his style and his style is based on for people</v>

1685
00:52:05.281 --> 00:52:06.114
<v Speaker 4>don't know.</v>

1686
00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Dwayne was a worldclass kickboxer worldclass Muay Thai fight.</v>

1687
00:52:10.141 --> 00:52:11.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean fought Ramon Dekkers,</v>

1688
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean fought some of the best of the best,</v>

1689
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.920
<v Speaker 4>had some amazing fights in both MMA and in kickboxing.</v>

1690
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 4>And he was a really talented guy and then transitioned on to being a coach.</v>

1691
00:52:22.261 --> 00:52:27.261
<v Speaker 4>And the obsession that he has towards coaching is really at a higher level than</v>

1692
00:52:28.441 --> 00:52:30.150
<v Speaker 4>even his obsession towards fighting.</v>

1693
00:52:30.151 --> 00:52:31.160
<v Speaker 4>And he talks about that,</v>

1694
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:33.630
<v Speaker 4>that his passion is teaching people.</v>

1695
00:52:33.631 --> 00:52:34.464
<v Speaker 4>He loves it.</v>

1696
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:39.450
<v Speaker 4>He loves being able to mold students and he's found the perfect muse or the</v>

1697
00:52:39.451 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 4>perfect willing participant in Tj and teaching him.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I have a very unique friendship and very unique student mentorship sort of</v>

1699
00:52:49.591 --> 00:52:50.221
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

1700
00:52:50.221 --> 00:52:51.030
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

1701
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:52.950
<v Speaker 4>really interesting to watch the two of them together.</v>

1702
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.600

1711
00:53:08.181 --> 00:53:09.014
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1712
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 1>we will funnel all of my experience through everything through this super</v>

1713
00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:13.310
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

1714
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.320
<v Speaker 1>But like you talk about those books,</v>

1715
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 1>the only way that you get to a point of this level of mastery that we're talking</v>

1716
00:53:20.481 --> 00:53:25.481
<v Speaker 1>about is that you must go down some fucking road for six months that amounts to</v>

1717
00:53:25.891 --> 00:53:30.420
<v Speaker 1>nothing so that you learned that road isn't the road and the only way and you</v>

1718
00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:31.680
<v Speaker 1>can't give up too worldly.</v>

1719
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 1>And what if by going down at long enough,</v>

1720
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:36.930
<v Speaker 1>some different concept about how you switch your feet in a certain moment.</v>

1721
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 1>You think maybe that ain't it.</v>

1722
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 1>But you have discovered that by pushing through some of these concepts long</v>

1723
00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:43.291
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

1724
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:46.410
<v Speaker 1>you find it so you stick with it long enough and it turns out no.</v>

1725
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne and or anybody else reaching that level of mastery has gone down some</v>

1726
00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:55.200
<v Speaker 1>rabbit hole for months or years and discovered the only value they got out of it</v>

1727
00:53:55.201 --> 00:53:55.501
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1728
00:53:55.501 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1729
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of value that wasn't the rabbit hole.</v>

1730
00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1731
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.360
<v Speaker 1>the process of searching this rabbit hole has made me better at searching rabbit</v>

1732
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:03.780
<v Speaker 1>holes.</v>

1733
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.190
<v Speaker 1>So those two values,</v>

1734
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.420
<v Speaker 1>some of the stacks of his books are things that didn't work and he will probably</v>

1735
00:54:09.421 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 1>appreciate those just as much as any of the ones that did.</v>

1736
00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 1>It was also,</v>

1737
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 4>Tj is approach is really interesting to me because Tj is obsessed with</v>

1738
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:22.311
<v Speaker 4>improvement and knowledge and he keeps talking about his fight Iq and you know,</v>

1739
00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:23.220
<v Speaker 4>him and Dwayne,</v>

1740
00:54:23.221 --> 00:54:24.001
<v Speaker 4>I've been around them,</v>

1741
00:54:24.001 --> 00:54:24.870
<v Speaker 4>I've trained with them,</v>

1742
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:25.681
<v Speaker 4>I've worked out with him,</v>

1743
00:54:25.681 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 4>I watched him coach Tj and I mean they're,</v>

1744
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 4>they're constantly working on the minutia.</v>

1745
00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 4>They're constantly working on finite details and improving every single aspect</v>

1746
00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:38.700
<v Speaker 4>and tightening things up.</v>

1747
00:54:38.701 --> 00:54:40.300
<v Speaker 4>And it's really interesting.</v>

1748
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Tj is a fucking open book man.</v>

1749
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:42.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1750
00:54:42.601 --> 00:54:42.841
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1751
00:54:42.841 --> 00:54:43.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1752
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.800
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1753
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.251
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1754
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:48.230
<v Speaker 4>you can talk to that guy about anything and he's considering it.</v>

1755
00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:49.350
<v Speaker 4>He's thinking and he's like,</v>

1756
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:49.741
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1757
00:54:49.741 --> 00:54:50.041
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1758
00:54:50.041 --> 00:54:50.731
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're doing.</v>

1759
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:51.564
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're doing.</v>

1760
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.111
<v Speaker 4>Like he's,</v>

1761
00:54:52.111 --> 00:54:54.930
<v Speaker 4>he's a guy who's always trying to take in information,</v>

1762
00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:56.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1763
00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:56.710
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1764
00:54:56.710 --> 00:55:01.710
<v Speaker 1>so these are the things when we do watch this kind of thing,</v>

1765
00:55:02.081 --> 00:55:06.850
<v Speaker 1>whether it is martial arts or even your jazz or football or whatever,</v>

1766
00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:09.040
<v Speaker 1>there are these lessons that are there,</v>

1767
00:55:09.041 --> 00:55:09.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1768
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.720
<v Speaker 1>we should do that.</v>

1769
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.240
<v Speaker 1>My corresponds to go through life doing that.</v>

1770
00:55:13.241 --> 00:55:15.250
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to look at Tj Dillashaw and go,</v>

1771
00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:15.641

00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:16.750
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

1774
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:17.620
<v Speaker 1>if we do that,</v>

1775
00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:18.730
<v Speaker 1>our lives will get better.</v>

1776
00:55:18.731 --> 00:55:19.564
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1777
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I got two.</v>

1778
00:55:21.161 --> 00:55:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So I get to work for Tsn in Canada,</v>

1779
00:55:24.131 --> 00:55:26.320
<v Speaker 1>which is like ESPN at in the states and we,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm myself and Aaron broadens that are like the two person division.</v>

1781
00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It talks about about a UFC and fighting.</v>

1782
00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:34.083
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1783
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:35.103
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1784
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1785
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.840
<v Speaker 1>they went and when George was fighting Michael,</v>

1786
00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:38.591
<v Speaker 1>they went and said,</v>

1787
00:55:38.591 --> 00:55:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1788
00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:41.680
<v Speaker 1>could you approach your friends with George and his people?</v>

1789
00:55:41.681 --> 00:55:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Could you approach them about doing a half hour long documentary on him about</v>

1790
00:55:44.801 --> 00:55:46.480
<v Speaker 1>his comeback and training and stuff?</v>

1791
00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.310
<v Speaker 1>And I did.</v>

1792
00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.040
<v Speaker 1>And at first George was open to it and is Rudolph has manager.</v>

1793
00:55:52.041 --> 00:55:52.331
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1794
00:55:52.331 --> 00:55:52.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1795
00:55:52.661 --> 00:55:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I hear the word documentary and I know what that means.</v>

1796
00:55:54.971 --> 00:55:57.550
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be months and is going to be cameras and it's going to be a</v>

1797
00:55:58.090 --> 00:55:58.631
<v Speaker 1>distraction.</v>

1798
00:55:58.631 --> 00:55:59.464
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1799
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I'll just travel with George and I have the best producer,</v>

1802
00:56:07.331 --> 00:56:09.850
<v Speaker 1>so I got to travel with George for a month,</v>

1809
00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:21.940
<v Speaker 1>It did come up before,</v>

1810
00:56:21.941 --> 00:56:23.020
<v Speaker 1>so mostly in Canada,</v>

00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:34.750
<v Speaker 1>It changed my life,</v>

1819
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:35.590
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>

1820
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.570
<v Speaker 1>because you don't get to be around the greats of the greats and study them and</v>

1821
00:56:40.571 --> 00:56:41.321
<v Speaker 1>we're friends.</v>

1822
00:56:41.321 --> 00:56:43.940
<v Speaker 1>So I can talk to him like we hang out here,</v>

1823
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I got to fucking train karate with his team,</v>

1824
00:56:46.661 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 1>like point karate,</v>

1825
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:48.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1826
00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:50.500
<v Speaker 1>so it'd be all Robbins training with us today.</v>

1827
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 1>What kind of point karate training do they do?</v>

1828
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And do they do this to practice like blitzing?</v>

1829
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1830
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And just think of this like an eye.</v>

1831
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.670
<v Speaker 1>You were big on point karate like 2012,</v>

1832
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:05.560
<v Speaker 1>2013 and I didn't disagree but I didn't really get there.</v>

1833
00:57:05.561 --> 00:57:06.394
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1834
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.150
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

1835
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1836
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It uh oh fuck.</v>

1837
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It was so magical to see like,</v>

1838
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.280
<v Speaker 1>and I wasn't just like how does he kick?</v>

1839
00:57:12.281 --> 00:57:12.581
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1840
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:13.414
<v Speaker 1>how does he,</v>

1841
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 1>why does he do the things he does and why?</v>

1842
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:16.990
<v Speaker 1>What's his motivation?</v>

1843
00:57:16.991 --> 00:57:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And it really made me a better human being getting to do that.</v>

1844
00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:20.440
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1845
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.371
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

1846
00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really connect to a sit.</v>

1847
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's something so simple and we don't see it cause we're in,</v>

1848
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:27.531
<v Speaker 1>we're deep in,</v>

1849
00:57:27.531 --> 00:57:28.390
<v Speaker 1>up whatever we're in.</v>

1850
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:32.380
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of point karate people right away and say,</v>

1851
00:57:32.381 --> 00:57:32.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1852
00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:33.640
<v Speaker 1>they're just touching each other.</v>

1853
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like a true,</v>

1854
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.160
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm training to just touch you,</v>

1855
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:36.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to hurt you.</v>

1856
00:57:36.941 --> 00:57:37.121
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1857
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:38.860
<v Speaker 1>That seems like that's not valuable,</v>

1858
00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 1>but you're training to not,</v>

1859
00:57:40.451 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 1>let me even fucking touch you.</v>

1860
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1861
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:45.190
<v Speaker 1>If you can't get touched by me,</v>

1862
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:45.910
<v Speaker 1>how hard,</v>

1863
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:47.650
<v Speaker 1>impossible as it for me to hit you clean.</v>

1864
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:48.791
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1865
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:50.650
<v Speaker 1>If your movement and your,</v>

1866
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.740
<v Speaker 1>your defensive systems and your management of the,</v>

1867
00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 1>of the distance between our weapons and targets are such that I can't fucking</v>

1868
00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:58.780
<v Speaker 1>touch you.</v>

1869
00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 1>How can I hurt you?</v>

1870
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1871
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.810
<v Speaker 1>If I can't even like get touchy with my glove.</v>

1872
00:58:02.811 --> 00:58:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1873
00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:03.723
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>

1874
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:09.190
<v Speaker 4>here's what I think about point fighting and what I think was valid about it is</v>

1875
00:58:09.191 --> 00:58:12.070
<v Speaker 4>if you're just doing point fighting with a point fighter,</v>

1876
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 4>it is extremely frustrated.</v>

1877
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:17.260
<v Speaker 4>I fought in point fighting tournaments when I was competing and we,</v>

1878
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:18.123
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

1879
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:22.870
<v Speaker 4>I came from a full contact taekwondo background and we fought in these</v>

1880
00:58:22.871 --> 00:58:25.990
<v Speaker 4>tournaments and the object was to knock people unconscious and you would fight,</v>

1881
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:29.260
<v Speaker 4>you know there were three minute rounds and you would fight and you would try to</v>

1882
00:58:29.261 --> 00:58:30.620
<v Speaker 4>kick people into another time.</v>

1883
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.490
<v Speaker 4>A similar in Canada when it says what we,</v>

1884
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:37.660
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of people that are trained with that openly dismissed point</v>

1885
00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:38.320
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

1886
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.020
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why they openly dismissed point fighting was cause they would</v>

1887
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 4>stop every time someone would get touched.</v>

1888
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.231
<v Speaker 4>And I would be like,</v>

1889
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:47.200
<v Speaker 4>well in the real world or everybody would say in the real world,</v>

1890
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.150
<v Speaker 4>you don't just stop when you get touched,</v>

1891
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 4>you keep fighting.</v>

1892
00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:51.910
<v Speaker 4>And so with our techniques,</v>

1893
00:58:51.911 --> 00:58:52.570
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it,</v>

1894
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:55.900
<v Speaker 4>you would hit someone once and they would counter it and then you'd set up the</v>

1895
00:58:55.901 --> 00:58:56.950
<v Speaker 4>big shot afterwards.</v>

1896
00:58:56.951 --> 00:58:58.360
<v Speaker 4>Like this is part of the thing.</v>

1897
00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.760
<v Speaker 4>And if the the referee kept stopping you,</v>

1898
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.530
<v Speaker 4>then you would never get anything done.</v>

1899
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:07.390
<v Speaker 4>But my thinking once I got into MMA was okay.</v>

1900
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.931
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1901
00:59:07.931 --> 00:59:11.860
<v Speaker 4>But if you can do that and do the other things,</v>

1902
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:15.310
<v Speaker 4>it's like people dismiss taekwondo because there were like,</v>

1903
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:16.240
<v Speaker 4>we'll talk window.</v>

1904
00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:16.650
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1905
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1906
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.280
<v Speaker 4>you get taken to the ground,</v>

1907
00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:19.720
<v Speaker 4>you get your legs kicked out.</v>

1908
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:20.583
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1909
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 4>But if you have</v>

1910
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:27.280
<v Speaker 3>takedown defense and you know Moitai you can wheel kick someone into another</v>

1911
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 3>fucking dimension.</v>

1912
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:31.910
<v Speaker 3>And we saw that with Edson Barboza versus Terry Edom.</v>

1913
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 3>We've seen these taekwondo techniques manifest themselves in MMA and you realize</v>

1914
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1915
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:37.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1916
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 3>these are some of the most powerful things you could do to a person inside a</v>

1917
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:41.594
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>

1918
00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:45.560
<v Speaker 3>But when you see the point fighting style,</v>

1919
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:48.530
<v Speaker 3>they'll like the Raymond Daniels or the Michael Venom page.</v>

1920
00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:52.430
<v Speaker 3>This ability to blitz if they can do those other things too.</v>

1921
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:53.780
<v Speaker 3>This is another,</v>

1922
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:54.831
<v Speaker 3>another level.</v>

1923
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:55.551
<v Speaker 3>There's something to it.</v>

1924
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:57.050
<v Speaker 3>So as a fighter,</v>

1925
00:59:57.051 --> 01:00:01.670
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't willing to dismiss point fighting because I had been lied to already.</v>

1926
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.121
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1927
01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:05.720
<v Speaker 3>when I went and took taekwondo and then started kickboxing,</v>

1928
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 3>first American kickboxing above the waist,</v>

1929
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:11.360
<v Speaker 3>first thing I realized is how easy it was for me to get punched in the face.</v>

1930
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:12.110
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1931
01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:12.890
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1932
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:13.341
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1933
01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Now if I'm trapped in this ring and I can't go anywhere and someone's throwing</v>

1934
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.980
<v Speaker 3>punches and I don't understand how to get away from him,</v>

1935
01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:21.950
<v Speaker 3>and I'm used to this taekwondo style of having your hands down low,</v>

1936
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting fucked up.</v>

1937
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 3>So I've been lied to.</v>

1938
01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Talk Window is not the best martial art.</v>

1939
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.450
<v Speaker 3>None of the Ma.</v>

1940
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1941
01:00:26.661 --> 01:00:27.580
<v Speaker 3>there's exactly,</v>

1942
01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm nothing.</v>

1943
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1944
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:29.460
<v Speaker 3>There is no best much.</v>

1945
01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:33.710
<v Speaker 3>There's something absolutely legit about that blitz,</v>

1946
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 3>that karate blitz that some of these guys can do.</v>

1947
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:41.300
<v Speaker 3>And I fought some really good guys and those karate style tournaments in and I</v>

1948
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.800
<v Speaker 3>got an ass made out of me.</v>

1949
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:43.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

1950
01:00:43.671 --> 01:00:45.170
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what to do.</v>

1951
01:00:45.171 --> 01:00:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Like and you get kicked and then the referees point and you're like,</v>

1952
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:52.970
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a chance to fire back because they're separating you guys.</v>

1953
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.180
<v Speaker 3>And I really absorb those lessons.</v>

1954
01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:57.890
<v Speaker 3>And I was like in MMA,</v>

1955
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 3>that ability to close the distance because every,</v>

1956
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:02.450
<v Speaker 3>in MMA there's so many guys,</v>

1957
01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 3>and Connor talked about this,</v>

1958
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 3>there's so many guys that have this Moy Thai stance and they're,</v>

1959
01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:07.990
<v Speaker 3>they're presenting,</v>

1960
01:01:07.991 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 3>it's very predictable target.</v>

1961
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.610
<v Speaker 3>They're standing right in front of each other.</v>

1962
01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 3>And I think this stance and especially this,</v>

1963
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.990
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1964
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:15.741
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>

1965
01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:16.031
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1966
01:01:16.031 --> 01:01:16.200
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1967
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.090
<v Speaker 3>the forward stance is one of the reasons why [inaudible] has been caught,</v>

1968
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:23.000
<v Speaker 3>knocked out twice with front kicks because he squares off.</v>

1969
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:28.320
<v Speaker 3>I veto explained this to me in like Shit 1997 when I was training at Carlson</v>

1970
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Gracie's,</v>

1971
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.540
<v Speaker 3>he was explaining that,</v>

1972
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:32.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1973
01:01:32.841 --> 01:01:37.370
<v Speaker 3>some kickboxers are going to have a hard time in MMA even though they're really</v>

1974
01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:40.160
<v Speaker 3>good kickboxers because the MMA stance,</v>

1975
01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:42.140
<v Speaker 3>you really have to square off more.</v>

1976
01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't stand like this.</v>

1977
01:01:43.671 --> 01:01:45.110
<v Speaker 3>You can't stand like a boxer.</v>

1978
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.110
<v Speaker 3>And a kickboxer is a little more open than a boxer.</v>

1979
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.420
<v Speaker 3>But then MMA is a little more open than that.</v>

1980
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.751
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1981
01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 3>you almost have to be square,</v>

1982
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:57.190
<v Speaker 3>but that's square leaves you open to front kick to the face and then turning</v>

1983
01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.031
<v Speaker 3>side kicks in.</v>

1984
01:01:58.031 --> 01:01:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Side kicks to the body.</v>

1985
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Think about what Vito has been dropped with.</v>

1986
01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones dropped him with a side kick to the body.</v>

1987
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Soccer.</v>

1988
01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Robert dropped him with a turning side kick to the body to front kicks with</v>

1989
01:02:06.951 --> 01:02:07.850
<v Speaker 3>front kicks to the face.</v>

1990
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.340
<v Speaker 3>It's because he presents this square thing.</v>

1991
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 3>But to him this is sprawl and throw punches and throw that the like the blitz</v>

1992
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:18.380
<v Speaker 3>that we used on Vandelay Silva and it worked much of his career.</v>

1993
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 3>He either with it or lost</v>

1994
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.281
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

1995
01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1996
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>And I'm have respect that thinking.</v>

1997
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>But those types of doctrines like is literally and in martial arts in day to day</v>

1998
01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>life in anything,</v>

1999
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>if you think anything is the other thing,</v>

2000
01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>you're totally wrong,</v>

2001
01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2002
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Because if we all agree it's the thing,</v>

2003
01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>then we all acting like it's the thing,</v>

2004
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>then we all start ignoring other things and those things will work.</v>

2005
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you have to,</v>

2006
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>if MMA you have to square up,</v>

2007
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.040
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden some guy,</v>

2008
01:02:46.041 --> 01:02:48.410
<v Speaker 1>some Connor comes out with a different thing and you were wrong.</v>

2009
01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>That the guard is the one that is glaring to me right now because,</v>

2010
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I've talked to some of the smartest and the best and they will,</v>

2011
01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>and we do this over and over again.</v>

2012
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.930
<v Speaker 1>And we do it in everything.</v>

2013
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:01.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2014
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:02.390
<v Speaker 1>you remember when you,</v>

2015
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:03.030
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2016
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you cannot cross your feet when you do an arm bar.</v>

2017
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.061
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

2018
01:03:06.061 --> 01:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Or like what the fuck,</v>

2019
01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.213
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

2020
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.531
<v Speaker 1>Head kicks.</v>

2021
01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't work in MMA.</v>

2022
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

2023
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.100
<v Speaker 1>this has been going on forever.</v>

2024
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Any absolute decision that this is a fundamental rule is completely,</v>

2025
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.270
<v Speaker 1>that's where you're going to get fucked.</v>

2026
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And how about the low calf kick?</v>

2027
01:03:23.401 --> 01:03:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2028
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean the look Benson Henderson was in my opinion,</v>

2029
01:03:26.251 --> 01:03:31.251
<v Speaker 1>the first guy to bring him and he started doing that back in the day but not to</v>

2030
01:03:31.271 --> 01:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the effectiveness,</v>

2031
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.290
<v Speaker 1>the level of effectiveness that we're seeing now.</v>

2032
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>That low calf kick his fucking people.</v>

2033
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's really interesting.</v>

2034
01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll adapt and then it won't work.</v>

2035
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:41.940
<v Speaker 1>But that adaptation,</v>

2036
01:03:41.941 --> 01:03:43.980
<v Speaker 1>we'll put something else available.</v>

2037
01:03:43.981 --> 01:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Think of the problem with the low calf kick is that you really can't condition</v>

2038
01:03:48.271 --> 01:03:51.030
<v Speaker 1>the lower part of your leg the same way you can your thighs.</v>

2039
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's going to keep working,</v>

2040
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 1>but then we ask them to not get hit by it.</v>

2041
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 1>So we'll make a change to not get hit by and once we do,</v>

2042
01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:00.540
<v Speaker 1>that'll force us to do something else that someone will take advantage.</v>

2043
01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how quickly it works.</v>

2044
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Like if you see a guy get hit with a brutal leg kick,</v>

2045
01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>like it takes one or two and then they start to feel it.</v>

2046
01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the first low calf kick.</v>

2047
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:12.180
<v Speaker 1>You see guys wobbly like that.</v>

2048
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.190
<v Speaker 1>That muscle is like really done.</v>

2049
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.280
<v Speaker 1>The insertion at the bottom is so small and it's taking so much work like it's</v>

2050
01:04:20.281 --> 01:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>carrying so much.</v>

2051
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2052
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2053
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2054
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and these are when things work beautifully and again,</v>

2055
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>like I used to take anything we would talk about and I'd bring it back to</v>

2056
01:04:29.611 --> 01:04:30.300
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

2057
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Now I tend to take anything and fighting and I tried to figure out what it means</v>

2058
01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>

2059
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I've kind of swell over time of study.</v>

2060
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I've started to to do that.</v>

2061
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2062
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.820
<v Speaker 1>And this is true of this kick can.</v>

2063
01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:42.601
<v Speaker 1>It's true of anything.</v>

2064
01:04:42.601 --> 01:04:47.601
<v Speaker 1>It's like the w w it works best when the physiological truth that calf is small</v>

2065
01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:52.200
<v Speaker 1>and weak and then works with the systemic issue.</v>

2066
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.680
<v Speaker 1>He's got his foot there and the way he's standing as such that you can hit it to</v>

2067
01:04:55.681 --> 01:05:00.681
<v Speaker 1>those two things together are making that thing work right now if you can't</v>

2068
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>change the strength of the calf.</v>

2069
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>So the only thing we can change is how available that calf kick is if we don't</v>

2070
01:05:06.451 --> 01:05:07.284
<v Speaker 1>want to get hit with it.</v>

2071
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:08.880
<v Speaker 1>So we must change that.</v>

2072
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>And if we do,</v>

2073
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:13.080
<v Speaker 1>we've changed a lot of different things and now something else is available that</v>

2074
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne or Duke or somebody else's already planning how to,</v>

2075
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>how to take advantage that you've made that adaptation and that that is for me</v>

2076
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>what is eternally fascinating about martial arts.</v>

2077
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

2078
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>dots,</v>

2079
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>those are the lessons of life that are there.</v>

2080
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>If you can't see that the world around you has changed dramatically and you act</v>

2081
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>as if it's the same,</v>

2082
01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:34.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2083
01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:34.853
<v Speaker 1>you get fucked up,</v>

2084
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>you will get fucked up.</v>

2085
01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:36.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2086
01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.410
<v Speaker 4>I bring this to Paul daily versus John Fitch because,</v>

2087
01:05:40.411 --> 01:05:40.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2088
01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:45.890
<v Speaker 4>that fight was extremely frustrating to Paul Daley and frustrating to a lot of</v>

2089
01:05:45.991 --> 01:05:47.190
<v Speaker 4>people that were watching it too.</v>

2090
01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Cause John Fitch was just able to take him down and kind of do what John Fitch</v>

2091
01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:56.130
<v Speaker 4>does and hit him on the ground and kind of beat him up and control the position.</v>

2092
01:05:56.131 --> 01:05:56.361
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2093
01:05:56.361 --> 01:05:57.001
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2094
01:05:57.001 --> 01:05:59.290
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the fight Paul's yell and boom,</v>

2095
01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.330
<v Speaker 4>he seals.</v>

2096
01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:01.440
<v Speaker 4>It was so strange,</v>

2097
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.130
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2098
01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:02.700
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2099
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:06.930
<v Speaker 4>but this is a guy that if you just stand with him,</v>

2100
01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:08.670
<v Speaker 4>he's going to fuck you up.</v>

2101
01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Like if you just decide to trade shots with Paul daily on your feet,</v>

2102
01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:15.090
<v Speaker 4>he's got a left hand that is a goddamn nuclear missile,</v>

2103
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2104
01:06:15.421 --> 01:06:16.770
<v Speaker 4>and he basically,</v>

2105
01:06:16.771 --> 01:06:18.930
<v Speaker 4>everybody he hits with that thing goes night night.</v>

2106
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:19.501
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>

2107
01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Even Lorens Larkin,</v>

2108
01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:22.470
<v Speaker 4>who's a seasoned striker,</v>

2109
01:06:22.471 --> 01:06:23.940
<v Speaker 4>he got clipped by that left hand.</v>

2110
01:06:23.941 --> 01:06:24.181
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2111
01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:25.014
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

2112
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:26.200
<v Speaker 1>the ability to make,</v>

2113
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.790
<v Speaker 1>generate and create that amount of impact is elegant.</v>

2114
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.653
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2115
01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like we are human bodies and minds don't do all that many things that are</v>

2116
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>that unbelievably beautiful and rooted in our history as human beings.</v>

2117
01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:42.491
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2118
01:06:42.491 --> 01:06:47.491
<v Speaker 1>This is at the basis of what it was to survive and protect and expand and stuff.</v>

2119
01:06:47.761 --> 01:06:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And you see it right there.</v>

2120
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>When Paul Daley hits somebody like it's unreal.</v>

2121
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.730
<v Speaker 1>The opposite of that scenario is,</v>

2122
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:55.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2123
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Hendricks was fighting Stephen Thompson and Johnny Hendricks wanted,</v>

2124
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>when Stephen would come in,</v>

2125
01:07:01.091 --> 01:07:04.950
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to drill him with hooks and upper cuts and then get to his body and to</v>

2126
01:07:04.951 --> 01:07:06.250
<v Speaker 1>take him down and do what,</v>

2127
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:06.731
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2128
01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:07.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2129
01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2130
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.313
<v Speaker 1>John Fitch did.</v>

2131
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.460
<v Speaker 1>But Steven's like,</v>

2132
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing that.</v>

2133
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And after he kicked him and beat him up at distance and then finish the fight,</v>

2134
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Johnny was being interviewed and he's like,</v>

2135
01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:17.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2136
01:07:17.161 --> 01:07:17.994
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't my knife.</v>

2137
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And Johnny is a classy guy overall over the length of his career,</v>

2138
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.170
<v Speaker 1>he sometimes gets heat,</v>

2139
01:07:23.171 --> 01:07:23.891
<v Speaker 1>but who cares,</v>

2140
01:07:23.891 --> 01:07:24.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2141
01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Like the opinion of the people shouldn't matter to Johnny Hendricks.</v>

2142
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>But Johnny said after he said,</v>

2143
01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:29.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2144
01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I was kinda hoping he'd come in trade a little more.</v>

2145
01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2146
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.060
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck would he do that?</v>

2147
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:35.260
<v Speaker 1>That's not his style.</v>

2148
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you want.</v>

2149
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>He wants to do what you don't want.</v>

2150
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:44.050
<v Speaker 1>The whole goal is to do something that benefits him in the scenario and does not</v>

2151
01:07:44.051 --> 01:07:44.651
<v Speaker 1>benefit you,</v>

2152
01:07:44.651 --> 01:07:45.940
<v Speaker 1>which would be exactly what he did,</v>

2153
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.751
<v Speaker 4>which is why,</v>

2154
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:50.870
<v Speaker 4>what brings you back to the Paul Daley John Fitch fight like this is the answer</v>

2155
01:07:50.871 --> 01:07:51.800
<v Speaker 4>to that style,</v>

2156
01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:56.880
<v Speaker 4>the answer to that styles take you down and not ever let you get up and,</v>

2157
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:59.780
<v Speaker 4>and force John Fitches game on you,</v>

2158
01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.090
<v Speaker 4>which is what makes fighting so interesting.</v>

2159
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:06.830
<v Speaker 4>If John Fitch had just decided to go cowboy and bite down his mouthpiece and</v>

2160
01:08:06.831 --> 01:08:10.460
<v Speaker 4>just wing punches that Paul daily until one of them went to sleep,</v>

2161
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:12.560
<v Speaker 4>that would have been a great fight for Paul Dalian.</v>

2162
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:13.170
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

2163
01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:13.470
<v Speaker 4>China.</v>

2164
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2165
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>when Nick Diaz and Paul Daley did that,</v>

2166
01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.690
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty happy and that only happens again.</v>

2167
01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:25.750
<v Speaker 2>You're creating a moment and it only happens because nick was motivated by who</v>

2168
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:28.280
<v Speaker 2>he is in that moment.</v>

2169
01:08:28.281 --> 01:08:30.740
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't motivated by strategy even necessarily.</v>

2170
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:31.011
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2171
01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:31.850
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2172
01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck you.</v>

2173
01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 2>And that however people will look at that.</v>

2174
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:38.481
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

2175
01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2176
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:41.690
<v Speaker 2>it is an expression of the individuality,</v>

2177
01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>the authentic truth of who Nick Diaz is.</v>

2178
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.310
<v Speaker 2>That's why that's art.</v>

2179
01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.080
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] art and fight.</v>

2180
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a fight.</v>

2181
01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.440
<v Speaker 2>This was got a fight,</v>

2182
01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:52.710
<v Speaker 2>but that's a little bit of this.</v>

2183
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.410
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

2184
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:55.910
<v Speaker 2>he just kept the pace.</v>

2185
01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.230
<v Speaker 2>He's just refusing.</v>

2186
01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Paul just got too tired too quick.</v>

2187
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.930
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

2188
01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 2>he was willing and big shots and look at Nick just oh damn.</v>

2189
01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2190
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:05.031
<v Speaker 2>He got clipped.</v>

2191
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:06.640
<v Speaker 2>That's his left hook you're talking about.</v>

2192
01:09:06.641 --> 01:09:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2193
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:07.551
<v Speaker 2>this is over.</v>

2194
01:09:07.551 --> 01:09:07.761
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2195
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:08.361
<v Speaker 2>It's all right there.</v>

2196
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:08.780
<v Speaker 2>We're done.</v>

2197
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2198
01:09:09.081 --> 01:09:10.520
<v Speaker 2>cause nick won't be done.</v>

2199
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.653
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2200
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2201
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:12.981
<v Speaker 2>who knows me.</v>

2202
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 2>It was Paul's in better condition.</v>

2203
01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:15.890
<v Speaker 2>But this is the end.</v>

2204
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.930
<v Speaker 2>The end is nick just battering him.</v>

2205
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that he beat him his striking contest.</v>

2206
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 2>But he did it with Wale.</v>

2207
01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:24.680
<v Speaker 2>He was always a great boxer.</v>

2208
01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:25.910
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

2209
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.721
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

2210
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:27.111
<v Speaker 2>we're this,</v>

2211
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:29.090
<v Speaker 2>we're this a metaphor for life.</v>

2212
01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Like you got a wall or the greatest victories ever.</v>

2213
01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.470
<v Speaker 2>The quintessential Nick Diaz fight.</v>

2214
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.713
<v Speaker 2>You're get to look at them.</v>

2215
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:38.301
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2216
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:39.134
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2217
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.120
<v Speaker 2>And there are people who don't like him.</v>

2218
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2219
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy too,</v>

2220
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.140
<v Speaker 2>because that what we're,</v>

2221
01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 2>what we're searching for,</v>

2222
01:09:46.101 --> 01:09:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I think is we are trying to be authentically who we are.</v>

2223
01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that's all we're doing.</v>

2224
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.860
<v Speaker 2>That's what Nick Diaz is.</v>

2225
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck you think he is.</v>

2226
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:58.510
<v Speaker 2>He is authentically Nick Diaz and w and the metaphor to me is Paul Daley is a</v>

2227
01:09:59.391 --> 01:10:01.400
<v Speaker 2>wall and you can,</v>

2228
01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:05.790
<v Speaker 2>you can dig under it or you can go around it or you can trick somebody who gives</v>

2229
01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.510
<v Speaker 2>you a rope or you can climb it or you can dissemble it.</v>

2230
01:10:08.511 --> 01:10:08.991
<v Speaker 2>And Nick's like,</v>

2231
01:10:08.991 --> 01:10:09.411
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

2232
01:10:09.411 --> 01:10:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go through it.</v>

2233
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go through it.</v>

2234
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:15.140
<v Speaker 2>And there are many ways to choose to live your life and that's how Nick Diaz</v>

2235
01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:16.010
<v Speaker 2>lifts his fucking life.</v>

2236
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:16.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2237
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:17.600
<v Speaker 2>that's beautiful.</v>

2238
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.090
<v Speaker 2>What sucks is that he hasn't fought in forever.</v>

2239
01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean he hasn't fought since the Anderson Silva fight.</v>

2240
01:10:22.431 --> 01:10:23.264
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2241
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:27.650
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that they suspended him for marijuana when Anderson Silva tested</v>

2242
01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:31.160
<v Speaker 2>positive for steroids in that fight and he got a shorter suspension.</v>

2243
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:31.994
<v Speaker 2>The nick,</v>

2244
01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.140
<v Speaker 2>that's a reflection.</v>

2245
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:36.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a cultural leftover cultural reflection.</v>

2246
01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:39.860
<v Speaker 2>That's also the nick refuse to pay the fine cause that's Nick d is being</v>

2247
01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:40.990
<v Speaker 2>authentically Nicholas.</v>

2248
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.830
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting that money from me.</v>

2249
01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.713
<v Speaker 2>Oh see ya.</v>

2250
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:46.580
<v Speaker 2>But you can admire that.</v>

2251
01:10:46.581 --> 01:10:47.414
<v Speaker 2>Like some,</v>

2252
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:49.850
<v Speaker 2>some people will look at that and go do just pay it.</v>

2253
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:50.431
<v Speaker 2>It'll go this way.</v>

2254
01:10:50.431 --> 01:10:50.721
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2255
01:10:50.721 --> 01:10:51.051
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2256
01:10:51.051 --> 01:10:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally who I am,</v>

2257
01:10:52.641 --> 01:10:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I cannot do that.</v>

2258
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I will get negative consequences in my life,</v>

2259
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:59.060
<v Speaker 2>but I will be authentic to who I am.</v>

2260
01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:01.490
<v Speaker 2>But nick is like 36 now I think.</v>

2261
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.440
<v Speaker 2>How old is Nick Diaz?</v>

2262
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:02.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2263
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 2>34 he's 34 now.</v>

2264
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:05.310
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

2265
01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Well Dude,</v>

2266
01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.130
<v Speaker 2>his first fight in UFC,</v>

2267
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:12.131
<v Speaker 2>I believe he was 20 you know when he fought Jeremy Jackson like way back in the</v>

2268
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.141

2287
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.151
<v Speaker 1>truly,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's what he wants to do.</v>

2289
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:40.430
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>

2290

2291
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:42.204
<v Speaker 1>And if he doesn't,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and I'll ask honestly as a friend,</v>

2308
01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:58.560
<v Speaker 1>and he knows that I'm also employed by somebody who I have a little</v>

2309

<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

2310

<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2311
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:04.580
<v Speaker 1>but I will never advert sacrifice a friendship or like a longterm relationship</v>

2312
01:12:05.641 --> 01:12:07.430
<v Speaker 1>to like find something out on that.</v>

2313
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:08.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2314
01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about,</v>

2315
01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 1>and I don't care about Twitter beefs and I don't care about the breaking news</v>

2316
01:12:14.401 --> 01:12:14.911
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

2317
01:12:14.911 --> 01:12:15.744
<v Speaker 1>It's just not interesting.</v>

2318
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not anything to do with my life.</v>

2319
01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:18.210
<v Speaker 1>But I'll go ask George.</v>

2320
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:19.440
<v Speaker 1>So I asked George,</v>

2321
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 1>who we are friends,</v>

2322
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.700
<v Speaker 1>we talked yesterday and uh,</v>

2323
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.713
<v Speaker 1>we will,</v>

2324
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:27.660
<v Speaker 1>he will tell me the truth and then,</v>

2325
01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.440
<v Speaker 1>and something as simple as all,</v>

2326
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2327
01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:32.190
<v Speaker 1>not as fucking bullshit,</v>

2328
01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe not in exactly those terms,</v>

2329
01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:34.644
<v Speaker 1>but he would say.</v>

2330
01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:35.760
<v Speaker 1>But when I asked him about it,</v>

2331
01:12:35.761 --> 01:12:36.420
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2332
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:36.691
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2333
01:12:36.691 --> 01:12:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

2334
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2335
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I haven't signed nothing.</v>

2336
01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.440
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at that and like,</v>

2337
01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:41.191
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2338
01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:42.930
<v Speaker 1>that's George tried to be deceptive.</v>

2339
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Like George would normally go ass be ass man.</v>

2340
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:46.494
<v Speaker 1>That's not happening.</v>

2341
01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I know I haven't signed anything.</v>

2342
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Well I know they've offered him knee,</v>

2343
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:51.480
<v Speaker 1>but that was George,</v>

2344
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.340
<v Speaker 1>who's Shitty at being deceptive,</v>

2345
01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.650
<v Speaker 1>trying to be deceptive like he,</v>

2346
01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:55.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2347
01:12:55.921 --> 01:12:56.701
<v Speaker 1>so like you said,</v>

2348
01:12:56.701 --> 01:12:57.391
<v Speaker 1>they've offered it to,</v>

2349
01:12:57.391 --> 01:13:00.060
<v Speaker 1>they've offered it to him and by saying I haven't signed it means he's</v>

2350
01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:00.800
<v Speaker 1>considering it.</v>

2351
01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.970
<v Speaker 3>I think he's considering it,</v>

2352
01:13:01.971 --> 01:13:06.650
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's also considering could be number of off and then there's always</v>

2353
01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.290
<v Speaker 3>the great Irish Leprechaun,</v>

2354
01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:10.850
<v Speaker 3>you know mean.</v>

2355
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:12.800
<v Speaker 3>I think those are the two big fights.</v>

2356
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:14.180
<v Speaker 3>The two big fights or could be,</v>

2357
01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:16.590
<v Speaker 3>but one 55 or even one 70 yeah.</v>

2358
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.960
<v Speaker 3>GSP wants to winner of Conor McGregor versus could be not Nate Diaz insider</v>

2359
01:13:20.961 --> 01:13:24.680
<v Speaker 3>drops bombshell and this is May 19th Saturday.</v>

2360
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:13:25.281 --> 01:13:26.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he wants that.</v>

2362
01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.040
<v Speaker 3>But that fight would have to take place first.</v>

2363
01:13:28.041 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 3>And who the fuck knows when Connor or could be,</v>

2364
01:13:30.151 --> 01:13:32.440
<v Speaker 3>but fight afterwards if it's Connor,</v>

2365
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:33.860
<v Speaker 3>it might be a decade later.</v>

2366
01:13:33.861 --> 01:13:34.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2367
01:13:34.071 --> 01:13:35.930
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows what that guys going to do?</v>

2368
01:13:35.931 --> 01:13:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Now when you give a guy like Conor a hundred million dollars,</v>

2369
01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:39.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2370
01:13:39.771 --> 01:13:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what happens.</v>

2371
01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:45.230
<v Speaker 3>He's throwing dollars at bus windows and losing his fucking mind and yeah,</v>

2372
01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.190
<v Speaker 3>that's mad of Jamie,</v>

2373
01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:47.600
<v Speaker 3>that UFC inside of a shop,</v>

2374
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.740
<v Speaker 3>was it?</v>

2375
01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:48.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2376
01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:49.820
<v Speaker 3>it was on his podcast.</v>

2377
01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.070
<v Speaker 3>I didn't saw that.</v>

2378
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.903
<v Speaker 3>Scroll down.</v>

2379
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:55.880
<v Speaker 3>UFC inside Brendan shot those who?</v>

2380
01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Brendan Schaub as you fucking idiots.</v>

2381
01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.140
<v Speaker 3>That fucking some obscure insider.</v>

2382
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2383
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:03.980
<v Speaker 3>well I'm sure he does want that,</v>

2384
01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.380
<v Speaker 3>but if they offer him a fat paycheck and they really should,</v>

2385
01:14:06.381 --> 01:14:07.010
<v Speaker 3>if they want.</v>

2386
01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:07.311
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2387
01:14:07.311 --> 01:14:08.780
<v Speaker 3>the UFC is in a weird position.</v>

2388
01:14:08.781 --> 01:14:08.960
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2389
01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.770
<v Speaker 3>they bought the company for $4.</v>

2390
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it's worth,</v>

2391
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 3>but I would guess it's probably not really worth $4 billion.</v>

2392
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.890
<v Speaker 3>They have a giant monthly nut.</v>

2393
01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.240
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking huge.</v>

2394
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:23.650
<v Speaker 3>The monthly nut that they have to make caused them to fire a hundred employees.</v>

2395
01:14:23.651 --> 01:14:23.801
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2396
01:14:23.801 --> 01:14:26.440
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going on and there's been some,</v>

2397
01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:26.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2398
01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:30.220
<v Speaker 3>great fights and it's obviously still incredibly popular,</v>

2399
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:33.670
<v Speaker 3>but you want to make those big paper view bucks.</v>

2400
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:35.380
<v Speaker 3>You need the big name stars.</v>

2401
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 3>GSP was always a big name.</v>

2402
01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:42.481
<v Speaker 3>Star became even bigger when he came back and beat Bisbing and one by finish and</v>

2403
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 3>you've got them in a rear naked choke and put them to sleep.</v>

2404
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's still a giant star.</v>

2405
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.380
<v Speaker 3>However he hasn't fought in a while vacated at title.</v>

2406
01:14:51.381 --> 01:14:52.690
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have the title anymore.</v>

2407
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.120
<v Speaker 3>So it's not as big of a deal to the public size when his sit down.</v>

2408
01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:57.790
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2409
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:58.151
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2410
01:14:58.151 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 3>People are dumb as shit man.</v>

2411
01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:00.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2412
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing to me is like,</v>

2413
01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like,</v>

2414
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.313
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2415
01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and I always feel like a lot of these mechanisms,</v>

2416
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.000
<v Speaker 1>title shots,</v>

2417
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:10.721
<v Speaker 1>rankings,</v>

2418
01:15:10.721 --> 01:15:11.554
<v Speaker 1>belts,</v>

2419
01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:12.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2420
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:12.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2421
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:13.384
<v Speaker 1>Twitter beefs.</v>

2422
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:18.390
<v Speaker 1>They weren't intended to be there as a short term solution to give people a</v>

2423
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:21.220
<v Speaker 1>talking point until they saw how,</v>

2424
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.380
<v Speaker 1>till they got deeply invested in connected.</v>

2425
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.651
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2426
01:15:23.651 --> 01:15:24.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was,</v>

2427
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:29.790
<v Speaker 1>but yet somehow these sort of extra outside distractions became the focus.</v>

2428
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck cares?</v>

2429
01:15:32.051 --> 01:15:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Who's the number eight guy?</v>

2430
01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And who cares if these guys are mad at each other on Twitter and the belt itself</v>

2431
01:15:38.321 --> 01:15:39.910
<v Speaker 1>as a mechanism for discussion.</v>

2432
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.350
<v Speaker 1>What matters is the fight.</v>

2433
01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:41.750
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2434
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.300
<v Speaker 1>and I know that it's like,</v>

2435
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:43.961
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2436
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:47.200
<v Speaker 1>but you're obsessed with fighting most people,</v>

2437
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:50.890
<v Speaker 1>if you show them what's really going on there and contextualize the fact that</v>

2438
01:15:50.891 --> 01:15:54.310
<v Speaker 1>these two human beings have dedicated their life and take an all of the</v>

2439
01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:57.820
<v Speaker 1>knowledge in human history to put on the line in this moment of,</v>

2440
01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.490
<v Speaker 1>of severe intensity and consequence,</v>

2441
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:04.570
<v Speaker 1>he won't care as much about whether somebody has an interim title,</v>

2442
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:05.583
<v Speaker 1>you won't know</v>

2443
01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:06.960
<v Speaker 3>you won't and you won't.</v>

2444
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.700
<v Speaker 3>But the average Joe blow by a paper view once a year is going to care.</v>

2445
01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.133
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2446
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2447
01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the idea behind stripping Tony Ferguson.</v>

2448
01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2449
01:16:16.650 --> 01:16:17.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2450
01:16:17.071 --> 01:16:17.400
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

2451
01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:17.971
<v Speaker 3>why strip?</v>

2452
01:16:17.971 --> 01:16:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm why,</v>

2453
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.141
<v Speaker 3>why takeaways?</v>

2454
01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:19.801
<v Speaker 3>Interim title,</v>

2455
01:16:19.801 --> 01:16:20.940
<v Speaker 3>let them keep the interim title.</v>

2456
01:16:20.941 --> 01:16:21.960
<v Speaker 3>If you want to strip Connor,</v>

2457
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:23.180
<v Speaker 3>just strip Connor,</v>

2458
01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:24.031
<v Speaker 3>that's trip Connor.</v>

2459
01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:26.220
<v Speaker 3>And then Tony's obviously going to go through surgery.</v>

2460
01:16:26.221 --> 01:16:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Tony didn't do anything wrong.</v>

2461
01:16:27.271 --> 01:16:28.260
<v Speaker 3>He fell and hurt himself.</v>

2462
01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:33.110
<v Speaker 1>But I think at the root of it is the filicides is an incorrect philosophical</v>

2463
01:16:33.111 --> 01:16:33.560
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

2464
01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.393
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>

2465
01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:38.330
<v Speaker 1>if I talked to people at the UFC and I talked to them periodically,</v>

2466
01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:39.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2467
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:42.620
<v Speaker 1>and I'll discuss something with them about,</v>

2468
01:16:42.621 --> 01:16:43.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2469
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:45.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's generally at different times been like,</v>

2470
01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:45.830
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2471
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:48.590
<v Speaker 1>you can see the work that I'm doing and you can see people like it,</v>

2472
01:16:48.591 --> 01:16:52.910
<v Speaker 1>could I contribute something x or y and then I'll mention,</v>

2473
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2474
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.040
<v Speaker 1>they will then say,</v>

2475
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.341
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2476
01:16:55.341 --> 01:16:56.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2477
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:59.180
<v Speaker 1>you've got like a really unique way of approaching it.</v>

2478
01:16:59.181 --> 01:16:59.620
<v Speaker 1>We think,</v>

2479
01:16:59.620 --> 01:16:59.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2480
01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:02.120
<v Speaker 1>we got so many casual fans watching on,</v>

2481
01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:05.260
<v Speaker 1>on Fox or on these TV stations.</v>

2482
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:07.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a casual audience.</v>

2483
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:08.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think about it,</v>

2484
01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like nobody questions at the,</v>

2485
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:15.590
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of people that are a casual fan that is watching anything is very</v>

2486
01:17:15.591 --> 01:17:16.550
<v Speaker 1>close to zero.</v>

2487
01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Very close to zero.</v>

2488
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2489
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Because the casual,</v>

2490
01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:20.761
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2491
01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:25.761
<v Speaker 1>the not actively choosing what to watch is being on a Netflix search or is</v>

2492
01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 1>somebody puts something on and I go in and see what the rock is cooking in his</v>

2493
01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:31.184
<v Speaker 1>kitchen,</v>

2494
01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:31.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2495
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:31.780
<v Speaker 1>or I said,</v>

2496
01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.950
<v Speaker 1>what's your dog's name and the Gold Dog Marshall.</v>

2497
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I go and see what fucking Joe is feeding Marshall.</v>

2498
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's watching something they're not interested in ever in our society,</v>

2499
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:42.190
<v Speaker 1>we are all conscious,</v>

2500
01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2501
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:47.660
<v Speaker 1>constantly and consciously choosing what we consume at all times.</v>

2502
01:17:47.661 --> 01:17:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And if we're sitting there,</v>

2503
01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:51.440
<v Speaker 1>whether our boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife and they're watching it</v>

2504
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:52.820
<v Speaker 1>were somewhere else,</v>

2505
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:57.970
<v Speaker 1>by feeding this nonexistent casual audience and really believing they exist</v>

2506
01:17:58.071 --> 01:18:00.560
<v Speaker 1>despite all the evidence that there was no such thing,</v>

2507
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you are now giving less,</v>

2508
01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:03.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2509
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:04.760
<v Speaker 1>importance to the,</v>

2510
01:18:04.761 --> 01:18:07.370
<v Speaker 1>your actual audience who is ready to go deeper,</v>

2511
01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 1>ready to see something more meaningful,</v>

2512
01:18:09.141 --> 01:18:10.790
<v Speaker 1>ready to be brought somewhere different.</v>

2513
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 1>There is no casual audience of almost anything in our modern world.</v>

2514
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:17.450
<v Speaker 3>I like what you're saying,</v>

2515
01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.080
<v Speaker 3>but I disagree because people are watching and they don't know what the fuck</v>

2516
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:21.680
<v Speaker 3>they're watching.</v>

2517
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I've done it with people.</v>

2518
01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2519
01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:27.710
<v Speaker 3>I've unfortunately watch fights over friends houses before cause I happened to</v>

2520
01:18:27.711 --> 01:18:28.820
<v Speaker 3>be there and then,</v>

2521
01:18:28.821 --> 01:18:29.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2522
01:18:29.061 --> 01:18:30.470
<v Speaker 3>there'll be people sitting around watching a,</v>

2523
01:18:30.471 --> 01:18:31.610
<v Speaker 3>why doesn't he just do this?</v>

2524
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 3>But they still chose to watch it.</v>

2525
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:35.360
<v Speaker 3>They still may not pay attention,</v>

2526
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:36.470
<v Speaker 3>but they made that choice.</v>

2527
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Let's say they're barely paying attention,</v>

2528
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.720
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what the fuck they're watching.</v>

2529
01:18:39.730 --> 01:18:44.180
<v Speaker 3>So a guy like you comes in talking about artistry and all this and they,</v>

2530
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I think you are great.</v>

2531
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I love your approach,</v>

2532
01:18:48.261 --> 01:18:53.261
<v Speaker 3>but I think your approach in their eyes is a little bit too esoteric and complex</v>

2533
01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.420
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it'd be balanced out better with someone like me.</v>

2534
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2536
01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:58.933
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I mean?</v>

2537
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:02.840
<v Speaker 1>100% and as a result we're not over,</v>

2538
01:19:02.841 --> 01:19:05.720
<v Speaker 1>especially the last sort of year or so I've looked at it like,</v>

2539
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2540
01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.260
<v Speaker 1>trying to force something like I'm not,</v>

2541
01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sort of happily saying that I would be,</v>

2542
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I would be in a relationship with you and accept what you are.</v>

2543
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:21.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I think we should be in a relationship only I want to change you and</v>

2544
01:19:21.531 --> 01:19:22.364
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

2545
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:22.831
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2546
01:19:22.831 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2547
01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally saying,</v>

2548
01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying put a role here.</v>

2549
01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what that role you need and I'll do it.</v>

2550
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually saying I think it should be different and that's why it's not a</v>

2551
01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:33.411
<v Speaker 1>good fit.</v>

2552
01:19:33.411 --> 01:19:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I say a one championship is a more logical fit for me because</v>

2553
01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:40.250
<v Speaker 1>it's younger and it's in its evolution,</v>

2554
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.650
<v Speaker 1>but still growing</v>

2555
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.880
<v Speaker 3>think I agree with you,</v>

2556
01:19:43.881 --> 01:19:47.060
<v Speaker 3>but I think it goes back to the money cause I think there's so much money</v>

2557
01:19:47.061 --> 01:19:50.000
<v Speaker 3>involved in the UFC that they have to make money every month.</v>

2558
01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:50.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2559
01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:50.800
<v Speaker 3>it's there,</v>

2560
01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.820
<v Speaker 3>it's there in a tricky situation.</v>

2561
01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:53.893
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2562
01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:58.940
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a guy and you make 500 bucks a week and you really like this car,</v>

2563
01:19:58.941 --> 01:20:00.410
<v Speaker 3>God damn that corvette is so nice.</v>

2564
01:20:00.411 --> 01:20:00.951
<v Speaker 3>I really like it.</v>

2565
01:20:00.951 --> 01:20:01.041
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2566
01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:01.861
<v Speaker 3>how much is the lease?</v>

2567
01:20:01.861 --> 01:20:03.830
<v Speaker 3>The lease is $1,000 a month,</v>

2568
01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:05.270
<v Speaker 3>but you only make $2,000 a month.</v>

2569
01:20:05.271 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to do that while if I only pay 500 bucks a month in rent,</v>

2570
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.720
<v Speaker 3>I can kind of pull it off.</v>

2571
01:20:09.970 --> 01:20:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2572
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.951
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

2573
01:20:10.951 --> 01:20:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I guess he can,</v>

2574
01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:16.410
<v Speaker 3>but you got to watch every penny and you gotta be cautious and I think you could</v>

2575
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:20.220
<v Speaker 3>put yourself in these traps and then you have to like really micromanage</v>

2576
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:20.910
<v Speaker 3>everything you do.</v>

2577
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Like we've got to make money but we got to make money,</v>

2578
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:27.590
<v Speaker 3>but we got to make money instead of we got to do what we like and put together</v>

2579
01:20:28.861 --> 01:20:32.520
<v Speaker 3>what we like and do the best possible version of what we like.</v>

2580
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Like a perfect example is like this podcast.</v>

2581
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a boss.</v>

2582
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:38.940
<v Speaker 3>There's no overhead.</v>

2583
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:39.833
<v Speaker 3>I don't have,</v>

2584
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:41.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have a couple employees.</v>

2585
01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:42.540
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy.</v>

2586
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:43.740
<v Speaker 3>There's no worries,</v>

2587
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:48.890
<v Speaker 3>so I don't give a fuck if I have you on to talk about stuff or a leap expert or</v>

2588
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to have anybody on that.</v>

2589
01:20:51.581 --> 01:20:51.841
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2590
01:20:51.841 --> 01:20:54.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in talking to because,</v>

2591
01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 3>and I'll talk about whatever the fuck I want to.</v>

2592
01:20:56.071 --> 01:20:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2593
01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:57.101
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

2594
01:20:57.101 --> 01:20:57.311
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2595
01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2596
01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if people are going to be interested in this.</v>

2597
01:20:59.551 --> 01:21:01.050
<v Speaker 3>I need that advertising money.</v>

2598
01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.750
<v Speaker 3>I need to say if you,</v>

2599
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:04.230
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>

2600
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:07.020
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one of the reasons why the show has been successful because it</v>

2601
01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:09.660
<v Speaker 3>honestly represents my thinking.</v>

2602
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:14.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like I am allowed to pursue my interests and have these conversations and</v>

2603
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 3>let it be pure.</v>

2604
01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.110
<v Speaker 3>I think if the UFC took that exact approach,</v>

2605
01:21:19.111 --> 01:21:20.700
<v Speaker 3>I think the product would be better.</v>

2606
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:25.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think if they had someone like you breaking down the artistry of specific</v>

2607
01:21:25.951 --> 01:21:26.784
<v Speaker 3>techniques,</v>

2608
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:31.880
<v Speaker 3>the air quote casual fan would be more educated and they would learn more about</v>

2609
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:32.731
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2610
01:21:32.731 --> 01:21:33.001
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2611
01:21:33.001 --> 01:21:37.290
<v Speaker 3>and you get some of that from Dominick Cruz when he does his breakdowns on Fox</v>

2612
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.330
<v Speaker 3>and some of the other fighters who do breakdowns.</v>

2613
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2614
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.660
<v Speaker 3>when Daniel Cormier AA does wrestling breakdowns,</v>

2615
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 3>breakdowns,</v>

2616
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:47.850
<v Speaker 3>specific techniques of why they work and why they don't work and what someone's</v>

2617
01:21:47.851 --> 01:21:48.061
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

2618
01:21:48.061 --> 01:21:48.894
<v Speaker 3>right or wrong,</v>

2619
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:50.190
<v Speaker 3>you get educated,</v>

2620
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2621
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:53.440
<v Speaker 3>and I tried to do the best I can to when it comes to the ground in particular,</v>

2622
01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:57.270
<v Speaker 3>which is what I think is the most confusing aspect of MMA for the casual fan.</v>

2623
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:58.200
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2624
01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:58.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2625
01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:03.480
<v Speaker 3>I think we should approach the f the entire sport in the,</v>

2626
01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:03.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2627
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:06.960
<v Speaker 3>the most illuminating way possible.</v>

2628
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Speaker 3>And I think a guy like you and your approach is very valuable.</v>

2629
01:22:10.261 --> 01:22:11.790
<v Speaker 3>And I love your breakdowns.</v>

2630
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:12.331
<v Speaker 3>Thanks man.</v>

2631
01:22:12.331 --> 01:22:13.161
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of him.</v>

2632
01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:14.820
<v Speaker 3>It's why retweet him all the time.</v>

2633
01:22:14.821 --> 01:22:19.821
<v Speaker 3>I just think that you have a a very unique and passionate and it not just</v>

2634
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.950
<v Speaker 3>passionate approach but it's genuine.</v>

2635
01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Like I know you,</v>

2636
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.260
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to you when the cameras are not on and you are just as interested in</v>

2637
01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:28.860
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2638
01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:29.693
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>

2639
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're just going through,</v>

2640
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.120
<v Speaker 1>thank you by the way man.</v>

2641
01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I think where we're going through whatever you're doing,</v>

2642
01:22:36.511 --> 01:22:40.200
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to seek some kind of mastery and if you realize you're really</v>

2643
01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:41.010
<v Speaker 1>early in it,</v>

2644
01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you can do it by studying yoga.</v>

2645
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.501
<v Speaker 1>Some people do,</v>

2646
01:22:43.501 --> 01:22:44.221
<v Speaker 1>some people do it.</v>

2647
01:22:44.221 --> 01:22:44.471
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2648
01:22:44.471 --> 01:22:45.120
<v Speaker 1>they're in,</v>

2649
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.310
<v Speaker 1>they go to church twice a week.</v>

2650
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.260
<v Speaker 1>You're just looking to try to grow.</v>

2651
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And if you do it with something that you're deeply fascinated and eventually you</v>

2652
01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:55.890
<v Speaker 1>kind of learn about connections and all things,</v>

2653
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:56.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2654
01:22:56.161 --> 01:23:00.360
<v Speaker 1>it's the study of martial arts or the study of Yoga or the study of jazz or</v>

2655
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever teaches you about connections in all things.</v>

2656
01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.590
<v Speaker 1>And my life is so fucking good.</v>

2657
01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:05.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2658
01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.390
<v Speaker 1>and these little moments where I'm like,</v>

2659
01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why these guys,</v>

2660
01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:09.483
<v Speaker 1>I don't work for them.</v>

2661
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

2662
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense for me to think that because I get up in the morning</v>

2663
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.641
<v Speaker 1>and I sit in my car,</v>

2664
01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I make my wife and I coffee and I sit in my kitchen and I fucking analyze</v>

2665
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:20.710
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

2666
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I sit down and I look at it and I look for moments and I look for things.</v>

2667
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I think people will find fascinating.</v>

2668
01:23:26.891 --> 01:23:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I look for things that'll teach us something about life and I look for these and</v>

2669
01:23:30.371 --> 01:23:31.204
<v Speaker 1>I'm make them.</v>

2670
01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:31.931
<v Speaker 1>Then when I make them,</v>

2671
01:23:31.931 --> 01:23:36.280
<v Speaker 1>people seem to like them and then that gets me jobs commentating where I fly off</v>

2672
01:23:36.281 --> 01:23:36.790
<v Speaker 1>and I get to,</v>

2673
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got it so fucking gun to try to square peg my way into a large</v>

2674
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 1>corporation because years back I dreamed about working there.</v>

2675
01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you change your dream,</v>

2676
01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:52.420
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's okay to change your route and find the world changes.</v>

2677
01:23:52.421 --> 01:23:53.254
<v Speaker 1>Constantly</v>

2678
01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.170
<v Speaker 4>be afraid to be flexible and you know the,</v>

2679
01:23:56.180 --> 01:24:00.990
<v Speaker 4>the idea of holding onto a dream for your entire life despite your interest is</v>

2680
01:24:00.991 --> 01:24:02.010
<v Speaker 4>pretty ridiculous.</v>

2681
01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:02.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:04.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's things that I wanted to do when I was younger.</v>

2683
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:05.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do anymore.</v>

2684
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:06.420
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

2685
01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:06.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2686
01:24:06.721 --> 01:24:08.970
<v Speaker 4>you should follow your interest period.</v>

2687
01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:09.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2688
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2689
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:12.720
<v Speaker 4>And if they change your change as you change and grow.</v>

2690
01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:14.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean these,</v>

2691
01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:18.540
<v Speaker 4>like I talked about my waning love for talk one doe when I realized that it</v>

2692
01:24:18.541 --> 01:24:20.250
<v Speaker 4>wasn't really the right way to go.</v>

2693
01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.810
<v Speaker 4>Well when I first started doing it,</v>

2694
01:24:21.811 --> 01:24:23.490
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was the most effective martial art.</v>

2695
01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Once I realized it wasn't,</v>

2696
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:26.430
<v Speaker 4>I lost interest,</v>

2697
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.380
<v Speaker 4>I lost interest in competing in it.</v>

2698
01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:28.801
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2699
01:24:28.801 --> 01:24:30.960
<v Speaker 4>it didn't seem like the thing to do anymore.</v>

2700
01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:34.650
<v Speaker 4>And I think that as you grow as a human being,</v>

2701
01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:35.250
<v Speaker 4>you're in,</v>

2702
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.380
<v Speaker 4>you should have other interests.</v>

2703
01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:38.101
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2704
01:24:38.101 --> 01:24:42.300
<v Speaker 4>and I think the ones that are the most intriguing in the most passionate,</v>

2705
01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:43.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2706
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.400
<v Speaker 4>are you the,</v>

2707
01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:43.741
<v Speaker 4>you're the,</v>

2708
01:24:43.741 --> 01:24:45.690
<v Speaker 4>you're the most passionate of theirs.</v>

2709
01:24:45.691 --> 01:24:48.930
<v Speaker 4>They're going to give you the most reward if you pursue them.</v>

2710
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.940
<v Speaker 4>If you're more passionate about music,</v>

2711
01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.620
<v Speaker 4>then you are about accounting.</v>

2712
01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:56.190
<v Speaker 4>But you decided to stick with accounting because it's what's paying your bills</v>

2713
01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:56.760
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

2714
01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.001
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2715
01:24:57.001 --> 01:24:57.900
<v Speaker 4>that's a dark road.</v>

2716
01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.730
<v Speaker 4>That's a soul suck and road.</v>

2717
01:24:59.731 --> 01:25:00.071
<v Speaker 4>You're going to go,</v>

2718
01:25:00.071 --> 01:25:00.150
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2719
01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:00.710
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2720
01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Sit,</v>

2721
01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:06.080
<v Speaker 1>it feels scary in for somebody in that setting to change because in the short</v>

2722
01:25:06.511 --> 01:25:07.530
<v Speaker 1>run it will be painful.</v>

2723
01:25:07.531 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 1>But in the long run it will be so valuable and less painful.</v>

2724
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2726
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2727
01:25:12.630 --> 01:25:17.520
<v Speaker 1>20 years have way less pain is such a great trade for two years of pain.</v>

2728
01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.980
<v Speaker 4>But if you're that guy with that corvette that you got that lease on and you</v>

2729
01:25:20.981 --> 01:25:22.810
<v Speaker 4>could barely fucking make those payments,</v>

2730
01:25:22.811 --> 01:25:25.420
<v Speaker 4>you can not take any chances.</v>

2731
01:25:25.421 --> 01:25:27.490
<v Speaker 4>You have to just work those extra hours.</v>

2732
01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:27.611
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2733
01:25:27.611 --> 01:25:30.190
<v Speaker 4>if I just put in two hours of overtime every day,</v>

2734
01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:32.050
<v Speaker 4>that's still only 10 hours of work a day.</v>

2735
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.600
<v Speaker 4>But that was two hours at 20 bucks an hour and a little out.</v>

2736
01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 4>We started doing those calculations.</v>

2737
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:36.760
<v Speaker 4>And that's how you,</v>

2738
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.750
<v Speaker 4>that's how you get fucked.</v>

2739
01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.340
<v Speaker 4>And that's how you get trapped.</v>

2740
01:25:39.341 --> 01:25:40.210
<v Speaker 4>And next thing you know,</v>

2741
01:25:40.211 --> 01:25:43.550
<v Speaker 4>you've got a family and you've got kids and you definitely can't move and you</v>

2742
01:25:43.551 --> 01:25:46.210
<v Speaker 4>got a mortgage and you definitely ain't pursuing any music dreams.</v>

2743
01:25:46.211 --> 01:25:46.430
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2744
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:47.050
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker,</v>

2745
01:25:47.050 --> 01:25:47.530
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

2746
01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:48.221
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>

2747
01:25:48.221 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 4>this is the trap that life leads.</v>

2748
01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2749
01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:51.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2750
01:25:51.031 --> 01:25:51.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2751
01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>

2752
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:54.090
<v Speaker 1>so I do a one man show now.</v>

2753
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So I built where the friend,</v>

2754
01:25:55.501 --> 01:25:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I built a one man show.</v>

2755
01:25:56.881 --> 01:25:57.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2756
01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:57.401
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2757
01:25:57.401 --> 01:25:58.560
<v Speaker 1>we're going to theater setting,</v>

2758
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2759
01:25:58.771 --> 01:25:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2760
01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you do that?</v>

2761
01:26:00.451 --> 01:26:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you use video?</v>

2762
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:03.090
<v Speaker 1>How it is for,</v>

2763
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:05.460
<v Speaker 1>we put it for um,</v>

2764
01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.590
<v Speaker 1>drunk tedtalks right.</v>

2765
01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's four story driven parts of life that uh,</v>

2766
01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:16.340
<v Speaker 1>take you on a bit of an in theory and in practice.</v>

2767
01:26:16.341 --> 01:26:18.860
<v Speaker 1>So far people seem to be inspired or find it,</v>

2768
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:19.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2769
01:26:19.491 --> 01:26:20.121
<v Speaker 1>compelling.</v>

2770
01:26:20.121 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And people have cried Adam them before,</v>

2771
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:22.940
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite moving.</v>

2772
01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:24.620
<v Speaker 1>But I go to a dog gate,</v>

2773
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>they may be shit especially.</v>

2774
01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2775
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2776
01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:28.483
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2777
01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2778
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I did it with,</v>

2779
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 1>so I decided I wanted to do that.</v>

2780
01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I decided I want to get up and tell stories and hopefully a fun,</v>

2781
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:38.320
<v Speaker 1>entertain people or find them,</v>

2782
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 1>inspire them or take them somewhere.</v>

2783
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>

2784
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Partly I watched your show and then that would have never in a million years.</v>

2785
01:26:46.651 --> 01:26:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So when I saw you in Vegas would never in a million years thought I could do</v>

2786
01:26:49.311 --> 01:26:53.750
<v Speaker 1>that because it's clearly a lifetime of training and development and improvement</v>

2787
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and trial and error and thousands and thousands of repetitions.</v>

2788
01:26:57.081 --> 01:27:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And you look at that and you don't look at an Olympic gymnast and say I can do</v>

2789
01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:01.941
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2790
01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:02.591
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of,</v>

2791
01:27:02.591 --> 01:27:03.740
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't think of it at all.</v>

2792
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.780
<v Speaker 1>But then I saw Brendan do his show and it was awesome and I realized he only</v>

2793
01:27:08.781 --> 01:27:10.190
<v Speaker 1>started working on this two years ago.</v>

2794
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:11.030
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2795
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:13.310
<v Speaker 1>And all he represents is hard,</v>

2796
01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:14.210
<v Speaker 1>hard work,</v>

2797
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.000
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and drive to learn.</v>

2798
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:18.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's possible.</v>

2799
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2800
01:27:18.981 --> 01:27:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Which shop is doing is what I said to him as you are essentially using an</v>

2801
01:27:23.901 --> 01:27:27.290
<v Speaker 3>athlete's work ethic and applying it to an art form.</v>

2802
01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:28.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's awesome about him.</v>

2803
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 3>He's a funny guy who realize like,</v>

2804
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:33.050
<v Speaker 3>I can do standup,</v>

2805
01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.450
<v Speaker 3>I just need to put the time in and you know,</v>

2806
01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that guy kill,</v>

2807
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean kill.</v>

2808
01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:39.220
<v Speaker 3>And he's been doing comedy for like two years,</v>

2809
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2810
01:27:40.090 --> 01:27:40.390
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

2811
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:41.223
<v Speaker 1>is inspiring.</v>

2812
01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:42.290
<v Speaker 1>That should in,</v>

2813
01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you should be aware when you see that,</v>

2814
01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:47.920
<v Speaker 1>that that means something you work on for only a couple of years as possible,</v>

2815
01:27:47.921 --> 01:27:49.360
<v Speaker 1>if you're driven and smart and,</v>

2816
01:27:49.361 --> 01:27:50.500
<v Speaker 1>and really committed.</v>

2817
01:27:50.501 --> 01:27:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I took out of his shell.</v>

2818
01:27:51.671 --> 01:27:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Plus he explained to me the process.</v>

2819
01:27:53.530 --> 01:27:55.150
<v Speaker 1>So I decided I'm doing it right.</v>

2820
01:27:55.151 --> 01:27:58.960
<v Speaker 1>So I booked about five months ahead in Winnipeg because there was a UFC in</v>

2821
01:27:58.961 --> 01:28:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Winnipeg and that's my hometown to do a small theater.</v>

2822
01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:01.931
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2823
01:28:01.931 --> 01:28:02.171
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2824
01:28:02.171 --> 01:28:03.004
<v Speaker 1>five months.</v>

2825
01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:03.521
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2826
01:28:03.521 --> 01:28:04.720
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do I do?</v>

2827
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So I called up a good friend of mine gray.</v>

2828
01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm just you,</v>

2829
01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:08.111
<v Speaker 1>when you booked it,</v>

2830
01:28:08.111 --> 01:28:09.250
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have to have a show.</v>

2831
01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:10.923
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the shell.</v>

2832
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Maybe months yourself.</v>

2833
01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2834
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.721
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2835
01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 1>and I cut,</v>

2836
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.450
<v Speaker 1>but I had one plan that was going to call up.</v>

2837
01:28:16.451 --> 01:28:19.510
<v Speaker 1>My friend Graham is the door who is a playwright and um,</v>

2838
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.270
<v Speaker 1>and a writer for vice and a bunch of other stuff and uh,</v>

2839
01:28:22.271 --> 01:28:24.790
<v Speaker 1>and very smart and interesting and we're good friends,</v>

2840
01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.320
<v Speaker 1>but we have very different perspectives.</v>

2841
01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:26.950
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2842
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:27.671
<v Speaker 1>I booked this show.</v>

2843
01:28:27.671 --> 01:28:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It's in six months.</v>

2844
01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I need 40 minutes.</v>

2845
01:28:29.921 --> 01:28:30.790
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be eye.</v>

2846
01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.450
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

2847
01:28:31.450 --> 01:28:36.010
<v Speaker 1>he has told some of my stories and vice before getting drunk with sumo wrestlers</v>

2848
01:28:36.011 --> 01:28:36.821
<v Speaker 1>and different,</v>

2849
01:28:36.821 --> 01:28:37.571
<v Speaker 1>different stories.</v>

2850
01:28:37.571 --> 01:28:37.981
<v Speaker 1>And so he's,</v>

2851
01:28:37.981 --> 01:28:38.814
<v Speaker 1>how much do you weigh?</v>

2852
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:42.790
<v Speaker 1>A one 56 and you got drunk with sumo wrestler?</v>

2853
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Scary.</v>

2854
01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:43.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2855
01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:44.140
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>

2856
01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.160
<v Speaker 1>It was really like,</v>

2857
01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.960
<v Speaker 1>it was joyous.</v>

2858
01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:47.711
<v Speaker 1>Like it was,</v>

2859
01:28:47.711 --> 01:28:50.950
<v Speaker 1>you've never seen anything like this became big though.</v>

2860
01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2861
01:28:51.370 --> 01:28:51.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2862
01:28:51.581 --> 01:28:52.211
<v Speaker 1>you should see it.</v>

2863
01:28:52.211 --> 01:28:54.240
<v Speaker 1>So Byamba do you know who'd be is?</v>

2864
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:54.821

01:28:54.821 --> 01:28:55.061
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2866
01:28:55.061 --> 01:28:58.090
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever see us Sumal on TV that's beyond.</v>

2867
01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:03.240
<v Speaker 1>So he's the guy like in the Geico commercial do I being a figure skater,</v>

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:06.210
<v Speaker 1>And he is a genius.</v>

2870
01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:07.021
<v Speaker 1>He's a world champion,</v>

2871
01:29:07.021 --> 01:29:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but he's also an entertainer.</v>

2872
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:11.070
<v Speaker 1>So he lives in Hollywood and he's very,</v>

2873
01:29:11.071 --> 01:29:12.210
<v Speaker 1>very blips here.</v>

2874
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2875
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:13.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2876
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:14.680
<v Speaker 1>He is sumo Russell's,</v>

2877
01:29:14.710 --> 01:29:14.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2878
01:29:14.871 --> 01:29:15.704
<v Speaker 1>there he is.</v>

2879
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2880
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:18.090
<v Speaker 1>he is from Mongolia.</v>

2881
01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:22.950
<v Speaker 1>But he spends a great deal of time here working as a television personality and</v>

2882
01:29:22.951 --> 01:29:24.450
<v Speaker 1>an actor and whatever.</v>

2883
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:26.070
<v Speaker 1>But he's still just look fat.</v>

2884
01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:26.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2885
01:29:26.491 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 1>he's got it looks jacked.</v>

2886
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Like go to that one where he's doing that muscle pose.</v>

2887
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry there.</v>

2888
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2889
01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2890
01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.680
<v Speaker 1>See that's like those shoulder muscles through all that fat.</v>

2891
01:29:34.710 --> 01:29:35.970
<v Speaker 1>That guy looks like a tank.</v>

2892
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:36.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2893
01:29:36.211 --> 01:29:37.050
<v Speaker 1>people don't realize,</v>

2894
01:29:37.051 --> 01:29:41.550
<v Speaker 1>but underneath there is like you or underneath there is like Tj Dillashaw.</v>

2895
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:42.151
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2896
01:29:42.151 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 1>There is muscular person underneath all those additional layers of fat and</v>

2897
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:47.720
<v Speaker 1>fleshing skin.</v>

2898
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:48.320
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

2899
01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 1>there was a powerful athlete,</v>

2900
01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:52.200
<v Speaker 1>a real benefit and being not fat.</v>

2901
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2902
01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:53.581
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2903
01:29:53.581 --> 01:29:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Force power generation like momentum,</v>

2904
01:29:56.401 --> 01:29:57.120
<v Speaker 1>the ability,</v>

2905
01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2906
01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:02.190
<v Speaker 1>if the other guy is that big and our goal is just to smash into each other until</v>

2907
01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:03.780
<v Speaker 1>one of us has taken from the platform,</v>

2908
01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:04.050
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2909
01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:05.040
<v Speaker 1>You're not that big,</v>

2910
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be very difficult.</v>

2911
01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2912
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:11.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's like an arms race of size over generations where they just got bigger</v>

2913
01:30:11.671 --> 01:30:12.810
<v Speaker 1>and bigger out of necessity.</v>

2914
01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're bigger,</v>

2915
01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:14.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2916
01:30:14.401 --> 01:30:15.234
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

2917
01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:16.383
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2918
01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.660
<v Speaker 1>we could in theory,</v>

2919
01:30:18.661 --> 01:30:20.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could use your size against your,</v>

2920
01:30:20.911 --> 01:30:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I could use technique and strategy and smarts to take you off,</v>

2921
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:28.130
<v Speaker 1>but I could be big and also to that,</v>

2922
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.710
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2923
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:28.920
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2924
01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.630
<v Speaker 1>So why not v also big.</v>

2925
01:30:30.631 --> 01:30:31.130
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

2926
01:30:31.130 --> 01:30:34.440
<v Speaker 1>it arms raised to that point and there are little guys,</v>

2927
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:35.783
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2928
01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:37.770
<v Speaker 1>but to watch this guy that's with them,</v>

2929
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:38.890
<v Speaker 1>then he got killed.</v>

2930
01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:40.230
<v Speaker 1>He was an impractical jokers.</v>

2931
01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:42.331
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2932
01:30:42.331 --> 01:30:46.200
<v Speaker 1>beyond that is like he's the most famous sumo guy in the world and I got wasted</v>

2933
01:30:46.201 --> 01:30:49.080
<v Speaker 1>with him at the world combat games and Saint Petersburg,</v>

2934
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>

2935
01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:51.390
<v Speaker 1>So I got to commentate it.</v>

2936
01:30:51.570 --> 01:30:51.871
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2937
01:30:51.871 --> 01:30:55.980
<v Speaker 1>So I was in Saint Petersburg and I absolutely love,</v>

2938
01:30:55.981 --> 01:31:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I've found a niche where I get to commentate like real traditional martial arts,</v>

2939
01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:03.930
<v Speaker 1>a fair bit of done taekwondo and karate at the Pan Am Games.</v>

2940
01:31:03.931 --> 01:31:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And I did the world so much championships or the world combat games.</v>

2941
01:31:07.531 --> 01:31:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I do the World Woo Shu Championships,</v>

2942
01:31:09.211 --> 01:31:11.070
<v Speaker 1>which is Kung Fu and Sanda.</v>

2943
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:15.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I've carved out this niche where I get called for these and develop</v>

2944
01:31:15.661 --> 01:31:18.600
<v Speaker 1>expertise in these different areas and get to experience them.</v>

2945
01:31:18.601 --> 01:31:21.330
<v Speaker 1>And see the little details that change when you change something.</v>

2946
01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And so I got to commentate sumo and then after he seemed to like me and he's</v>

2947
01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:26.370
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>

2948
01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:31.340
<v Speaker 1>you were drink and it was something that like,</v>

2949
01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:36.390
<v Speaker 1>it's he drink vodka while you were in Russia to Russia.</v>

2950
01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:37.620
<v Speaker 1>So I love Russia.</v>

2951
01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2952
01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.433
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2953
01:31:39.570 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I love the Russians.</v>

2954
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I love that our view of combat and of artists,</v>

2955
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:46.230
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and and stuff,</v>

2956
01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:48.000
<v Speaker 1>they're very straight.</v>

2957
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2958
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2959
01:31:48.781 --> 01:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>when you negotiate to commentate or to do some work that just straight,</v>

2960
01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.580
<v Speaker 1>this is what we can pay you.</v>

2961
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.200
<v Speaker 1>This is what we expect of you.</v>

2962
01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.191
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

2963
01:31:56.191 --> 01:31:57.090
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to be happy.</v>

2964
01:31:57.091 --> 01:31:57.924
<v Speaker 1>Like it's very,</v>

2965
01:31:58.270 --> 01:31:59.410
<v Speaker 1>very little bullshit.</v>

2966
01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2967
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Frank Mir does commentary for them over there,</v>

2968
01:32:01.721 --> 01:32:01.871

<v Speaker 4>Frank Mir,</v>

2974
01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:07.690
<v Speaker 4>I would hope that someone would hire him in America.</v>

2975
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:11.970
<v Speaker 1>They can't afford them because I wasn't getting paid way too well in Russia.</v>

2976
01:32:11.971 --> 01:32:12.480
<v Speaker 1>In Russia.</v>

2977
01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:12.811
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2978
01:32:12.811 --> 01:32:13.500
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

2979
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2980
01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.280
<v Speaker 1>For him.</v>

2981
01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.810
<v Speaker 1>He said that's why he couldn't do a deal with [inaudible]</v>

2982
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:19.770
<v Speaker 1>and his deal with ACB,</v>

2983
01:32:19.771 --> 01:32:20.980
<v Speaker 1>who he loves and respects things,</v>

2984
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:23.190
<v Speaker 1>become sort of partners in there with uh,</v>

2985
01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:23.770
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2986
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:23.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2987
01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Mr [inaudible] who runs it,</v>

2988
01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:29.580
<v Speaker 1>where frank is now a part partner of the presentation of it.</v>

2989
01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Went for American shows.</v>

2990
01:32:31.081 --> 01:32:31.770
<v Speaker 1>He'll be part,</v>

2991
01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:33.360
<v Speaker 1>he'll be part promoter.</v>

2992
01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think Frank May even get away from some of the commentary.</v>

2993
01:32:36.601 --> 01:32:38.130
<v Speaker 1>As much as he's good at it and loves it.</v>

2994
01:32:38.370 --> 01:32:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I think he's interested in some of the other aspects of it now,</v>

2995
01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:42.360
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2996
01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2997
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:43.530
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2998
01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:43.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2999
01:32:43.711 --> 01:32:45.240
<v Speaker 1>they pay very well.</v>

3000
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:47.190
<v Speaker 1>They and they pay the athletes very,</v>

3001
01:32:47.191 --> 01:32:47.790
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

3002
01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:51.860
<v Speaker 1>You can be a guy that had a couple of UFC fights or a belt or a fighter too.</v>

3003
01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:56.130
<v Speaker 1>They'll give you 60,000 us cash in your hand in an envelope at the end of it.</v>

3004
01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3005
01:32:57.230 --> 01:32:57.980
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

3006
01:32:57.980 --> 01:32:58.221
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3007
01:32:58.221 --> 01:33:00.230
<v Speaker 4>it's always great that fighters have more options,</v>

3008
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:00.891
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3009
01:33:00.891 --> 01:33:01.400
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3010
01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:04.850
<v Speaker 4>I know Bella tour has become a viable option to a lot of fighters.</v>

3011
01:33:04.851 --> 01:33:05.151
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3012
01:33:05.151 --> 01:33:08.360
<v Speaker 4>like guys like Ryan Bader or making good money over there now.</v>

3013
01:33:08.361 --> 01:33:08.840
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3014
01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:09.440
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3015
01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.930
<v Speaker 4>Roy McDonald obviously who's the champion now.</v>

3016
01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:13.101
<v Speaker 4>I just think,</v>

3017
01:33:13.101 --> 01:33:13.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3018
01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:14.570
<v Speaker 4>we need more of those.</v>

3019
01:33:14.571 --> 01:33:15.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3020
01:33:15.170 --> 01:33:15.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3021
01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.380
<v Speaker 4>I know that Oscar de la Hoya is getting into the mix now,</v>

3022
01:33:18.381 --> 01:33:20.930
<v Speaker 4>but just the approach that he's making,</v>

3023
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.240
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me to be ridiculous.</v>

3024
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:25.160
<v Speaker 1>The old school promote us approach,</v>

3025
01:33:25.161 --> 01:33:29.690
<v Speaker 1>get some big name and then invest all your time in that big fight.</v>

3026
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.031
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

3027
01:33:30.031 --> 01:33:30.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3028
01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.990
<v Speaker 1>that's the same thing you were just talking about the UFC,</v>

3029
01:33:32.991 --> 01:33:35.840
<v Speaker 1>the challenge they face now is that we need another big one.</v>

3030
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:36.770
<v Speaker 1>We need another big one.</v>

3031
01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.140
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like that</v>

3032
01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:40.011
<v Speaker 4>that approach.</v>

3033
01:33:40.011 --> 01:33:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Like we just,</v>

3034
01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:41.301
<v Speaker 4>we know,</v>

3035
01:33:41.301 --> 01:33:41.631
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3036
01:33:41.631 --> 01:33:42.970
<v Speaker 4>if this wasn't the upper,</v>

3037
01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:44.390
<v Speaker 4>would this be the ideal approach?</v>

3038
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:45.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3039
01:33:45.210 --> 01:33:46.220
<v Speaker 4>it's never the ideal approach.</v>

3040
01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:48.380
<v Speaker 4>The ideal approach is to do the best fights possible.</v>

3041
01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 4>The ideal approach is not necessarily to make the most money or to have the like</v>

3042
01:33:54.951 --> 01:33:56.330
<v Speaker 4>the most spectacular thing.</v>

3043
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3044
01:33:56.830 --> 01:34:01.380
<v Speaker 4>like when they were really promoting Ronda Rousey and the rematch with a,</v>

3045
01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.400
<v Speaker 4>or the fight with Amanda Nunez and didn't promote Nunez at all.</v>

3046
01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:05.413
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

3047
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:06.320
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3048
01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:06.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3049
01:34:06.651 --> 01:34:06.981
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3050
01:34:06.981 --> 01:34:08.990
<v Speaker 4>this is my huge Ronda Rousey fan.</v>

3051
01:34:08.991 --> 01:34:09.824
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knows that.</v>

3052
01:34:10.170 --> 01:34:10.361
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3053
01:34:10.361 --> 01:34:11.270
<v Speaker 4>I think she's a,</v>

3054
01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:12.440
<v Speaker 4>she's a legend.</v>

3055
01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:12.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3056
01:34:12.651 --> 01:34:14.270
<v Speaker 4>what she did for women's MMA,</v>

3057
01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:19.500
<v Speaker 4>she essentially was the reason why the UFC decided to have women's MMA was one</v>

3058
01:34:19.941 --> 01:34:20.390
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>

3059
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's running around and fighting.</v>

3060
01:34:21.861 --> 01:34:22.131
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3061
01:34:22.131 --> 01:34:22.964
<v Speaker 1>I was here that day.</v>

3062
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:23.280
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

3063
01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.980
<v Speaker 4>just passed her by and it happened so quick,</v>

3064
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.760
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3065
01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.190
<v Speaker 4>But Amanda Nunez,</v>

3066
01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:32.100
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking even before Holly Holm Beater,</v>

3067
01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:33.750
<v Speaker 4>Amanda Nunez was the big threat.</v>

3068
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.271
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3069
01:34:34.271 --> 01:34:37.320
<v Speaker 4>that girl could knock you fucking dead with one punch.</v>

3070
01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:41.700
<v Speaker 4>She is such a ruthless striker and she's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt.</v>

3071
01:34:41.701 --> 01:34:41.941
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3072
01:34:41.941 --> 01:34:44.070
<v Speaker 4>this is a terrible matchup for Rhonda.</v>

3073
01:34:44.071 --> 01:34:44.904
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

3074
01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.200
<v Speaker 4>cause Ron does hands,</v>

3075
01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.430
<v Speaker 4>although good,</v>

3076
01:34:47.610 --> 01:34:47.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3077
01:34:47.941 --> 01:34:49.260
<v Speaker 4>and getting better and you know,</v>

3078
01:34:49.261 --> 01:34:52.050
<v Speaker 4>really was starting to look like a polished striker.</v>

3079
01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:57.690
<v Speaker 4>Still doesn't have nearly the kind of power that Nunez has and the ability that</v>

3080
01:34:58.141 --> 01:34:59.930
<v Speaker 4>I could Nunez Nunez is,</v>

3081
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 4>she can take it as well as receive it.</v>

3082
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:06.680
<v Speaker 4>We just seen Rhonda sort of have these blitz moments with like Batchko Hey,</v>

3083
01:35:06.681 --> 01:35:07.011
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3084
01:35:07.011 --> 01:35:07.530
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3085
01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 4>and kind of Sarah Mann bricks just smashed through.</v>

3086
01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Speaker 4>But when you see the overall game like versus Holly Home,</v>

3087
01:35:15.861 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 4>then you've got to see all this.</v>

3088
01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.030
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of limitations here and trying to smash through the bricks if the</v>

3089
01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:22.210
<v Speaker 4>bricks aren't there and the bricks head kick you,</v>

3090
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.971
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3091
01:35:22.971 --> 01:35:23.240
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3092
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.500
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot going on there.</v>

3093
01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:24.851
<v Speaker 4>So we're,</v>

3094
01:35:24.851 --> 01:35:27.570
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing the layers upon layers upon layer.</v>

3095
01:35:27.571 --> 01:35:29.900
<v Speaker 4>So what happens after you get to the first layer?</v>

3096
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:31.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh well you don't have a second layer.</v>

3097
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:32.331
<v Speaker 4>You're your,</v>

3098
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:33.121
<v Speaker 4>this is your layer,</v>

3099
01:35:33.121 --> 01:35:34.370
<v Speaker 4>your layer straight forward,</v>

3100
01:35:34.371 --> 01:35:35.204
<v Speaker 4>move ahead.</v>

3101
01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.440
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3102
01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:37.670
<v Speaker 4>coaching is to blame as well.</v>

3103
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:37.941
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

3104
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:39.440
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things there,</v>

3105
01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:42.740
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that they weren't even promoting Amanda Nunez,</v>

3106
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.600
<v Speaker 4>you have the very first ever openly gay women's MMA champion in the UFC</v>

3107
01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:49.900
<v Speaker 1>era comes out and is interesting aspect</v>

3108
01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:51.300
<v Speaker 4>and she's a fun girl.</v>

3109
01:35:51.301 --> 01:35:52.170
<v Speaker 4>She's interesting,</v>

3110
01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:52.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3111
01:35:52.861 --> 01:35:55.340
<v Speaker 4>and she's a fucking killer man.</v>

3112
01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:56.640
<v Speaker 4>She's a fucking killer.</v>

3113
01:35:56.641 --> 01:35:57.900
<v Speaker 4>And that you showed it in that fight.</v>

3114
01:35:58.050 --> 01:36:00.060
<v Speaker 4>They had an opportunity to make another star.</v>

3115
01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:01.013
<v Speaker 4>Instead,</v>

3116
01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.940
<v Speaker 4>they didn't make this other star.</v>

3117
01:36:02.941 --> 01:36:04.980
<v Speaker 4>And then you look at her most recent paper view,</v>

3118
01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:06.690
<v Speaker 4>I heard the numbers were abysmal.</v>

3119
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.560
<v Speaker 4>Vallely I heard,</v>

3120
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:10.920
<v Speaker 4>see if you can find out what the numbers were because someone told me,</v>

3121
01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:11.780
<v Speaker 4>I think it was shopped,</v>

3122
01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.910
<v Speaker 4>told me there were 85,000 people view by wow.</v>

3123
01:36:15.230 --> 01:36:15.971
<v Speaker 1>Which is scary.</v>

3124
01:36:15.971 --> 01:36:20.971
<v Speaker 1>You should be at this point you have to stop and wonder is there anything we</v>

3125
01:36:21.131 --> 01:36:23.050
<v Speaker 1>could do strategically different?</v>

3126
01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Like just because something worked all the way along in any business or in</v>

3127
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:28.240
<v Speaker 1>anything you're doing,</v>

3128
01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:32.740
<v Speaker 1>there might be a time to take a slightly different approach or to change one of</v>

3129
01:36:32.741 --> 01:36:35.440
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental beliefs of how we do business or something.</v>

3130
01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.573
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3131
01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.780
<v Speaker 1>What you can't do is just go,</v>

3132
01:36:37.781 --> 01:36:37.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3133
01:36:37.931 --> 01:36:39.160
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the next one will be good.</v>

3134
01:36:39.190 --> 01:36:39.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3135
01:36:39.431 --> 01:36:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you watch that happen all the time to some massive change in your business or in</v>

3136
01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:47.230
<v Speaker 1>life and that change,</v>

3137
01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:48.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3138
01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.060
<v Speaker 1>at first people deny that it's there,</v>

3139
01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:50.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3140
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:53.720
<v Speaker 1>They deny it and then they say it's a niche and then they say it's a blip.</v>

3141
01:36:53.721 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time that it's actually in the heat of something scary or</v>

3142
01:36:58.191 --> 01:36:59.090
<v Speaker 1>challenging happening,</v>

3143
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:02.870
<v Speaker 1>you've wasted two or three years that you could've used adapting to be ready for</v>

3144
01:37:02.871 --> 01:37:03.030
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3145
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3146
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.260
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3147
01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:04.520
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3148
01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.353
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what you mean?</v>

3149
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3150
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:06.331
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3151
01:37:06.331 --> 01:37:11.310
<v Speaker 4>I think that what would you got to do when you have a champion that has</v>

3152
01:37:11.311 --> 01:37:12.450
<v Speaker 4>spectacular results?</v>

3153
01:37:12.630 --> 01:37:14.720
<v Speaker 4>Like Amanda knows you've got to hype the shit out of her.</v>

3154
01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:15.683
<v Speaker 4>Invest,</v>

3155
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:16.380
<v Speaker 4>invest,</v>

3156
01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:17.400
<v Speaker 4>hype the shit out of her.</v>

3157
01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.680
<v Speaker 4>And that would have made the Ronda Rousey fight.</v>

3158
01:37:19.681 --> 01:37:23.250
<v Speaker 4>I think even bigger if you show her smashing me should Tate,</v>

3159
01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.113
<v Speaker 4>you show her,</v>

3160
01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:24.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3161
01:37:24.481 --> 01:37:25.890
<v Speaker 4>smashing Sarah McMahon,</v>

3162
01:37:25.891 --> 01:37:28.660
<v Speaker 4>you show what she's capable of like she's a fucking once</v>

3163
01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:29.370
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3164
01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:29.731
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

3165
01:37:29.731 --> 01:37:34.440
<v Speaker 1>And you talked to Mike Brown or anyone there who's been around the greats and</v>

3166
01:37:34.441 --> 01:37:35.460
<v Speaker 1>that they talk about it.</v>

3167
01:37:35.461 --> 01:37:40.461
<v Speaker 1>But this level now where they are the brilliance of where what we've seen.</v>

3168
01:37:40.711 --> 01:37:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It's another example if you think that only fighting to stand up when you're in</v>

3169
01:37:45.301 --> 01:37:46.134
<v Speaker 1>guard is right.</v>

3170
01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3171
01:37:46.890 --> 01:37:48.930
<v Speaker 1>or only keeping somebody down as the game.</v>

3172
01:37:48.931 --> 01:37:50.100
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing you have to worry about us,</v>

3173
01:37:50.101 --> 01:37:50.760
<v Speaker 1>they'll stand up,</v>

3174
01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:51.590
<v Speaker 1>they'll submit you,</v>

3175
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3176
01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Like as soon as you don't recognize where you are in,</v>

3177
01:37:54.741 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 1>in change of the,</v>

3178
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the river of life and time,</v>

3179
01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you sometimes get fucked up.</v>

3180
01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.420
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3181
01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.253
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3182
01:38:01.650 --> 01:38:01.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3183
01:38:01.921 --> 01:38:02.191
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3184
01:38:02.191 --> 01:38:03.001
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating thing.</v>

3185
01:38:03.001 --> 01:38:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I know I literally was just in Singapore and I just spent days with this</v>

3186
01:38:06.241 --> 01:38:07.050
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

3187
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but they see the world differently.</v>

3188
01:38:09.451 --> 01:38:12.300
<v Speaker 1>They're strategy is simply,</v>

3189
01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:12.890
<v Speaker 1>they're a,</v>

3190
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>they're a values based company that believes in the values of these things and</v>

3191
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:18.474
<v Speaker 1>tries to,</v>

3192
01:38:18.630 --> 01:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>to show people and share martial artists reef for the greater good.</v>

3193
01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's not some business,</v>

3194
01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.220
<v Speaker 1>it's what they truly believe.</v>

3195
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:29.100
<v Speaker 1>They truly are going about and making choices.</v>

3196
01:38:29.101 --> 01:38:30.450
<v Speaker 1>And when chattery says,</v>

3197
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I would not hire Conor McGregor because he represents,</v>

3198
01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:38.540
<v Speaker 1>he's dead fucking serious people who represent his ideas is and what he sees,</v>

3199
01:38:40.050 --> 01:38:41.370
<v Speaker 1>and I shouldn't speak for him at all.</v>

3200
01:38:41.371 --> 01:38:42.480
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant man.</v>

3201
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:42.901
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

3202
01:38:42.901 --> 01:38:43.291
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

3203
01:38:43.291 --> 01:38:43.710
<v Speaker 1>he's a chef,</v>

3204
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 1>he was a homeless kid with,</v>

3205
01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:49.710
<v Speaker 1>with a single parent that later became educated.</v>

3206
01:38:49.711 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And then moved to America and went to Harvard and then started managing a</v>

3207
01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:56.250
<v Speaker 1>corporate funds and became a Moitai champion.</v>

3208
01:38:56.251 --> 01:38:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And this is all easily documented.</v>

3209
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.390
<v Speaker 1>This is who that individual is.</v>

3210
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.320
<v Speaker 1>And he's lived that life based on honor,</v>

3211
01:39:04.321 --> 01:39:05.154
<v Speaker 1>respect,</v>

3212
01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:06.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3213
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3214
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:08.340
<v Speaker 1>teamwork excellence,</v>

3215
01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:09.180
<v Speaker 1>that mind,</v>

3216
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:11.280
<v Speaker 1>that is what built that company.</v>

3217
01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:15.690
<v Speaker 1>And one is a billion dollar company now it's $1 billion company that's in 1.7</v>

3218
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.980
<v Speaker 1>billion homes in Asia.</v>

3219
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.740
<v Speaker 1>This isn't some mythological idea.</v>

3220
01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:24.510
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy who's built a massive company based around these values and that's</v>

3221
01:39:24.511 --> 01:39:25.530
<v Speaker 1>a different thing.</v>

3222
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.981
<v Speaker 1>He's been,</v>

3223
01:39:25.981 --> 01:39:26.850
<v Speaker 1>what does he say about common?</v>

3224
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3225
01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:27.810
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

3226
01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3227
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I go off on this.</v>

3228
01:39:29.101 --> 01:39:29.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3229
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.870
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

3230
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3231
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:34.890
<v Speaker 1>so he looks at it as the things that he says and the way that,</v>

3232
01:39:34.891 --> 01:39:35.251
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

3233
01:39:35.251 --> 01:39:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't speak for him,</v>

3234
01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:36.840
<v Speaker 1>this was the,</v>

3235
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:37.673
<v Speaker 1>what I've gathered,</v>

3236
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:42.980
<v Speaker 1>throwing things and creating conflict and controversy as your currency is not</v>

3237
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:43.950
<v Speaker 1>something to be proud of.</v>

3238
01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:44.521
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting,</v>

3239
01:39:44.521 --> 01:39:45.870
<v Speaker 1>we were putting it as your currency.</v>

3240
01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3241
01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:47.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3242
01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

3243
01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:48.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3244
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:50.250
<v Speaker 1>and that sounds because,</v>

3245
01:39:50.251 --> 01:39:51.890
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not quite all the,</v>

3246
01:39:51.891 --> 01:39:53.250
<v Speaker 1>although I've drank the Koolaid,</v>

3247
01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I believe in what they're doing and I see it as real,</v>

3248
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.900
<v Speaker 1>not only cause my values line up with it,</v>

3249
01:39:57.901 --> 01:40:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but I think they are going to grow dramatically as a result of some of these,</v>

3250
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 1>the way they see the world.</v>

3251
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:03.960
<v Speaker 1>But not only that,</v>

3252
01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:08.100
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still also immersed here and I like Connor,</v>

3253
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I think of Connor,</v>

3254
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I worked for TSN because Connor fell out of a march to a red carpet to shake my</v>

3255
01:40:15.031 --> 01:40:17.070
<v Speaker 1>hand while the my boss was watching.</v>

3256
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:18.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3257
01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3258
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:18.961
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3259
01:40:18.961 --> 01:40:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Like the great,</v>

3260
01:40:20.221 --> 01:40:23.130
<v Speaker 1>some of the most interesting moments I've had are with that guy and some of the</v>

3261
01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.180
<v Speaker 1>most interesting,</v>

3262
01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:25.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3263
01:40:25.051 --> 01:40:29.760
<v Speaker 1>many dozens of hours of trying to figure out what's happening in research and</v>

3264
01:40:29.761 --> 01:40:31.440
<v Speaker 1>growth has happened by studying that guy.</v>

3265
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:33.510
<v Speaker 1>And I see his,</v>

3266
01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:38.690
<v Speaker 1>the games that he is willing to play as part of his strategy for success as a</v>

3267
01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:43.650
<v Speaker 1>fighter and success trying to be successful for his family and his future.</v>

3268
01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I see it all connected so I don't dislike him,</v>

3269
01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:47.300
<v Speaker 1>but I respect this,</v>

3270
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:52.410
<v Speaker 1>this idea that conflict and controversy are not good for us.</v>

3271
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

3272
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 1>But I also understand</v>

3273
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:57.010
<v Speaker 3>psychological warfare and I think the condor is a master of that.</v>

3274
01:40:57.011 --> 01:40:58.780
<v Speaker 3>And that has a huge factor in victory.</v>

3275
01:40:58.781 --> 01:40:59.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3276
01:40:59.021 --> 01:41:01.690
<v Speaker 3>this is something Miyamoto Musashi use to his advantage.</v>

3277
01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3278
01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:03.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3279
01:41:03.201 --> 01:41:03.460
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

3280
01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:04.870
<v Speaker 3>if you read the book of five rings,</v>

3281
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.800
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3282
01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.520
<v Speaker 3>what Connor's doing is fucking with people's heads the point where they,</v>

3283
01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.630
<v Speaker 3>he has space in their head and then Conor goes into the cage,</v>

3284
01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:15.040
<v Speaker 3>like loose as a goose,</v>

3285
01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.110
<v Speaker 3>relaxed and calm.</v>

3286
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:18.580
<v Speaker 3>So he's letting you know,</v>

3287
01:41:18.581 --> 01:41:20.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck about you,</v>

3288
01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 3>but you give a fuck about me and I'm going to fuck you up right now.</v>

3289
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:23.801
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

3290
01:41:23.801 --> 01:41:23.981
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3291
01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:24.401
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

3292
01:41:24.401 --> 01:41:25.061
<v Speaker 3>You better not.</v>

3293
01:41:25.061 --> 01:41:25.531
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

3294
01:41:25.531 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

3295
01:41:26.050 --> 01:41:26.883
<v Speaker 3>This is too much.</v>

3296
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:29.020
<v Speaker 3>And Josie Aldo is the perfect example,</v>

3297
01:41:29.021 --> 01:41:34.021
<v Speaker 3>although was so out of composure a although charged at him with that just</v>

3298
01:41:34.331 --> 01:41:37.660
<v Speaker 3>leaping left hook and just got fucking waylaid on the way in.</v>

3299
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:38.590
<v Speaker 3>And Eddie Alvarez,</v>

3300
01:41:38.591 --> 01:41:39.850
<v Speaker 3>the greatest game day performer,</v>

3301
01:41:39.851 --> 01:41:42.340
<v Speaker 3>one of the Great Game Day performance we've ever seen.</v>

3302
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:44.410
<v Speaker 3>And I talked to Ldl,</v>

3303
01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:49.440
<v Speaker 3>that is one of my favorites and I admire and am inspired by Eddie Alvarez,</v>

3304
01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Michael Chandler too.</v>

3305
01:41:51.690 --> 01:41:54.070
<v Speaker 3>You know those two are like the same guy I lost.</v>

3306
01:41:54.071 --> 01:41:54.904
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3307
01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:56.673
<v Speaker 3>Eddie was like,</v>

3308
01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:01.740
<v Speaker 3>the plan was to wrestle a lot and stay at distance and barely at all and I</v>

3309
01:42:01.751 --> 01:42:05.050
<v Speaker 3>stayed at distance almost the whole time and barely Russell like he's just like,</v>

3310
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:06.710
<v Speaker 3>it was real like an I.</v>

3311
01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:11.200
<v Speaker 3>And by not accepting it was real coming in and suddenly you find yourself in</v>

3312
01:42:11.201 --> 01:42:13.090
<v Speaker 3>there and it's real and you feel different and your,</v>

3313
01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:13.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3314
01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:16.540
<v Speaker 3>your mind is working differently and your hormones are working differently and</v>

3315
01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:18.790
<v Speaker 3>who you are and that moment is different and you're like,</v>

3316
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:19.661
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck,</v>

3317
01:42:19.661 --> 01:42:20.350
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>

3318
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Had I prepared for it to be real?</v>

3319
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I could be in a different state right now,</v>

3320
01:42:24.101 --> 01:42:27.010
<v Speaker 3>but I denied that this was going to be real and now it's fucking real.</v>

3321
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Santa Claus is real.</v>

3322
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:29.651
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

3323
01:42:29.651 --> 01:42:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I also think you got clipped early and I think that's a factor.</v>

3324
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:32.801
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3325
01:42:32.801 --> 01:42:36.220
<v Speaker 3>you get caught on the chin like that and your legs give out real quick and you,</v>

3326
01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:36.760
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

3327
01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.550
<v Speaker 3>your brain doesn't work right and know your body doesn't work right anymore.</v>

3328
01:42:39.551 --> 01:42:40.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a factor.</v>

3329
01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:45.810
<v Speaker 3>The ability that Connor has to land those sharp shots that come out of nowhere</v>

3330
01:42:46.421 --> 01:42:51.100
<v Speaker 3>and blitz you and come at you so fast and just drop those shots on you.</v>

3331
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:55.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean his left hand is a fucking laser beam and that's so good planning it.</v>

3332
01:42:55.610 --> 01:42:56.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is.</v>

3333
01:42:56.741 --> 01:42:58.210
<v Speaker 3>The definition of it.</v>

3334
01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:03.070
<v Speaker 3>He's so good at landing that shot and he's also good at landing a bunch of other</v>

3335
01:43:03.071 --> 01:43:03.640
<v Speaker 3>shit too.</v>

3336
01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:03.971
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

3337
01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:05.110
<v Speaker 3>me pick you apart.</v>

3338
01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.161
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

3339
01:43:06.161 --> 01:43:07.390
<v Speaker 3>he's a real dynamo.</v>

3340
01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.253
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3341
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:12.730
<v Speaker 3>I hate to see things like what happened in New York and Brooklyn and he threw</v>

3342
01:43:12.731 --> 01:43:15.100
<v Speaker 3>the Dolly at the bus and smashed the window.</v>

3343
01:43:15.101 --> 01:43:15.461
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3344
01:43:15.461 --> 01:43:17.680
<v Speaker 3>so it's so fucking stupid.</v>

3345
01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.820
<v Speaker 3>All that thuggish shit running in with a bunch of other guys and everyone's</v>

3346
01:43:21.821 --> 01:43:23.620
<v Speaker 3>screaming at w was what?</v>

3347
01:43:23.621 --> 01:43:24.490
<v Speaker 3>What did he do?</v>

3348
01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:27.550
<v Speaker 3>He smacked your friend in the face because your friend friend was talking shit.</v>

3349
01:43:27.610 --> 01:43:28.301
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3350
01:43:28.301 --> 01:43:28.571
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3351
01:43:28.571 --> 01:43:30.690
<v Speaker 3>and even the way smacked him was pretty general.</v>

3352
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:32.051
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3353
01:43:32.051 --> 01:43:35.020
<v Speaker 3>And Artem called him a coward and he said didn't,</v>

3354
01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:37.090
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't find Connor's a real fighters.</v>

3355
01:43:37.091 --> 01:43:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3356
01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.253
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

3357
01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:39.510
<v Speaker 3>he's rushing.</v>

3358
01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:40.413
<v Speaker 3>You're rushing.</v>

3359
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.070
<v Speaker 3>You guys got to sort this out on your own.</v>

3360
01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:43.270
<v Speaker 3>That is how they sorted it out.</v>

3361
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:44.050
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>

3362
01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:46.600
<v Speaker 3>it was a pretty calm sorting out in my opinion.</v>

3363
01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:47.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean they didn't stomp him,</v>

3364
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:49.270
<v Speaker 3>they didn't beat his ass.</v>

3365
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:51.160
<v Speaker 3>But once we get to that point,</v>

3366
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean I get</v>

3367
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:52.330
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3368
01:43:52.330 --> 01:43:52.480
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3369
01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:52.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3370
01:43:52.630 --> 01:43:53.031
<v Speaker 1>once we,</v>

3371
01:43:53.031 --> 01:43:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something and I'm responding what's he responds that happens every</v>

3372
01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:57.201
<v Speaker 1>day in gangs,</v>

3373
01:43:57.201 --> 01:43:57.891
<v Speaker 1>in wars,</v>

3374
01:43:57.891 --> 01:44:01.820
<v Speaker 1>in Northern Ireland and Ireland and all types of religions that's been going on</v>

3375
01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:02.480
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

3376
01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever wins when that happens,</v>

3377
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:05.120
<v Speaker 1>it just goes,</v>

3378
01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.350
<v Speaker 1>it just perpetuates it.</v>

3379
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 1>And when you watch it and then there'll be a lot of people,</v>

3380
01:44:09.171 --> 01:44:14.171
<v Speaker 1>you see this scenario and like Habib's fans or friends or supporters and condos</v>

3381
01:44:15.261 --> 01:44:16.094
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

3382
01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:16.281
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3383
01:44:16.281 --> 01:44:17.060
<v Speaker 1>he did this.</v>

3384
01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:18.080
<v Speaker 1>They're both wrong.</v>

3385
01:44:18.170 --> 01:44:19.003
<v Speaker 1>And nobody,</v>

3386
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:20.240
<v Speaker 1>everybody always,</v>

3387
01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.550
<v Speaker 1>when somebody does something bad to somebody else,</v>

3388
01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:25.010
<v Speaker 1>they almost always feel like something was but done bad to them.</v>

3389
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Very few people instigate that was perceived.</v>

3390
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:28.364
<v Speaker 1>Something happened.</v>

3391
01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:32.960
<v Speaker 1>They perceive a slight and you know some people you do one thing to them and</v>

3392
01:44:32.961 --> 01:44:33.441
<v Speaker 1>then they're like,</v>

3393
01:44:33.441 --> 01:44:34.340
<v Speaker 1>okay mother fucker,</v>

3394
01:44:34.341 --> 01:44:35.660
<v Speaker 1>now it's to eternity.</v>

3395
01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't make any sense either.</v>

3396
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:40.730
<v Speaker 1>You look like a fool,</v>

3397
01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:42.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3398
01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.870
<v Speaker 1>you just can't throw a dolly at a bus.</v>

3399
01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:45.380
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3400
01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:45.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3401
01:44:45.741 --> 01:44:48.560
<v Speaker 1>filled with other fighters because it's so selfish.</v>

3402
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean all those people that got caught,</v>

3403
01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:51.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3404
01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ray Borg got cuts in his eyes.</v>

3405
01:44:54.711 --> 01:44:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the whole thing is a disaster.</v>

3406
01:44:56.660 --> 01:45:00.020
<v Speaker 1>So my theory based on bits of information that,</v>

3407
01:45:00.110 --> 01:45:02.810
<v Speaker 1>that we have is that Connor,</v>

3408
01:45:02.811 --> 01:45:03.644
<v Speaker 1>on some level,</v>

3409
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:04.340
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

3410
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it reinforces constantly.</v>

3411
01:45:06.670 --> 01:45:06.930
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>

3412
01:45:06.930 --> 01:45:10.700
<v Speaker 1>if your kid does something terrible that we know is bad and he'd give him candy</v>

3413
01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:14.270
<v Speaker 1>every time they're going to do some batch yet give her candy.</v>

3414
01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Every time she does something,</v>

3415
01:45:15.711 --> 01:45:18.050
<v Speaker 1>that reward conn has been rewarded.</v>

3416
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:19.101
<v Speaker 1>He gets richer,</v>

3417
01:45:19.101 --> 01:45:19.671
<v Speaker 1>more famous,</v>

3418
01:45:19.671 --> 01:45:20.630
<v Speaker 1>more influential,</v>

3419
01:45:20.631 --> 01:45:21.351
<v Speaker 1>the belts.</v>

3420
01:45:21.351 --> 01:45:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And he's been given candy every time he's done this.</v>

3421
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And it works.</v>

3422
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.920
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

3423
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.890
<v Speaker 1>there is parallels in the political system in America.</v>

3424
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:34.790
<v Speaker 1>There's parallels all over the world that by acting out in these strange ways,</v>

3425
01:45:34.791 --> 01:45:37.760
<v Speaker 1>it's so bizarre and unsettling that we reward it.</v>

3426
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:39.220
<v Speaker 1>You know that name for a band?</v>

3427
01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Candy for Babby.</v>

3428
01:45:40.610 --> 01:45:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3429
01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:41.480
<v Speaker 1>that'd be,</v>

3430
01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a punk band,</v>

3431
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:45.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's what's happening.</v>

3432
01:45:45.591 --> 01:45:45.801
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3433
01:45:45.801 --> 01:45:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And so now we take it and he's,</v>

3434
01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:50.920
<v Speaker 1>and then you add the strategy element that you're talking about,</v>

3435
01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:51.111
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3436
01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.550
<v Speaker 1>So he's looking at it and it's like,</v>

3437
01:45:52.551 --> 01:45:53.384
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3438
01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:53.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3439
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Habib would be a great fight.</v>

3440
01:45:55.281 --> 01:45:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to fight in Russia.</v>

3441
01:45:56.271 --> 01:45:58.280
<v Speaker 1>He likes challenges is as hard,</v>

3442
01:45:58.281 --> 01:45:59.114
<v Speaker 1>but let's do it.</v>

3443
01:45:59.360 --> 01:45:59.541
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3444
01:45:59.541 --> 01:46:02.150
<v Speaker 1>if I create some viral controversy,</v>

3445
01:46:02.151 --> 01:46:03.230
<v Speaker 1>which I did with,</v>

3446
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:03.941
<v Speaker 1>with Paulie,</v>

3447
01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:04.774
<v Speaker 1>Mala nausea,</v>

3448
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:05.870
<v Speaker 1>who's a have you,</v>

3449
01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:07.213
<v Speaker 1>do you know Polly?</v>

3450
01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I've only talked to him on Twitter.</v>

3451
01:46:08.690 --> 01:46:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3452
01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love Polly.</v>

3453
01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And I like him as a dude.</v>

3454
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.133
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

3455
01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3456
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3457
01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:16.701
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3458
01:46:16.701 --> 01:46:17.534
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3459
01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.850
<v Speaker 1>so he created that in the work and it's like,</v>

3460
01:46:19.851 --> 01:46:20.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3461
01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:20.751
<v Speaker 1>whether,</v>

3462
01:46:20.751 --> 01:46:23.120
<v Speaker 1>how on what level he's strategizing this,</v>

3463
01:46:23.121 --> 01:46:23.840
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3464
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.190
<v Speaker 1>let's go do some pushing.</v>

3465
01:46:25.191 --> 01:46:27.470
<v Speaker 1>And shoving with Habib and has guys some given the finger,</v>

3466
01:46:27.471 --> 01:46:28.550
<v Speaker 1>it'll be caught on cameras.</v>

3467
01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:29.120
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3468
01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:30.500
<v Speaker 1>What one thing we know about Connor,</v>

3469
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:31.370
<v Speaker 1>he's always late,</v>

3470
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:33.103
<v Speaker 1>always late.</v>

3471
01:46:33.110 --> 01:46:34.910
<v Speaker 1>He didn't plan to get there when they're on a bus.</v>

3472
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:36.740
<v Speaker 1>He planned to get there when they're in the hall.</v>

3473
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:37.671
<v Speaker 1>He planned to get there.</v>

3474
01:46:37.671 --> 01:46:41.030
<v Speaker 1>When does a bunch of people around it's security and it's easy to manage little</v>

3475
01:46:41.031 --> 01:46:44.930
<v Speaker 1>push and little shove in a couple of cameras and all of a sudden his $5 million</v>

3476
01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:47.990
<v Speaker 1>pay day is a $12 million payday in Russia and everybody's going crazy.</v>

3477
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:48.381
<v Speaker 1>It'll work.</v>

3478
01:46:48.381 --> 01:46:48.990
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>

3479
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.823
<v Speaker 1>But he's late.</v>

3480
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.690
<v Speaker 1>So he shows up there on the bus.</v>

3481
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Now the cameras are out and what's he going to do?</v>

3482
01:46:53.671 --> 01:46:54.660
<v Speaker 1>He's got to perform.</v>

3483
01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:55.890
<v Speaker 1>He came there to perform it,</v>

3484
01:46:55.891 --> 01:46:56.730
<v Speaker 1>came there to do a thing.</v>

3485
01:46:56.731 --> 01:46:58.020
<v Speaker 1>We showed up and now it,</v>

3486
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:03.260
<v Speaker 1>now it goes sideways and that's the most likely scenario is that it was a,</v>

3487
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.800
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

3488
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.580
<v Speaker 1>It'll be,</v>

3489
01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.260
<v Speaker 1>it'll feel right for us as,</v>

3490
01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:08.760
<v Speaker 1>as defending our friend,</v>

3491
01:47:08.761 --> 01:47:12.110
<v Speaker 1>but also it will have some inherent value in the cameras come out and nobody</v>

3492
01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:12.501
<v Speaker 1>will get hurt.</v>

3493
01:47:12.501 --> 01:47:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3494
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3495
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:14.360
<v Speaker 4>I think you're probably right there.</v>

3496
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:15.050
<v Speaker 4>It's got to get,</v>

3497
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.920
<v Speaker 4>he's got a good point,</v>

3498
01:47:16.610 --> 01:47:20.060
<v Speaker 4>but obviously it's a terrible thing to do and stupid.</v>

3499
01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:20.601
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3500
01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:20.811
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3501
01:47:20.811 --> 01:47:22.160
<v Speaker 4>there's a way to manage that,</v>

3502
01:47:22.161 --> 01:47:23.120
<v Speaker 4>but then is people say,</v>

3503
01:47:23.121 --> 01:47:23.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3504
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3505
01:47:23.691 --> 01:47:26.450
<v Speaker 4>now it becomes like the WWE and you know,</v>

3506
01:47:26.451 --> 01:47:27.040
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3507
01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:32.040
<v Speaker 4>there's people that love real fighting that have a real hard time with these</v>

3508
01:47:32.661 --> 01:47:37.661
<v Speaker 4>fake WWE style scenarios where you know that whether it's Colby Covington,</v>

3509
01:47:39.501 --> 01:47:39.670
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3510
01:47:39.670 --> 01:47:39.891
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3511
01:47:39.891 --> 01:47:41.750
<v Speaker 4>like he did a promo recently.</v>

3512
01:47:41.751 --> 01:47:42.584
<v Speaker 4>We had a,</v>

3513
01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:47.180
<v Speaker 4>a girl by the pool and the girl sat in his lap and she was like,</v>

3514
01:47:47.210 --> 01:47:52.210
<v Speaker 4>obviously had a plan script and it seemed kind of Corny people.</v>

3515
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:56.120
<v Speaker 4>There's people who think that's great and there's people fucking hate it.</v>

3516
01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:57.013
<v Speaker 1>I'm the hate it.</v>

3517
01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:57.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3518
01:47:57.411 --> 01:47:58.191
<v Speaker 4>I'm the heated too.</v>

3519
01:47:58.191 --> 01:47:59.024
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3520
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.331
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3521
01:47:59.331 --> 01:48:00.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a real problem with pro wrestling.</v>

3522
01:48:00.951 --> 01:48:04.010
<v Speaker 4>I joke around about it all the time and I get the fact that people like it.</v>

3523
01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:07.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that kind of shit bleeding into MMA.</v>

3524
01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:08.090
<v Speaker 4>I think it's dumb</v>

3525
01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:09.290
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

3526
01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:10.123
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

3527
01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3528
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:11.683
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3529
01:48:12.230 --> 01:48:17.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're viewing it as inspiring artistry with which there are lessons to</v>

3530
01:48:17.661 --> 01:48:20.600
<v Speaker 1>fucking live your life on one hand and on,</v>

3531
01:48:20.601 --> 01:48:22.970
<v Speaker 1>and then that's how I truly see it,</v>

3532
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.790
<v Speaker 1>an interface with it and experience it and,</v>

3533
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:27.280
<v Speaker 1>and share it and,</v>

3534
01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:30.020
<v Speaker 1>and want to see people get to feel that.</v>

3535
01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.250
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other hand,</v>

3536
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:35.390
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of putting together these weird scripts to sell pay per views,</v>

3537
01:48:35.391 --> 01:48:39.530
<v Speaker 1>but I mean wrestling that stuff that came up in wrestling because it isn't</v>

3538
01:48:39.531 --> 01:48:40.960
<v Speaker 1>inherently real.</v>

3539
01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:42.580
<v Speaker 1>It needed those extras.</v>

3540
01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It needed all that stuff.</v>

3541
01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.180
<v Speaker 1>If we understood how brilliant Colby Covington was,</v>

3542
01:48:47.181 --> 01:48:50.150
<v Speaker 1>if we understood how brilliant of a combat sportsman he was,</v>

3543
01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.680
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't have to do that.</v>

3544
01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.900
<v Speaker 1>But he's doing that and that's what got him a title shot.</v>

3545
01:48:53.930 --> 01:48:54.141
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3546
01:48:54.141 --> 01:48:54.920
<v Speaker 1>So on the other side,</v>

3547
01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:55.880
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the coin,</v>

3548
01:48:55.881 --> 01:48:56.630
<v Speaker 1>we're wrong.</v>

3549
01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You want to know if we understood he would get it based on that.</v>

3550
01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.370
<v Speaker 1>But we don't understand.</v>

3551
01:49:01.570 --> 01:49:01.810
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

3552
01:49:01.810 --> 01:49:02.601
<v Speaker 1>we the royal,</v>

3553
01:49:02.601 --> 01:49:03.800
<v Speaker 1>we don't get it.</v>

3554
01:49:03.801 --> 01:49:08.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'll see people talk about fighting after and there'll be like there</v>

3555
01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:09.230
<v Speaker 1>and some people's,</v>

3556
01:49:09.230 --> 01:49:13.900
<v Speaker 1>this is their idea of covering a fight and our fans or people and everybody's</v>

3557
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:14.750
<v Speaker 1>entitled to their own thing.</v>

3558
01:49:14.751 --> 01:49:15.584
<v Speaker 1>But they'll be like,</v>

3559
01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.011
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3560
01:49:16.011 --> 01:49:16.161
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3561
01:49:16.161 --> 01:49:17.990
<v Speaker 1>the show was kind of a lackluster fair.</v>

3562
01:49:17.991 --> 01:49:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of finishes.</v>

3563
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3564
01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Could you have 20 brilliant athletes have it interact and some that your opinion</v>

3565
01:49:25.221 --> 01:49:28.850
<v Speaker 1>of how it did or it didn't excite you is super valid to you.</v>

3566
01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.050
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what we were watching that.</v>

3567
01:49:31.051 --> 01:49:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3568
01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.410
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm talking about is like what got him a title shot?</v>

3569
01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:36.830
<v Speaker 1>My title shot is being an asshole because of the reality that we live in.</v>

3570
01:49:36.831 --> 01:49:37.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what he had to do.</v>

3571
01:49:37.650 --> 01:49:37.821
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3572
01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:37.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3573
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:40.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean like what he did in Brazil after he beat Damien,</v>

3574
01:49:40.041 --> 01:49:41.380
<v Speaker 4>Maia said this is a shit hole.</v>

3575
01:49:41.570 --> 01:49:43.190
<v Speaker 4>That's literally what got him the title shot.</v>

3576
01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:44.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you really stop and think about it,</v>

3577
01:49:44.721 --> 01:49:45.500
<v Speaker 4>he's ranked,</v>

3578
01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:46.730
<v Speaker 4>what does he ranked number three?</v>

3579
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 4>He's only beaten Maya and he's beaten some other people,</v>

3580
01:49:49.631 --> 01:49:54.010
<v Speaker 4>but it terms of top 10 contenders in terms of like real world class fighters,</v>

3581
01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:57.340
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of guys that are out there that have fucked up a lot of other</v>

3582
01:49:57.341 --> 01:49:58.570
<v Speaker 4>people like wonder boy.</v>

3583
01:49:58.580 --> 01:49:58.931
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3584
01:49:58.931 --> 01:50:01.750
<v Speaker 4>how is this guy fighting for the title and for an interim title?</v>

3585
01:50:01.751 --> 01:50:02.584
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not.</v>

3586
01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 4>After he's gone through those two big fights with Tyron Woodley,</v>

3587
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:06.431
<v Speaker 4>beaten,</v>

3588
01:50:06.431 --> 01:50:07.080
<v Speaker 4>Jorge Mas,</v>

3589
01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:07.570
<v Speaker 4>doll,</v>

3590
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:10.180
<v Speaker 4>beaten all these debate and Johnny Hendricks beaten all of these different</v>

3591
01:50:10.181 --> 01:50:10.870
<v Speaker 4>fighters.</v>

3592
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:15.290
<v Speaker 4>Colby beat Damien Maia and that's the really the big name on his resume and</v>

3593
01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:15.520
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3594
01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:18.070
<v Speaker 4>but it's also because he's going to be fighting Hofeld dos Anjos who's a</v>

3595
01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:18.904
<v Speaker 4>Brazilian.</v>

3596
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 4>He said a lot of stupid shit about Brazil.</v>

3597
01:50:20.831 --> 01:50:21.531
<v Speaker 4>Brazilians hate.</v>

3598
01:50:21.531 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 4>And Brazil's a giant market.</v>

3599
01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:25.130
<v Speaker 4>It's an easy sell and this is,</v>

3600
01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 4>this is what he's talked himself into and it's a tough fight.</v>

3601
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:29.170
<v Speaker 4>Don't make no mistake about it.</v>

3602
01:50:29.171 --> 01:50:32.410
<v Speaker 4>The guy that beat Damien Maia is a tough fucking fighter.</v>

3603
01:50:32.411 --> 01:50:33.730
<v Speaker 4>Colby A.</v>

3604
01:50:33.730 --> 01:50:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3605
01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:34.740
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3606
01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you talked to Dean Thomas or Mike Brown and they two years back when they were</v>

3607
01:50:39.691 --> 01:50:39.901
<v Speaker 1>taught.</v>

3608
01:50:39.901 --> 01:50:40.600
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>

3609
01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Jorge Mass fuddled freak,</v>

3610
01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:43.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3611
01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.750
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those special artists to me.</v>

3612
01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.130
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll be asking,</v>

3613
01:50:47.190 --> 01:50:47.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3614
01:50:47.551 --> 01:50:51.480
<v Speaker 1>like when I'll see Mike or a dean or these guys or anybody around that,</v>

3615
01:50:51.481 --> 01:50:51.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3616
01:50:51.751 --> 01:50:51.961
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3617
01:50:51.961 --> 01:50:52.231
<v Speaker 1>how's,</v>

3618
01:50:52.231 --> 01:50:52.951
<v Speaker 1>how's Jorge doing?</v>

3619
01:50:52.951 --> 01:50:53.820
<v Speaker 1>What's he working on?</v>

3620
01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.710
<v Speaker 1>What is he changes and they'll talk on,</v>

3621
01:50:56.730 --> 01:50:57.810
<v Speaker 1>he's always training with Colby.</v>

3622
01:50:57.811 --> 01:50:58.580
<v Speaker 1>He's a fuck.</v>

3623
01:50:58.580 --> 01:50:59.430
<v Speaker 1>He's a deadly,</v>

3624
01:50:59.431 --> 01:51:00.990
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the greats in the Jim Hill.</v>

3625
01:51:01.050 --> 01:51:03.180
<v Speaker 1>The two of them are first there last to leave.</v>

3626
01:51:03.181 --> 01:51:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Like you've heard about how good he was under that public surface.</v>

3627
01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:08.340
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3628
01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:09.390
<v Speaker 1>but I see what you're saying,</v>

3629
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:11.910
<v Speaker 1>based on what we've created,</v>

3630
01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:17.420
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have much of a choice if he wants to achieve his goals other than</v>

3631
01:51:17.761 --> 01:51:18.301
<v Speaker 1>doing it this way.</v>

3632
01:51:18.301 --> 01:51:19.470
<v Speaker 1>And the guys who are good at it,</v>

3633
01:51:19.471 --> 01:51:19.861
<v Speaker 1>jail,</v>

3634
01:51:19.861 --> 01:51:22.140
<v Speaker 1>obviously the jail is like really good at one of the best,</v>

3635
01:51:22.150 --> 01:51:22.983
<v Speaker 1>whatever greatness.</v>

3636
01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:23.940
<v Speaker 1>And he's an entertainer.</v>

3637
01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3638
01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.410
<v Speaker 1>And don't you love jail?</v>

3639
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I love chatting fucking love child.</v>

3640
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:32.750
<v Speaker 1>And yet this is something I find distasteful about this art form is that game</v>

3641
01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:35.700
<v Speaker 1>yet somehow channel is so lovable.</v>

3642
01:51:36.090 --> 01:51:36.751
<v Speaker 1>I love child.</v>

3643
01:51:36.751 --> 01:51:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3644
01:51:37.130 --> 01:51:42.130
<v Speaker 1>But it's because there's a natural love of that kind of performance and Colby</v>

3645
01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.530
<v Speaker 1>and I've played around with it a little bit when I played in a band where you</v>

3646
01:51:46.531 --> 01:51:48.990
<v Speaker 1>would be rude and arrogant and play that kind of game.</v>

3647
01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:50.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3648
01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.713
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

3649
01:51:52.170 --> 01:51:52.770
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

3650
01:51:52.770 --> 01:51:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>

3651
01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:55.680
<v Speaker 1>It's hard when it's hard to be convincing.</v>

3652
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It's also hard to be hated all the time.</v>

3653
01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.441
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

3654
01:51:58.441 --> 01:51:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

3655
01:51:59.010 --> 01:52:04.010
<v Speaker 1>you will feel the hatred of the all Brazilians who truly hate you even though</v>

3656
01:52:05.431 --> 01:52:06.490
<v Speaker 1>you were playing a game.</v>

3657
01:52:06.491 --> 01:52:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Getting real about that shit.</v>

3658
01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:10.550
<v Speaker 4>Zillions are extremely patriotic,</v>

3659
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:12.110
<v Speaker 4>very nationalistic.</v>

3660
01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:13.640
<v Speaker 4>You Talk Shit about Brazil,</v>

3661
01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.630
<v Speaker 4>you better duck.</v>

3662
01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3663
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3664
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:17.530
<v Speaker 1>they know the boomerang.</v>

3665
01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:19.393
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

3666
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:25.450
<v Speaker 1>even if you were talked to somebody like a stereotypically passionate person,</v>

3667
01:52:26.031 --> 01:52:29.240
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about here and you said it's a joke and they'd be like,</v>

3668
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't make that joke right there.</v>

3669
01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Point isn't that.</v>

3670
01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if he was kidding.</v>

3671
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:39.830
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he was willing to do that is so disrespectful to all of us that we</v>

3672
01:52:39.831 --> 01:52:41.000
<v Speaker 1>must slit his throat.</v>

3673
01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:44.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they'll chant when he goes to walk out there and they mean it.</v>

3674
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:45.740
<v Speaker 1>They do mean it.</v>

3675
01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile</v>

3676
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:47.150
<v Speaker 2>he just doubled down.</v>

3677
01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:49.610
<v Speaker 2>He didn't give a fuck even after he got hit in the head with the boomerang,</v>

3678
01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:51.140
<v Speaker 2>still doubling down,</v>

3679
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:52.400
<v Speaker 2>swinging for the fences.</v>

3680
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:53.151
<v Speaker 2>What other choice,</v>

3681
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:53.984
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

3682
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.440
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3683
01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:59.440
<v Speaker 2>it has got him to the dance and if he wins two Saturdays from this one or one</v>

3684
01:53:01.011 --> 01:53:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>

3685
01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:02.930
<v Speaker 2>how's it going next one,</v>

3686
01:53:02.931 --> 01:53:04.100
<v Speaker 2>his tail and Wonderboy.</v>

3687
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3688
01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:06.930
<v Speaker 2>that's another one to talk about it.</v>

3689
01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3690
01:53:07.690 --> 01:53:08.780
<v Speaker 2>But if he wins,</v>

3691
01:53:09.110 --> 01:53:10.190
<v Speaker 2>if he wins,</v>

3692
01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.330
<v Speaker 2>he will have a belt.</v>

3693
01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:11.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3694
01:53:11.661 --> 01:53:13.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not the real belt.</v>

3695
01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:14.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's an interim belt,</v>

3696
01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.270
<v Speaker 2>but it guarantees them a shot at the real belt.</v>

3697
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3698
01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:18.171
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3699
01:53:18.171 --> 01:53:19.610
<v Speaker 2>so it gets very interesting.</v>

3700
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.100
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>

3701
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I know that I my look at these sort of systems and the areas around that I have</v>

3702
01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.700
<v Speaker 2>a negative bias.</v>

3703
01:53:31.701 --> 01:53:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3704
01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:32.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3705
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:33.283
<v Speaker 2>it's not about that.</v>

3706
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:34.310
<v Speaker 2>And I know that's,</v>

3707
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:39.650
<v Speaker 2>that's negative to me about the belt or the rankings or beef or whatever.</v>

3708
01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:43.430
<v Speaker 2>But the belt cannot mean what it meant before.</v>

3709
01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:47.810
<v Speaker 2>By the nature of once upon a time there were only ever 27 of them and now</v>

3710
01:53:47.811 --> 01:53:49.400
<v Speaker 2>there's been 340 of them.</v>

3711
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:52.310
<v Speaker 2>By nature it cannot be as valuable as it once was.</v>

3712
01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3713
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:54.410
<v Speaker 2>And when there's two in yours,</v>

3714
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:58.880
<v Speaker 2>it inherently cannot have the value because scarcity is where value comes from.</v>

3715
01:53:58.970 --> 01:53:59.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3716
01:53:59.181 --> 01:54:00.860
<v Speaker 2>It's really just a promotional tool.</v>

3717
01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a marketing tool and it's a,</v>

3718
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:03.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a questionable one.</v>

3719
01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:04.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3720
01:54:04.281 --> 01:54:04.611
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3721
01:54:04.611 --> 01:54:08.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a real good argument that it's a bad idea to have these interim title</v>

3722
01:54:08.781 --> 01:54:09.860
<v Speaker 2>shots because you know,</v>

3723
01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:10.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3724
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:10.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3725
01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:11.570
<v Speaker 2>well what's the rules?</v>

3726
01:54:11.571 --> 01:54:13.490
<v Speaker 2>You just decide when to have an interim shot,</v>

3727
01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 2>especially with a guy like Tony Ferguson,</v>

3728
01:54:15.231 --> 01:54:15.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3729
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:20.090
<v Speaker 2>He Beats Kevin Lee Spectacular Phi triangles and off lost to nobody after that</v>

3730
01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.830
<v Speaker 2>last one.</v>

3731
01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:26.060
<v Speaker 2>One the interim title and then you strip it because he falls down during a</v>

3732
01:54:26.061 --> 01:54:26.690
<v Speaker 2>promotion.</v>

3733
01:54:26.690 --> 01:54:28.100
<v Speaker 2>He trips on some wires.</v>

3734
01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:29.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean this isn't,</v>

3735
01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not like you went and did something stupid outside of fighting.</v>

3736
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:36.800
<v Speaker 2>He was just doing a promotion and tripped on some wires.</v>

3737
01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:40.340
<v Speaker 2>So freak accident and that really,</v>

3738
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:44.390
<v Speaker 2>if we move away all of the things and just look at the systems at play and how</v>

3739
01:54:44.391 --> 01:54:45.224
<v Speaker 2>and why it's there.</v>

3740
01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:46.161
<v Speaker 2>If he was,</v>

3741
01:54:46.161 --> 01:54:48.620
<v Speaker 2>if he had another 2 million Instagram followers,</v>

3742
01:54:48.621 --> 01:54:49.454
<v Speaker 2>that would not happen.</v>

3743
01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:50.690
<v Speaker 2>You're right and that's it.</v>

3744
01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:51.231
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

3745
01:54:51.231 --> 01:54:52.970
<v Speaker 2>It's strictly that that is true,</v>

3746
01:54:53.010 --> 01:54:53.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3747
01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3748
01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean Tony was a giant,</v>

3749
01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:55.940
<v Speaker 2>huge star.</v>

3750
01:54:55.941 --> 01:54:57.050
<v Speaker 2>There's no way they would strip them.</v>

3751
01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:57.530
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3752
01:54:57.530 --> 01:54:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3753
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:58.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3754
01:54:58.460 --> 01:54:59.660
<v Speaker 2>but by not being,</v>

3755
01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.890
<v Speaker 2>cause he's a character.</v>

3756
01:55:00.891 --> 01:55:01.310
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3757
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:02.300
<v Speaker 2>he's an odd ball.</v>

3758
01:55:02.301 --> 01:55:03.410
<v Speaker 2>He has a unique,</v>

3759
01:55:03.411 --> 01:55:04.244
<v Speaker 2>he's one of a kind.</v>

3760
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:05.990
<v Speaker 2>We should celebrate that.</v>

3761
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:07.370
<v Speaker 2>He's one of a kind.</v>

3762
01:55:07.371 --> 01:55:08.270
<v Speaker 2>He's an individual.</v>

3763
01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:09.320
<v Speaker 2>He's different than everybody.</v>

3764
01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:10.154
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

3765
01:55:10.210 --> 01:55:11.270
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to strip Connor,</v>

3766
01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:12.830
<v Speaker 2>which they did and you have,</v>

3767
01:55:12.831 --> 01:55:14.690
<v Speaker 2>could be fight for the title,</v>

3768
01:55:14.691 --> 01:55:16.610
<v Speaker 2>the true title and you know,</v>

3769
01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:16.911
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3770
01:55:16.911 --> 01:55:19.880
<v Speaker 2>that's arguable whether or not you should do that should probably be two interim</v>

3771
01:55:19.881 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 2>fights or to an interim titles,</v>

3772
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:22.710
<v Speaker 2>which will be cool.</v>

3773
01:55:22.710 --> 01:55:24.140
<v Speaker 2>He's not beating the champion.</v>

3774
01:55:24.141 --> 01:55:25.370
<v Speaker 2>If he didn't beat the champion,</v>

3775
01:55:25.371 --> 01:55:26.540
<v Speaker 2>he beat ally Quinta.</v>

3776
01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.940
<v Speaker 2>How is him beating owl?</v>

3777
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I acquaint to a more valid than Tony beating Kevin Lee.</v>

3778
01:55:30.751 --> 01:55:31.461
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3779
01:55:31.461 --> 01:55:32.180
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>

3780
01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:32.931
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3781
01:55:32.931 --> 01:55:33.740
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

3782
01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:34.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3783
01:55:34.071 --> 01:55:35.740
<v Speaker 2>not no taking anything away against Al,</v>

3784
01:55:35.741 --> 01:55:38.540
<v Speaker 2>but Al took that fight on unfucking one day's notice.</v>

3785
01:55:38.541 --> 01:55:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3786
01:55:38.910 --> 01:55:42.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's even more ridiculous and awesome and awesome and awesome.</v>

3787
01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:43.780
<v Speaker 2>That was a great fight.</v>

3788
01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>It was</v>

3789
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.371
<v Speaker 1>really fun.</v>

3790
01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3791
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:45.641
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>

3792
01:55:45.641 --> 01:55:46.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of,</v>

3793
01:55:46.681 --> 01:55:46.831
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3794
01:55:46.831 --> 01:55:48.630
<v Speaker 1>it was really fun and I like,</v>

3795
01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Quinta is another one of these guys.</v>

3796
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:53.040
<v Speaker 1>How can you not be inspired?</v>

3797
01:55:53.041 --> 01:55:58.041
<v Speaker 1>Seeing a guy like life is traveling along and all of a sudden you have this one</v>

3798
01:55:58.441 --> 01:55:59.400
<v Speaker 1>shot at something,</v>

3799
01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:00.450
<v Speaker 1>you're not ready.</v>

3800
01:56:00.451 --> 01:56:01.171
<v Speaker 1>You don't have,</v>

3801
01:56:01.171 --> 01:56:02.700
<v Speaker 1>you haven't prepared in the ways you want,</v>

3802
01:56:02.701 --> 01:56:03.151
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

3803
01:56:03.151 --> 01:56:03.961
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go for it.</v>

3804
01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3805
01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a life lesson.</v>

3806
01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:08.390
<v Speaker 1>And there's also like I,</v>

3807
01:56:08.490 --> 01:56:12.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a forgiving nature to this machine that is kind of admirable.</v>

3808
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Like Alice created problems.</v>

3809
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Al Has had conflict with that company and then they were still like,</v>

3810
01:56:18.421 --> 01:56:18.841
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3811
01:56:18.841 --> 01:56:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this area.</v>

3812
01:56:20.630 --> 01:56:21.430
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

3813
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:22.263
<v Speaker 3>did it though.</v>

3814
01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:23.810
<v Speaker 3>They did it because they wouldn't,</v>

3815
01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.160
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't use Paul Felder the fucking athletic commission.</v>

3816
01:56:28.161 --> 01:56:28.941
<v Speaker 3>That's all ridiculous,</v>

3817
01:56:28.941 --> 01:56:29.774
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

3818
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:33.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean all their wisdom,</v>

3819
01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:36.950
<v Speaker 3>they decided that Paul Felder isn't ranked high enough.</v>

3820
01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

3821
01:56:37.610 --> 01:56:38.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't know shit.</v>

3822
01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know where rankings come from,</v>

3823
01:56:40.011 --> 01:56:43.220
<v Speaker 1>which is a bunch of people like hanging out to kind of watch,</v>

3824
01:56:43.221 --> 01:56:43.971
<v Speaker 1>fighting a bunch of,</v>

3825
01:56:43.971 --> 01:56:45.980
<v Speaker 1>making an arbitrary choice and then combining it.</v>

3826
01:56:45.981 --> 01:56:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3827
01:56:46.650 --> 01:56:47.241
<v Speaker 1>do you know what,</v>

3828
01:56:47.241 --> 01:56:47.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3829
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:49.550
<v Speaker 1>what a first class noticer is.</v>

3830
01:56:49.551 --> 01:56:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard this term a fa?</v>

3831
01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:55.860
<v Speaker 1>So a first class noticer in business or any number of things as somebody who</v>

3832
01:56:56.650 --> 01:57:01.580
<v Speaker 1>over times you start to see the different systems and how they interact with</v>

3833
01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.660
<v Speaker 1>each other and you are one,</v>

3834
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:05.600
<v Speaker 1>you clearly are a first class noticer.</v>

3835
01:57:05.601 --> 01:57:06.950
<v Speaker 1>You see big picture,</v>

3836
01:57:06.951 --> 01:57:07.611
<v Speaker 1>small picture,</v>

3837
01:57:07.611 --> 01:57:09.800
<v Speaker 1>combine how the outside right now you're like,</v>

3838
01:57:09.801 --> 01:57:10.460
<v Speaker 1>well the,</v>

3839
01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:13.250
<v Speaker 1>the commission did this but Paul felter did that.</v>

3840
01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Rankings are this way and you're able to pull all these things together and look</v>

3841
01:57:16.851 --> 01:57:17.210
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

3842
01:57:17.210 --> 01:57:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3843
01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.710
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at any of these things from that perspective of how the systems</v>

3844
01:57:21.711 --> 01:57:22.190
<v Speaker 1>all work,</v>

3845
01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:24.080
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing barely makes sense.</v>

3846
01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:24.920
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3847
01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Paul Felder is brilliant.</v>

3848
01:57:27.670 --> 01:57:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

3849
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:29.690
<v Speaker 1>if he's a dangerous fight day,</v>

3850
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:35.150
<v Speaker 1>including Khabib and committed and mentally strong and a striver,</v>

3851
01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:38.670
<v Speaker 3>worldclass striker and his striking his fucking deadly.</v>

3852
01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:42.180
<v Speaker 3>And he's not just a striker in terms of punching like owl.</v>

3853
01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.040
<v Speaker 3>He's a really nasty kicker.</v>

3854
01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:44.371
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3855
01:57:44.371 --> 01:57:44.971
<v Speaker 3>Al can kick.</v>

3856
01:57:44.971 --> 01:57:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

3857
01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:45.953
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it.</v>

3858
01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.690
<v Speaker 3>But Paul was a bit more achieved in,</v>

3859
01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:49.290
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>

3860
01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:49.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3861
01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:51.870
<v Speaker 3>he's got more weapons,</v>

3862
01:57:51.871 --> 01:57:52.710
<v Speaker 3>more complex,</v>

3863
01:57:52.711 --> 01:57:57.711
<v Speaker 3>spinning back fists and elbows and knees and nasty leg kicks and you know,</v>

3864
01:57:58.321 --> 01:58:01.350
<v Speaker 3>went three hard rounds with Barboza and went toe to toe with them.</v>

3865
01:58:01.351 --> 01:58:01.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3866
01:58:01.531 --> 01:58:02.251
<v Speaker 3>he's that good.</v>

3867
01:58:02.251 --> 01:58:02.980
<v Speaker 3>He's that good on it</v>

3868
01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:03.790
<v Speaker 1>and smart.</v>

3869
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3870
01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:04.670
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3871
01:58:04.670 --> 01:58:06.800
<v Speaker 1>he's a great analyst for a such a young one.</v>

3872
01:58:06.801 --> 01:58:07.730
<v Speaker 1>But when you look,</v>

3873
01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:08.181
<v Speaker 1>so you're like,</v>

3874
01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:09.380
<v Speaker 1>how is that possible?</v>

3875
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Because that's really hard and it's a different skill set than just being a good</v>

3876
01:58:12.771 --> 01:58:16.730
<v Speaker 1>fight this language and being able to rationalize things and all these different</v>

3877
01:58:16.731 --> 01:58:17.120
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3878
01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.060
<v Speaker 1>But you look back and he did it on the small leaks,</v>

3879
01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:22.130
<v Speaker 1>which he didn't need to do.</v>

3880
01:58:22.190 --> 01:58:24.200
<v Speaker 1>He pursued because it was of interest to him.</v>

3881
01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.110
<v Speaker 1>He pursued it to get good at it because he loved it,</v>

3882
01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:29.960
<v Speaker 1>which means he's predisposed to thinking that way.</v>

3883
01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.610
<v Speaker 1>So now you also have a thinker,</v>

3884
01:58:32.090 --> 01:58:32.923
<v Speaker 1>a fighter,</v>

3885
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:35.810
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dangerous striker,</v>

3886
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:40.190
<v Speaker 1>a guy who can play complex games in it and you in your infinite wisdom,</v>

3887
01:58:40.191 --> 01:58:44.530
<v Speaker 1>don't think he can fight Habib because somebody somewhere said that he put a</v>

3888
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 1>seven next to his name instead of a three.</v>

3889
01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:47.240
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot</v>

3890
01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:47.630
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

3891
01:58:47.630 --> 01:58:51.490
<v Speaker 3>real problems with the athletic commission and we won't go into depth.</v>

3892
01:58:51.710 --> 01:58:52.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to cause any problems.</v>

3893
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:54.040
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3894
01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:54.330
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3895
01:58:54.330 --> 01:58:55.610
<v Speaker 3>they had some real issues.</v>

3896
01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:56.230
<v Speaker 3>They're young,</v>

3897
01:58:56.230 --> 01:58:56.780
<v Speaker 3>they're new.</v>

3898
01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:57.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3899
01:58:57.021 --> 01:58:57.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of nonsense.</v>

3900
01:58:57.891 --> 01:58:59.090
<v Speaker 3>It was going on behind the scenes.</v>

3901
01:58:59.510 --> 01:59:01.760
<v Speaker 3>But I think that what,</v>

3902
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:06.620
<v Speaker 3>what was interesting about that fight was we got to see al step up.</v>

3903
01:59:06.650 --> 01:59:10.840
<v Speaker 3>We got to see Khabib have some issues with striking and you know,</v>

3904
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:11.810
<v Speaker 3>we got to see,</v>

3905
01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:13.393
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3906
01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:14.331
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3907
01:59:14.331 --> 01:59:16.610
<v Speaker 3>what I don't like about it is this whole,</v>

3908
01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:18.290
<v Speaker 3>the whole championship thing.</v>

3909
01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:21.650
<v Speaker 3>What I don't like about it is he didn't beat the champion to become a champion.</v>

3910
01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:23.840
<v Speaker 3>They just sort of like set this fight up.</v>

3911
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Al Wasn't preparing for that fight.</v>

3912
01:59:25.671 --> 01:59:29.240
<v Speaker 3>He was preparing for a three round fight and then Tony gets stripped.</v>

3913
01:59:29.241 --> 01:59:29.751
<v Speaker 3>All those things.</v>

3914
01:59:29.751 --> 01:59:30.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3915
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3916
01:59:30.970 --> 01:59:32.860
<v Speaker 1>it because they don't make any sense.</v>

3917
01:59:32.970 --> 01:59:33.660
<v Speaker 1>They don't take anything,</v>

3918
01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:34.271
<v Speaker 1>make any sense.</v>

3919
01:59:34.271 --> 01:59:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Because if we go back to the,</v>

3920
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:41.230
<v Speaker 1>if we have some kind of value root of what we're about other than the necessity</v>

3921
01:59:41.231 --> 01:59:41.680
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3922
01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:44.820
<v Speaker 1>to sell things based on the same marketing that we use,</v>

3923
01:59:45.130 --> 01:59:47.050
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have to be in that situation,</v>

3924
01:59:47.051 --> 01:59:49.840
<v Speaker 1>but we find ourselves there and when you're on,</v>

3925
01:59:49.841 --> 01:59:51.400
<v Speaker 1>when you're on the bottom of half guard,</v>

3926
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:53.950
<v Speaker 1>you just have to work your way out of half guard and that's what that machine</v>

3927
01:59:53.951 --> 01:59:57.160
<v Speaker 1>has to do and that's what you know Habib has to do and that's,</v>

3928
01:59:57.190 --> 01:59:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you got an artificial stand up.</v>

3929
01:59:58.780 --> 01:59:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3930
01:59:59.290 --> 02:00:00.123
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3931
02:00:02.370 --> 02:00:03.091
<v Speaker 3>Got stood up.</v>

3932
02:00:03.091 --> 02:00:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3933
02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3934
02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3935
02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Wonderboy until,</v>

3936
02:00:07.681 --> 02:00:08.160
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3937
02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:08.941
<v Speaker 3>that's a big fire.</v>

3938
02:00:08.941 --> 02:00:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3939
02:00:09.150 --> 02:00:10.020
<v Speaker 3>that's a Saturday.</v>

3940
02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:10.830
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking,</v>

3941
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:11.810
<v Speaker 3>that's chaos stuff.</v>

3942
02:00:11.811 --> 02:00:13.440
<v Speaker 3>Fight is very interesting to me.</v>

3943
02:00:13.590 --> 02:00:14.371
<v Speaker 3>I am very,</v>

3944
02:00:14.371 --> 02:00:14.671
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

3945
02:00:14.671 --> 02:00:16.050
<v Speaker 3>very interested in that fight.</v>

3946
02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

3947
02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:17.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3948
02:00:17.161 --> 02:00:19.340
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what happens when till fights Wonderboy,</v>

3949
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:24.350
<v Speaker 3>because I was stunned by how easily till ran through cowboy and cowboy in all</v>

3950
02:00:25.981 --> 02:00:27.120
<v Speaker 3>fairness is not,</v>

3951
02:00:27.330 --> 02:00:28.141
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

3952
02:00:28.141 --> 02:00:30.570
<v Speaker 3>a real one 70 he's a tweener.</v>

3953
02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I think cowboy would be a one 65 you know,</v>

3954
02:00:34.021 --> 02:00:35.190
<v Speaker 3>and I think maybe it,</v>

3955
02:00:35.191 --> 02:00:38.340
<v Speaker 3>his struggles to make one 55 maybe she'd be 10 pounds heavier.</v>

3956
02:00:38.341 --> 02:00:41.460
<v Speaker 3>And I think that 10 pound weight class thing is real.</v>

3957
02:00:41.461 --> 02:00:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where it should be.</v>

3958
02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Every 10 pounds.</v>

3959
02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Darren till is a fucking huge guy.</v>

3960
02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:48.533
<v Speaker 3>So Steve,</v>

3961
02:00:48.690 --> 02:00:49.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3962
02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:52.140
<v Speaker 3>they're both very tall and strong,</v>

3963
02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:53.370
<v Speaker 3>but till you know,</v>

3964
02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:56.150
<v Speaker 3>regularly is well over a hundred I mean,</v>

3965
02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:57.690
<v Speaker 3>well over 200 pounds.</v>

3966
02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3967
02:00:58.110 --> 02:00:59.520
<v Speaker 3>He's walking around at like,</v>

3968
02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:00.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3969
02:01:00.930 --> 02:01:01.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3970
02:01:01.291 --> 02:01:05.430
<v Speaker 3>fucking two oh five and shit and cutting down to one 70 it's a good one,</v>

3971
02:01:05.431 --> 02:01:05.700
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3972
02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:06.533
<v Speaker 1>It's a really,</v>

3973
02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3974
02:01:07.230 --> 02:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>there's so many little odd ball variables and unknowns,</v>

3975
02:01:10.921 --> 02:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3976
02:01:11.250 --> 02:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Like we literally,</v>

3977
02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>when we go and we look at these,</v>

3978
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>the more you've studied and analyzed and commentated fighting for 20 years of</v>

3979
02:01:20.071 --> 02:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

3980
02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>the more you realize how little we actually know.</v>

3981
02:01:23.071 --> 02:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Like we have about two or seven or 18% of the actual information,</v>

3982
02:01:27.570 --> 02:01:28.171
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3983
02:01:28.171 --> 02:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>And we're trying to work with it and the big one.</v>

3984
02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

3985
02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>when Cody fought TJ or,</v>

3986
02:01:32.701 --> 02:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3987
02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:34.093
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3988
02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.153
<v Speaker 1>Dominic,</v>

3989
02:01:35.370 --> 02:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3990
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see how he can win.</v>

3991
02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how Cody can win.</v>

3992
02:01:39.650 --> 02:01:40.381
<v Speaker 1>And then somebody to say,</v>

3993
02:01:40.381 --> 02:01:40.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3994
02:01:40.491 --> 02:01:41.151
<v Speaker 1>why did he say that?</v>

3995
02:01:41.151 --> 02:01:41.931
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out all these guys?</v>

3996
02:01:41.931 --> 02:01:42.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3997
02:01:42.141 --> 02:01:42.471
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

3998
02:01:42.471 --> 02:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get to Dominic.</v>

3999
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>And we've never seen evidence of him doing well after those minutes.</v>

4000
02:01:47.451 --> 02:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>The evidence isn't there to see it.</v>

4001
02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Of course 100% wrong,</v>

4002
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>

4003
02:01:53.090 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>but you have to go by what evidence you have.</v>

4004
02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>What have we seen or what information have we gathered that can allow us to make</v>

4005
02:01:59.950 --> 02:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>a decision to me?</v>

4006
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Cody Garbrandt did not have,</v>

4007
02:02:03.381 --> 02:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>there was no evidence he can be Dominic and then boom,</v>

4008
02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>beats up Dominic and you're blown away.</v>

4009
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's an exciting feeling.</v>

4010
02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:11.001
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

4011
02:02:11.001 --> 02:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I think what's at play here.</v>

4012
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Is there any evidence that that Darren till can do what Rory Macdonald couldn't</v>

4013
02:02:16.941 --> 02:02:21.200
<v Speaker 1>do and Jorge mass but all couldn't do and get to a guy who has that movement,</v>

4014
02:02:21.201 --> 02:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>that blitz thinking that karate's um,</v>

4015
02:02:23.710 --> 02:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4016
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>those karate instincts we were talking about,</v>

4017
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>we've seen no real evidence of that.</v>

4018
02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean he can't do it.</v>

4019
02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean he can't do it,</v>

4020
02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>but the evidence isn't there.</v>

4021
02:02:32.871 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

4022
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I was stunned by his ability to close the distance on cowboy,</v>

4023
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>that nasty left.</v>

4024
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4025
02:02:38.681 --> 02:02:39.950
<v Speaker 1>well they'll be landed over the top.</v>

4026
02:02:39.970 --> 02:02:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4027
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>The way he put them away.</v>

4028
02:02:41.630 --> 02:02:42.051
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4029
02:02:42.051 --> 02:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that's pretty good evidence that he's a fucking monster.</v>

4030
02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

4031
02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And his fights previous in the UFC as well,</v>

4032
02:02:47.841 --> 02:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>although they didn't have a lot of fanfare behind him,</v>

4033
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:51.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4034
02:02:51.141 --> 02:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>stunning results.</v>

4035
02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>And then you talk to people that know him,</v>

4036
02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:54.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4037
02:02:54.891 --> 02:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>talk to people that know his striking document and people that have seen him in</v>

4038
02:02:58.101 --> 02:03:00.410
<v Speaker 1>the gym and understand what he's been through in his life.</v>

4039
02:03:00.411 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 1>And he's a young guy.</v>

4040
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's only 25 how old is Darren [inaudible]?</v>

4041
02:03:05.090 --> 02:03:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he's 25 Celso never lost,</v>

4042
02:03:07.611 --> 02:03:08.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4043
02:03:08.090 --> 02:03:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

4044
02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:09.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking beast,</v>

4045
02:03:09.631 --> 02:03:09.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4046
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4047
02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 1>And then you see the pictures,</v>

4048
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>even the 25 years old.</v>

4049
02:03:12.710 --> 02:03:13.640
<v Speaker 1>That's wild man.</v>

4050
02:03:13.641 --> 02:03:16.370
<v Speaker 1>And but what I'm saying is I would have,</v>

4051
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I would not be the slightest bit surprised if he could do it because we've seen</v>

4052
02:03:19.881 --> 02:03:24.740
<v Speaker 1>enough over time to know that what a 23 year old is capable of,</v>

4053
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:26.750
<v Speaker 1>they'll see the whole game differently.</v>

4054
02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:31.520
<v Speaker 1>They'll see their understanding of where they are in relation to the other guy</v>

4055
02:03:31.521 --> 02:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>is so different that it just on one day,</v>

4056
02:03:34.641 --> 02:03:37.340
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden all these 25 year olds are just so fucking good.</v>

4057
02:03:37.341 --> 02:03:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And we don't really have the language to explain why.</v>

4058
02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:41.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4059
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:42.380
<v Speaker 1>can we just say,</v>

4060
02:03:42.590 --> 02:03:42.831
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4061
02:03:42.831 --> 02:03:45.020
<v Speaker 1>he was able to close the distance on Stephen Thompson.</v>

4062
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:46.040
<v Speaker 1>If he does,</v>

4063
02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:46.850
<v Speaker 1>we'll say yes,</v>

4064
02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:50.270
<v Speaker 1>but then the question would be how when nobody else could do it,</v>

4065
02:03:50.630 --> 02:03:52.760
<v Speaker 1>how and why could he do it?</v>

4066
02:03:52.761 --> 02:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's always what obsesses me.</v>

4067
02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:56.660
<v Speaker 1>If you see him do it,</v>

4068
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:58.460
<v Speaker 1>there is now the explanation isn't,</v>

4069
02:03:58.670 --> 02:04:02.480
<v Speaker 1>he was better at closing the distance or his range management was excellent.</v>

4070
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.781
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

4071
02:04:02.781 --> 02:04:03.740
<v Speaker 1>That's true for a bit.</v>

4072
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:05.030
<v Speaker 1>But then my next question,</v>

4073
02:04:05.031 --> 02:04:06.140
<v Speaker 1>the next morning we'll be like,</v>

4074
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:07.490
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did he do it?</v>

4075
02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4076
02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.200
<v Speaker 1>What changed now?</v>

4077
02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>What about the,</v>

4078
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:12.620
<v Speaker 1>the entirety of the game itself,</v>

4079
02:04:12.621 --> 02:04:14.990
<v Speaker 1>the systems of the relationships of two fighters.</v>

4080
02:04:15.110 --> 02:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>What changed in such a way because of his behavior and that's where it gets to</v>

4081
02:04:19.641 --> 02:04:20.840
<v Speaker 1>me really,</v>

4082
02:04:20.841 --> 02:04:21.471
<v Speaker 1>really wild.</v>

4083
02:04:21.471 --> 02:04:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Because right now nobody gets to Stephen Thompson and I mean nobody really at</v>

4084
02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

4085
02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Well Tyron is knocked him down twice about him really badly.</v>

4086
02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>There's 50 minutes,</v>

4087
02:04:30.411 --> 02:04:31.520
<v Speaker 1>50 minutes,</v>

4088
02:04:31.590 --> 02:04:32.780
<v Speaker 1>and he had like the fight.</v>

4089
02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Those are the moments in the fight where they engaged.</v>

4090
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:36.960
<v Speaker 1>See the problem with those two Tyron Woodley fights,</v>

4091
02:04:37.290 --> 02:04:38.123
<v Speaker 1>Woodley fought</v>

4092
02:04:38.150 --> 02:04:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Wonderboy the right way.</v>

4093
02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:40.570
<v Speaker 3>That's how you got to fight them.</v>

4094
02:04:40.571 --> 02:04:41.401
<v Speaker 3>You don't engage.</v>

4095
02:04:41.401 --> 02:04:42.221
<v Speaker 3>And when you do engage,</v>

4096
02:04:42.221 --> 02:04:43.950
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be absolutely convinced you're going to land.</v>

4097
02:04:44.130 --> 02:04:46.440
<v Speaker 3>And Tyron did and did land and hurt them.</v>

4098
02:04:46.710 --> 02:04:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean you looked at those two fights.</v>

4099
02:04:48.121 --> 02:04:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Tyron is the one who's the wrestler,</v>

4100
02:04:49.770 --> 02:04:51.600
<v Speaker 3>but he's also the one that hurt Wonderboy.</v>

4101
02:04:51.601 --> 02:04:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Wonderboy never heard tire.</v>

4102
02:04:52.721 --> 02:04:53.430
<v Speaker 3>And in those fights,</v>

4103
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:54.020
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

4104
02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:56.090
<v Speaker 3>Tyron had him very close to being now.</v>

4105
02:04:56.460 --> 02:05:01.350
<v Speaker 3>And I just wonder if Wonderboy is starting to slip.</v>

4106
02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:01.891
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4107
02:05:01.891 --> 02:05:02.820
<v Speaker 3>you got to wonder,</v>

4108
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:05.610
<v Speaker 3>you gotta wonder if all his years of combat sports,</v>

4109
02:05:05.611 --> 02:05:08.240
<v Speaker 3>all of his years of kickboxing and you've got to remember this guy,</v>

4110
02:05:08.241 --> 02:05:10.620
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the most spectacular kickboxing records ever.</v>

4111
02:05:10.750 --> 02:05:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4112
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:11.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4113
02:05:11.131 --> 02:05:15.780
<v Speaker 3>what is it like 57 and oh or something like that and kickboxing and then he gets</v>

4114
02:05:15.781 --> 02:05:17.310
<v Speaker 3>into MMA and you know,</v>

4115
02:05:17.311 --> 02:05:19.350
<v Speaker 3>he loses to Matt Brown,</v>

4116
02:05:19.351 --> 02:05:21.000
<v Speaker 3>he gets kind of beat up on the ground,</v>

4117
02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:22.673
<v Speaker 3>comes back,</v>

4118
02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:24.930
<v Speaker 3>has some really good fights and you know,</v>

4119
02:05:24.931 --> 02:05:27.780
<v Speaker 3>it's been in there with world class fighters and beaten some world class</v>

4120
02:05:27.781 --> 02:05:28.500
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>

4121
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:29.520
<v Speaker 3>But he's also,</v>

4122
02:05:29.521 --> 02:05:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he's 34 35 right.</v>

4123
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>And that was a lot of fights,</v>

4124
02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>although we didn't get until recently until those three examples,</v>

4125
02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>he had really get hit all that much.</v>

4126
02:05:39.041 --> 02:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>But it's still the wearable tech Stephen Thompson</v>

4127
02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:42.410
<v Speaker 3>find out how wonderful it is.</v>

4128
02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:44.560
<v Speaker 3>It might even be 35 yep.</v>

4129
02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>The hips and the knees and the shoulders and that whole five 35.</v>

4130
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4131
02:05:48.730 --> 02:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4132
02:05:49.150 --> 02:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4133
02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:50.793
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4134
02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>and there's also that what he,</v>

4135
02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean he developed mastery in what he does.</v>

4136
02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4137
02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>And once you've developed that elite,</v>

4138
02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:02.380
<v Speaker 1>elite top level of reached your highest potential,</v>

4139
02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:03.850
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to keep going.</v>

4140
02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:09.540
<v Speaker 1>And then the masses start to close that distance though the general young kid</v>

4141
02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:10.360
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

4142
02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:10.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4143
02:06:10.571 --> 02:06:11.560
<v Speaker 1>a kid at Tristar,</v>

4144
02:06:11.561 --> 02:06:12.640
<v Speaker 1>like some of their young guys,</v>

4145
02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:16.300
<v Speaker 1>they have that and they've had Thompson in there for years and for us has been</v>

4146
02:06:16.301 --> 02:06:20.260
<v Speaker 1>able to study people like that up close and they all studied Leo Odo.</v>

4147
02:06:20.410 --> 02:06:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Now the young guy can do a lot of those things at a much higher level than</v>

4148
02:06:25.150 --> 02:06:26.500
<v Speaker 1>fighters that came before them.</v>

4149
02:06:26.501 --> 02:06:28.810
<v Speaker 1>So your level of mastery starts,</v>

4150
02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you plateau to a point that it's hard to go beyond.</v>

4151
02:06:31.541 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4152
02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:35.590
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard work and sometimes it requires you to get a little shittier for</v>

4153
02:06:35.591 --> 02:06:40.591
<v Speaker 1>a bit too to go past that plateau to weekend or get worse by having to reexamine</v>

4154
02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:46.000
<v Speaker 1>what you believe and the way that you train or the way that you fight to break</v>

4155
02:06:46.001 --> 02:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>through a plateau.</v>

4156
02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kind of be willing to go backwards a bit.</v>

4157
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And when you're fighting Tyron Woodley's of the world,</v>

4158
02:06:51.581 --> 02:06:52.780
<v Speaker 1>you cannot go backwards.</v>

4159
02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:55.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of kind of stalls you there.</v>

4160
02:06:55.001 --> 02:06:55.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4161
02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately the big question also is,</v>

4162
02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:02.710
<v Speaker 1>is there some other strategy that hasn't yet been done that is a Stephen</v>

4163
02:07:02.710 --> 02:07:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Thompson beater and that low leg kick?</v>

4164
02:07:04.121 --> 02:07:06.310
<v Speaker 1>You talked about that mate.</v>

4165
02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:07.990
<v Speaker 1>So I cannot get to you.</v>

4166
02:07:08.010 --> 02:07:11.860
<v Speaker 1>So what would I prefer when I'm fighting Stephen Thompson body lock.</v>

4167
02:07:11.861 --> 02:07:14.530
<v Speaker 1>If I can get to the body lock cover up and down to get to a body,</v>

4168
02:07:14.531 --> 02:07:15.550
<v Speaker 1>like I got to touch them.</v>

4169
02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:16.691
<v Speaker 1>That's really hard.</v>

4170
02:07:16.691 --> 02:07:20.260
<v Speaker 1>He stops me from doing that or I got to hit him or kick him.</v>

4171
02:07:20.261 --> 02:07:21.011
<v Speaker 1>But when I do that,</v>

4172
02:07:21.011 --> 02:07:22.000
<v Speaker 1>he moves away and hits.</v>

4173
02:07:22.150 --> 02:07:26.160
<v Speaker 1>What if I can just get to the edge of his sort of bubble of,</v>

4174
02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

4175
02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:27.690
<v Speaker 1>of hot,</v>

4176
02:07:27.690 --> 02:07:29.710
<v Speaker 1>that hot range where he can hurt you.</v>

4177
02:07:29.890 --> 02:07:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that low leg kick is a part of that,</v>

4178
02:07:32.010 --> 02:07:32.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4179
02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:33.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe that low leg kick,</v>

4180
02:07:33.311 --> 02:07:36.550
<v Speaker 1>just getting on the outside of it where you're still somewhat safe,</v>

4181
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:38.380
<v Speaker 1>but you can smash him up a little bit.</v>

4182
02:07:38.381 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe those are a weapon that hasn't been used.</v>

4183
02:07:40.450 --> 02:07:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>

4184
02:07:41.110 --> 02:07:46.110
<v Speaker 3>this is also arguably the best striker that wonder boys ever faced in MMA,</v>

4185
02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:47.700
<v Speaker 3>arguably,</v>

4186
02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:48.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4187
02:07:48.130 --> 02:07:50.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean Moskva is very talented striker as well.</v>

4188
02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:51.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4189
02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:56.280
<v Speaker 3>but Wonderboy is a master of that front leg and that front leg is a real tricky</v>

4190
02:07:56.891 --> 02:07:57.340
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

4191
02:07:57.340 --> 02:07:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Cause the,</v>

4192
02:07:57.730 --> 02:07:59.320
<v Speaker 3>that karate style that he uses,</v>

4193
02:07:59.321 --> 02:08:00.820
<v Speaker 3>he keeps his hands down low.</v>

4194
02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:04.750
<v Speaker 3>He stands totally sideways on you and you got to get past that front leg side</v>

4195
02:08:04.751 --> 02:08:06.430
<v Speaker 3>kick and Johnny couldn't get past it.</v>

4196
02:08:06.431 --> 02:08:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Hendricks got lit up by that front leg,</v>

4197
02:08:08.591 --> 02:08:11.470
<v Speaker 3>side kick and then front roundhouse kick to the face right afterwards.</v>

4198
02:08:11.471 --> 02:08:12.304
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

4199
02:08:12.370 --> 02:08:15.100
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going on with that front leg if you're not used to that.</v>

4200
02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:15.881
<v Speaker 3>And then if you,</v>

4201
02:08:15.881 --> 02:08:17.260
<v Speaker 3>if he'd get too obsessed with it,</v>

4202
02:08:17.261 --> 02:08:18.320
<v Speaker 3>the back leg comes.</v>

4203
02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4204
02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Till is a way better.</v>

4205
02:08:22.650 --> 02:08:24.460
<v Speaker 3>He's a way better master of distance.</v>

4206
02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:28.120
<v Speaker 3>He understands distance and strike and he knows how to close that distance with</v>

4207
02:08:28.121 --> 02:08:29.320
<v Speaker 3>explosive power.</v>

4208
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:30.453
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting.</v>

4209
02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Cause and before he fought cowboy,</v>

4210
02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:37.200
<v Speaker 1>his successes were fighting at distance and smashing guys who came in.</v>

4211
02:08:37.290 --> 02:08:39.300
<v Speaker 1>So he does do that.</v>

4212
02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:41.520
<v Speaker 1>He does by doing it,</v>

4213
02:08:41.550 --> 02:08:43.410
<v Speaker 1>you understand it on a different level,</v>

4214
02:08:43.411 --> 02:08:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you connect to it.</v>

4215
02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:45.810
<v Speaker 3>It is it in a mood tie way.</v>

4216
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:50.990
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Wonderboy doesn't the cry way and Wonderboy is fantastic at moving his</v>

4217
02:08:51.001 --> 02:08:54.130
<v Speaker 3>waist back and forth like a snake and jumped on.</v>

4218
02:08:54.170 --> 02:08:55.100
<v Speaker 3>He's really good at that too.</v>

4219
02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:55.591
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4220
02:08:55.591 --> 02:08:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Tony Ferguson's really fucking good.</v>

4221
02:08:57.450 --> 02:08:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4222
02:08:58.110 --> 02:08:58.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4223
02:08:58.560 --> 02:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

4224
02:08:59.250 --> 02:09:01.740
<v Speaker 1>so w when I get to go study,</v>

4225
02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4226
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Sanda and Kung Fu and you,</v>

4227
02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.550
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

4228
02:09:05.550 --> 02:09:06.630
<v Speaker 1>some of my friends are like,</v>

4229
02:09:06.631 --> 02:09:06.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4230
02:09:06.781 --> 02:09:07.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4231
02:09:07.650 --> 02:09:08.461
<v Speaker 1>like enjoy it.</v>

4232
02:09:08.461 --> 02:09:08.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4233
02:09:08.701 --> 02:09:08.941
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

4234
02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be some brilliant shit to learn over here.</v>

4235
02:09:11.251 --> 02:09:13.980
<v Speaker 1>This and some of that long fist stuff.</v>

4236
02:09:14.010 --> 02:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Like people will often say,</v>

4237
02:09:14.971 --> 02:09:15.101
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4238
02:09:15.101 --> 02:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Kung Fu is not super relevant.</v>

4239
02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Some of that long fist reaching where I move my body through space to reach you,</v>

4240
02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>which people would say is dangerous,</v>

4241
02:09:22.651 --> 02:09:23.484
<v Speaker 1>you get counted.</v>

4242
02:09:23.650 --> 02:09:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Well I check the answer is don't get countered.</v>

4243
02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>The answer isn't discard a valuable weapons.</v>

4244
02:09:28.290 --> 02:09:29.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you see some of that.</v>

4245
02:09:29.371 --> 02:09:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Tony does that stuff really,</v>

4246
02:09:30.901 --> 02:09:31.261
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

4247
02:09:31.261 --> 02:09:31.840
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

4248
02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of really cool.</v>

4249
02:09:32.911 --> 02:09:37.911
<v Speaker 1>He does see him work with the wing Chung cool man wing chunk too.</v>

4250
02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:40.950
<v Speaker 1>When I'm sitting in your guard wanting to beat you up.</v>

4251
02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:41.551
<v Speaker 1>Tell me that.</v>

4252
02:09:41.551 --> 02:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Isn't wing Chung just were attached.</v>

4253
02:09:43.230 --> 02:09:44.063
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

4254
02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is,</v>

4255
02:09:45.271 --> 02:09:45.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4256
02:09:45.610 --> 02:09:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4257
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:50.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's techniques in every single art that are like an established</v>

4258
02:09:50.051 --> 02:09:51.820
<v Speaker 3>realistic art that are valuable.</v>

4259
02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:52.451
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4260
02:09:52.451 --> 02:09:52.751
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

4261
02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:56.190
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be something in wing Chung the people are missing for sure.</v>

4262
02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:57.053
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

4263
02:09:57.570 --> 02:09:58.403
<v Speaker 1>Santa,</v>

4264
02:09:58.470 --> 02:10:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean art's psych that people would look at and Mike Discard because they would</v>

4265
02:10:03.961 --> 02:10:06.030
<v Speaker 1>think they're limited to only this scenario.</v>

4266
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Well that scenario happens if I'm in your garden,</v>

4267
02:10:09.211 --> 02:10:10.044
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight.</v>

4268
02:10:10.170 --> 02:10:10.950
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

4269
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:11.880
<v Speaker 1>that's that scenario.</v>

4270
02:10:12.110 --> 02:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>So that thing may not be useful to fight,</v>

4271
02:10:14.970 --> 02:10:15.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4272
02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:16.673
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir.</v>

4273
02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:19.390
<v Speaker 1>But that thing will be useful in a context when you're fighting.</v>

4274
02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:19.841
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4275
02:10:19.841 --> 02:10:21.070
<v Speaker 3>how about Jon Jones?</v>

4276
02:10:21.071 --> 02:10:25.960
<v Speaker 3>His use of you grab his wrist and he comes over the top of an elbow that is hand</v>

4277
02:10:25.961 --> 02:10:26.520
<v Speaker 3>tramping.</v>

4278
02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4279
02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:27.160
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

4280
02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:28.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really wasn't is what it is.</v>

4281
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Leverage a Sherif.</v>

4282
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh Yeah,</v>

4283
02:10:30.850 --> 02:10:31.550
<v Speaker 3>limb distraction.</v>

4284
02:10:31.550 --> 02:10:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

4285
02:10:31.930 --> 02:10:32.710
<v Speaker 3>That's old school.</v>

4286
02:10:32.710 --> 02:10:33.170
<v Speaker 3>The structure.</v>

4287
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4288
02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 3>How and</v>

4289
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.040
<v Speaker 2>why that hasn't been rabid hauled a lot more,</v>

4290
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:40.770
<v Speaker 2>although he's do start to see that and that moment where were,</v>

4291
02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:41.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4292
02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I get to all four,</v>

4293
02:10:42.621 --> 02:10:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I get to four points that I'm going to stand up and you just kind of decide,</v>

4294
02:10:45.681 --> 02:10:46.011
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4295
02:10:46.011 --> 02:10:46.491
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

4296
02:10:46.491 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 2>We'll get back to the fence in that process of standing up,</v>

4297
02:10:49.401 --> 02:10:50.900
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys throw a fight,</v>

4298
02:10:50.901 --> 02:10:55.250
<v Speaker 2>finishing kick there or just at least take that chance to smash your leg with</v>

4299
02:10:55.251 --> 02:10:55.491
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

4300
02:10:55.491 --> 02:11:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Like there's free shots that exist in these moments and Jon Jones is a master of</v>

4301
02:11:00.141 --> 02:11:00.950
<v Speaker 2>finding them.</v>

4302
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:01.783
<v Speaker 2>He really is.</v>

4303
02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4304
02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:05.690
<v Speaker 2>I hope they figure out what the fuck they're going to do with him soon.</v>

4305
02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:10.691
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where they stand now in terms of like his suspension or what have</v>

4306
02:11:11.151 --> 02:11:11.361
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4307
02:11:11.361 --> 02:11:13.700
<v Speaker 2>but here's my ultimate goal,</v>

4308
02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:14.593
<v Speaker 2>my hope,</v>

4309
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:17.480
<v Speaker 2>my dream is that core me a fight,</v>

4310
02:11:17.481 --> 02:11:22.481
<v Speaker 2>Steve Bay for the heavyweight title and somewhere around then they announce when</v>

4311
02:11:23.061 --> 02:11:23.741
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones,</v>

4312
02:11:23.741 --> 02:11:24.830
<v Speaker 2>the suspension is up,</v>

4313
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:27.250
<v Speaker 2>they announced John Jones versus Brock Lesnar.</v>

4314
02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>

4315
02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

4316
02:11:30.081 --> 02:11:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

4317
02:11:30.770 --> 02:11:34.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at their body types and look at what they are and where did they</v>

4318
02:11:34.221 --> 02:11:34.701
<v Speaker 2>come from.</v>

4319
02:11:34.701 --> 02:11:34.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4320
02:11:34.941 --> 02:11:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I love it,</v>

4321
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:39.530
<v Speaker 2>but I know you've sat down with John and and stuff,</v>

4322
02:11:39.810 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 2>but what did you like,</v>

4323
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:43.910
<v Speaker 2>what did he feel like you do you know what I mean?</v>

4324
02:11:43.911 --> 02:11:44.744
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

4325
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:47.090
<v Speaker 2>what Reed did you get from him?</v>

4326
02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel like he was saying the things that he thought you wanted to hear or</v>

4327
02:11:51.531 --> 02:11:53.810
<v Speaker 2>did you feel he was being honest and genuine?</v>

4328
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:54.763
<v Speaker 2>Definitely both.</v>

4329
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Easy and honest.</v>

4330
02:11:55.731 --> 02:11:57.950
<v Speaker 2>And he's also had some things that he planned out.</v>

4331
02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I like John a lot.</v>

4332
02:11:59.450 --> 02:12:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I really love that guy,</v>

4333
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:03.260
<v Speaker 2>but I think he surrounds himself with a bunch of knuckleheads.</v>

4334
02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:04.513
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>

4335
02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:07.490
<v Speaker 2>he's around too many people that are a bad influence.</v>

4336
02:12:07.491 --> 02:12:09.080
<v Speaker 2>And I think he's,</v>

4337
02:12:09.081 --> 02:12:10.310
<v Speaker 2>he's a wild man.</v>

4338
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:14.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think when he's a wild man around other people that are sort of indulging</v>

4339
02:12:14.661 --> 02:12:15.530
<v Speaker 2>that stuff with them,</v>

4340
02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:16.820
<v Speaker 2>this is the word that I get,</v>

4341
02:12:16.821 --> 02:12:18.710
<v Speaker 2>not just from what I know,</v>

4342
02:12:18.711 --> 02:12:22.550
<v Speaker 2>but from the people that know him very well is that he's just around the wrong</v>

4343
02:12:22.551 --> 02:12:23.180
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

4344
02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:23.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4345
02:12:23.421 --> 02:12:24.800
<v Speaker 2>he's got bad influences.</v>

4346
02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:26.173
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4347
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:28.400
<v Speaker 2>if you can identify that,</v>

4348
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:29.630
<v Speaker 2>then you must change it.</v>

4349
02:12:29.631 --> 02:12:30.171
<v Speaker 2>Yet it's not,</v>

4350
02:12:30.171 --> 02:12:32.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not to take any personal responsibility away from him either,</v>

4351
02:12:32.961 --> 02:12:37.640
<v Speaker 2>because I'm sure he also makes for a bad influence to them.</v>

4352
02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:37.921
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4353
02:12:37.921 --> 02:12:38.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4354
02:12:38.081 --> 02:12:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4355
02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:40.700
<v Speaker 2>the fucking baddest man on the planet can live like this.</v>

4356
02:12:40.701 --> 02:12:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll live like this to fuck it.</v>

4357
02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Let's do more coke and know it's what's party harder.</v>

4358
02:12:44.751 --> 02:12:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Let's drive fast.</v>

4359
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:46.363
<v Speaker 2>Let's go drunk.</v>

4360
02:12:46.670 --> 02:12:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4361
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4362
02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:48.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4363
02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the answer is.</v>

4364
02:12:49.401 --> 02:12:49.620
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

4365
02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:51.020
<v Speaker 2>we're a guy like John,</v>

4366
02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:51.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4367
02:12:51.321 --> 02:12:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know.</v>

4368
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:52.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4369
02:12:52.551 --> 02:12:53.384
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4370
02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:55.610
<v Speaker 2>it's got to have that come to Jesus moment.</v>

4371
02:12:55.611 --> 02:12:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4372
02:12:56.210 --> 02:12:57.043
<v Speaker 2>Or not.</v>

4373
02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:57.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4374
02:12:57.441 --> 02:13:01.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe he just keeps doing what he's doing and keeps beating everybody's ass and</v>

4375
02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:04.700
<v Speaker 2>people keep forgiving them and hopefully it doesn't wind up in jail.</v>

4376
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:07.820
<v Speaker 2>But he should for sure get a driver for sure.</v>

4377
02:13:07.821 --> 02:13:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Get someone to fucking drive him around.</v>

4378
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:09.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad,</v>

4379
02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:10.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a good bandaid.</v>

4380
02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:11.601
<v Speaker 2>But it's not going to be,</v>

4381
02:13:11.601 --> 02:13:12.860
<v Speaker 2>that's not the problem solver.</v>

4382
02:13:13.070 --> 02:13:14.120
<v Speaker 2>The truth is I think,</v>

4383
02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean we get to live the life that we want.</v>

4384
02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Like we get to choose the things that we do.</v>

4385
02:13:20.901 --> 02:13:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Like we have free to a certain extent to a certain extent.</v>

4386
02:13:23.691 --> 02:13:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I know freewill is something that's been deceived,</v>

4387
02:13:26.001 --> 02:13:26.801
<v Speaker 2>discussed and it's,</v>

4388
02:13:26.801 --> 02:13:28.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating concept,</v>

4389
02:13:28.190 --> 02:13:29.420
<v Speaker 2>but to some degree,</v>

4390
02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:30.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4391
02:13:30.111 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>we are offering own lives,</v>

4392
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:32.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4393
02:13:32.581 --> 02:13:32.731
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4394
02:13:32.731 --> 02:13:34.950
<v Speaker 1>and if it isn't going the way that you want it,</v>

4395
02:13:35.470 --> 02:13:38.430
<v Speaker 1>small tiny changes can push it a different way.</v>

4396
02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:39.433
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4397
02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:42.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter of whether or not he's willing to make those changes.</v>

4398
02:13:42.051 --> 02:13:42.830
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4399
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:45.800
<v Speaker 4>right now I'm sure he just wants to get his license back,</v>

4400
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:47.060
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4401
02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:51.110
<v Speaker 4>But like when I see him like having these battles back and forth with chuck</v>

4402
02:13:51.111 --> 02:13:52.160
<v Speaker 4>Ladell Online,</v>

4403
02:13:52.161 --> 02:13:54.650
<v Speaker 4>like you got a bark away from that.</v>

4404
02:13:55.190 --> 02:13:56.030
<v Speaker 4>Like Chuck Odell,</v>

4405
02:13:56.031 --> 02:14:00.260
<v Speaker 4>some old warrior who is clearly taking too many shots like,</v>

4406
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:02.120
<v Speaker 4>and you know the s you know,</v>

4407
02:14:02.121 --> 02:14:07.121
<v Speaker 4>calling him an old man and saying all this stuff and it's like just be the</v>

4408
02:14:07.251 --> 02:14:08.900
<v Speaker 4>better man in this situation.</v>

4409
02:14:08.901 --> 02:14:09.121
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

4410
02:14:09.121 --> 02:14:12.230
<v Speaker 4>you're the top of the heap right now at the top of your game.</v>

4411
02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:17.560
<v Speaker 4>You don't want some young guy doing this to you 15 years from now talking to you</v>

4412
02:14:17.721 --> 02:14:18.261
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>

4413
02:14:18.261 --> 02:14:18.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4414
02:14:18.501 --> 02:14:19.050
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>

4415
02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:20.600
<v Speaker 4>these are the dark days,</v>

4416
02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:22.850
<v Speaker 1>but when we turn the TV on,</v>

4417
02:14:22.970 --> 02:14:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you watch CNN or Fox or CNBC or whatever,</v>

4418
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:30.740
<v Speaker 1>or the NFL or hockey or fighting or whatever.</v>

4419
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:34.640
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what we see is a bunch of heads who somebody has said you choose</v>

4420
02:14:34.641 --> 02:14:37.010
<v Speaker 1>different sides or they know that's what they should do.</v>

4421
02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:39.200
<v Speaker 1>And then they just argue and we watch it.</v>

4422
02:14:39.230 --> 02:14:39.860
<v Speaker 1>We're taught it,</v>

4423
02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:41.150
<v Speaker 1>we see it every single day,</v>

4424
02:14:41.210 --> 02:14:42.043
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

4425
02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:42.841
<v Speaker 4>You crazy.</v>

4426
02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:46.980
<v Speaker 4>It drives me crazy and transmits to fighting the sports guy talk.</v>

4427
02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4428
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:51.840
<v Speaker 4>that drives me nuts when it comes to fighting because they have this sort of</v>

4429
02:14:51.841 --> 02:14:56.841
<v Speaker 4>robotic predetermined pattern of behavior that they apply to football and</v>

4430
02:14:58.291 --> 02:15:03.291
<v Speaker 4>baseball and I just feel like fighting is just more personal,</v>

4431
02:15:03.391 --> 02:15:05.790
<v Speaker 4>more intimate is there's more on the line,</v>

4432
02:15:05.791 --> 02:15:06.780
<v Speaker 4>there's more at stake.</v>

4433
02:15:06.781 --> 02:15:11.781
<v Speaker 4>It means more to me and when I see that dopey sports guide jock talk applied to</v>

4434
02:15:12.421 --> 02:15:12.871
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

4435
02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 4>it makes me angry.</v>

4436
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.060
<v Speaker 1>It makes me angry too,</v>

4437
02:15:15.090 --> 02:15:17.550
<v Speaker 1>but for different reasons as well.</v>

4438
02:15:17.551 --> 02:15:19.440
<v Speaker 1>One is this,</v>

4439
02:15:19.770 --> 02:15:23.970
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't apply exactly as you said and the other one is the city of apply to</v>

4440
02:15:23.971 --> 02:15:26.490
<v Speaker 1>football or anything because it's ritualistic,</v>

4441
02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:29.340
<v Speaker 1>like it acts as if this show doesn't exist.</v>

4442
02:15:30.090 --> 02:15:31.080
<v Speaker 1>The reason it looks,</v>

4443
02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:34.380
<v Speaker 1>so we were talking about how things meanings change once upon a time.</v>

4444
02:15:34.381 --> 02:15:35.760
<v Speaker 1>That was a professional speaker.</v>

4445
02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Now that is a rehearsed over,</v>

4446
02:15:38.131 --> 02:15:38.970
<v Speaker 1>strategized,</v>

4447
02:15:38.971 --> 02:15:42.810
<v Speaker 1>constructed artificial speaker and in a world where someone watches the fucking</v>

4448
02:15:42.811 --> 02:15:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast or goes on and sees Dwayne training guys or watches a</v>

4449
02:15:47.191 --> 02:15:50.670
<v Speaker 1>supermodel on Instagram or sees what the rock is cooking.</v>

4450
02:15:50.671 --> 02:15:51.504
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

4451
02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:53.520
<v Speaker 1>we see real people everywhere.</v>

4452
02:15:53.521 --> 02:15:57.600
<v Speaker 1>So now this becomes ritualistic and artificial.</v>

4453
02:15:57.710 --> 02:16:00.620
<v Speaker 4>It's a strip club Dj to hey come into the top stage.</v>

4454
02:16:00.710 --> 02:16:05.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like that pre determined sort of pattern of behavior.</v>

4455
02:16:05.150 --> 02:16:08.150
<v Speaker 4>The they adopt this pattern and you know,</v>

4456
02:16:08.151 --> 02:16:12.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that adopt that sports guy pattern and there's a lot of</v>

4457
02:16:12.201 --> 02:16:13.940
<v Speaker 4>shitty writers that do it too.</v>

4458
02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:19.460
<v Speaker 4>And they apply that insulting style of writing to combat sports.</v>

4459
02:16:19.461 --> 02:16:23.680
<v Speaker 4>And some of them have never been inside a cage and most in life and apparently</v>

4460
02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:24.573
<v Speaker 4>even trained.</v>

4461
02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4462
02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:25.361
<v Speaker 1>no it,</v>

4463
02:16:25.361 --> 02:16:25.551
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4464
02:16:25.551 --> 02:16:26.384
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4465
02:16:26.450 --> 02:16:27.283
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

4466
02:16:28.130 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 1>if you have not been kicked</v>

4467
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.690
<v Speaker 2>in the fucking head in front of your mother,</v>

4468
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you have no right to criticize.</v>

4469
02:16:33.810 --> 02:16:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Never saw me fight my mom.</v>

4470
02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I fucking got got God.</v>

4471
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:38.663
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

4472
02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want that pressure.</v>

4473
02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:44.080
<v Speaker 2>A couple of punches happening and I get caught in the guillotine and I'm</v>

4474
02:16:44.081 --> 02:16:47.350
<v Speaker 2>thinking I'm okay and I'm driving my shoulder in and then I start to go out and</v>

4475
02:16:47.351 --> 02:16:47.801
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

4476
02:16:47.801 --> 02:16:51.760
<v Speaker 2>and I kind of hit him in the eye tap and I look up and my mom is right fucking</v>

4477
02:16:51.761 --> 02:16:52.330
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4478
02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:53.200
<v Speaker 2>She's right there.</v>

4479
02:16:53.650 --> 02:16:55.510
<v Speaker 2>And my mom.</v>

4480
02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.710
<v Speaker 2>My family is wonderful,</v>

4481
02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:57.071
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4482
02:16:57.071 --> 02:17:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Like I got the best wife that the humans have ever had in my parents and her</v>

4483
02:17:01.451 --> 02:17:01.970
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

4484
02:17:01.970 --> 02:17:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm surrounded by great people and I know that my mother literally was looking</v>

4485
02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:07.624
<v Speaker 2>at me like,</v>

4486
02:17:07.630 --> 02:17:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud of you.</v>

4487
02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:09.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4488
02:17:09.610 --> 02:17:10.241
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>

4489
02:17:10.241 --> 02:17:10.930
<v Speaker 2>this happens,</v>

4490
02:17:10.930 --> 02:17:12.400
<v Speaker 2>but my memory has are going</v>

4491
02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:15.250
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

4492
02:17:15.250 --> 02:17:16.480
<v Speaker 2>She's probably just sad.</v>

4493
02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4494
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:17.501
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

4495
02:17:17.501 --> 02:17:18.370
<v Speaker 2>She's going to shake her head.</v>

4496
02:17:18.371 --> 02:17:19.204
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4497
02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:19.601
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

4498
02:17:19.601 --> 02:17:19.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4499
02:17:19.991 --> 02:17:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but I mean if you haven't been to that,</v>

4500
02:17:21.851 --> 02:17:23.380
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't experienced failure,</v>

4501
02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:27.550
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't been carried out on a stretcher as everybody booze you or it felt</v>

4502
02:17:27.551 --> 02:17:29.080
<v Speaker 2>victory or been terrified,</v>

4503
02:17:29.290 --> 02:17:34.290
<v Speaker 2>you cannot logically criticized them because you don't understand the thing.</v>

4504
02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:37.600
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't done it,</v>

4505
02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:39.310
<v Speaker 2>if you have some respect for it,</v>

4506
02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:40.153
<v Speaker 2>I'll respect you.</v>

4507
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Just just understand what they're going through like you.</v>

4508
02:17:42.421 --> 02:17:44.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you necessarily have to have gone to war to be a war</v>

4509
02:17:44.951 --> 02:17:45.784
<v Speaker 2>correspondent,</v>

4510
02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:46.990
<v Speaker 2>to understand it,</v>

4511
02:17:46.991 --> 02:17:47.741
<v Speaker 2>to talk about it.</v>

4512
02:17:47.741 --> 02:17:51.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have shot someone to be able to understand what people are</v>

4513
02:17:51.731 --> 02:17:54.670
<v Speaker 2>going through or at least try to comprehend it,</v>

4514
02:17:54.671 --> 02:17:56.210
<v Speaker 2>but have some respect about it.</v>

4515
02:17:56.260 --> 02:18:00.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a way to criticize technique and movement without being insulting.</v>

4516
02:18:00.850 --> 02:18:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is a part of the problem with this.</v>

4517
02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:06.220
<v Speaker 2>The sports guy attitude isn't insulting attitude.</v>

4518
02:18:06.430 --> 02:18:07.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a judgmental one.</v>

4519
02:18:07.601 --> 02:18:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4520
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:12.650
<v Speaker 2>It's judgmental and mocking and I think they played a Johnny lunchbox.</v>

4521
02:18:12.670 --> 02:18:17.530
<v Speaker 2>I think they play to dumb dumbs and I just that it really hurts my feelings when</v>

4522
02:18:17.531 --> 02:18:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I see that sort of strategy applied to covering mixed martial arts.</v>

4523
02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4524
02:18:22.210 --> 02:18:23.410
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

4525
02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it acts as if as less and less people consume this older but valid,</v>

4526
02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:31.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4527
02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:32.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4528
02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:37.200
<v Speaker 2>interface television less and less and more and more are consuming other things</v>

4529
02:18:37.631 --> 02:18:39.120
<v Speaker 2>that are different and new and,</v>

4530
02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:39.970
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

4531
02:18:39.970 --> 02:18:43.000
<v Speaker 2>It's bizarre that the old one starts to say,</v>

4532
02:18:43.001 --> 02:18:43.151
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4533
02:18:43.151 --> 02:18:44.290
<v Speaker 2>well we still do it this way.</v>

4534
02:18:44.490 --> 02:18:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4535
02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:48.850
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it that way because people now it looks weird and old now it looks,</v>

4536
02:18:49.090 --> 02:18:53.320
<v Speaker 2>it's context has changed because we have seen thousands,</v>

4537
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:57.340
<v Speaker 2>we've seen what Michael Chandler eight today and how he helped his son and this</v>

4538
02:18:57.341 --> 02:18:57.941
<v Speaker 2>guy is saying,</v>

4539
02:18:57.941 --> 02:18:58.181
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4540
02:18:58.181 --> 02:18:58.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4541
02:18:58.990 --> 02:19:00.580
<v Speaker 2>a striker versus grappler like,</v>

4542
02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:02.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

4543
02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you haven't evolved.</v>

4544
02:19:03.370 --> 02:19:03.610
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4545
02:19:03.610 --> 02:19:03.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4546
02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:08.170
<v Speaker 2>you have to step in and this applies to us all.</v>

4547
02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:11.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to reset up and look at where you are and what it's meaning is and</v>

4548
02:19:11.771 --> 02:19:12.250
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

4549
02:19:12.250 --> 02:19:12.640
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4550
02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:13.151
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

4551
02:19:13.151 --> 02:19:15.280
<v Speaker 2>change the audience change the world changed my life,</v>

4552
02:19:15.281 --> 02:19:17.170
<v Speaker 2>changed the economy,</v>

4553
02:19:17.171 --> 02:19:18.004
<v Speaker 2>changed the market.</v>

4554
02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:19.240
<v Speaker 2>All of these things have changed.</v>

4555
02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:20.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm still the same.</v>

4556
02:19:20.470 --> 02:19:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I met,</v>

4557
02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dinosaur.</v>

4558
02:19:21.851 --> 02:19:22.571
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense.</v>

4559
02:19:22.571 --> 02:19:23.261
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

4560
02:19:23.261 --> 02:19:24.094
<v Speaker 2>I must change.</v>

4561
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4562
02:19:24.610 --> 02:19:26.410
<v Speaker 2>But the reason sports,</v>

4563
02:19:26.411 --> 02:19:27.140
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

4564
02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 2>the NFL or</v>

4565
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:28.970
<v Speaker 1>many of these things,</v>

4566
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:33.020
<v Speaker 1>news doesn't is it starts out that there are innovators.</v>

4567
02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:38.140
<v Speaker 1>So in fighting it was Dana White and the fatigue does and you guys and vital</v>

4568
02:19:38.361 --> 02:19:43.361
<v Speaker 1>young innovative creators and then as it grows you need organized thinkers.</v>

4569
02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:48.920
<v Speaker 1>You need people who can organize and structure something so that it can grow.</v>

4570
02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:52.400
<v Speaker 1>The problem is they get really good at structuring hierarchies that get really</v>

4571
02:19:52.401 --> 02:19:56.690
<v Speaker 1>good at structuring business in such a way that they are then in charge and then</v>

4572
02:19:56.691 --> 02:19:57.411
<v Speaker 1>when it changes,</v>

4573
02:19:57.411 --> 02:19:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you need those creatives again.</v>

4574
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.570
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

4575
02:19:59.570 --> 02:20:03.830
<v Speaker 1>but these structure guys are there and they've built these formulas that they</v>

4576
02:20:03.831 --> 02:20:05.510
<v Speaker 1>are then bound by where it's like,</v>

4577
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4578
02:20:05.811 --> 02:20:08.210
<v Speaker 1>of course we're going starting with the opening shot and then we're going to go,</v>

4579
02:20:08.211 --> 02:20:09.500
<v Speaker 1>we're right here in Brazil,</v>

4580
02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:10.880
<v Speaker 1>shot of the Christ,</v>

4581
02:20:10.881 --> 02:20:11.571
<v Speaker 1>the redeemer,</v>

4582
02:20:11.571 --> 02:20:13.060
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll go and here we've got a,</v>

4583
02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:14.600
<v Speaker 1>oh it's so unbelievable.</v>

4584
02:20:14.601 --> 02:20:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Matchup with the winner gets a title shot.</v>

4585
02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Those are rituals.</v>

4586
02:20:17.350 --> 02:20:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It was a bizarre formulaic rituals created when they mattered and there were</v>

4587
02:20:21.561 --> 02:20:24.500
<v Speaker 1>valuable by highly intelligent people that,</v>

4588
02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:27.380
<v Speaker 1>that were required to make this work.</v>

4589
02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:28.790
<v Speaker 1>But now you need different people,</v>

4590
02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you need a different thought,</v>

4591
02:20:29.841 --> 02:20:30.261
<v Speaker 1>you need crew,</v>

4592
02:20:30.261 --> 02:20:32.960
<v Speaker 1>the creatives back in and they usually don't want that.</v>

4593
02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:34.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4594
02:20:34.201 --> 02:20:34.641
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4595
02:20:34.641 --> 02:20:34.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4596
02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:39.860
<v Speaker 4>I like your point about different approaches and I think one of the best ways to</v>

4597
02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:44.820
<v Speaker 4>maybe perhaps have a different approach is to have more intense coverage of</v>

4598
02:20:44.821 --> 02:20:45.750
<v Speaker 4>training footage.</v>

4599
02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:46.291
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4600
02:20:46.291 --> 02:20:49.680
<v Speaker 4>and I think they're doing that with the embedded series of those online things.</v>

4601
02:20:49.681 --> 02:20:51.360
<v Speaker 4>I'd like more people to check those out.</v>

4602
02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:55.620
<v Speaker 4>I think if more people got an understanding of how much is involved in this,</v>

4603
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:57.900
<v Speaker 4>like when people get injured and pull out a fight,</v>

4604
02:20:57.901 --> 02:21:01.290
<v Speaker 4>it's like some people will freak out and complain and write a bunch of stupid</v>

4605
02:21:01.291 --> 02:21:01.531
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

4606
02:21:01.531 --> 02:21:03.540
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know what happened to Mirko Cro cop,</v>

4607
02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:06.090
<v Speaker 4>but you can't say anything bad about him,</v>

4608
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:07.620
<v Speaker 4>but he's a superhero.</v>

4609
02:21:07.621 --> 02:21:07.891
<v Speaker 4>The Guy,</v>

4610
02:21:07.891 --> 02:21:09.420
<v Speaker 4>if that guy pulls out of a fight,</v>

4611
02:21:09.421 --> 02:21:09.871
<v Speaker 4>you've got to go.</v>

4612
02:21:09.871 --> 02:21:10.081
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4613
02:21:10.081 --> 02:21:14.280
<v Speaker 4>he obviously must be too hurt to fight and this is part of the game,</v>

4614
02:21:14.610 --> 02:21:14.971
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4615
02:21:14.971 --> 02:21:15.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4616
02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:19.020
<v Speaker 4>but I've read some ridiculous shit that people have said about Mirko online.</v>

4617
02:21:19.021 --> 02:21:21.480
<v Speaker 4>Like I went to Canelo's page the other day.</v>

4618
02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:22.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

4619
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:25.230
<v Speaker 4>there's pictures of Canelo Alvarez and people are,</v>

4620
02:21:25.231 --> 02:21:25.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4621
02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:26.880
<v Speaker 4>judging his body and saying,</v>

4622
02:21:26.881 --> 02:21:27.990
<v Speaker 4>it looks tiny now.</v>

4623
02:21:27.991 --> 02:21:28.390
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4624
02:21:28.390 --> 02:21:33.390
<v Speaker 4>and there's all these emojis of pills and needles all throughout his entire</v>

4625
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:36.190
<v Speaker 4>Instagram posts.</v>

4626
02:21:36.191 --> 02:21:36.811
<v Speaker 4>There's fucking,</v>

4627
02:21:36.811 --> 02:21:38.430
<v Speaker 4>the comments are ruthless.</v>

4628
02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Just ruthlessly fucking insult.</v>

4629
02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Dang.</v>

4630
02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4631
02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:44.210
<v Speaker 1>this is just the world we live in.</v>

4632
02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I did a breakdown on Vito and like you know,</v>

4633
02:21:47.961 --> 02:21:51.250
<v Speaker 1>he'd go in and then Instagram is the law,</v>

4634
02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:54.770
<v Speaker 1>at least in my experience is the least negative cause it's the newest.</v>

4635
02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:56.810
<v Speaker 1>What's the most top negatively youtube.</v>

4636
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

4637
02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4638
02:21:58.010 --> 02:21:59.210
<v Speaker 1>because it's the oldest,</v>

4639
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4640
02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:03.050
<v Speaker 1>It's the oldest because as things get older,</v>

4641
02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:06.560
<v Speaker 1>a lot of negativity is around and positive people leave positive.</v>

4642
02:22:06.561 --> 02:22:11.030
<v Speaker 1>People leave because they go on there on the early part of the technological</v>

4643
02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:12.770
<v Speaker 1>adoption life cycle,</v>

4644
02:22:12.860 --> 02:22:16.730
<v Speaker 1>positive people are innovators and early adopters and they go onto the newer</v>

4645
02:22:16.731 --> 02:22:20.300
<v Speaker 1>thing and then you leave behind the people who are negative and made the whole</v>

4646
02:22:20.301 --> 02:22:22.460
<v Speaker 1>place go septic and then that is argue with each other.</v>

4647
02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:24.550
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's the case I want,</v>

4648
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I've never figured out</v>

4649
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.140
<v Speaker 3>what is wrong with youtube comments,</v>

4650
02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:33.440
<v Speaker 3>but there are so ruthless like whenever I have a liberal woman on in particular</v>

4651
02:22:35.350 --> 02:22:38.740
<v Speaker 1>who you have on with an open mind and are interested in their perspective.</v>

4652
02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:41.840
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are my friends like Abby Martin when when she's on,</v>

4653
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:45.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't even fucking touch those Commons or Whitney Whitney Cummings is on.</v>

4654
02:22:45.261 --> 02:22:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean I don't look at the comments period,</v>

4655
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:48.081
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>

4656
02:22:48.081 --> 02:22:48.914
<v Speaker 3>but if I did,</v>

4657
02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:51.680
<v Speaker 3>those would be the last ones that I would look because Dave looked at them</v>

4658
02:22:51.681 --> 02:22:53.780
<v Speaker 3>before and like Whitney contracts in me and she's like,</v>

4659
02:22:53.781 --> 02:22:54.000
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

4660
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:54.833
<v Speaker 1>And the fuck.</v>

4661
02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:55.770
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4662
02:22:55.770 --> 02:22:57.300
<v Speaker 1>don't read that shit.</v>

4663
02:22:57.301 --> 02:22:58.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't taste the poison.</v>

4664
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4665
02:22:59.330 --> 02:23:00.163
<v Speaker 1>If the,</v>

4666
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:02.250
<v Speaker 1>wherever the positive people are,</v>

4667
02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:03.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to spend time.</v>

4668
02:23:03.991 --> 02:23:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And I like too,</v>

4669
02:23:04.831 --> 02:23:08.970
<v Speaker 1>because if 50,000 people watched me do a breakdown,</v>

4670
02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:10.620
<v Speaker 1>that means a lot to me.</v>

4671
02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4672
02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And if 60 of them commented,</v>

4673
02:23:13.170 --> 02:23:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

4674
02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:15.990
<v Speaker 1>If I can schedule on the day 45 minutes,</v>

4675
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take the time and thank as many of them as I can,</v>

4676
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:20.910
<v Speaker 1>but only where the good way only where the positive ones are.</v>

4677
02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Not that I want to be reinforced that what I'm doing right.</v>

4678
02:23:24.210 --> 02:23:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to spend the time on people who are going through life so negative</v>

4679
02:23:28.470 --> 02:23:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that I can't get through to them anyways.</v>

4680
02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4681
02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who's going through life looking for something and trying to to either</v>

4682
02:23:33.811 --> 02:23:36.780
<v Speaker 1>be inspired or learn something or by positive,</v>

4683
02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:38.940
<v Speaker 1>those are the people that you should spend time with.</v>

4684
02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's also like the reverse of giving candy to your kid when they're bad.</v>

4685
02:23:43.171 --> 02:23:43.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4686
02:23:43.421 --> 02:23:46.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't go give those people candy when they're negative.</v>

4687
02:23:46.081 --> 02:23:48.000
<v Speaker 1>If you want them to get away from that,</v>

4688
02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:49.500
<v Speaker 1>you want their lives to get better,</v>

4689
02:23:49.501 --> 02:23:52.020
<v Speaker 1>which it will if they stop having that behavior.</v>

4690
02:23:52.410 --> 02:23:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4691
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe of</v>

4692
02:23:54.810 --> 02:23:56.110
<v Speaker 3>from are just so broken.</v>

4693
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:56.530
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

4694
02:23:56.530 --> 02:23:59.470
<v Speaker 3>it's just like their structure is so poor.</v>

4695
02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:03.820
<v Speaker 3>The structure of their thinking is so poor and you know all a lot of them are</v>

4696
02:24:03.821 --> 02:24:07.090
<v Speaker 3>like shut-ins and does a lot of people with mental illness that are just</v>

4697
02:24:07.091 --> 02:24:08.290
<v Speaker 3>constantly commenting.</v>

4698
02:24:08.291 --> 02:24:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4699
02:24:08.770 --> 02:24:12.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean and then there's the argument to like kill the comments,</v>

4700
02:24:12.281 --> 02:24:14.440
<v Speaker 3>but then people get furious at you.</v>

4701
02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:18.820
<v Speaker 3>We had an issue for a while and it was an accidental issue and the issue was</v>

4702
02:24:18.970 --> 02:24:19.990
<v Speaker 3>during the stream,</v>

4703
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:24.190
<v Speaker 3>we don't allow the live chat because it was always like con to your mother's a</v>

4704
02:24:24.210 --> 02:24:28.630
<v Speaker 3>con like Horse Shit because people would just try to get attention.</v>

4705
02:24:28.631 --> 02:24:32.440
<v Speaker 3>If we read that stream while we were doing the show,</v>

4706
02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:35.620
<v Speaker 3>the show would be inexorably altered,</v>

4707
02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:36.693
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4708
02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:37.181
<v Speaker 3>you'd,</v>

4709
02:24:37.181 --> 02:24:38.640
<v Speaker 3>you'd be altered by like what,</v>

4710
02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:39.190
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

4711
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:40.000
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>

4712
02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Don't say that.</v>

4713
02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Like you would read it and then that would be the show.</v>

4714
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.440
<v Speaker 3>The show would be these people as well as you.</v>

4715
02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:45.941
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4716
02:24:45.941 --> 02:24:50.920
<v Speaker 3>it's just not necessary or valuable because of the fact that we had the comments</v>

4717
02:24:50.921 --> 02:24:53.110
<v Speaker 3>killed during the live feed.</v>

4718
02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:53.830
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't,</v>

4719
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:57.550
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't chat during the live feed when we would transfer it over to</v>

4720
02:24:57.551 --> 02:24:58.384
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>

4721
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4722
02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:02.710
<v Speaker 3>the comments would be disabled and people went crazy and the,</v>

4723
02:25:02.730 --> 02:25:03.700
<v Speaker 3>and I had a tweet about it,</v>

4724
02:25:03.701 --> 02:25:04.091
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>

4725
02:25:04.091 --> 02:25:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not disabling the comments.</v>

4726
02:25:05.561 --> 02:25:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what this glitches,</v>

4727
02:25:07.571 --> 02:25:08.530
<v Speaker 3>but they're gonna figure it out.</v>

4728
02:25:09.250 --> 02:25:14.250
<v Speaker 3>But Shab decided to disable his comments on purpose and do they fucking went</v>

4729
02:25:15.701 --> 02:25:17.680
<v Speaker 3>crazy and they were attacking him,</v>

4730
02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:21.580
<v Speaker 3>but what are the numbers that give a shit?</v>

4731
02:25:21.581 --> 02:25:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Like who,</v>

4732
02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:23.920
<v Speaker 3>have you ever commented a youtube video?</v>

4733
02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 3>Have</v>

4734
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:25.990
<v Speaker 4>you ever watched a youtube video and commented about it?</v>

4735
02:25:25.991 --> 02:25:27.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I ever have.</v>

4736
02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:27.903
<v Speaker 4>I never have either.</v>

4737
02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:30.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anybody worth a fuck that has that.</v>

4738
02:25:30.220 --> 02:25:33.880
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the problem is like I know there's some really positive comments</v>

4739
02:25:33.881 --> 02:25:37.660
<v Speaker 4>and people who were healthy people were just interested in debate and discussion</v>

4740
02:25:37.661 --> 02:25:39.340
<v Speaker 4>about particular topics,</v>

4741
02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:41.980
<v Speaker 4>but when you're dealing with all these negative people,</v>

4742
02:25:41.981 --> 02:25:43.060
<v Speaker 4>like what are the numbers?</v>

4743
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:46.240
<v Speaker 4>If you have a million people watching a youtube video,</v>

4744
02:25:46.290 --> 02:25:47.850
<v Speaker 4>are we talking about a hundred people there?</v>

4745
02:25:48.850 --> 02:25:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Is it even if I don't even think it's the south 200 it might not even be a</v>

4746
02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:54.190
<v Speaker 4>hundred you might be dealing with like 30 cunts,</v>

4747
02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:55.210
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

4748
02:25:55.210 --> 02:25:57.940
<v Speaker 4>And they're the ones who are going to be mad that you disable the comments.</v>

4749
02:25:57.941 --> 02:25:59.740
<v Speaker 4>But does that really matter?</v>

4750
02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:00.311
<v Speaker 4>And it is.</v>

4751
02:26:00.311 --> 02:26:01.510
<v Speaker 4>This is keeping that,</v>

4752
02:26:01.570 --> 02:26:03.490
<v Speaker 4>that cesspool open,</v>

4753
02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:07.960
<v Speaker 4>keeping that commode open for them to dump their fucking verbal diarrhea into.</v>

4754
02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:10.600
<v Speaker 4>Is that really feeding the bay?</v>

4755
02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:12.940
<v Speaker 4>Is that giving the kid candy for being an asshole?</v>

4756
02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Is it the same?</v>

4757
02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

4758
02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I went,</v>

4759
02:26:15.031 --> 02:26:15.864
<v Speaker 1>saw you,</v>

4760
02:26:16.210 --> 02:26:16.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4761
02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.940

<v Speaker 1>You had an in depth conversation,</v>

4763

4765
02:26:27.690 --> 02:26:31.890
<v Speaker 1>You spent for sure four hours when you took a bunch of friends out for dinner</v>

4766
02:26:31.891 --> 02:26:32.521
<v Speaker 1>and invited me,</v>

4767
02:26:32.521 --> 02:26:33.360

02:26:34.381 --> 02:26:35.041
<v Speaker 1>I Brag about it,</v>

4771
02:26:35.041 --> 02:26:35.760

02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:36.061
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4774
02:26:37.770 --> 02:26:39.240

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4801
02:27:15.041 --> 02:27:16.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say fuck off.</v>

4802
02:27:16.211 --> 02:27:21.211
<v Speaker 4>I just think that people have this distorted idea of space that they should just</v>

4803
02:27:21.971 --> 02:27:24.910
<v Speaker 4>be able to invade your space where you literally have a mouthful of food.</v>

4804
02:27:25.260 --> 02:27:25.571
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

4805
02:27:25.571 --> 02:27:26.380
<v Speaker 4>I've had it happen.</v>

4806
02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:26.651
<v Speaker 4>I've had,</v>

4807
02:27:26.651 --> 02:27:28.180
<v Speaker 4>it happened when I was feeding my daughter,</v>

4808
02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:29.081
<v Speaker 4>have her in my lap.</v>

4809
02:27:29.081 --> 02:27:31.930
<v Speaker 4>He'll be a cog in a selfie and you definitely can't get a selfie right now while</v>

4810
02:27:31.931 --> 02:27:32.741
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeding my daughter.</v>

4811
02:27:32.741 --> 02:27:33.700

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4813
02:27:34.130 --> 02:27:36.050
<v Speaker 1>That's just a misunderstanding of,</v>

4814
02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:37.173
<v Speaker 1>of space.</v>

4815
02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4816
02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:38.473
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

4817
02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:41.720
<v Speaker 1>there it is a strange thing.</v>

4818
02:27:41.721 --> 02:27:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4819
02:27:42.260 --> 02:27:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch my wife,</v>

4820
02:27:44.470 --> 02:27:44.720

4823
02:27:47.331 --> 02:27:47.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:49.870

4829
02:27:53.331 --> 02:27:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the motivation for doing it.</v>

4830
02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to get it too.</v>

4831
02:27:57.340 --> 02:27:59.630
<v Speaker 1>But those are still humans.</v>

4832
02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Like those are still people there and that's the,</v>

4833
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:04.880
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand that woman shit.</v>

4834
02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:06.590
<v Speaker 1>She does it this way here.</v>

4835
02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4836
02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:07.910
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4837
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:08.550
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

4838
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.980
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

4839
02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:09.681
<v Speaker 1>they're people.</v>

4840
02:28:09.681 --> 02:28:12.980
<v Speaker 1>And can you imagine if the person asks you what you're feeding your daughter?</v>

4841
02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:13.913
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did that.</v>

4842
02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the first time he'd be like,</v>

4843
02:28:15.081 --> 02:28:15.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4844

4845
02:28:17.211 --> 02:28:18.170
<v Speaker 1>but after that it would be,</v>

4846
02:28:18.370 --> 02:28:19.970
<v Speaker 1>it's still living your human life.</v>

4847
02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:21.093
<v Speaker 1>The only one you have,</v>

4848
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:22.250
<v Speaker 1>you just can't interrupt</v>

4849
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:25.040
<v Speaker 3>people while they're sitting at dinner with their family or with their friends.</v>

4850
02:28:25.041 --> 02:28:26.860
<v Speaker 3>They're just sitting there cutting food.</v>

4851
02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just like they don't owe you that,</v>

4852
02:28:28.850 --> 02:28:29.181
<v Speaker 3>like can,</v>

4853
02:28:29.181 --> 02:28:30.390
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't ask for that.</v>

4854
02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:32.120
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the way to do it.</v>

4855
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:33.343
<v Speaker 3>It's just not,</v>

4856
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:35.690
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to know when people can't stop.</v>

4857
02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:37.040
<v Speaker 3>They just can't just say hi.</v>

4858
02:28:37.041 --> 02:28:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Can you just say hi?</v>

4859
02:28:38.050 --> 02:28:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4860
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:39.200
<v Speaker 3>No one can say hi.</v>

4861
02:28:39.201 --> 02:28:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to dress up their Facebook.</v>

4862
02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Everyone needs that fucking selfie.</v>

4863
02:28:42.921 --> 02:28:43.754
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

4864
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

4865
02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:44.721
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

4866
02:28:44.721 --> 02:28:47.270
<v Speaker 3>we're in a weird space with that stuff that,</v>

4867
02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:49.400
<v Speaker 3>that whole social media shit,</v>

4868
02:28:49.401 --> 02:28:52.320
<v Speaker 3>because people want something from you that they get up to.</v>

4869
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:55.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not just their fam and they want to say hi,</v>

4870
02:28:55.490 --> 02:28:57.920
<v Speaker 3>they want something from you to make them look cooler.</v>

4871
02:28:58.190 --> 02:29:00.620
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you can give them some currency.</v>

4872
02:29:00.621 --> 02:29:03.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're a Pokemon and they can pick you up and</v>

4873
02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:04.700
<v Speaker 1>get a point for,</v>

4874
02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:05.533
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

4875
02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:06.373
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4876
02:29:06.410 --> 02:29:07.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4877
02:29:07.310 --> 02:29:08.143
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

4878
02:29:08.290 --> 02:29:08.841
<v Speaker 1>I told you,</v>

4879
02:29:08.841 --> 02:29:09.674
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>

4880
02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit for breezy over doom got flat and he was just going to fight in Russia,</v>

4881
02:29:14.781 --> 02:29:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I think against all neck.</v>

4882
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4883
02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:17.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4884
02:29:17.330 --> 02:29:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4885
02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not how,</v>

4886
02:29:18.450 --> 02:29:19.283
<v Speaker 1>that's a wrap.</v>

4887
02:29:19.370 --> 02:29:20.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap on that.</v>

4888
02:29:20.290 --> 02:29:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4889
02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:24.740
<v Speaker 1>he's 40 years old trying to compete in something that's a young man's game.</v>

4890
02:29:24.890 --> 02:29:25.491
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

4891
02:29:25.491 --> 02:29:27.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can get mad,</v>

4892
02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:32.660
<v Speaker 1>you can get outraged and that's a reasonable result or reasonable response if</v>

4893
02:29:32.661 --> 02:29:32.991
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

4894
02:29:32.991 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 1>But if you rationalize,</v>

4895
02:29:33.981 --> 02:29:34.820
<v Speaker 1>if you have empathy,</v>

4896
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like this guy still wants to do this thing that his body won't allow him to</v>

4897
02:29:38.391 --> 02:29:39.020
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

4898
02:29:39.020 --> 02:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And so he's willing to bend the rules to attempt it.</v>

4899
02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:44.470
<v Speaker 1>He failed and now he's going to have to pay the cost.</v>

4900
02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Francis.</v>

02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:36.530
<v Speaker 1>but I was trying to interview and it's only six,</v>

4945
02:30:36.531 --> 02:30:37.490
<v Speaker 1>nine or six,</v>

4946
02:30:37.491 --> 02:30:38.031
<v Speaker 1>eight or something.</v>

4947
02:30:38.031 --> 02:30:41.030
<v Speaker 1>But it was the physical frame of him and I was just like,</v>

4948
02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:44.180
<v Speaker 1>it was so wild as a triple h in a restaurant one time and I was like,</v>

4949
02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:44.840
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

4950
02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:45.710
<v Speaker 1>like giant dude.</v>

4951
02:30:45.890 --> 02:30:46.500
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4952
02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:47.333
<v Speaker 1>he's big,</v>

4953
02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:49.100
<v Speaker 1>big athletes like this.</v>

4954
02:30:49.101 --> 02:30:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Like what the,</v>

4955
02:30:49.770 --> 02:30:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the force that they can generate like in Gannon,</v>

4956
02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:53.390
<v Speaker 1>that ability to,</v>

4957
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:56.780
<v Speaker 1>to create that type of power and impact.</v>

4958
02:30:56.781 --> 02:30:57.614
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy</v>

4959
02:30:57.650 --> 02:31:01.460
<v Speaker 3>picture of Afghanistan and extra professional basketball player and a god who</v>

4960
02:31:01.461 --> 02:31:02.750
<v Speaker 3>looks like a tiny person.</v>

4961
02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:04.010
<v Speaker 3>So weird.</v>

4962
02:31:04.430 --> 02:31:04.611
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

4963
02:31:04.611 --> 02:31:04.940
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

4964
02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:07.010
<v Speaker 3>it looks like I look what I stand next to him.</v>

4965
02:31:07.330 --> 02:31:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Not Quite as much contrast but pretty ridiculous.</v>

4966
02:31:10.041 --> 02:31:10.641
<v Speaker 3>But there it is.</v>

4967
02:31:10.641 --> 02:31:11.474
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

4968
02:31:12.670 --> 02:31:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's absurd.</v>

4969
02:31:13.930 --> 02:31:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>

4970
02:31:15.310 --> 02:31:15.781
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

4971
02:31:15.781 --> 02:31:16.120
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

4972
02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:17.140
<v Speaker 1>there's more always,</v>

4973
02:31:17.141 --> 02:31:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but I have a Chihuahua,</v>

4974
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:21.030
<v Speaker 1>the Chihuahua and you have your dog,</v>

4975
02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you put them beside each other and you're like,</v>

4976
02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:24.090
<v Speaker 1>that can't be the same species.</v>

4977
02:31:24.091 --> 02:31:24.601
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4978
02:31:24.601 --> 02:31:25.201
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

4979
02:31:25.201 --> 02:31:25.441
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4980
02:31:25.441 --> 02:31:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Then humans are just like dogs and that way,</v>

4981
02:31:27.390 --> 02:31:27.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4982
02:31:27.571 --> 02:31:29.500
<v Speaker 1>we vary so wildly size.</v>

4983
02:31:29.530 --> 02:31:30.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4984
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He listened to let's wrap this up.</v>

4985
02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Tell people where they can get your breakdowns and your MMA stuff.</v>

4986
02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:38.580
<v Speaker 1>If you're from Dublin,</v>

4987
02:31:38.581 --> 02:31:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Ireland,</v>

4988
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm there doing my one man show June 22nd how often are you doing this?</v>

4989
02:31:42.810 --> 02:31:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this will be the fifth I think there was one practice,</v>

4990
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:48.180
<v Speaker 1>one sort of friends and family.</v>

4991
02:31:48.181 --> 02:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from it.</v>

4992
02:31:49.081 --> 02:31:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Then Winnipeg and London,</v>

4993
02:31:50.161 --> 02:31:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Ontario and I did cause I knew,</v>

4994
02:31:52.420 --> 02:31:52.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4995
02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:56.040
<v Speaker 1>harmonic and they've got some good friends there that would be supportive and</v>

4996
02:31:56.041 --> 02:31:56.460
<v Speaker 1>that was good.</v>

4997
02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Then I sold out a little venue in Toronto and what really,</v>

4998
02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:01.440
<v Speaker 1>really well and then now Ireland,</v>
