00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't blizzard in world of Warcraft,</v>

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact numbers,</v>

4
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:08.190
<v Speaker 1>but they had released a pet whereas it was like 25 actual dollars or something</v>

5
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>like that and their servers wound up getting crashed and people lining up to buy</v>

6
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>it just for like one little pet.</v>

7
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the power of those goods they've figured out how to do is make it so that</v>

8
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>the more you play the game,</v>

9
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>the better you get,</v>

10
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>the better your life is,</v>

11
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>the more successful you are,</v>

12
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>the more powerful you are,</v>

13
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>the better the experiences,</v>

14
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>the more you have controller of the people in the game.</v>

15
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's like the really trippy thing.</v>

16
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a time thing they like locked you in.</v>

17
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.571
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

18
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a,</v>

19
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a show that you're totally hooked on and it never ends and it keeps getting</v>

20
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>crazier everyday new people and they,</v>

21
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

22
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>any blizzard,</v>

23
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>mark my words has created this mold that so many other people in the business</v>

24
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>you're going to follow.</v>

25
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.601
<v Speaker 1>We got this,</v>

26
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.971
<v Speaker 1>this thing and the new gear.</v>

28
00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>So we have a calendar and it's like you play gears and it's like,</v>

29
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey,</v>

30
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>don't trade in your game because in two weeks there's like ticker Tuesday or</v>

32
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>triple XP Thursdays.</v>

33
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.931
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

34
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And then your friends are playing on that same day and you want to keep going.</v>

35
00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:57.961
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

36
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there's like a psychology strict.</v>

37
00:00:59.431 --> 00:00:59.971
<v Speaker 1>There were like,</v>

38
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't sell the game because you're thinking there might be something coming</v>

40
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:03.331
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

41
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:03.601
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

42
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>We're dungeon masters and we're always like manipulating that experience online</v>

43
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>to have new shit happen.</v>

44
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy that it just keeps going though.</v>

46
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>But I mean your average person have over their life to a world where he can</v>

47
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>start gaining that control.</v>

48
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>That's like the biggest problem.</v>

49
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're young,</v>

50
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>it's figuring out what you want to do when you grow up.</v>

51
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.081
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

52
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:22.761
<v Speaker 1>Like thanks that.</v>

53
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully I was lucky and I saw games.</v>

54
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:24.571
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

55
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:24.841
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

56
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 1>that right.</v>

57
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>But so I've talked to kids who are like,</v>

58
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to school and I don't know what I want to do.</v>

59
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.161
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

60
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

61
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>pick something and be surgical about it and decide that you're going to be the</v>

62
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:33.054
<v Speaker 1>best at that.</v>

63
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>We'd put the problem is finding something.</v>

64
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of kids,</v>

65
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>the real issue is finding something.</v>

66
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:38.701
<v Speaker 1>Then you got lucky.</v>

67
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:39.271
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>

68
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:40.104
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people did,</v>

69
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's like it's very difficult to find the thing that you're into.</v>

70
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.331
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

71
00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to like say,</v>

72
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:44.401
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

73
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be this,</v>

74
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>and then you're doing it and then halfway into it you're like this fucking blog.</v>

75
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And so it's difficult to find what that thing is.</v>

76
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:51.054
<v Speaker 1>It's like anchoring,</v>

77
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>asking it a young,</v>

78
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>especially the young age when you don't know,</v>

79
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you hardly know a lot about what's going on in the world around you.</v>

80
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.423
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

81
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>that opportunity now with the internet is greater than ever,</v>

82
00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you could shoot a viral video,</v>

84
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>you could start a podcast,</v>

85
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:03.481
<v Speaker 1>you could do anything.</v>

86
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you start getting better and better at it,</v>

87
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:05.611
<v Speaker 1>you can build community,</v>

88
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:05.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

89
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you want to do.</v>

90
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>But what if you want to be a carpenter?</v>

91
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Or what if you want to be a painter?</v>

92
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>You know there's,</v>

93
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>there's so many for kids,</v>

94
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>the hardest thing is finding the thing,</v>

95
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>finding whatever the fuck it is.</v>

96
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

97
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>most kids don't get enough exposure to interesting ideas between the schoolwork.</v>

99
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

100
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>when you go to school,</v>

101
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>when you think about what you've gotta do,</v>

102
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>you've gotta get up at fucking seven o'clock in the morning.</v>

103
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.201
<v Speaker 1>You've got to leave,</v>

104
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>catch a bus with a bunch of other Douche bags,</v>

105
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>do a bunch of shit that sucks all day.</v>

106
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Listen to a bunch of people tell you never gonna make anything out of your life</v>

107
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>unless you pay attention to them.</v>

108
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.361
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

109
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:33.841
<v Speaker 1>listen bitch,</v>

110
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you're teaching school.</v>

111
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't make any money.</v>

112
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:36.421
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

113
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Don't you love?</v>

114
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

115
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>life was so great when you're a kid.</v>

116
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Like no answered moments,</v>

117
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>but it sucked.</v>

118
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>So to find something that you truly love in the midst of all this,</v>

119
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>like programming is what school is no more than programming.</v>

120
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>It is education.</v>

121
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>There is information that you're going to download it,</v>

122
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>you're going to remember it,</v>

123
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of what it is is getting you program to get used to doing things</v>

124
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do.</v>

125
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Listening to people that you don't want hear,</v>

126
00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.921
<v Speaker 1>you're around people.</v>

127
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:01.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be around the New Yorker.</v>

128
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.053
<v Speaker 1>There's a buzzer.</v>

129
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

130
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to be a buzzer stupid?</v>

131
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Was it so important that we fucking leave at a certain time and get there at a</v>

132
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>certain time?</v>

133
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>You're turning me into a robot.</v>

134
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>You know you're turning me into some worker asshole that just goes and does the</v>

135
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>same God damn thing everyday and providing order for a certain mind that might</v>

136
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>otherwise to either the default,</v>

137
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

138
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>there's ways to educate.</v>

139
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Like my favorite hobbies,</v>

140
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>if I'm out with friends and I was out in San Francisco with a buddy and he had a</v>

141
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>date,</v>

142
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>who is this a public school teacher at?</v>

143
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I find one of my polar sound like American memory by your drink and it</v>

144

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.870
<v Speaker 1>There was no girls making out with girls when I was 13 there.</v>

165
00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Shit never took place.</v>

166
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.411
<v Speaker 1>They're all doing it.</v>

167
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.244
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

168
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>13 year old girls.</v>

169
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>

171
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that I was 13 I knew a lot of 13 year olds,</v>

172
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:05.121
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

173
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>And none of them were making out with each other.</v>

174
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would,</v>

175
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>let's say they were going to do something and you never know quite what it was.</v>

176
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:09.731
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

177
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>And there was this kind of like a Dell conspiracy to keep like pornography or</v>

178
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:13.391
<v Speaker 1>away from you and things like that.</v>

179
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>You had to go in the woods and find porn.</v>

180
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this a hundred times in the pod for meaning finding Portland</v>

181
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.160
<v Speaker 1>in the woods.</v>

182
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.081
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

184
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got the same story,</v>

185
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

186
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible.</v>

187
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>The dirty stuff.</v>

188
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>We didn't bring this up to you and everyone has the same goddamn story and the</v>

189
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:28.721
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>

190
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.570
<v Speaker 1>We find a magazine.</v>

191
00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't make an adult bookstore in the woods.</v>

192
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It would probably be the most successful.</v>

193
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Just don't even tell him any signs.</v>

194
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Here's like a Johnny Porno Ct.</v>

195
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>It looks like Ron Jeremy and a thong going through with a giant sack of porn and</v>

196
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like Cherry Cherry.</v>

199
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It's the dirtiest shit you could find was the bad stuff we grew up with.</v>

200
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.301

<v Speaker 1>It was always penthouse with a lot of water damage.</v>

205
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>The girls look like that.</v>

206
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>The SARLACC pit down there.</v>

207
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible.</v>

208
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

209
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>and you're young,</v>

210
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.491
<v Speaker 1>impressionable mind.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is going on here?</v>

215
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:00.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

216
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.114
<v Speaker 1>It was terrifying,</v>

217
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's click of a button.</v>

218
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:03.851
<v Speaker 1>You can see two girls,</v>

219
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:04.684
<v Speaker 1>one cup.</v>

220

222
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 1>how how close all this stuff is.</v>

223
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Like someone could send you a Twitter link and you click on it and just give to</v>

224
00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:15.000
<v Speaker 1>be the most horrible thing.</v>

225
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.701
<v Speaker 1>My words,</v>

226
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>if I ever have children,</v>

228
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>But you know what the worst thing you want to have is an uninformed kid.</v>

229
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>True,</v>

230

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Talk to them and just let them be in the same flow as everybody else.</v>

232
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just to let them know what the fuck is going on while it's out.</v>

233
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>As long as that basis there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

252
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>But I understand where that's coming from.</v>

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>These kids going to be fine.</v>

254
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.350
<v Speaker 1>They're growing up with other human beings to some extent.</v>

255
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>You want them to make their own mistakes.</v>

256
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:01.461
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

257
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.241

262
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Let them learn how balance.</v>

263
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:06.921
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

264
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:07.160

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

267
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

268
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be careful.</v>

269
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.021
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them to,</v>

270
00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

271
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.093
<v Speaker 1>kids die,</v>

272
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:14.130
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a coal stove in the middle of the living room.</v>

274
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.261
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

275
00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:14.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:14.931
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

277
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>if you have hard floors,</v>

278
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:16.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

279
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 1>like I have marble floors.</v>

280
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:18.404
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of tricky.</v>

281
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.921
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

282
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>you've gotta you gotta watch them,</v>

283
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

284
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.771
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the point.</v>

285
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

286
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

287
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you know what these are,</v>

288
00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>they're growing up with other people.</v>

289
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think p things always get better.</v>

290
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>And even though it seems like Shit's worse,</v>

291
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.720
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know that.</v>

292
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It seems like Shit's worse as far as like the economy and all this craziness as</v>

293
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>far as invasion of privacy and you know,</v>

294
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:36.910
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

296
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.471
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

297
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 1>the access to information that we have and they're getting inundated with images</v>

299
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>and videos and all this shit that we didn't see until we were well mature.</v>

300
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.193
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be fine.</v>

301
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.741
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>

302
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 1>this is how they're growing up now.</v>

303
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>This is just how it is and we're just the law,</v>

304
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 1>the old people that are just like our parents,</v>

305
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:50.961
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

306
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>oh kids these days looking at,</v>

307
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:52.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

308
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

309
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>it's the same video games.</v>

310
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

311
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just we're like,</v>

312
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>we're like kids these days with their fucking ass to mouth porn.</v>

313
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

314
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>they got asked to mouth porn on their fucking iPhone.</v>

315
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:01.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

316
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:02.421
<v Speaker 1>that's just what it is.</v>

317
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just this is the new world and the world constantly keeps getting more and</v>

318
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 1>more complex world of ass to mouth.</v>

319
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

320
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the world is always getting more and more fucked up.</v>

321
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>It's always getting more complicated,</v>

322
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>more strange or bizarre.</v>

323
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to the Zombie apocalypse is the default.</v>

324
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>

325
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

326
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I think as long as there's freedom of information,</v>

327
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>the way we were expressing each other right now and communicating with each</v>

328
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

329
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 1>people are gonna be able to figure out things quicker.</v>

330
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

331
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 1>and I think kids are going to be able to figure out this multifaceted,</v>

332
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:32.820
<v Speaker 1>fucked up chaotic world far quicker than some fucking doofus from 1963 and now</v>

333
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 1>he takes some kid from 1963 you could talk him into anything they didn't know</v>

334
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:36.540
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

335
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>You know today kids are going to be more savvy,</v>

336
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:38.961
<v Speaker 1>more aware,</v>

337
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:39.850
<v Speaker 1>more installation.</v>

338
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Ask anybody anything anymore.</v>

339
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

340
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 1>fuck it up.</v>

341
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 1>You can find it in the act was complaining about this actually he was a,</v>

342
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 1>there was a Steve Wasniak,</v>

343
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the creators of apple was doing an interview where he cited saying,</v>

344
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.291
<v Speaker 1>back in my day,</v>

345
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:51.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

346
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you had a,</v>

347
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 1>if you will add a question,</v>

348
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>you had to find a smart person and ask them,</v>

349
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>well that's dumb.</v>

350
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Why would I,</v>

351
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>why are you complaining about that?</v>

352
00:07:58.281 --> 00:07:59.800
<v Speaker 1>There's not that many fucking smart people,</v>

353
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but I've got to seek out one dude.</v>

354
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.600
<v Speaker 1>That's retarded.</v>

355
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I have to go and talk to the professor.</v>

356
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.410
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so God damn arrogant about their information.</v>

357
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:07.161
<v Speaker 1>Think about the Mayans,</v>

358
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:07.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

359
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>What they used to control them by the,</v>

360
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:08.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:08:08.731 --> 00:08:08.781
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

362
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>all the quote priests,</v>

363
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:09.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>

365
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Science.</v>

366
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.121
<v Speaker 1>I figure it out.</v>

367
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:11.331
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

368
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:11.751
<v Speaker 1>how the,</v>

369
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

370
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the lunar cycles and how everything would turn out and think.</v>

372
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:14.481
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was like,</v>

373
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:14.721
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

374
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:15.351
<v Speaker 1>how do they know this?</v>

375
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:16.071
<v Speaker 1>It must be magic.</v>

376
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Or like we're controlling this through knowledge,</v>

377
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

378
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

379
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>

380
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:19.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

381
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>but now the Egyptians to,</v>

382
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>before the library of Alexandria burned down,</v>

383
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.830
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

384
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the idea as well.</v>

385
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.220
<v Speaker 1>They kept all the knowledge,</v>

386
00:08:26.221 --> 00:08:27.250
<v Speaker 1>they had all this information,</v>

387
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 1>but all sorts of different things that the lay person was unaware of so</v>

388
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:31.761
<v Speaker 1>everybody can get it.</v>

389
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:32.091
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>

390
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:32.720
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

391
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.381
<v Speaker 1>Damn you.</v>

392
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:35.720
<v Speaker 1>We used to have to seek out a Tim Sweeney or John Carmax,</v>

393
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:36.531
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

394
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 1>And hang on to the right of up to the top.</v>

395
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.021
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

396
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Now there's just fucking a computer connection to the Internet and all your</v>

397
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:43.791
<v Speaker 1>questions answered.</v>

398
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:44.541
<v Speaker 1>But it's not always true,</v>

399
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

400
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.951
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

401
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

402
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing.</v>

403
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>But it's getting there.</v>

404
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>It released sitting closer and closer.</v>

405
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>It's getting to the point.</v>

406
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of disinformation,</v>

407
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a lot of information.</v>

408
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of good information and I think that's because I think it</v>

409
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>developed it just like we need to be able to discern between bullshit and</v>

410
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 1>reality in the real world.</v>

411
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 1>You need to be able to discern between bullshit and reality online and people</v>

412
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>will sort it all out and figure it out.</v>

413
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

414

<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

415
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that have it,</v>

416
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of urban myths about all sorts of different things.</v>

417
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

418
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.620

<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

429
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

430
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.450
<v Speaker 1>It was Mikey from the life cereal commercial dye to stomach explodes,</v>

431
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>right where there was their religion about the girl that stuck a hot dog in her</v>

432
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>pussy and then had to go to the hospital.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It really seems like life is going towards like the having a matrix where you</v>
