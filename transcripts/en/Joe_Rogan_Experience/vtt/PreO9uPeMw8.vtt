00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.860
Hello freaks.
What the fuck's going on?

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.550
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by legal zoom.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.020
What is legal zoom?

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.770
Legal Zoom is a way to handle a lot of shit that you would ordinarily have to go

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:17.460
to an actual attorney and make an appointment and go into an office and pay an

6
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.640
exorbitant fee per hour.
Instead,

7
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:25.641
you can handle a lot of that shit yourself from your house while naked and drunk

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
and it's legal.
Yes,
legal zoom is not a law firm,

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.970
but what they do is they provide you with self help services and if the shit

10
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:37.770
hits the fan and you're panicking,

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.210
they can also connect you with an independent third party attorney.

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.950
So what you can do on legal zooms a lot of stuff that you would have to go to a

13
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:51.570
lawyer's office for,
like you can create a last will just 69 bucks.

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.810
You can start a business incorporate and form an LLC for starting at just 99

15
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:01.230
bucks.
Super easy to do all this stuff.
In fact,

16
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.250
Brian Bread band has done it himself.
You've actually done it.

17
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.320
You made actual legal work over there.

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.220
At four in the morning I created desk squad.
They goes down,
which he goes,

19
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:14.660
you can make an LSC until it'd be irresponsible and do all this horrible thing

20
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.480
that Doug don't expose the flaws and the governments.

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.420
You're not supposed to do that.

22
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.810
While we're doing a commercial legal zoom has no connection whatsoever to any of

23
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:29.490
the opinions of Brian Redman is has expressed.
Those are his and his alone.

24
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.300
They also do not represent the Joe Rogan experience podcast.
Anyway.

25
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.170
In the past 12 years,

26
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:37.230
over 2 million Americans have used legal zoom and they've saved a ton of money.

27
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.650
Can you tell that I didn't write that.

33
00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:01.020
N.
N.
I.
T.
If you have never been and you've never listened to this podcast,

34
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.820
then this will be new.
If you've listened to this podcast,
you,

35
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:07.920
you're going to be like,
can this motherfucker say the same thing again?

36
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.610
Unfortunately,
yes.
There's no other way to do this.
Um,

37
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.660
what on it is for those who don't know is a human optimization website.

38
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.490
That's what we call ourselves.
Sounds pretentious,
but the intentions are pure.

39
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.000
What we're trying to do is sell you the best shit we can find,

40
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.240
whether it's strength and conditioning equipment like kettlebells,

41
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.170
whether it's foods like they're the new warrior bar,

42
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:35.850
which is just like really delicious and actually nutritious buffalo bar and made

43
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:38.790
the ancient native American way.
We just started getting these,

44
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.890
they're made with cranberries and pepper,
no antibiotics,
no added hormones.

45
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.770
It's gluten free.
No nitrates is actually good for you.

46
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:51.180
14 grams of protein and a very low in fat as well.
Um,

47
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.540
four grams of fat per two ounce serving and it's healthy fat.
This is,

48
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.350
this is all like organic buffalo meat.
Interesting stuff is,
you know,

49
00:02:58.351 --> 00:02:59.890
we always think like,
oh,
I need a snack.

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 1>And you just sort of sacrifice that.</v>

51
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:04.840
You're just going to eat something that's just totally shitty for your body just

52
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.710
to fill that hole and give you calories.
There's ways around that shit.

53
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.270
A hemp force protein bars.

54
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.900
Another one that we have hemp force protein is the stuff that we get from Canada

55
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.300
because we still ever tarted laws here in America.

56
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.490
And you can buy hemp and you can have him,

57
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.720
but you can't grow him and you can't sell it either,
which is a fucking crazy,

58
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:25.810
but you can sell it once you've already bought it.
You mother fuckers.

59
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.470
What are you doing?
Like a pre workout bar?
It's just a bar.

60
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.750
It's just got protein in it.
It's just hemp.
Uh,

61
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.320
the same hemp force protein that we have in the powder.
It's in the bar.

62
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.530
They're really delicious too there.
They're easy to digest.

63
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.770
That's one of the best things about hemp proteins.
One of the easiest digest.

64
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.830
I really like whey protein.
Um,

65
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.390
I liked the taste of like muscle milk and a lot of those things,

66
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.080
but God damn would they erupt inside my booty hole?

67
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.040
I'd just get the worst farts ever from those things.
I don't know what it is,
man.

68
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.290
It's just me and I'm and way ways that essentially it's a milk protein.

69
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.540
It's just a little bit more difficult for your body to digest,

70
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.230
but barely grassfed whey is easier.

71
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.540
No Asprey sells from grass fed whey I think grass fed ways easier for your body

72
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:12.460
to digest.
Sort of similar to how grass fed butter is.
Um,
anyway,

73
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.600
on it.com o.
N n I t we sell lots of good shit.

74
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:18.640
And if you use the code word Rogan,

75
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.260
you will save 10% off any and all supplements.
All right,
boom.

76
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.400
That's it.
Oh Hongyan I would just say it.
A lot of our meetings are rejoicing.

77
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:31.840
I just say Ohanian cause he wanted to be Americanized.
Alexis Ohanian is here,

78
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.030
ladies and gentlemen,
Cuban music.
Brian Redman

79
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.063
experience.

80
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.250
I don't know why we have to have your music.
Could we do I like,

81
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:47.920
otherwise it does it.
We've done it without the music several times.

82
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.860
We just get fucking crazy.
And we just got,
we said,
you know,

83
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:54.970
let's do the least produced version of this possible with no professionalism

84
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:58.630
attached to which is anyway,
which would be hard.
You guys,

85
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.390
you guys had run a tight ship here.
You got to go with your right name,
Dude.

86
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:03.460
You've got to go with [inaudible].
Yeah,
you got to go with that.

87
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.430
I call these these silly people that can't say that.
Learn how to say that.
Oh,

88
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.980
onion.
Awesome.
The,
well,
I mean,
my father,
so my father was born in the states.

89
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:16.000
Both of his parents,
uh,
had,
were,
were part of the generation that came over.

90
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.850
So my dad pronounces it handing as well.
So,
but I'll tell you,

91
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.040
I'll tell you what I own.
See that first name?
Alexis.
You never call me Alex.

92
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.610
Oh,
okay.
I like that rope as a little pudgy kid named Alexis.

93
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:31.090
And you learn real quick to own that name because I was,

94
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:35.240
I was born in 83 and my father named me after a boxer.
Uh,

95
00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:38.620
Alexis are guayle this Nicaraguan flag.
I know exactly who he is.

96
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.860
I got to see him fight live serious.
Yeah.
Yeah,

97
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:46.090
I got to see him fight live a long time ago.
Me and my friend Jimmy lawless,

98
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.300
we went down to,
I think it was in Lowell,
Massachusetts.

99
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:53.950
We saw Alexis are guayle live and we saw Micky ward live before he became famous

100
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:57.950
and brought my father,
what am I doing here?
Awesome.
It was awesome in Lowell.

101
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.760
It was fucking great.
Low Massachusetts,
which is where Micky Ward was from.

102
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.820
So when you went out there,
but he won't.
Yeah,

103
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.680
I got to see him when he was an up and coming contender alive.

104
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.530
But he's seeing our grail.
That's my pop.
He showed me how he is.
He has a,

105
00:06:10.531 --> 00:06:14.630
an entire closet full of VHS tapes of his fights,

106
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.110
which I keep telling him he needs to do something digitized now.

107
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.810
Like just go on Youtube.
And I got a quick,
quick query.
And um,
he had,

108
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.610
he had a wonderful mustache and amazing left jab and that combination.

109
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.440
Well Alexis Aguayo,
it'll awesome.

110
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:31.700
His straight right hand was a work of art and a gentleman.
Yeah,
a really,

111
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:36.140
really good guy.
Like a real man,
a real man's man.

112
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.710
So that's,
that was my name's sake.
He died young,
right?
Didn't,
he did,

113
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:44.570
it was a suicide.
If you,
I've talked to Nicaraguans about this and there,

114
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:44.781
you know,

115
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:47.930
he got very involved politically after his fighting days and there are a lot of

116
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:51.440
people who believe there was more to that story and that never happens.

117
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.170
Nobody ever kills anybody.
They didn't try to make it look like a suicide.

118
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:57.820
It's never happened Bro.
It's been snow.
Have you ever snow peas?

119
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.580
I love my Snopes.
Snopes Snopes into a lot of stupid fucking arguments.

120
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.080
Snoop,
real quick.
This is one of the advantages of the interwebs.

121
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.630
I know what you mean.
They're snooping for the facts.
No,
no.
I think it's,
no.

122
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.440
Yeah,
it was snoop sued.
We have to,
oh,

123
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.720
so you can probably check snow on English speaking mother.

124
00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:20.330
Plus if the English language wasn't so goofy and there wasn't any weird

125
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:23.390
exceptions like that,
it would be so easy to shit on me right now.

126
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.670
But there's a lot of ones that don't make any sense.

127
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:27.920
It's a pretty fucked up language.
Yeah,
it's is very bizarre.

128
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.150
More bizarre when you're working with,
you know,
where it's like a honeymoon.

129
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.820
I know,
man.
You know,
it's like it fits it or you know,

130
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.400
that's one of the reasons why he got to give sports nigger props.

131
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.240
That's a bowl and goddamn move the guy own Schwartz shots and that guy are knoll

132
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.460
and Arnold to Arnold is fucking,
that's the kid from different strokes.

133
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:51.080
You know what I mean?
It's not the manliest most manly bodybuilder ever.

134
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.880
He made it though.
Fuck Aa.
Did see,
see Arnold?
Uh,
definitely.
Uh,

135
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.900
definitely a fighter.
I,
I know I'm not,
I,

136
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.510
I didn't fulfill my father's prophecy and me being a boxer instead,

137
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:05.150
I guess I'm a,
I'm a lover,
not a fighter.
Well myself,

138
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.320
you figured your own path outs or thank goodness,
thank God for computers.

139
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.220
You don't have to be a fighter like in the physical form.

140
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.590
Obviously you figured out a way to succeed.

141
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:17.750
He figured out some cool shit for sure.
I mean,

142
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:20.960
that's what everybody admired about Alexis Arguayo was the same thing that

143
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:25.040
anybody Meyers about.
Anybody who is involved in the creation of something cool.

144
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.640
And you're involved in the creation of the coolest fucking website on the

145
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:33.590
Internet.
I,
you're like Dalton read it.
You can't get a better hub of information.

146
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:38.210
Like when new things,
innovation,
a lot of gossipy bullshit though.

147
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.740
But that's people,
people,
that's what we do as people.
We like to talk shit.

148
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.410
But other than that,
I mean the,
the,
the resource,

149
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:47.970
if anything is going down anywhere in the world at anytime,

150
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.830
you can pretty much find it,
read it and it gets verified.
The vote up system,

151
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.010
good posts rise to the top,
bad post,
fall down.
It's such a

152
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.390
<v 2>smart,
cool thing.</v>

153
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.920
And really the model I think for like online discourse when it comes to like

154
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:06.390
message board type discourse.
I think you guys are the model.
You know,
we,

155
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.070
I mean it's,
it's amazing.
Uh,
when Steve,
Steve Huffman,

156
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.620
my cofounder and I started this thing,
we were in a little apartment in Medford,

157
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:17.160
Massachusetts.
I lived in Medford,
Medford.
We're on 72.

158
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.680
I feel bad for whoever lives there now.
Can I say that?
No,
don't say it.

159
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:24.630
Definitely not.
But it's,
no,
I don't want to get in trouble.
Okay.

160
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.470
What's on fucking,
you know,
whatever,
what's with the questions?

161
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.590
But the MEFA Medford.
Yeah.
And it was,
it was a great,

162
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:35.400
we had just graduated from college,
just graduated Uva,
went up to Boston.

163
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:37.500
We raised 12 grand from y Combinator,

164
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.920
which would go on to invest in like Dropbox,
Airbnb,
and,
and read it.

165
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.510
And we 12 grand in the bank.

166
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.060
We worked our asses off for three months in that little apartment and built

167
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:50.010
reddit and to be a top of the website now,
hundred 50 million people a month.

168
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.210
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
Love hearing shit like that.
And that's cool.

169
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.010
That's the American dream,
man.
We weren't 100% nerds with,
with,

170
00:09:58.011 --> 00:10:01.440
with 12 grand in the bank total.
We just,
we just worked with a couple of laptops,

171
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.440
no connections and,
and,
and you know,
what's the American dream,
right?
I mean,

172
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.930
the American dream where your parents somewhere in their past,

173
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:13.020
they're either their parents or their parents' parents were,

174
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.550
came from over from Armenia.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
My fun rest fled the genocide.

175
00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:19.950
And so what year was this?
We're talking about the early 19 hundreds.
Yeah.

176
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.190
So 1915 was going to get started if you want to get really real.

177
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.630
So my birthday is April 24th,
which is the Remembrance Day of the genocide.

178
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.300
So like I'm,
so I'm half Armenian on my father's side.

179
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.450
I'm full on Armenian on my mother's side.
I'm full on German.

180
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:37.260
She actually immigrated,
she was a fresh off the boat from Deutschland.
Wow.

181
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.490
So it's a really interesting 20th century to your DNA is gone through some shit.

182
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.530
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's about those two and a,
and I feel like having,

183
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.120
I mean right there.
Yeah,
certainly from the Armenian side,
you know,

184
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.000
they came out of survival.
My mom actually came for love to marry my dad.

185
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.520
Very romantic.
Um,
but,
but both of them,
right.
The reality was,
um,

186
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.840
leaving her life,
she was on track to be like a pharmacist in Germany,

187
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:05.070
but coming to the states,
she was just an ignorant like degree lists,
uh,

188
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:07.200
immigrant,
right.
And quote unquote.
Um,

189
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.260
and so she worked jobs that she had to work just because it was paying the
bills.

190
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.740
Like she worked as an AU pair,
she worked.

191
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:16.140
And I'm so incredibly proud of what she did to leave a life behind a comfortable

192
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:18.850
great life in Germany to start fresh here.
Um,

193
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.150
and then obviously my father's family,
like,
you know,

194
00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:23.010
when you grow up with a bunch of Armenians,
you know,

195
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:26.580
real quick how lucky you are to have that sort of genetic lottery of being born

196
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:31.290
here instead of over there.
Yeah,
I didn't,
I was totally ignorant to,
uh,

197
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.880
the,
the,
the genocide,
um,
until,
uh,
I was interviewing a fighter,

198
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.690
Manny Gambhir Berian after one of his fights and um,

199
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.500
he was dedicating his victory to the victims of the Armenian genocide and he was

200
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:48.900
like trying to bring awareness to it.
And I was like,
wow.
For him.
Oh,

201
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.670
he's very proud Armenian.

202
00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:53.830
So I had to look it up and find out what it was all about.
But

203
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.360
<v 1>that's one of those ones that you,</v>

204
00:11:55.361 --> 00:12:00.070
you don't hear about too much another horrific event in human history.

205
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.940
It is a,
it is certainly re really unspoken.
And I,
I'm trying to think,

206
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.030
I discovered system of a down because I was listening to [inaudible] 98 rock

207
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:10.780
back in Maryland and I heard Sarah talking about the genocide and I was like,

208
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.290
who is on a rock station talking about the Armenian genocide?
And I'm like,
Oh,

209
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.120
Armenia Rock Ben.
Isn't it crazy how one event like that can make,

210
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.570
I mean it's not that Armenians wouldn't be,

211
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.830
have like nationalistic pride or pride of origin before that,

212
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.910
but that one event has everybody bonded together.
There's so much more.

213
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.640
And especially because a lot of folks don't even know about the Armenian

214
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:36.910
genocide.
It is.
And I was a history major to in school,

215
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:38.560
so I've thought a lot about this.
Um,

216
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.360
and it's partially because it is unrecognized in Turkey and even here in the u s

217
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:45.310
on a national level,
but it's this,

218
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.870
I think it's the fact that it's still this open wound and it seems it may seem

219
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:53.820
mood like I understand the people who committed this are long dead,
but it's,

220
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.590
I think it has such an effect on the psyche cause we're all like,
well hold on,

221
00:12:57.591 --> 00:13:02.591
I missed there to deny the existence that this thing happened is shown

222
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.620
incredibly offensive because it's not doing justice to all the people we know.

223
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.730
It's crazy that we're having this conversation because just 17 hours ago the u s

224
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:14.500
Senate committee passed and Armenian genocide resolution series.
Yup.

225
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.350
So it's still got to go self go to the house or did it already it says,

226
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.380
I don't know how I'll word it says 12 senators voted for the resolution.

227
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.100
I feel like when I,

228
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.250
when I have to pay attention to how the government works as far like senators

229
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:31.840
and Congressmen and representatives,
I get angry.
It hurts.
I just shut it off.

230
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:33.850
I don't know.
Want to know who has to go to who,
you know,
why?

231
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:35.320
Cause your system sucks.

232
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:40.321
Broken says such a donkey ass old king system may even people were riding

233
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:44.260
fucking horses and hurl and bows and arrows at each other's fucking systems

234
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:46.590
retarded.
You make me know who is it?

235
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.290
Well it has to go through the house and the house pastors are centered around a

236
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:54.360
concern,
almost passed muster the fuck outta here and dumb.
And it is,
uh,

237
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.930
it has been so co opted by,
uh,
by money and,
and,
and it's,

238
00:13:58.931 --> 00:14:02.230
it's frustrating.
It is.
And I am an optimist.
Don't get me wrong,
I still,

239
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:05.230
I think the Internet,
I mean,
the reason,
the reason in part I wrote the book,

240
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:08.530
the reason I campaigned against Sopa Pipa was I really believe the Internet can

241
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:12.340
be a way for us to get the government that we deserve.
I completely agree.

242
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:15.190
It's just,
it's a process and there's a lot of,
a lot of shit to get through.

243
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:20.740
What the process really is,
is in change,
changing the way people's minds operate.

244
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.040
And I think that that process without a doubt has already been done.

245
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.160
I think kids of today,
I'm 46 years old,

246
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.230
so anyone who's in their twenties I guess I'd be talking about kids of today,

247
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:33.460
they're men,
but they're kids.

248
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.680
They are so much more advanced than I ever was when I was at that age than I
was.

249
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.640
I was out fucking monkey.
I knew nothing.

250
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:46.480
I knew neighborhood couple books,
uh,
you know,

251
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:51.260
CNN news every now and then.
I knew nothing.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's,

252
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:52.050
it's amazing

253
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.750
<v 2>entities.
I visited 77 universities on the tour and it makes me,</v>

254
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:01.280
it makes me jealous,
frankly.
It makes me very hopeful to kids.

255
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.430
But look,
this is like these kids grew up,

256
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:08.000
like I remember getting that modem out of 33,
six in middle school.

257
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:11.090
I remember getting my first PC,
he was a four 86 SX and my parents,

258
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.490
I was lucky enough to get that one.
I got it in middle school.

259
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.130
My parents didn't have a ton of money and they didn't know shit about
technology,

260
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:17.690
but they knew enough and I got that chance.

261
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:19.490
And that has provided everything for me.

262
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.200
But their kids coming up today who by and large have known this technology from

263
00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:25.580
jump and they've known,
they have,

264
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:27.840
they don't even know what a dial up sounds like.
That's insane.

265
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.210
And so they think of knowledge as being something in real time.
Like,

266
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.440
like you were saying earlier,
you know,
we,
we're,

267
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:35.540
we're sort of developing this attitude of like,
oh,
right,

268
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:36.620
we can go seek out this information.

269
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:39.680
We can squelch gossip on Snopes or we can go learn how to do,

270
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.820
we can learn string theory on Khan Academy,
but this generation coming up,

271
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.280
they just,
they take it for granted because they just know,
oh,

272
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:48.650
I have a problem or I need to figure something out or I want to create something

273
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:51.230
and share it like the Internet.
Uh,
and that's how,

274
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.590
that's how all of us got to learn the programming languages that helped us build

275
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:57.980
things like reddit.
But it's helping filmmakers.
Right now it's helping artists.

276
00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:59.750
It's helping photog it's being comedians,
right?

277
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:03.560
Like think of the wealth of knowledge that the up and coming comic now has to

278
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:04.700
learn from to look to share.

279
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:09.440
Like the amount of the resource of just finding things to talk about as long as

280
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:14.220
they don't.
Men see it though.
I can't do that.
It's horrible.
That's a verb now.
Um,

281
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:19.190
the,
the,
the like the amount of internet like Internet websites,

282
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.120
Internet search engines,
amount of,
uh,
social media networks,

283
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.650
whether it's Facebook or Twitter,

284
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.880
they just a sheer amount of funny stories that are coming your way as a comic

285
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:31.160
today.
Yeah.
It's like if you can't write new material,

286
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:32.600
it's like you're just not paying attention.

287
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.390
It's not like the old days you had to wait for shit to happen.

288
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:39.120
You never live in fucking Pennsylvania and just looking left and low.
C'Mon.

289
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.170
I can need something to talk about.
Like now you go online,
it's like,

290
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.330
it's constant.
It's overflowing.
Sucks though,

291
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.180
because they not the same comics are also looking at the same news.

292
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:50.690
Stories are writing jokes about that.
That's totally going to happen.

293
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.500
It's totally going to happen without a doubt.
Like a,

294
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.190
I was doing something about almond milk and somebody,
uh,

295
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.440
let me know on the podcast that what's his face.
Um,

296
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.290
Lewis Black has a great hunk on soy milk.
It's basically the same joke.

297
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.750
And uh,
like you find that out because the Internet too.

298
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.030
But the good thing is like,

299
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.720
I wouldn't have known that unless I then I like that Joe could have made it into

300
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:18.590
my arsenal and then I wouldn't have even known that Louis Black had it.
And then,

301
00:17:18.591 --> 00:17:22.610
you know,
it'd be,
I would be accused of plagiarism and I would feel stupid.

302
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:26.090
And you change almond milk to something else.
Like I don't even want important.

303
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:29.450
It's,
it's a tiny part of the bit,
but because of the Internet,

304
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:32.660
I know all this and,
and think about it this way,
right?
Like the,

305
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.890
the speed with which you can learn shit.
This is,
this brings everyone up.

306
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.590
Like it forces us.
This is,
and we see this in tech all the time.
Um,

307
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.550
just because of the nature of writing code and creating applications,
you know,

308
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:45.860
competition is,
this is as efficient as it gets.

309
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:49.680
There's new stuff coming out every day and it forces you to stay up and to be

310
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:50.150
innovating

311
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.791
<v 3>and to be pushing.</v>

312
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:54.150
And now I think of it as there are so many more in this instance,

313
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:56.340
like comics who are connected,
who are watching,
who,

314
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.470
who are seeing what someone is doing.
They're like,
all right,

315
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:00.990
like I'm not going to take that joke,
but now I just gotta I have to,

316
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.790
I have to push harder,
faster.

317
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.490
And on the whole I think we all benefit because we'll get better

318
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.980
<v 0>jokes.
We human beings benefit.</v>

319
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.720
There's the artistic expression would benefit the real problem with plagiarism,

320
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:14.880
whether it's in that or blogs,

321
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:18.410
you see them blogs a lot and I mean people still are getting busted for it.
Yeah,

322
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.460
I remember there was police,
so yeah,
absolutely.

323
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:24.970
But the difference between the mindset is what's really important.
Like the,
the,

324
00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:27.500
the,
the guy who is an actual writer,
the guy who,

325
00:18:27.501 --> 00:18:30.690
or the girl who's an actual writer,
the girl who's an actual comic,

326
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.870
what they're trying to do is figure shit out and they're trying to find

327
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:37.650
ridiculous points and things and then make funny observations about those
points.

328
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.070
If you're just copying stuff,
then you're not exercising,

329
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:43.560
whatever it is the tunes you in to those ideas.

330
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:46.500
In the first place so the you're lost when you're done.

331
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.640
If you get busted stealing jokes and then you have to write your own,

332
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:53.580
you're like holy shit,
like I don't even know how to do this.

333
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.930
Like you're like an open miker.

334
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.440
That's why you see like the guys who have been accused of plagiarism,

335
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.470
there's just like a high period in their careers and then this massive drop off

336
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.320
where you look at and you go,
oh my God,
like what the fuck is writing this?

337
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:08.820
Like this isn't funny at all.

338
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:13.140
Like you went from being this guy with these really funny points to this monkey

339
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:16.290
with dog shit coming out of your mouth and what?
What does that for me,

340
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:19.050
the act good act probably better than your jokes,

341
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.870
but it's because they never really did it in the first place.

342
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.990
They were just stealing and that that mindset there,

343
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.790
they seem to be mutually exclusive.

344
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.110
Like people who are really creative are almost never the type of person that

345
00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:35.400
would even think about plagiarizing.
So it's kind of fascinating how it's a,

346
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.440
but something like reddit exposes that quick like this.
I found out about this,

347
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.250
I found out about this on Twitter,

348
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:45.630
but they're just social media and just the ability to communicate with people.

349
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.340
It's just,
it's unprecedented.

350
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.120
<v 3>And,
and you have to,
I mean,
in,
in o five,
two of us in a little apartment,</v>

351
00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:55.150
there was no Twitter,
there was no tumbler.
Facebook is still in colleges.

352
00:19:55.151 --> 00:19:59.440
It's still in like elite colleges.
Back then it was a different world.
But,

353
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.390
and to give credit where it's due,
I mean,
I,
I really,

354
00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:03.340
I do believe we're all standing on the shoulders of giants.

355
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.000
I'm also not my quote,
but like,
you know the message board,
right?

356
00:20:07.001 --> 00:20:09.460
That's nothing new right there.
We had message boards.

357
00:20:09.461 --> 00:20:12.310
I ran a message boarding college,
a forum,
um,
you know,

358
00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:15.640
before that they come out like what was the first year of the message board?
Ah,

359
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.400
well,
I mean really early Internet,
you've got bbs systems.
Um,
you've got,
I mean,

360
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.200
they're like the forum use net forum,

361
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.900
like basic forum software where if someone creates an account,

362
00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:28.030
usually with like a pseudonym,
right?
They create an account,

363
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.910
they post the link or they have a discussion.
This stuff.

364
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.370
This stuff is as old as the Internet,
as the World Wide Web.

365
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.430
What Steve and I got right was we adapted it and modernize it a bit because we

366
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:42.490
let people,
you know,
at large up vote or down vote,
um,
and,
and essentially,

367
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:43.660
I mean I hate to simplify it that much,

368
00:20:43.661 --> 00:20:48.110
but reddit is like a next generation forum platform and then what we that dig

369
00:20:48.111 --> 00:20:52.660
and all the dig clones didn't realize was that they were just one front page.

370
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.980
We knew if we were going to win,
we'd have to be a platform for communities.

371
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:59.170
Dig was a platform for a community,
right?

372
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:02.020
The front page and only have so much stuff on it.
But we knew,
you know,
Steven,

373
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:04.720
I knew that we had uh,
you know,
there were things we were interested in,
right?

374
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.650
We're interested in technology,

375
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:08.950
we're interested in the Redskins were interested in like just football.

376
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:11.560
Like we might have a certain audience,

377
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.190
but what's going to make this work is if anyone who has a particular community

378
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:15.611
or a following,

379
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:18.520
whether you love my little pony and want to create a a read it about that a

380
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:19.000
subreddit,

381
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.790
which there are lots or do you want to create about your favorite team or you

382
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:25.240
want to hear about your favorite TV show or just about science or asking

383
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:27.550
questions about science,
ask science,
amazing sub.

384
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:30.430
All of these things exist because we knew this has to be a platform.

385
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.380
Just like Twitter as a platform for individuals.

386
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:34.240
This would be a platform for communities.

387
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.360
It's just amazing that it's been able to be pulled off the way it is.

388
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.100
The vote up vote down system is such a brilliant system because Steve,

389
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.930
you're always going to have noise.

390
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.240
You're always gonna have people that just want to make noise.

391
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:50.500
You're always going to have people that just want to be twats and now you can

392
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:55.060
sort of at least without censoring sorta just push that to the bottom and it's

393
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:59.170
not perfect.
I will argue in,
and this is all to credit.
Yeah,

394
00:21:59.171 --> 00:22:03.040
I mean there is no perfect system.
We constantly fight against ring voting,

395
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:04.420
all that stuff.
But I'm,

396
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:07.420
Steve built a really smart system with a really smart hotness algorithm and by

397
00:22:07.421 --> 00:22:11.340
the way,
were open source.
So if you want that,
go take it.
It's there.
Um,
and,

398
00:22:11.341 --> 00:22:13.000
and I think it is for what it is,

399
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:16.120
it's one of the best on the web and I think that's why our content is so good.

400
00:22:16.121 --> 00:22:19.270
It used to be right.
We started with just people linking stuff out.

401
00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:23.530
The first link on reddit fun fact was a submission I made to the Downing Street

402
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:25.450
memo.
Remember that it was,
it was showing this,

403
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:27.580
this leaked memo during the run up to the Iraq war,

404
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:30.190
the English government kind of saying like,
hey,
we're going to drum up some,

405
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.780
you know,
a support here to support America going into this war.
And,
um,

406
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.910
and it was my first submission and it was a link to another.

407
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.890
Was that the proposed false flag event?
Yes.
Well,
the,
the,

408
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:44.380
the notion being,
we can pull this thing up.
Um,
the notion being,

409
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:46.780
what is it called again,
down in sterling memo.

410
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.440
And so this was leaked out as basically an indication that the British

411
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:55.720
government really wanted to help drum up support for the war.

412
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.160
I don't know if how explicit it was.

413
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.490
I don't recall if it was like an explicit like I guess they wouldn't call it a

414
00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:03.630
false flag thing in the memo,
but we're going to do a stunt.

415
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.640
But whenever they have like code words and then the blueberry big bad wolf says,

416
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.351
but this,

417
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:14.680
this was the first submission or reddit and it wasn't that new at the time,

418
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.840
but I was just thinking like,
Hey,
what if it would be,

419
00:23:16.841 --> 00:23:18.100
if this thing actually worked,

420
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:21.970
like what would we want reddit to be a place to like find and have people link

421
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:23.890
to?
And this seemed like the perfect thing,
right?

422
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:27.970
The Internet enabled some person to put this image of a leaked document online

423
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:30.970
and share to the world right now massive printing press.
And uh,

424
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.550
but what's crazy is we thought that's how it was going to always be.

425
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.830
Maybe like three years in some user because users are fucking clever.
Um,

426
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.780
linked to a comments page like they knew when they hit submit what the link

427
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:46.040
would be like if the number of the random number we

428
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.170
<v 2>will not quite random to sequential number we would generate.</v>

429
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.290
And so they linked to what they effectively do is create a self post,

430
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.820
which is now a feature in the site,

431
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:55.910
but basically read it only used to let people link out to other sites.

432
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.900
One user hacked it and learned you could just link to itself and create this

433
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:02.660
amazing comment thread so you wouldn't,
you know when you click on it,

434
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:03.680
when you do an Ama right,

435
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.380
you're not creating something that links somewhere else.

436
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.140
You're creating something that just creates a reddit comment page.

437
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.500
And what that user did by hacking the site was show that there was a tremendous

438
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:18.440
value in just saying,
hey,
people have a discussion about whatever it is.

439
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.220
And today I,

440
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.170
I believe it's a little less than half of our like content is actually linking

441
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.490
to read it.
So it's actually,

442
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:29.480
it's an ama or it's an ask historians post or it's just people talking about

443
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:31.640
shit.
It's not even linking to other content on the Internet.

444
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.330
And we never could've seen that coming.
Wow,
that's awesome.

445
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.960
And it was just the user being creative,
uh,
basically hacking our site to,

446
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.150
you know,
that that word we need to take back.
We need to take back hat.

447
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.610
It's not get a positive thing.
Yeah.
It's,
you can life hack you and you see this,

448
00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:50.210
right?
You can life how you can,
you can body hack.
You can basically find a,

449
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.320
understand the system so well that you can find an optimal way to use it to your

450
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:56.240
advantage.
That's it.
That's hacking.
It's not,

451
00:24:56.241 --> 00:25:00.950
it's not the like Angelina Jolie bagging on a keyboard hoodie and like doing

452
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:05.230
evil.
It can be,
but it's,
it's a much more innocuous word.
Yeah.
It's,

453
00:25:05.231 --> 00:25:09.380
it seems to have weird,
it's kind of combination of meanings.

454
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:11.090
It's like some people use it in a negative way,

455
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:14.060
but some people look use it in a positive way.
Like,
dude,

456
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.060
I fucking hack the system.
I got it sound like someone's saying,

457
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:21.470
I hacked the system.
That's that.
That's,
you know,
that's in a positive way.
But Oh,

458
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:25.460
these hackers broke into this website and put Dixon everybody's picture.

459
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.920
You know,
like that's how we look at it.

460
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:32.270
And we also have this weird sort of connection to adolescents,

461
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.350
like adolescent prankster hacking being some sort of an adolescent prankster

462
00:25:36.351 --> 00:25:38.990
type behavior,
which I don't think it's fair either.

463
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.930
You know what it is and that's it.
That's an interesting point.
There are,

464
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.250
there's definitely the,
there's uh,
there was a,

465
00:25:45.251 --> 00:25:49.420
so there was always been a spirit of like pranking in the hacker community.

466
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.670
I'm talking,
Oh,
like,
oh gee,
hackers like MIT building in early,

467
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:54.860
like Steve Wasniak be an example.
Um,

468
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.360
and I think what's cool is there's that childlike wonder like,

469
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.640
because I think a lot of that shit usually gets beaten out of us as we get
older,

470
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.640
especially in a lot of traditional industries and whatnot.

471
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.570
And so I'd like to believe that that can even like be an excuse for people to

472
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:12.620
think about stuff a little differently and think about stuff a little more.
Like,

473
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.420
let's face takes,
take things less seriously as part of that broader cultural,

474
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:18.291
no,

475
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:22.610
it's cool that there's a prankster type thing rather than an evil vicious mean

476
00:26:22.611 --> 00:26:23.600
type thing.
You know,

477
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:26.960
like when they hacked someone's and they put a smiley face on the front page

478
00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.610
instead of,
that's kind of funny.
It's kind of funny,
you know?
Well,

479
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.910
when now we know that someone can hack into your page.
I mean in,

480
00:26:33.911 --> 00:26:37.860
in a way it's probably good that you know that that's possible.
Yeah.
I mean,

481
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.480
I don't encourage people to just go hack it.

482
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.370
Everybody's website because it fucks up that person's Day.
But all in all,

483
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.320
<v 0>overall</v>

484
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.560
<v 2>you should be lucky that someone's doing that and that if they're doing it,</v>

485
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:52.140
hopefully they're not stealing your credit card information and doing it

486
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:56.040
maliciously.
There's a whole,
I mean there we can,
I can dig into this.
There's the,

487
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:56.760
so there's the white,

488
00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.580
so they're like the white hat hacker is the quintessential like,
Hey,

489
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:03.150
I found out there's a problem with your of website.
I'm not going to exploit it.

490
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.260
I'm just telling you so you need to fix it or hire me.
And it fixes bug,

491
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.110
but usually just like,
and we had,
we've had white hat hackers,
um,

492
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.130
periodically emailing us with exploits on reddit that have done us a huge

493
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:17.340
service because they told us about this thing we could,
I mean,

494
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.350
you can't possibly know every,
no,
you can can't,
you know,
it's interesting man.

495
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.650
It's,
it's the,

496
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.450
the amount of information that's available now has got it's so,

497
00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.090
it's so the world is so wired that it's like

498
00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:36.390
<v 0>we're standing in this crazy river of ideas that are just constantly flying by</v>

499
00:27:36.761 --> 00:27:40.810
us and a few people are looking around and poking their head up out of the water

500
00:27:40.811 --> 00:27:45.320
and just looking at each other going,
Holy Shit.
And the,

501
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.370
the Internet is where it all sort of pools together.

502
00:27:48.371 --> 00:27:49.930
I mean that's the channel for it all.

503
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.500
And that's where it all pulls together in places like reddit or places like

504
00:27:53.501 --> 00:27:57.400
Twitter all over where you just,
you think about how much you know now,

505
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.240
how many things you've been exposed to now,
how many strange bits of information,

506
00:28:01.241 --> 00:28:06.040
all the chaos that was caused by wikileaks and Edward Snowden and all this
stuff.

507
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.580
Where's all this coming from?
Well,
it's all on the Internet.

508
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.820
The Internet is it just boom,
booms like these shots are being fired,

509
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.860
these holes are being exploded into the system.
And then,
you know,

510
00:28:17.861 --> 00:28:21.340
there's a bunch of scrambling to try to put scaffolding up where the whole

511
00:28:21.341 --> 00:28:25.810
wasn't.
Boom.
Another hole gets blown out of the fucking society standards.

512
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:31.090
<v 2>It is weird.
It is,
is probably a really scary time to be an incumbent.</v>

513
00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.640
Uh Oh yeah.
But it's a great time to be an upstart.
It's a great time.

514
00:28:34.641 --> 00:28:38.320
They'll be someone who is trying to find a way to get their ideas to the world

515
00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.490
because there's never been a better time and yeah,

516
00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:44.350
there's never been a better time to be an honest politician.
It's a good,

517
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:49.180
good move.
And that's,
that's just it.
Right.
That brings us like,
I god,

518
00:28:49.181 --> 00:28:53.390
I hope we get there because we need to,
I'm a big fan of the states and evolve.

519
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.290
I really do.
It's just gonna take a lot.

520
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.880
It's just going to take a lot of these old fucks getting out of office.

521
00:28:57.881 --> 00:29:01.120
These people that have been doing it in a sneaky,
dirty,

522
00:29:01.121 --> 00:29:04.060
underhanded way since the jump.
You know what I mean?

523
00:29:04.061 --> 00:29:07.600
There's fucking people in office that were alive when Kennedy was assassinated

524
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.480
and they were there like in government and they're still,

525
00:29:10.481 --> 00:29:13.930
they're still involved in something that was supposed to be a career.
Uh,

526
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.710
pretty sure.

527
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.170
Pretty sure the founding fathers didn't want it to be a career that was the

528
00:29:17.171 --> 00:29:18.420
exact opposite of that.

529
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.700
That's one of the reasons why they wanted to put term limits and wanted to make

530
00:29:21.701 --> 00:29:22.534
sure that

531
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.580
<v 0>they don't get too much of a stranglehold on how things operate because men just</v>

532
00:29:27.581 --> 00:29:30.520
do that and men are creepy fucks when we get power.

533
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.610
Some of us that get to positions of power like that,

534
00:29:33.611 --> 00:29:36.130
they just distort things to their advantage.

535
00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.780
And then you're stuck with lobbyists and you're stuck with these Arlin Spector

536
00:29:40.781 --> 00:29:44.890
type and who,
who's also involved in a single bullet theory.

537
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.710
He's one of those long term.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

538
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.530
He was the guy who came up with the idea.

539
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.800
He was the like when people say the single bullet theory,

540
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:58.660
you know you're looking at it all wrong.
Arlen Specter motherfucker,
that guy,

541
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.830
that guy came up with it.
That's how goofy that fucking idea was.

542
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.330
One bullet went through two people and caused all this fucking damage in their

543
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:11.090
body and barely like barely dented the bullet.
The bullet.

544
00:30:11.091 --> 00:30:14.080
It looked beautiful little pieces of bullet in their bodies.

545
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.920
Nothing missing from the bullet,
whatever,
whatever.
This is a magic bullet.

546
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:22.030
This is a single bullet is that Arlen Specter guy.
It was his idea.

547
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:25.390
He had to come up with a reason why one bullet had done so much damage.

548
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.260
People right now that are anti Kennedy conspiracies theorists are going nuts

549
00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.920
right now possibly even on Reddit Rogan central Fulcan route toward with this

550
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:37.390
boot theory
but that all came from Ireland Specter.

551
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:40.330
That all came from that sort of old school politician.

552
00:30:40.331 --> 00:30:43.710
Those guys that had just been around and been a part of the system for just two

553
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.840
<v 2>long.
I wonder if it's possible to do to to,
I mean,
I want to,</v>

554
00:30:47.841 --> 00:30:50.570
I want to be hopeful enough to think that there is a chance for someone to get

555
00:30:50.571 --> 00:30:53.150
into it for the right reasons and then be able to stay in it for the right

556
00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:54.980
reasons there is,
and not get

557
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.930
<v 0>a lot of,
um,
prompt.
I mean,
fuck guys,</v>

558
00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.080
guys like Arland spectrum sharp probably got into it for all the right reasons,

559
00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.350
but I think there's certain systems that once you get into,

560
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.700
you just look around and you go,
oh,
fuck.
Like it's just such a mess.

561
00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:11.870
I'll viper's nest that.
You're like,
what?
When you're a young guy,
it's like,

562
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.680
did you see the movie a wolf of Wall Street?
Of course.
Yeah.
Well,
there's,

563
00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.640
I don't know how much of that was a hustle.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

564
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.940
whenever you have a story and the guy who it's his life,
it's based on a story,

565
00:31:23.941 --> 00:31:26.780
it's probably going to make them look a little bit nicer than he was.

566
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.850
A little bit more innocent in the beginning of the movie.

567
00:31:28.851 --> 00:31:33.080
But it's that system where you see Leonardo Dicaprio,
he starts out,

568
00:31:33.081 --> 00:31:35.690
he's a family man,
he's a nice guy.
He drinks water,

569
00:31:35.691 --> 00:31:37.370
he doesn't want to have anything to do with drugs.

570
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:42.440
And he gets co opted by the Matthew mcconaughey mcconaughey,
hey character.

571
00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.820
And then he becomes a part of this system that's fucked up.

572
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.520
And so he's a victim.
He becomes a,
someone that you can sort of sympathize with.

573
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.410
You know,
how much of that is,
is real.

574
00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.100
<v 2>Yeah.
That's,
I,
I definitely,
I can only imagine,
uh,</v>

575
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.160
cause you got to figure,
I mean why someone gets into that whole industry.

576
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:06.610
Actually the whole finance industry just blows my mind because I really like,

577
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.530
I really like making things and doing things and I just can't even wrap my head

578
00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:14.990
around getting into work every day and just hustling like that.
Well,

579
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.290
it's a crazy way to live.
Those guys are maniacs.

580
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.840
A guy used to know that I grew up with,
he,
uh,
became a stockbroker and he was,
um,

581
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.690
he was a maniac.
He was a maniac.
And all of a sudden he's like,
Bro,

582
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:28.710
we're fucking selling stocks and shit.
It's great.
It's amazing.
He,

583
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.020
I saw him in a bar,
we're going to a suit with a time like,

584
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:34.180
what the fuck are you doing with a suit on?
He was an animal,

585
00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:37.510
this guy and all of a sudden he was a stockbroker.
They'll like maniacs,

586
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:40.130
a lot of them.
Wild,
crazy

587
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.530
<v 0>gambling,
risking maniacs.</v>

588
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.090
I think if you had a job in a system like that,

589
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:50.260
and I'm not equating politicians with,
with,
uh,

590
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.130
these kind of guys with a stockbroker's,

591
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.690
but I think what a system that's equally fucked,

592
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.450
the political system is equally fucked as a financial system.

593
00:32:59.451 --> 00:33:01.040
You look at the both of them,
you're like,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Why?

594
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:04.160
Why are you doing it like that?
What does that a derivative is?
What is it?
Fuck,

595
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.940
oh no,
what did you guys make?
You're making things up,
but did you mate,

596
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.580
you have $100 billion.
You don't have any money.

597
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:15.540
There's no money here at all because it's crazy that that system is equally fuck

598
00:33:15.541 --> 00:33:18.710
to the political system.
Like,
wait,
the,
wait the fucking,
hold on a second.

599
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:21.110
The supreme court just changed the limits.

600
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.040
They just made it so that you can just unload money on politicians,

601
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:29.010
citizens United.
Uh,
yeah,
I got a nice little jump site.
Okay.
What crazy.

602
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.880
It's crazy.
Yeah.
So I think equal system,

603
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.190
once you incorporate yourself into it,

604
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:38.060
like a lot of these politicians who probably do go into it with good intentions,

605
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.410
I think you find along the ways that if you try to buck the system completely,

606
00:33:42.411 --> 00:33:44.090
you probably get blackballed.

607
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.960
There's probably going to be a lot of blow back against you by your party,

608
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.740
by competing parties.
You're going to,
you're going to be in a tough situation,

609
00:33:51.741 --> 00:33:54.260
you against the world.
And that's how they survive.

610
00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:57.650
They survive by sort of attacking each other like this and then propping up

611
00:33:57.651 --> 00:34:02.651
these individual candidates that differ only slightly from each other and all of

612
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:07.721
them supported by the same giant hood of money that comes from corporations.

613
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.060
It's crazy.
It's a crazy system.

614
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.930
So if you're a young guy and you're a senator from Delaware and you decide that

615
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:18.800
you want to make some changes in this world,
and if you elect me,

616
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:22.490
I'm going to about bla and boo boo.
And then he'd get in there and you're like,

617
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.020
oh fuck,
you're making me really optimistic right now.
Joe and I,

618
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:30.360
and I just got,
I got off my house of cards bender,
which,
you know,

619
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.770
those systems are inherently corrupting.
That's what I'm saying.

620
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.740
I just think that younger people have to it,

621
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:42.170
it almost has to be like transparency involved in your actions is going to reach

622
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.100
such a tipping point.
Oh yeah.
That there will be no room for corruption.

623
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.850
And once that happens,
different stories.
Yeah.

624
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.720
And it's kind of beyond the way there.
Right.
We all,
all the,

625
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.380
the forces certainly seem to be on their way.
I mean,
it's crazy.

626
00:34:54.381 --> 00:34:58.100
We still live in an age where these senators and Congress people are still doing

627
00:34:58.101 --> 00:35:02.930
what they're doing on there.
And,
uh,
Twitter direct messages or,
uh,
I mean,

628
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:07.250
sending Dick Pics,
Yo.
But the funny thing is there's this kind of like,
okay,

629
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.110
at a certain point there'll be a mutually assured destruction where like,

630
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:14.510
the president is going to have like photos of herself from like a party in high

631
00:35:14.511 --> 00:35:15.380
school.
Right.

632
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.440
We're going to get to a certain point where everyone's got shit on everyone from

633
00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:20.780
all this stuff we did ever.
But that,
that's going to take a little while.

634
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.780
And in the meantime,
I mean,
I hope that the,
the,

635
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:28.070
the thing that still makes me hopeful is coming back to the sort of finance side

636
00:35:28.071 --> 00:35:32.810
of things.
Um,
money is the corrupting influence in Washington,
one of the biggest,

637
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.261
and,

638
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:37.290
and right now there are a few people who can put in a lot of money and having a

639
00:35:37.291 --> 00:35:38.124
lot of an effect.

640
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.580
<v 2>What I hope the Internet can do,
and we've started seeing this happen,
is,</v>

641
00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:44.550
is in the same way that it's given a voice to people through social media,

642
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.840
we can start using small amounts of money and in aggregate started having a

643
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:49.621
really big impact.

644
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:53.820
And we saw as we've seen these money bombs before in Oh eight and in 12 but I

645
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:56.070
feel like the software is going to keep getting better and better with

646
00:35:56.071 --> 00:36:00.210
crowdfunding and with these models that are going to really inspire people to

647
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:02.340
want to give to a candidate and know that there's actually going to be

648
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:05.760
accountability too with how that's spent and who they are and whatnot.

649
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.140
One of the big ones,

650
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.440
one of the really big ones that people think is kind of frivolous,

651
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:14.850
especially people who don't smoke marijuana is the legalization of it and the

652
00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:19.620
legalization of marijuana and in Washington state and Colorado is fucking

653
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:23.550
gigantic.
Yeah.
Those impacts that it's had on their economy.

654
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.960
It's been so big that there's,
everyone's forced to step back and go,

655
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:30.540
wait a minute,
wall.
Okay.
All right,

656
00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:35.541
so now we know Eddie hands rubbing on their pants and a lot of late night

657
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:39.750
meetings and a lot of guys pacing back and forth.
A lot of people yelling,
John,

658
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.250
they're going to smoke pot.
Okay,
they're gonna fucking smoking.
No matter what.

659
00:36:43.251 --> 00:36:47.100
What are we doing here?
Let's make some money.
We cannot,
we can't fix the street.

660
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.760
We can't hire new teachers.
Well,
and that's the,
and that's right.
If,
if,
uh,

661
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.820
if that money being used in the Oregon's drugs were being used for more

662
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:56.640
productive things and we did legalize,
my goodness,

663
00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:01.500
the war against drugs is just a farce.
Crazy idea.
It's a crazy term.

664
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:04.500
It's like the war against breathing,
you know,
we figured out drugs,

665
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:07.380
it's probably made,
it made people better in a million different ways.

666
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.720
The idea that you've got a war against it as this and it just,

667
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:12.120
you're calling it drugs.
You don't make any distinction.

668
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.590
The war against negative lethal drugs that are addictive,

669
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.270
you're not going to make it any distinctions is just the war against drugs.

670
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:22.370
Somebody got to break in the fucking store and steal the aspirin at gunpoint.

671
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.640
Like,
what does this war you're saying?
Yeah,
it's ridiculous.
It's preposterous.

672
00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:30.600
And I hope the,
uh,
I know dcs,
I don't know where DC is that right now,

673
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:33.340
is that it was on the table.
Maryland just decriminalized.
Yeah,
that's awesome.

674
00:37:33.341 --> 00:37:35.310
Step in the right direction.
And I mean,
what happens?
Like,

675
00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:38.070
what happens if we get legal weed in the district of Columbia?

676
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.680
Now I know they're not technically a state because that's ridiculous,

677
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:44.860
but it will happen.
It has to.
But like the point,
you know,
I like,

678
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.670
I see the discrepancy between the federal law and the state laws,

679
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:50.970
but like if you're not having feds knocking down doors and the district of

680
00:37:50.971 --> 00:37:52.800
Columbia,
like,
you know,

681
00:37:52.801 --> 00:37:55.230
I think maybe everyone's in agreement here and you see so many,

682
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.940
so many x law enforcement's so many ex DEA people come out in support of

683
00:37:59.941 --> 00:38:04.110
legalization because they read the goal.
If we have a common goal here,

684
00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.320
um,
to actually make our streets safer and actually curb the,

685
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.970
the criminal element that comes in with this,
um,

686
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.710
legalization is the way to do it and make a lot of money and help help a lot of

687
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:16.710
people live better lives because they don't have to be treated like criminals

688
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.720
for a drug like marijuana.

689
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.550
I've never seen a single person that I didn't think was just trolling say that

690
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:25.590
they think that marijuana should stay illegal.

691
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.030
Anyone worth having a conversation with?
Like when I hear Ann Coulter say it,

692
00:38:30.031 --> 00:38:33.260
I'm like,
this bitch is trolling.
She's trolls.
Trolls too.
Good at it.

693
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.770
Obvious troll is out half a fucking smile while she's doing it.
Yeah.

694
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.100
Did you just meme it,
good

695
00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.850
thing that came out of places like Reddit is means met Reddit and message

696
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:47.170
boards.
These dreams,

697
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:52.120
I mean there are obviously a four Chan is still a hub for a lot of that meme

698
00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:55.240
creation.
I feel like,
I feel like at this point hub,
right?
Yes.

699
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.610
And that's where it all began.
Isn't it a way?
It is.

700
00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.630
I mean it is one of the war map scores and that's a classic for Chia.

701
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:06.570
That picture.
Yeah,
that's a classic fortunate picture.
It,
uh,
and it's,

702
00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:11.050
it's,
it's just,
it's so interesting because now there are enough basically,

703
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.970
right.
10 years ago,
the culture,

704
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:15.490
people who were spending a lot of time communicating on a forms online was

705
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:18.710
pretty small.
And now,
right.
Everyone's taking their selfies.

706
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.320
Like it has reached a point where,
uh,
it's nearly,
it's so,

707
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.920
so ubiquitous,
are so close to it.
They,
yeah,
these,
these memes,
these funny,

708
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:28.020
interesting image,
Mac,

709
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.570
whatever they are can catch hold and literally millions of people can see it.

710
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:35.380
I mean it gets a little weird when you see like Rick Astley in the Thanksgiving

711
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.370
Day parade a couple of years ago.
Rick Rolling a little,

712
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:43.370
that's like a little weird little art influencing life and it's change way.
Yeah.

713
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.840
Yeah.
That was weird man.
The Rick Roll.

714
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.470
It's a strange thing with something just catches on like a virus,

715
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:53.950
like a real disease and spreads across,
I mean,

716
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:58.400
or an organism almost like a thing with a lifespan.
We like as,

717
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.050
I mean as humans we are,
and I'm not,
I'm not saying plagiarism here,

718
00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:06.970
but like we are sort of intrinsically copy machines and that like early man,

719
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:10.510
right.
Sees someone else hunting a little better than him and he's like,
oh,

720
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.420
I could use that as a weapon dude.
This guy,
this guy over here,

721
00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:14.500
let's all make weapons.
Right?

722
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:17.590
And we are really good at seeing what someone is doing it.
That's how we learn.

723
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.760
Yes.
And,
and what's so wild is,
you know,
because of that hyper connectivity,

724
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:24.520
because of how fast these ideas now spread,
right?
These memes,

725
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.070
like humans are naturally really good at this,

726
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:30.240
but now we can spread this shit faster than ever before.
Right?
It within hours,

727
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.210
million within minutes,

728
00:40:31.211 --> 00:40:34.780
millions of people can see and interesting photo of a cat or an interesting

729
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:38.320
video or what have you.
You know,
Alexis,
you can't do that on your own.

730
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:39.670
You didn't get there on your own.

731
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.920
I think what Obama was trying to say when he was trying to say that,
uh,

732
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.900
you didn't build that,
you didn't make that and he's,
you know,

733
00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.760
the about the infrastructure that's required to build your own small business

734
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:55.300
member was that speech that he was so criticized from there was that that quote

735
00:40:55.301 --> 00:40:59.730
was,
it was definitely taken out of context.
The reality is it was,
he,

736
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.150
he said it very poorly,

737
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.600
but it's essentially what we're saying is we all needed someone before us to

738
00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:09.700
come up with all these ideas that we all pee back,
shoulders of giants,
man.

739
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:13.540
And I everybody,
look,
dude,
I mean I,
I have been incredibly fortunate,
right?

740
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:18.310
I sold my company when I was 23 years old.
All right,
that is crazy.
Crazy dude.

741
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:21.640
How much coke did you do?
Don't lie.
I have actually never done coke.
Good for you.

742
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.370
If you were hanging out with that guy and it was done coke,

743
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:29.200
you would add too much coke and you'd be,
I'd ask you that question.
You'd go,

744
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.980
wow,
bad things.
Weird eyebrow hair.
You can't like when did that start

745
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.450
<v 0>growing coke?
It's not,
I am,</v>

746
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.740
I feel like caffeine is enough of a stimulant for me.
Um,

747
00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.360
that I'm more interested in the stuff that calms me down.
Yeah.
Chills me out,

748
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:47.510
chills me out.
And that's what I think would change.

749
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:52.210
And I think that's one of the things that is changing right now in,

750
00:41:52.211 --> 00:41:55.900
in America because of the fact that the spread of this stuff,
the,

751
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.000
what the spread is starting out first of all,
information wise,

752
00:41:59.001 --> 00:42:02.330
when people found out the real truth about,
look,
the LD 50 rates,

753
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.940
like you can't die from it.
Like it's not possible.

754
00:42:04.941 --> 00:42:08.180
And that Malarkey document or film reefer madness.
Oh,
it's great.

755
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:13.280
It's great to watch now.
Fascinating.
Oh yeah.

756
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:17.330
It's um,
that's a,
that's a fascinating movie.
It's fun to watch today,

757
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.900
but just a lot of people that still believe that it does something negative,

758
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.570
that it slows you down or removes motivation.
I think,
um,

759
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.370
people have to realize like the motivation for motivation in the first place.

760
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:36.110
Like why,
why is that so inspiring to you?
I'm like,
what is,
what is motivation?

761
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.230
You want someone to get off their ass and get a job and get to work.
Well,

762
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.380
they just have to be excited about something.
You know,

763
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:44.810
the most likely they're more excited about sitting on the couch and whatever it

764
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:46.250
is they're being exposed to in their life,

765
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:49.850
it doesn't mean that marijuana removes motivation means that if you're one of

766
00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:54.560
those lazy bitches that doesn't think outside the box and you're stuck in a spot

767
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:57.650
and your discontent and you like to get high and sit on the couch,

768
00:42:57.651 --> 00:42:59.510
she probably going to be like that for the rest of your life.

769
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.270
But that's okay too.
Is it is a,

770
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.030
it's not harming anyone except those are the same people that would drink cough

771
00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:07.880
syrup.
It would drink fucking crops here up until they,
you know,

772
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:12.170
their liver failed syrup.
[inaudible] Syrup.
I mean for real.

773
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:15.400
That is the same.
They're the same people.
And the idea that it did the,

774
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.920
all the benefits reported by people like I'm not saying you smoke a little weed,

775
00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:23.690
what I'm saying,
probably smoke a little weed or me or anyone else who does that.

776
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.270
That's,
that's all discounted.
Yeah.
And not to mention,

777
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:28.460
I mean seriously on it from a medical standpoint,

778
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:33.290
I mean you can't fight like every day there's another story from another person

779
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:36.110
who's using it to get through chemo or using it to get their app.

780
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.070
Like when you see that many people's lives being so positively affected by the

781
00:43:40.071 --> 00:43:44.290
thing that's naturally occurring,
like really it,
come on guys,
it's all,

782
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.400
it's truly unbelievable story.

783
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:51.320
The fact that it's still around in 2014 was really a truly unbelievable story

784
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.800
because if you looked at it logically and factually and said,

785
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:59.801
could you imagine a culture in which information is sent instantaneously all

786
00:44:00.651 --> 00:44:01.610
over the globe,

787
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.630
to which the answer to virtually any question a person can come up with can be

788
00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:08.060
answered on your phone in a matter of seconds,

789
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.210
that you truly have the information,

790
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.080
the current information of the world at your disposal.

791
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.200
Could you imagine that there would be one of the most beneficial plants that

792
00:44:18.201 --> 00:44:22.580
grows easily contains essentially amino acids.
It's very high in protein.

793
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.420
It can make you think about things differently.
It can make food taste better.

794
00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:31.370
It makes sex feel better.
It makes you sleep easier.
It removes anxiety,

795
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.520
it makes you nicer and kinder.
The sounds amazing.
You would go,
yeah,

796
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:39.090
but it's illegal and it's a schedule one drug and the record screeches and

797
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:41.850
you're like,
wait,
hold on.
What do you use?
This was used to be,

798
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:46.450
this was a major help,
was a major crop for the 13 colonies.
Yeah.
I'm like,

799
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:48.930
well,
when they figured out the cotton gin,

800
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:51.060
that's when things got a little weirder because um,

801
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.470
they used to make clothes with him.
But before the 1930s,
1930s,

802
00:44:55.471 --> 00:44:58.470
they came up with a thing called the decorticator and the decorticator was,

803
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.910
it was for the first time they could use this giant machine to break down the

804
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:07.380
hemp fiber because before they use slavery and then when slavery was abolished

805
00:45:07.381 --> 00:45:11.710
and the cotton gin was invented all along,
sort of in the same timeframe,
the,

806
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:15.060
the shift went to cotton and a way from from him.

807
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.760
It's really kind of fascinating.
This is like Wikipedia.

808
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.000
I know a few things that I've seen in documentaries,

809
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.230
but it's a fascinating,
fascinating story because one,

810
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.070
what was really Schwittt shutdown marijuana is the crop hemp.

811
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.410
That's what shut it down.
And that's the main reason why today,

812
00:45:31.411 --> 00:45:35.910
like when I was talking about on it,
we can't grow our own hemp.
We would love to,

813
00:45:35.911 --> 00:45:39.900
we would love to pay a farmer to grow hemp for our protein powder.
That way.

814
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:43.140
We could monitor the soil,
we could make sure everything's organic.

815
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:45.330
We can do all the right steps,
but we can't do it.
We can't.

816
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.750
We literally can't do it in America.
Land of the free,
but it's,

817
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:52.710
it's totally non psychoactive.
That's what's so stupid.
Like it's,

818
00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:56.520
it doesn't what you're getting when you're getting like a hemp bag or are you

819
00:45:56.521 --> 00:46:00.240
getting hemp protein powder?
This is a zero THC in there.
It's not in there.

820
00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:04.230
Not smoke kids.
You cannot smoke your handbag.
Don't try and do it.

821
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:09.240
But the idea that that somehow in other can be illegal because it's related.

822
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.500
It's crazy.
I mean that's like a poppy plant.
Like you could have a poppy plant,

823
00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:17.550
you can eat a Bagel were bananas.
It's crazy.

824
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:18.780
And then you know what it is though.

825
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.800
Here's the real victims of ending the drug war would be all those prisons that

826
00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:27.180
would no longer be full of young black men.
You say this,

827
00:46:27.181 --> 00:46:30.540
but what if your business is running prisoners,
right?

828
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.900
What if your business is prison guards?
I mean,
that's another thing.

829
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:36.210
When someone think of the prison,

830
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:41.450
the prison industrial complex prison guards lobby against drug legalization is

831
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:43.530
they do it because they want to stay in office.

832
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:46.770
They want to keep their jobs and how many lives has to be ruined in the process.

833
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.680
It's fucking crazy.
It's a vampire system,

834
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:54.000
so horrible van system and it's a system that's brought out of,

835
00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:59.350
it's based on these reverberations are these vibrations from the past.

836
00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:03.630
It's all like the scramble when people were retarded when they came over on

837
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:07.770
boats and this is just how they did things and throw in a jail.

838
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.710
He'll fucking scoundrel you were smoking marijuana or whatever.

839
00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:15.540
The rule that you broke is that they realize that they can do it so they do do

840
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:19.950
it and they throw you in some fucking cage in 2014 the fact that's still going

841
00:47:19.951 --> 00:47:22.880
on and that people are actually profiting from it.
This is,

842
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.920
these are more things that the Internet has a huge fucking problem with because

843
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:30.190
the Internet is guys like you is young fellas that are very and unconventional

844
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.970
<v 2>and seeing the system and being like,
you know what?
I don't buy it.
I think a,</v>

845
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.850
there's shit that people I knew growing up that were adults,

846
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:38.230
I knew there were fucking idiots and they do,

847
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:40.930
they made bad choices and now I'm looking at the,

848
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:45.610
the repercussions of this everywhere I'm looking at an item saying,
no,

849
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.730
this is dumb,
this is,
so this is one of the things,

850
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.600
especially talking to college students that I love bringing up,
which is that,

851
00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:56.410
and I'm the first to admit like I have no fucking clue what I'm doing 99% of the

852
00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:59.710
time,
especially when I got started,
I still don't know.
And I've,

853
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:02.740
I've come to realize like I don't,
I've got,

854
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.750
I've got been lucky enough to meet some pretty like successful,

855
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:07.180
impressive people.
But like you think going to the surface,

856
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:09.900
we're all just hacking it.
Like we're all just fake expertise,
experience,

857
00:48:09.901 --> 00:48:13.240
those things all help.
But like every one of us is a fallible human.

858
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.620
All the conventions and rules and status quo we know were created by other

859
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:21.400
fallible humans.
And there's no reason not to look at that and go,
Huh,

860
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.740
does it have to be that way?
Or why is it that way?

861
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:27.490
And if the reason why is that's the way it is.
Well,
that's a terrible reason,

862
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.170
you know?
And,
and when you see the world as being that hackable,
so to speak,

863
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.210
like you start to realize,
all right,
well let's just,

864
00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:36.640
let's actually question stuff.
And,
and for,
you know,

865
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:41.530
I remember I was a freshman at Uva when nine 11 happened for this generation of

866
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:44.020
millennials coming up.
We,
we mow nearly all of us.

867
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.860
One of our first really vivid memories of the world was nine 11 this awful

868
00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:48.694
tragedy.

869
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.630
And then we get into these two wars and then think of all the authority figures

870
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:54.250
we've had in our life since that moment.

871
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:58.030
They've all at one point other either misled us,
this sort of deceived us.

872
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.090
You've got the financial crisis,
you've got the housing bubble,

873
00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:04.140
all these conventions.
Oh,
trust us,
we know what we're doing.
This is the thing,

874
00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.340
the American dream is buying a home,
go to college,

875
00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:09.160
take on that student loan debt.
Don't worry,
there's a job waiting for you.

876
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.840
Every single one these conventions from,

877
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.330
from all these people in power have not held up.

878
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.550
And so I think in particular millennials,

879
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.920
millennials look at that very skeptically cause we were like,
all right,

880
00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:20.920
you know what?
So the conventional stuff didn't work out for anything.

881
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.590
Like we have no choice but to realize,
you know what,
we're all just hacking it.

882
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:26.140
So let's,
let's really,
let's dive into the passion.
Let's,

883
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.060
let's figure out a better way to do something.

884
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.540
Not Settle for the way they've always been.
I think you're completely right.

885
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:33.310
And I think,
um,
first of all,

886
00:49:33.311 --> 00:49:37.540
I'm slightly annoyed by this new statement and I'm first to absorb millennials.

887
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.620
I know it's terrible for you.
I'm sorry.
Not Sorry.
I'm not buying.

888
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.760
We can rebrand this.
I think we should.

889
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:47.320
I really do because I think there's a divisiveness or there's a separation that

890
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:52.150
comes when you start labeling people by like what era they were born in.

891
00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.630
It's a,
it's a state of mind more than it is.
Yeah,
I think so,

892
00:49:55.631 --> 00:49:59.910
but I think it's horseshit generation x generation y to fuck up.
It's just human.

893
00:49:59.911 --> 00:50:03.070
It's like this,
this idea of putting things in a label generalization.

894
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.380
The human race is evolving.

895
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:09.280
Watch father knows best and then watch game of Thrones.
Okay,

896
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.200
shit's different now.

897
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.700
We don't have to come up with names for the generations and your generation y

898
00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:20.650
and there was fucking Jamie from the laugh factory.
Tried to tell my friend,
uh,

899
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:23.860
Todd Parker.
Todd Parker's a standup comic that I started out with.

900
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.100
Jamie was like,
buddy,
you have to be generation x guy.
This

901
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.450
<v 0>is what you do.
You go on stage and everything.
My generation,
generation x,</v>

902
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:34.310
think that's going to be your hook.

903
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.810
And I remember him trying to explain it to change it.

904
00:50:36.811 --> 00:50:39.680
I'm in the background going,
don't fuck it.

905
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.130
<v 4>Did you hear what he told Tony to do?</v>

906
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.850
What he tell you must always wear a cowboy hat.

907
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.790
It just look like woody from toy

908
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.410
<v 0>cause he needed the hat shopping for that.
Jamie,</v>

909
00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:58.300
the guy who owns Jamie Masada,

910
00:50:58.301 --> 00:51:00.760
the guy who owns the laugh factor is a sweetheart of a guy.

911
00:51:00.761 --> 00:51:03.040
He is a very nice guy.
I love him to death,

912
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:07.450
but he's crazy and he gives advice to comedians and he was a comedian one point

913
00:51:07.451 --> 00:51:07.930
in time.

914
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:12.930
He might've been the second or third worst comedian that's ever walked the face

915
00:51:13.241 --> 00:51:15.880
of the earth,
but as a club owner,
he's like one of the best.

916
00:51:15.881 --> 00:51:19.330
He's a sweetheart of a guy.
He wasn't the worst comedian.
He just,

917
00:51:19.331 --> 00:51:22.240
we sit second or third,
barely speaks English and he's not funny,

918
00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:23.860
but he's a sweetheart of a guy,

919
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:27.050
but his ideas are terrible and he'll like tell young comedians,

920
00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:31.780
so like pull you aside buddy.
Listen,
this is your move from here on out.

921
00:51:31.781 --> 00:51:33.010
You go on stage.

922
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.180
You were a superhero costume with Falcon who don't look like stupid,
you know,

923
00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.910
that's the joke.
I want to know.

924
00:51:39.911 --> 00:51:42.760
Is there a comic somewhere who actually took his advice?
Oh yeah,

925
00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:44.350
there's been a bunch.
There's a bunch.

926
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:47.740
I want to main name any names because it's sort of like someone who got tricked

927
00:51:47.741 --> 00:51:49.690
by a guy who said he was in the military,

928
00:51:49.691 --> 00:51:52.630
so they had sex with them and then it turns out it was just a liar and the girl

929
00:51:52.631 --> 00:51:55.840
feels bad.
I don't want to shame anybody.
I won't say any names,
but yeah,

930
00:51:55.841 --> 00:51:57.640
there were some comedians for sure.

931
00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:01.750
There was definitely some comedians at listened and changed their,
their persona,

932
00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.360
you know,
and came up with like a,
a plan and none.

933
00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:09.290
It never worked because once jammies got you dancing,
first of all keep,
no,

934
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:12.940
I couldn't throw the dance body.
You're dancing bad.

935
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.100
It's not my dance moves are good.

936
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:19.690
Mitzi did it also with Carlos been it's,
he made,
um,
well,

937
00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:24.280
I mean,
I dunno,
I dunno mean allegedly it was mrs idea,

938
00:52:24.281 --> 00:52:26.050
but obviously we're not pals with that dude,

939
00:52:26.051 --> 00:52:29.680
so we probably shouldn't tell his life story without checking in with him.

940
00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:34.300
He probably doesn't even know it.
This soilage.
Yeah,
well I don't hate the guy,

941
00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.560
just hate what he's doing.

942
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.010
But there's been a lot of those club owners that come up.

943
00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.690
The best club owners are like Wendy from Denver who just stands back.

944
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.330
She's,
you know,
if you're doing well,
you're doing well.

945
00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.130
She encourages originality and her clubs are built like a real scene in Denver

946
00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.540
just because of her.

947
00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.920
Like if there's one person that like is important for the,
the,

948
00:52:56.921 --> 00:52:59.500
the entire Denver comedy scenes.
Just One lady,
Wendy.

949
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.710
<v 4>Mitzi ever give you any advice that you either took or</v>

950
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:06.670
<v 0>do have SEO Dardy you're too dirty.
It's clearly,</v>

951
00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:10.910
clearly too sick.
What you said was sick.
It wasn't fine.

952
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.120
It was sick.
I used to have this bit about Anna Nicole Smith's husband.

953
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:17.790
This is the one she always hated on.
Unfortunately,

954
00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:19.260
there's no good versions of it online.

955
00:53:19.261 --> 00:53:21.540
I think it was an audio version we're going to do.
It's recorded now,

956
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.500
but it was a,
um,

957
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:27.360
it was all about him making do ugly things before,

958
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.600
before he died like that.
She was earning this money and then everybody's like,

959
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:32.730
oh,
she's stealing his money.
I'm like,
what are you talking about?

960
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:34.980
The guy made $1 billion from scratch.

961
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:38.000
Don't only thing he knows what the fuck is going on.
Like he's,
he was,

962
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:39.450
he was onto it.
Yeah.

963
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:43.020
So the joke was that he was going out in style with this big Fat Kentucky Fried

964
00:53:43.021 --> 00:53:44.430
Hooker and he was just,

965
00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:49.440
I mean it was just this horrendous old man,
young,

966
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.630
you know,
buxom blonde bit.
That just was so disgusting.
And Mitzi would go,

967
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:58.440
he gets to Scott's Dang.
It's not funny.
I'm like,
but why is everybody laughing?

968
00:53:58.441 --> 00:54:03.150
And there's fucking idiots.
You clearly don't have to.
I mean,

969
00:54:03.151 --> 00:54:04.890
this is like,
Hey,
it's nice advice.
But like,

970
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.350
if people are still laughing and buying drinks,
she's going to keep having you.

971
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.650
Well,
she'd loved me,
you know,
she's nice.
She's a sweet woman.

972
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:15.420
She just didn't like,
it wasn't her style of comedy.
You know,
I,
I get it.

973
00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:16.260
I get that.

974
00:54:16.261 --> 00:54:19.050
And there's some things that I did that she really loved and she wanted me to

975
00:54:19.051 --> 00:54:23.460
keep doing those.
And I love those too.
But there's shit that I'll do that I,
I,
I,

976
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:27.330
and I always have because I would laugh at it and my friends who are comics

977
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:31.470
would laugh at it.
Like I like if I know that Stan hope is in the room,

978
00:54:31.471 --> 00:54:35.590
I'll probably ramp something up just cause I know he's the,
I'll,
I'll,
you know,

979
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:39.460
add some extra fucked up shit to it just to get him to laugh.
Just,

980
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:43.230
just so some delight appropriate that I don't even mean,

981
00:54:43.231 --> 00:54:45.480
but I'll do it just for standup if he's in the room,

982
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:48.660
like we do that to each other.
Comics do that.
So when,

983
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:51.780
when a comic is writing a bit that's like really fucked up,
like half of it.

984
00:54:51.781 --> 00:54:56.090
It's just like to make your own jaded sense of comedy,
like jolted,

985
00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.990
you know,
just get a little fun.
Yeah.
Just see,
oh man,
that's,
I uh,

986
00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:05.400
that is the bar that I like cause I do a fair bit of public speaking.
Right.
But,

987
00:55:05.401 --> 00:55:10.110
um,
I don't have to fucking tell jokes like that stand up bar has to be,

988
00:55:10.111 --> 00:55:11.010
and I'm not just blowing smoke,

989
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:15.840
like it's gotta be the hardest like public speaking Gig to have to do.
It isn't,

990
00:55:15.841 --> 00:55:16.410
it isn't,

991
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:19.350
but to do it night after night to well that it actually makes it easier.

992
00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:23.880
Joey Diaz says it best.
Joey Diaz is,
he goes,
this is the easiest,

993
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:26.760
hardest thing you can do.
Okay.
It's the easiest,

994
00:55:26.761 --> 00:55:29.490
hardest thing you can do because if you do it right,
it's easy.

995
00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.370
If you got it down and not in the beginning,
God damn,

996
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:36.330
it takes a long time to not be on shaky legs every time you go on stage.

997
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.660
But once you get good enough to where you kind of like,

998
00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:42.270
you understand yourself better,
so he's not as insecure,

999
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.570
you're not as concerned about acceptance and you can kind of relax and you're

1000
00:55:45.571 --> 00:55:48.900
more comfortable in your own skin and then you kind of understand the roots of

1001
00:55:48.901 --> 00:55:51.900
humor better as you get older and then you become a comic.
So then boom,

1002
00:55:51.901 --> 00:55:55.770
you're a comic.
Um,
and I think from there it's all just about maintaining.

1003
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.710
It's about continuing to do it.
And once you do that,
it's fairly easy.

1004
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.720
It's like once you're doing that,

1005
00:56:00.721 --> 00:56:03.840
but it's like once the train is moving downhill,
it's going well,

1006
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:07.050
but if the train stops and you've got to get it up hill,
oh,
you're fucked.

1007
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:09.720
That's why guys,
when they take time off,

1008
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.310
something weird happens to comedians when they take like three years off of

1009
00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:17.130
comedy and then get back in because they're,
their prospects are slim.

1010
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:22.500
Those are some dark sets that you watch.
You can see the bottom of a man's soul.

1011
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.590
You see some shit,
man,
because they forgot how to do comedy.
I mean,

1012
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:29.080
they just fucking forgot how to do comedy.

1013
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.840
<v 4>That happens after a couple of weeks though,</v>

1014
00:56:30.841 --> 00:56:34.110
sometimes two weeks off and I went back on stage.
It was like,
Oh shit.

1015
00:56:34.111 --> 00:56:38.160
Why do I feel nervous right now?
Simon?
Tension.
I mean,

1016
00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:41.900
you don't really prepare that much and you don't listen to recordings.
And I do.

1017
00:56:41.901 --> 00:56:44.840
So every I tape every single women.
Oh yeah.

1018
00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:48.420
Usually it's on the way to the next gig.
I'll listen to that.

1019
00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.440
<v 0>That's a good one way to,</v>

1020
00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.610
but one way that I like is to sit down and listen with a notepad and write down

1021
00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:57.670
shit I shouldn't do anymore or write down shit.

1022
00:56:57.671 --> 00:57:02.110
That's the front end is clunky and it works over here and I'll just keep doing

1023
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:04.380
that.
This guys,
I'm glad you do do that.

1024
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:07.690
The guys who don't do that are really silly.
Like it's,
it's an important point.

1025
00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:08.380
I have to do it

1026
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:12.250
<v 4>as a high fraction all down and then have to write it out on the note cards and</v>

1027
00:57:12.251 --> 00:57:12.590
stuff.

1028
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:15.730
<v 0>That's a good move to if as far as memory,
that's the best way.</v>

1029
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:20.380
Writing things out physically in long hand or I write it down on my galaxy.

1030
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:25.060
I got this fucking galaxy.
Where is it?
How dare I left it out there somewhere,

1031
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.520
Mike.
The galaxy note three is big as well.

1032
00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:32.040
I've got an ogre hands so it's perfect.
I have a note three too.
Um,

1033
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:37.150
but it is outside.
Yeah.
Um,
but they are there.
They have that little note,

1034
00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:42.160
the stylus.
Right on my notes longhand.
They're both schools.
So instead of,

1035
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:45.500
I'm using it like,
like instead of having a notepad,

1036
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.710
but I always still have no pen anyway cause there's still,

1037
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.060
for whatever reason I haven't let go of the nipple.
But the um,

1038
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.900
the notes written notes on that are almost just as good.
I mean really,

1039
00:57:55.901 --> 00:58:00.010
it's very sensitive.
I'm a stylist skeptic.
Are you really?
I am.
I've never,
I've,

1040
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:01.780
I talked to him real quick.
I'll grew up the phone.

1041
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:03.960
I want to see if you fuck with it if you like it.
I mean I had like,

1042
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:05.890
I've just never,
I have no three.
I just have never,

1043
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.080
like I pulled it out and I was like,
Nah,

1044
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:12.140
<v 5>you have the pebble.
Have you tried the yes,
the gears or whatever the watches.</v>

1045
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:16.500
I don't want it from Samsung.
Don't even get me started.
The thing is,
uh,

1046
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.370
and here's the thing.
I had the first pebble there,
y Combinator company.
I've,

1047
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.780
I actually was,
I was sitting in the room when we interviewed them.

1048
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.930
I remember their first prototype and I was so blown away cause he's like,

1049
00:58:24.931 --> 00:58:26.810
here's some friendly Canadians.
I made a cool watch.
All right,

1050
00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.360
I'll talk to my phone if there was a blackberry back then.
And uh,

1051
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.690
and then they launched that campaign and I was like,
this is amazeballs,
right?

1052
00:58:33.691 --> 00:58:34.950
10 million on a Kickstarter.

1053
00:58:34.951 --> 00:58:37.980
I preordered mine and I got my watch and I was really impressed,

1054
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:41.400
but I was a little like,
I liked it,
I didn't love it.

1055
00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:44.610
I'd be wearing other watches back and forth once I got this one though.

1056
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:46.640
Seriously,
like game over every day.

1057
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:51.360
Really the fatal flaw that Samsung Watch aside from it doesn't play with Ios.

1058
00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:55.860
The fatal flaw is the battery life.
It's got a beautiful full color screen.

1059
00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:59.490
It lasts for maybe a day.
And like I got enough shit to charge every night.

1060
00:58:59.491 --> 00:59:03.330
Like I don't want to also have to charge my watch every single night or it

1061
00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:06.660
should have a builtin a charging mat or something that where you just take it

1062
00:59:06.661 --> 00:59:09.310
off and think about the new one.

1063
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:13.700
The gear to that just is supposedly better.
It looks interesting.
I,
you know,

1064
00:59:13.701 --> 00:59:15.940
and obviously like I said,
I'm buddies with the pebble guys,
right?
Um,

1065
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.530
so take this with a grain of salt,
but in all objectivity,

1066
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.480
I think it's an amazing,
the software,
the Ios,

1067
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:23.370
android obviously know they know what the fuck they're doing.

1068
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:26.690
The question is going to be the hardware.
Um,
if that,

1069
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.620
I mean that watches all just Photoshop right now,
right.

1070
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.200
If they can make a watch that has a decent battery life that looks that good.

1071
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:34.910
Okay.
All right.

1072
00:59:34.911 --> 00:59:37.790
I'm perking up but until I actually see something with a real battery on it,

1073
00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.410
I forget about Google glass just announced that Google glass,

1074
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:44.940
it's going to be available for one day only to anybody.

1075
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.200
And of course CNN uses the photo of the most hipster,
hipster

1076
00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.160
sweat.
This look at this.
Holy Shit.
Yeah,
those are all my house.

1077
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:59.530
<v 1>There's a joke notes.
She Damn,
I love this though.</v>

1078
00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.990
It's pretty bad ass man.
But this is really encouraging.

1079
01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:06.370
<v 5>I there,
there are,
um,
I really,
I don't know.</v>

1080
01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:07.510
I want to think like,

1081
01:00:07.511 --> 01:00:10.720
I feel like I'm still just as hungry as I was when I got started and I'm really

1082
01:00:10.721 --> 01:00:12.610
motivated and inspired.
Like,

1083
01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.130
cause I feel like if you want to stay on top of your game,

1084
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.420
this is the stuff you have to do.

1085
01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.590
Cause as soon as you start getting soft and start getting cocky or complacent,

1086
01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:23.710
man.
Right on that.
All right.
All right.
Let's see.

1087
01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.250
<v 1>I'll save it and I'll put it up as a Twitter message.
All right.
Okay.</v>

1088
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:32.500
It's fascinating because a,
it,
it doesn't,

1089
01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.850
it doesn't lack,

1090
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:37.000
like there's not anything where I'm doing it where I'm like this isn't

1091
01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:41.200
completely picking up what I'm,
what I'm writing.
They picks it up.
Exactly.

1092
01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:45.610
As long as the stylist is touching the screen,
it's perfect.

1093
01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:50.110
And so for like writing notes,
I'm in their small file so you can,
you know,

1094
01:00:50.111 --> 01:00:53.860
you'd have fucking thousands of these things that backs up automatically.

1095
01:00:53.861 --> 01:00:58.420
I get an email when it backs up.
Hmm.
Hello.
I literally never taken the stylus.

1096
01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:02.290
You can suck it.
You can suck it.
Apple until you come up with one of those,

1097
01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:07.030
you can suck it.
But I,
I remember jobs used to be very anti stylist.
Fuck jobs.

1098
01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:11.050
You can suck it too.
I'll dig you up and then you can suck it.
That was rude.

1099
01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.320
There it goes.
Saved.
I didn't mean it.

1100
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:19.060
<v 5>If I managed to do the new information that's coming out about the two new</v>

1101
01:01:19.061 --> 01:01:21.120
iPhones that come out this year,
it's,
you know what I heard,

1102
01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:26.230
<v 1>I heard 'em they're gonna make you gay?
No,
no.
Oh,
I heard that.
Oh,
look at that.
Oh,</v>

1103
01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.200
this is for the updates for the votes votes.
Okay.
I can,

1104
01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:33.850
and I can send this right now.
Just throw it up as an Instagram

1105
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:34.743
<v 5>set in the future.</v>

1106
01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.870
Pebble works with the iPhone and what information isn't sent it does it send

1107
01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:42.380
texts or he's kind of basic stuff.
You get notifications.
Um,
you know,

1108
01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:46.230
you can mess with your iTunes if you want advance,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Um,

1109
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:47.330
and there's a whole fear,

1110
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.440
I think the long play and it seems like a smart one is the APP store model.

1111
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:54.320
So pebble has their APP store and there are tons of different apps.

1112
01:01:54.321 --> 01:01:55.970
So I can check in on foursquare from my watch.

1113
01:01:55.971 --> 01:01:57.500
I don't have to be that guy who takes out his phone

1114
01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.030
<v 1>squared.
All right.
This is one thing that's whack about android.</v>

1115
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.060
When you use the Instagram APP,
it gives you this weird little,

1116
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.860
no one's going to to see this,
but it gives you a weird little window.
Oh,

1117
01:02:08.861 --> 01:02:13.270
they won't let,
you can't get your whole hallway.
That's wack as fuck.

1118
01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:18.160
Well see that was a great demo.
But see that's,
that's one way that the um,

1119
01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.020
the iPhone it over this,
no,

1120
01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.760
<v 5>no,
no.
That,
that the square ratio size is just an Instagram thing.</v>

1121
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:27.660
You have to use a different program,
like a,
what's it called?
Uh,

1122
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.600
should be,

1123
01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.380
it'll just add black space so that you should be able to shrink it though at tip

1124
01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:37.920
on the iPhone as you turn it sideways.
So it's the,
the wrong,
you know,

1125
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.860
like when you have a picture of the wrong way and then you take a screenshot of

1126
01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:43.620
that.
So it keeps the black bars on the side and then,
yeah,

1127
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.630
then you have less protein going to do a gangster.

1128
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:49.410
That was a pro tip tip by brown rice cropping.
So,
just as for,

1129
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:52.980
if you can get for the up votes and then the reddit alien,
that'll suffice.

1130
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:57.550
See what we can do that.
And I'm looking out for you.
No,

1131
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.070
we're going to have to do another one.
I have failed you just,
no you haven't,

1132
01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:05.910
you know.
No,
I feel like I'm letting everyone down here.
Just do a smaller one.

1133
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:10.810
We'll do one more,
but yeah,
Google glass for $1,500.
So Google glass.
Um,

1134
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.290
so I'm 1500 bucks.
Are you going to throw into the trash a week later?
Yeah.

1135
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:18.900
Going to be,
look at the fuck is wrong with me.
I am very,
very skeptical.

1136
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:21.510
I don't think it'll,
I don't think it'll hit mainstream adoption.

1137
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:24.690
I think even if they go,
I mean they've got designers now designing glasses.

1138
01:03:24.691 --> 01:03:29.670
They got NBA players wearing them so it doesn't have that thing.
So I think,

1139
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:34.430
so I am full disclosure,
I'm an investor in a Google glass,
but,

1140
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:36.230
but here's the reason why.
Um,

1141
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.220
they actually just had a bunch of press and the club,
um,
the,
they are,

1142
01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.740
they are building software specifically for industries.

1143
01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:47.970
So like they're working with doctors at Beth Israel who can use them to check
in,

1144
01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:49.350
folks get their records with,

1145
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.070
cause they need both their hands free right there working with energy companies

1146
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:58.071
so that people out in the field can have real time data on what's going on at

1147
01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:01.600
this random oil pump.
Like if they got a check settings or updates.

1148
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.980
Basically they're targeting specific industries where people need both their

1149
01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:05.610
hands free.

1150
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:10.350
And so it's not the sort of obnoxious like walking around on the street,
uh,

1151
01:04:10.351 --> 01:04:11.880
ordering your latte from your face.

1152
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:15.630
It's like this is a very specific task where I need both my hands free and this

1153
01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:17.780
is helpful.
And so I think,
I think that's where it'll succeed.

1154
01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:21.920
Kind of like how segways or just for mall cops.
I think this'll be next.

1155
01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:25.500
Horrible useful.
Oh God,
yes.
That's right.
Can't forget the tourists.

1156
01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:29.760
It's going to go a blank on that one yet.
You haven't gotten one.

1157
01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:33.450
It'll change your rate.
They're really dope.
He's just being facetious.

1158
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.350
That was like one of the things that they were saying about the,
uh,

1159
01:04:36.351 --> 01:04:39.360
the product before it came out.
That was going to change cities.

1160
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.010
Change your lives.
Life as we know it though.
Streets around it.
You silly bitches.

1161
01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.490
That was the most ridiculous thing ever.
You're just standing and moving.

1162
01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:50.250
How's that change in life?
Did you hear about the new electronic,

1163
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:54.420
our age of a cow tipping that's going on in San Francisco and stuff like that.

1164
01:04:54.421 --> 01:04:59.220
People are flipping those little baby electric cars.
Smart cars.

1165
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:04.020
Smart smart card tipping.
Yeah,
that's it is.
Fuck.
Wow.

1166
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:05.460
Imagine if you went outside and you,

1167
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:09.590
you're a girl and you weigh a hundred pounds.
That's a dick.
Move fast.

1168
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.120
I also think I,
so I grew up in the suburbs.
I did not see a lot of cows.

1169
01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:17.890
I guess just time to time,
but like you,
can you actually tip a cow

1170
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:22.760
<v 4>a no.
Yes,
yes.
No,
no,
no.
We've done it.
Just wants you to save it.
You'll never tip.</v>

1171
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.920
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Yes.
We did.
Columbus,
Ohio.
Me and my friends did it twice.

1172
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.650
You've done it right?
Was it like a calf?
Was it like one of those calves too?

1173
01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.001
Just saying.

1174
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:35.380
So what happens is that when the cows and the cows are in the fields,

1175
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:38.290
they pretty much locked their legs and sleep standing up a lot.

1176
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:39.124
That's how I sleep.

1177
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.870
And so you just go next to him and push him and they'd just fall the heavy?
No,

1178
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.460
they,
they,
they just tip right over keeping cow tipping site.

1179
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.960
This was stuff that suburban kids know like,

1180
01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:53.210
or that like is an urban lore because none of us ever hung out with cows.
Oh,

1181
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.120
if you ever want to go cow tipping,
I'll take it.
I mean,
that was good.

1182
01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:00.280
I don't think that they would really like that,
but no,
they don't like it at all.

1183
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:04.660
I wouldn't like it.
Did you really go cow tipping Brian Weiss?
Yeah.
Twice.

1184
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:09.640
Can you find you actually video actually pushed the cow over believe it.
Yeah,

1185
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.820
me too.
My friends.
Okay.
And I want it to be one of those,

1186
01:06:12.821 --> 01:06:14.740
remember those night vision like the Paris Hilton videos.

1187
01:06:14.741 --> 01:06:17.320
I want it to be one of those night vision videos of the cow and coming over.

1188
01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:22.200
<v 1>All right.
Do you have a,
um,
an Instagram?
I do.
It's,
it's my name.</v>

1189
01:06:22.201 --> 01:06:26.550
Just add Alexis Ohanian or Ohio neon.
Okay.

1190
01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.840
That's another thing that's annoying about these things is that they insist on

1191
01:06:32.911 --> 01:06:37.800
trying to change what you wrote there.
Like my creative,
the ethnic,

1192
01:06:37.801 --> 01:06:41.130
uh,
yeah.
There,
I'm not gonna take it personally.

1193
01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.600
It's just that they're their auto correct is like really aggressive.

1194
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.030
He's color away and goofy.

1195
01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:50.510
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

1196
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:53.150
<v 1>they're awake.
Yeah.
Well then good luck.
They're going to kill you.</v>

1197
01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.880
I see nothing.
How's Tim got to look at these videos before you put them online,

1198
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:06.840
Bro.
Seriously.
Find something real.
Yeah.
You can do that often,
right?

1199
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.140
Yeah.
I don't know.

1200
01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:16.030
He might have thought he was cow tipping mushrooms.
Tripping his balls off.
Dude.

1201
01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:19.530
We tip cat cows,
but we never left the house,
man.
What are you talking about?

1202
01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:21.810
We were in the field.
You never remember.
I was there.

1203
01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:28.470
I was tipping cows.
Yeah,
I bet.
If we Snopes tipping cows like Snopes,
Snopes,

1204
01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.080
cow tipping,
I feel I should have brought my laptop also.
Side Note,
uh,

1205
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.050
and I've been,
I've enjoyed your podcast died.

1206
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.620
I love how I love the real time with the laptops.
Uh,
I wish,

1207
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:42.750
I wish every show basically had someone in real time just calling out shit.

1208
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.450
Here we go.
Ready?
All right,
let's get this out of the way.

1209
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.620
Cow Tipping at least as popularly imagined,
does not exist.

1210
01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:50.521
Drunk man.

1211
01:07:50.521 --> 01:07:54.630
Do not on any regular basis sneaking in cow pastures and put a hard shoulder to

1212
01:07:54.631 --> 01:07:57.840
a cow.
Taking a standing snooze does tipping the poor animal over.

1213
01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.760
While in the history of the world,

1214
01:07:59.761 --> 01:08:04.170
there have surely been a few unlucky cow shoved to the side by boozed up morons.

1215
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:08.400
We feel confident in saying that this happens at a rate roughly equivalent to

1216
01:08:08.401 --> 01:08:13.280
the Chicago cubs winning the world series.
Okay.
This is,

1217
01:08:13.281 --> 01:08:16.040
um,
got snooped cows.
Cows like

1218
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.270
<v 4>sit down in like on their legs and just sit there and you can go right up to him</v>

1219
01:08:20.271 --> 01:08:21.230
and tip them right over.

1220
01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:25.860
<v 1>This is a,
from a modern farmer.com.
Well,</v>

1221
01:08:25.861 --> 01:08:27.660
I'm convinced article on cow tipping.

1222
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:30.570
I've subscribed modern front of her for a decade now and I,

1223
01:08:30.571 --> 01:08:32.400
they have never led me astray.
Youtube,

1224
01:08:32.401 --> 01:08:35.910
the largest clearinghouse of human stupidity the world has ever known where you

1225
01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:39.930
can watch hours of kids taking the cinnamon challenge.

1226
01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:44.640
Teens jumping off route to rooftops on the trampolines and the explosive results

1227
01:08:44.641 --> 01:08:45.660
of fireworks set off.

1228
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.680
Indoors fails to deliver one single actual cow tipping video.

1229
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.060
<v 4>All right,
well we did it as a kid.</v>

1230
01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:57.490
<v 1>The one exception is a Russian dash cam video,</v>

1231
01:08:57.491 --> 01:09:01.870
which shows a semi truck full of cattle overturning.
That's really good.

1232
01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:05.230
You need to watch it was shaking themselves off and walking away.

1233
01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:09.520
How's not giving a fuck?
Yeah.
Wow.
This is a spectacular dash.
So this uh,

1234
01:09:09.521 --> 01:09:11.440
this article is called bullshit on you,
Brian.

1235
01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:15.870
<v 4>When I was younger,
we would go to these farms in a,
in planes plain city,</v>

1236
01:09:15.871 --> 01:09:19.920
Ohio and they would have tons of cows and we would break into the cows,

1237
01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:22.800
smoke weed and there'd be cows that we break into the cows,

1238
01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:24.840
no break into the fence.

1239
01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:27.360
And there would be cows that would sit there like on there,

1240
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:31.290
like perched up like on there like legs,
like it's just sitting there.

1241
01:09:31.291 --> 01:09:33.320
Sleeping would come over.
Just push them right over.

1242
01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.360
I don't know if that's the cow tipping that you've heard everybody doing like

1243
01:09:36.361 --> 01:09:39.000
people saying that the cows tip over.
But that's what we used to do.

1244
01:09:39.001 --> 01:09:40.920
Cause that's what we thought you were supposed to do.

1245
01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:44.240
I don't understand what you just said.
This cows are standing up right?

1246
01:09:44.241 --> 01:09:47.340
Cause they stand up when they sleep,
right?
No,
not all the time there.

1247
01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:51.270
There's cows like knee thing here.
I'll show you.
Okay.

1248
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:55.620
I thought cal was always stood out.
Horses always stand up,
right?
I have no idea.

1249
01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:59.640
I'm going to my guts telling me horses are the ones.
Yeah.

1250
01:09:59.641 --> 01:10:03.030
Horses I think always stand up.
Right.
And if they're down to hurt,

1251
01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:07.320
we have the Google.
Yeah.
Um,
but I'm,
I'm really settled this cow tipping.

1252
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.460
Sorry.
We have the Internet disagrees with you.
Oh look at that.
That's a

1253
01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.770
brown cows tell rolling.
That would be like that.
And you just push it.

1254
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:20.550
But there'd be tons of cows and it'll be night at timing will be drunk.

1255
01:10:20.551 --> 01:10:23.520
And that's what we used to,
I don't know.
That seems to be cow tipping

1256
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:26.930
<v 1>anybody that's cow tipping.
They're just lying down cows.</v>

1257
01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:31.430
So you're going to send the email to Snopes saying,
well actually you're wrong.

1258
01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.790
Well,
I have a feeling the problem with calling bullshit,

1259
01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:36.770
if you didn't grow up in that environment,

1260
01:10:36.771 --> 01:10:39.200
you might truly believe that it is bullshit.

1261
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:43.580
But then if a guy like Brian actually grew up there and actually pushed over

1262
01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:44.414
some cows,

1263
01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.830
<v 4>take this to your fan base,</v>

1264
01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:50.540
they would sit like this and then you just go over there and just push him over

1265
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:53.910
and they would roll over and wake up and freak out and it would be scary and you

1266
01:10:53.911 --> 01:10:56.090
would run away.
Now cow tipping.

1267
01:10:56.091 --> 01:10:59.930
What I think they're saying is not true is actually tipping over at cal.

1268
01:10:59.931 --> 01:11:02.000
It's like completely standing up.
Maybe,

1269
01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.480
<v 1>well maybe that's what people have in their head,</v>

1270
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:06.490
but what it really is is what you're talking about.

1271
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.890
<v 4>That's when we did it.
We just did,</v>

1272
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.330
cause we heard people did it and then we were like,
let's do it.

1273
01:11:11.331 --> 01:11:12.500
There's tons of here.

1274
01:11:14.890 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 0>Brian Redman move.
I heard of the people who are doing it and I'm like,</v>

1275
01:11:18.181 --> 01:11:21.450
well this show alive.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.

1276
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:25.090
So then cow tipping is real.
I guess if I would say,

1277
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.960
<v 4>well yeah,
at cal rolling,
I'm gonna call it cal rolling.
Rolling</v>

1278
01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:34.940
<v 0>cow tipping as an a cow standing up and you pushing it over.
That doesn't exist.</v>

1279
01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:39.680
But that's probably not what cow tipping ever was unless they do sleep standing

1280
01:11:39.681 --> 01:11:41.120
up because sleep standing up.
Okay,

1281
01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:44.870
we need tons of pictures of cows doing exactly how.
Yeah,

1282
01:11:44.871 --> 01:11:46.850
but did they also sleep standing up?
I should have say,

1283
01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.940
let me just say how much I appreciate you guys get into the bottom of this.

1284
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:54.500
We need to,
we should.
Worst case.
How far are we from some cows?
Oh,
not that far.

1285
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:57.980
We can get to 100 an hour.
Okay.
Does a cow sleep standing?

1286
01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:02.360
Common misconception that cows don't lie down.
Hmm.
Why?

1287
01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:05.870
Cows may doze off for a few minutes at a time while standing up.

1288
01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:10.520
They typically lie down to sleep or simply to rest.
Okay.

1289
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:14.390
I'm calling bullshit on the people calling bullshit.
I think Brian's right.

1290
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.010
I think Brian is right.

1291
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:18.840
He went cow tipping and that's how you really couch it because when everybody

1292
01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.470
says is that cows are sleeping and he'd go up and push him.

1293
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:23.120
Well obviously if that's not true,

1294
01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:26.860
if they only take a little nap standing up and usually they sleep lying down and

1295
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:31.190
then their whole premise sucks because they don't understand what cow tipping
is.

1296
01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.180
Yeah.
Cow Tipping starts from the knees.
Like Jujitsu class.

1297
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:38.570
Like if you take wrestling class,
you start standing up for the most part,

1298
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:41.840
there's a room full of 50 dudes trying to double egg each other.

1299
01:12:41.841 --> 01:12:45.620
That shit gets really dangerous.
So jujitsu classes all start from the knees.

1300
01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:50.660
So real cow tipping like the idea of it doesn't exist because that's like

1301
01:12:50.661 --> 01:12:52.730
wrestling style.
Everybody starts from their feet.

1302
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:57.380
But Jiu Jitsu style when you're already on the ground,
that's real.
This is great.

1303
01:12:57.381 --> 01:13:00.170
Now whenever I drive past a bunch of cows will be thinking about Jujitsu.

1304
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:04.430
I'll just what I do.
That's the vision.
That's my gift.
You should,
um,

1305
01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.890
you should totally sell snow to go fuck themselves.

1306
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.830
<v 4>The craziest thing is that modern farmer incorporate or whatever it is,</v>

1307
01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:14.460
how scary it was.
I just remember it.
No,
because I'd be scared.
I wouldn't go.

1308
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.910
We we did,
I remember twice but only reimburse size first time,

1309
01:13:20.911 --> 01:13:24.750
scared the fuck out of you and then you're like,
listen,
I can do it wrong.

1310
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:27.330
And the reason why it's because one of the,

1311
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:31.530
we used to hang out with this bridge where we would drink and under age and it

1312
01:13:31.531 --> 01:13:34.410
was just like everyone would go to this bridge in the middle of nowhere and

1313
01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.930
there was all these farms around it and that's why we'd go there.

1314
01:13:36.931 --> 01:13:39.270
Cause there was no police,
there's no one could even know you were there.

1315
01:13:39.271 --> 01:13:41.370
You see you can have bonfires and all this shit like that.

1316
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:43.170
So then after he got wasted,

1317
01:13:43.171 --> 01:13:46.380
everything kind of laid around and all the fields and one of the fields,

1318
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.980
his cows,
and it was pitch black because it was in the middle of the country.

1319
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:54.480
So it was just stars and you see shadows of cows and so you would like sneak up

1320
01:13:54.481 --> 01:13:55.590
going up to these cows.

1321
01:13:55.591 --> 01:13:57.780
He didn't have cell phones for lights or anything like that.

1322
01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:00.000
So it was literally just lighters and shit.

1323
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:03.300
And you just go up and just push it real fast and then we'll go through and you

1324
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:07.310
just run away and it was the scariest shit ever.
Wow.
And you'd be stoked.

1325
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.420
Did you ever find mushrooms on uh,
cow patties?
Yeah.

1326
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.010
But back then you just didn't think about that.

1327
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:17.140
And like I didn't get into mushrooms too.
I was in college,

1328
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:20.800
well Dunkin went to school in Asheville,
North Carolina.
And when I went up there,

1329
01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.200
I understand Dunkin

1330
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.640
<v 0>so much more after visiting Asheville cause it's just a hippie Mecca.</v>

1331
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:30.620
And they were getting [inaudible] apparently the mushroom flora or whatever it

1332
01:14:30.621 --> 01:14:34.820
is,
the spores are so healthy up there this because it rains a lot and there's so

1333
01:14:34.821 --> 01:14:39.650
many of them that they had to start giving the cows some sort of an antifungal

1334
01:14:39.651 --> 01:14:44.460
diet to kill the mushrooms because so many core harvesting.
Meanwhile,

1335
01:14:44.461 --> 01:14:48.080
I'll probably make the kids sick cause a few mushrooms probably grow on some

1336
01:14:48.081 --> 01:14:52.100
poor poison psilocybin.
I mean you want to talk about missing the fucking point,

1337
01:14:52.101 --> 01:14:55.220
right?
Poisoning cow shit.

1338
01:14:55.221 --> 01:14:59.120
So that the most beautiful thing that God ever created can't grow there.

1339
01:14:59.121 --> 01:15:00.320
You fucking dummies.

1340
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:04.790
But he said that they would constantly go there and just pluck them off and just

1341
01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:09.590
eat them.
They were everywhere and just trip balls and the whole town,

1342
01:15:09.591 --> 01:15:12.290
it's so psychedelic,
like partially because of that.

1343
01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.970
The whole town is like Asheville,
North Carolina is it trippy fucking place.

1344
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.270
I feel like I need to visit now.
You got to visit.
It's awesome.
It's really cool.

1345
01:15:20.271 --> 01:15:23.240
Everybody's walking around like they have a main area where like bars and

1346
01:15:23.241 --> 01:15:24.050
restaurants are,

1347
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:26.300
and people just walking around like everybody's walking around and it's like a

1348
01:15:26.301 --> 01:15:30.320
small town that exists in a giant world,

1349
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:33.380
but they're modern.
So it's,
it's uh,
I fucked up.

1350
01:15:33.381 --> 01:15:35.900
I shouldn't have told you guys about it and it's going to ruin Asheville.

1351
01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:41.360
They the,
but I kind of understand Dunkin way more now after going to this town.

1352
01:15:41.361 --> 01:15:43.970
It's like,
oh,
I see.
Like you,

1353
01:15:43.971 --> 01:15:47.090
you were spawned and one of the most awesome environments on earth.

1354
01:15:47.091 --> 01:15:49.400
Like this place is fucking sweet.
What,

1355
01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.460
what did they call it when they went out on an expedition?

1356
01:15:52.461 --> 01:15:56.990
I wonder [inaudible] out tip.
Do you want to go like candy picking them?

1357
01:15:56.991 --> 01:16:01.330
Harvesting as some kind of,
let's go get shrooms.
It's

1358
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:04.570
<v 4>so dangerous though because I remember even as a kid just going up and eating</v>

1359
01:16:04.571 --> 01:16:07.730
berries cause I was like,
oh look berries and I would just start kicking Ferris.

1360
01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.450
Wow.
You know?
And then like you find out

1361
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.860
a hundred years ago you would never survived.

1362
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:18.580
There's no way you would've been dead before you were fired.
Yeah.

1363
01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.700
But you're fucking,
what's that honeysuckle shit like?

1364
01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:25.030
I used to eat a lot of plant because there was nothing to do.

1365
01:16:25.031 --> 01:16:27.030
So you look what's that purple stuff or you pull it out,

1366
01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.120
just suck on it has nothing to do.
Yeah.
So we just eat grass.
Yeah.

1367
01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:32.170
I would eat a few things.

1368
01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:37.230
You know what I found out that tastes good actually is dandelions like Dandelion

1369
01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:39.880
Greens,
make salads at a Dandelion Greens.

1370
01:16:39.881 --> 01:16:43.510
My grandmother used to make them and I went over to the house once and she had

1371
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:46.730
this dandy line sal and I was like,
what is that?
And I was like,

1372
01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:49.900
that's dandy lines and they were like,
it's really good for you.

1373
01:16:49.901 --> 01:16:50.810
It's edible to my aunt,

1374
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:53.500
my uncle telling me it was good for me I think is what convinced me.

1375
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:56.940
But then I found out that it's like a common vegetable that a lot of people eat.

1376
01:16:57.390 --> 01:17:00.660
T am I crazy?
It makes you out of it.
I believe you can.
Yeah,
but it's,

1377
01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.700
it's actually good like as a salad it's,

1378
01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:06.450
it's a good tasting green and pretty fucking good for you too.

1379
01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:09.620
What's not to like,
I don't know how we got on sandy line business.

1380
01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:09.980
I don't know how

1381
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.620
<v 1>we got onto the dandy.
We've covered a lot of grants on this.
Yeah.</v>

1382
01:17:13.621 --> 01:17:17.220
I'm not a planner.
Freak ECO friendly.
It makes the world go round my friend.
Yeah.

1383
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.890
And you know what else makes the world go round.

1384
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.780
People know what the fuck they're talking about.

1385
01:17:20.781 --> 01:17:22.280
That's why this cow tipping thing,

1386
01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.550
it's really pissing me off because I believe we've got to change.

1387
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:28.920
I think cow tipping is some real shit and I think this is something that arts

1388
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.500
here is smart card tipping change to this woman.

1389
01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:35.210
Columbus Smart car tipping has hit Columbus,
Ohio.

1390
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:38.450
Wow,
that's so stupid.

1391
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:42.950
It's totally rude.
It's easy to do.

1392
01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:46.550
I bet though I bet like three or four guys could probably push well those things

1393
01:17:46.551 --> 01:17:50.690
over pretty easy.
How much they weigh.
It can't be more than like 1500 pounds.

1394
01:17:50.691 --> 01:17:55.430
Right.
I still,
I still flinch whenever I watch the,

1395
01:17:55.431 --> 01:18:00.110
uh,
the youtube videos of the crash tests in those things because they are more

1396
01:18:00.111 --> 01:18:02.400
resilient than you'd expect.
But,

1397
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:05.360
but I would not want to be in one at a top speed.

1398
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.880
Anything is in a top speed.
Um,
there's a guy who used to fight in the UFC,

1399
01:18:10.881 --> 01:18:12.650
Matt Grice,
and he got rear ended.

1400
01:18:12.651 --> 01:18:17.550
Someone was going like 60 miles an hour and his car was parked and uh,
and he,

1401
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:20.900
he didn't even get hit by anything.
Just the impact of the car.

1402
01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:24.860
He had to have brain surgery and they to remove a plate on the top of his head

1403
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.190
off for this one,
see this one here,

1404
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:30.430
and then put it and then connect it back on and ended his UFC career.
It's,

1405
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:33.380
you know,
the guy had been,
it had been in like all these crazy fights,

1406
01:18:33.381 --> 01:18:36.780
like really action packed wars in a car accident.
Took him,

1407
01:18:36.781 --> 01:18:40.130
I got up and he's sitting in a parked car.
Yup.
Shit.
Boom.
You see that thing?

1408
01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:45.440
Oh my God.
Yeah.
It does actually stay and actually,
wow.
That's incredible.

1409
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:50.240
It looks pretty good.
Our slow look at that.
You're still dead.
Uh,
not maybe.

1410
01:18:50.241 --> 01:18:53.690
Maybe you bitch.
Maybe I'll be fine bro.

1411
01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.670
You'll walk away and I'll jerk off on the call.
Man.
I saw,

1412
01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:00.920
I saw the guide mini Cooper crash the other day.

1413
01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:04.370
It freaked me out because they're small.
They're small.
I mean,
no matter what,

1414
01:19:04.371 --> 01:19:07.610
they're small.
Just the,
uh,
the thing that happened on the highway,

1415
01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:09.080
it's like everybody's worst nightmare.

1416
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:13.310
The Fedex truck crashed into a school bus filled with high school kids.

1417
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:17.900
Oh yeah.
Horrible Northern California yesterday.

1418
01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.840
It was in northern California.
North,
mid California somewhere,

1419
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:24.710
but it was on the five,
which is kind of a sketchy freeway.

1420
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.070
And apparently she said giant collision nine people dead,

1421
01:19:28.071 --> 01:19:31.280
like one of those horrible fire situations.
I am,

1422
01:19:31.281 --> 01:19:34.820
I am firmly in the self driving car camp.
Um,
I am,

1423
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:39.770
I am ready car.
Well or any,
I mean there's,
there's a company coming up right now,

1424
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:43.760
there,
there are a few people working on this.
Um,
but I am just ready for robots.

1425
01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:47.630
Me Look 90.
That's a new main bro.
I'm ready for robots,

1426
01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:52.160
but I'm ready for the robots.
And so they enslave us.
But 95% of our flights,

1427
01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:55.640
our robot,
the message,
obviously there are fewer things they hit in the sky,

1428
01:19:55.641 --> 01:19:58.680
but like we trust robots with a lot.
And,

1429
01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:00.290
and when it comes to the self driving cars,

1430
01:20:00.291 --> 01:20:03.380
I've gotten a ride in one for a minute.
Um,
and we're getting there,

1431
01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.540
but like there are so many senseless deaths,

1432
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:08.100
so much senseless bullshit happens because

1433
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.320
<v 2>of human error behind the wheel of a fucking thing.
That weighs a lot.</v>

1434
01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:15.570
That's totally true.
But will you long for freedom?

1435
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.660
One of the things that I've been thinking about when we were talking about,

1436
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:22.410
you're saying like,
oh,
I wish I was,
I'm jealous.
These kids that are born today,

1437
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:27.630
I don't buy it because I,
I'm very,
I think that I'm very,

1438
01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:31.980
very fortunate to have been born in a time where the Internet didn't exist to

1439
01:20:31.981 --> 01:20:36.600
grow,
to be a young man without it and then experience it once.

1440
01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:37.500
I've kind of,

1441
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:41.970
when I understand myself and the world a little bit better and got to see two

1442
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:42.870
different worlds,

1443
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:45.510
get to see the world pre internet and got to see the world post Internet.

1444
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:48.870
The people that are growing up just post Internet,
like there's,

1445
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:52.470
there's a certain,
there's a certain something we're all gonna Miss.

1446
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:56.160
We're all gonna miss just getting on a motorcycle and driving on the highway

1447
01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:57.690
because eventually that's going to be illegal.

1448
01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:00.540
It's going to be illegal to be in a fast car.

1449
01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:04.920
It's going to be illegal to do anything with.
It propels you on your own.
I mean,

1450
01:21:04.921 --> 01:21:07.410
but if you look at like what's going on with technology,

1451
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:10.440
if you look at like the idea of self driving cars a certain point in time,

1452
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:14.100
what's the justification for letting someone drive their own car if their ratio

1453
01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:18.920
of car crashes is even 10% higher?
I mean as long as,
okay,
here's the thing,

1454
01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:22.830
humans are infinitely resourceful.
Like I think,

1455
01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.110
I imagine it looking like cruise control for a while.

1456
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.420
We're like the self driving,
you'll still be sitting there,

1457
01:21:27.421 --> 01:21:30.210
he'll be chilling but like it's in cruise control and then if any point you can

1458
01:21:30.211 --> 01:21:31.560
just hit the brake or start driving,

1459
01:21:31.561 --> 01:21:34.770
tick heads would just start doing that and weaving in that traffic and you'd be

1460
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:36.180
right back to the one on one again,

1461
01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:40.320
it'd be the same fucking animal over and over again.
Well come on Bro.

1462
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:41.520
There were bits of that,

1463
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:45.720
but it's still not as bad as like if it's 1% of the people doing it,
which is,

1464
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:46.890
I think it's still be pretty high.

1465
01:21:46.891 --> 01:21:51.240
But like then you still have 99% of them being efficient robot cars I think

1466
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:54.000
without the sending to you know,
into the future.

1467
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.370
The hope is though humans are resourceful.

1468
01:21:56.371 --> 01:21:59.580
Even if you had it mandated where every car was was just,

1469
01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:02.220
it only knew how to self drive.
Someone would hack it.

1470
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.470
Someone would figure out a way to get a wheel on there.

1471
01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.580
Someone like I sense a class war.
I said,
oh well that's a whole nother story.

1472
01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:09.061
But it's coming.

1473
01:22:09.061 --> 01:22:13.200
The highway flooded with the self driving cars and other people like standing up

1474
01:22:13.230 --> 01:22:16.950
while they're driving their continental convertible screaming at the top of

1475
01:22:16.951 --> 01:22:19.630
their lungs at the robots.
The robot,

1476
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.160
people taking lawnmowers or the high way fucked up it's tractors while they're

1477
01:22:25.321 --> 01:22:28.770
dealing with four wheels and while there's a robot,
the whole,

1478
01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:31.380
the whole thing is bizarre.
It's going to happen.

1479
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:36.190
I mean the technology that's invaded our lives so far become a part of our life

1480
01:22:36.191 --> 01:22:40.290
so far.
It's not stopping anytime soon.
And I will say this,
I am.

1481
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:42.810
I think so.
Yeah.
I got to,
I mean,

1482
01:22:42.811 --> 01:22:45.270
I knew a little bit of the pre Internet world and I'm still jealous,

1483
01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:49.110
but I will have,
you know,
I'll have my own transition or this is all a process,

1484
01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:52.770
right?
The,
the,
the generation coming up,
we'll take the Internet for granted.

1485
01:22:52.771 --> 01:22:54.460
They'll have that.
But like,
um,

1486
01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:57.660
there is inevitably going to be something else that displaces them and blows

1487
01:22:57.661 --> 01:23:00.960
their minds.
Maybe it's like the Gatica babies situation.
Um,

1488
01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:05.920
I think we're already at a point now where we can better understand

1489
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.620
<v 5>a human DNA.
It's the point where it's like,
all right,</v>

1490
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:10.960
it's not unreasonable to imagine a world where like,
hey,

1491
01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:12.310
if you don't want this genetic disorder,

1492
01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:14.110
like we can make sure your kid doesn't have that.

1493
01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.440
Most people would probably be like,
yeah,
man.

1494
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:20.830
And you don't want to be the first guy to say yeah to that.
No,
but you could,

1495
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:23.950
I mean,
this is all pretty reasonable here.
Um,
and you imagine,
okay,

1496
01:23:23.951 --> 01:23:25.900
well let's say that happens.
Then it's like,
all right,

1497
01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:28.600
well we've gotten rid of like,
okay,
Parkinson's,
whatever.
And like everyone,

1498
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:31.180
most people are pretty happy about that.
Um,
but then it's like,
well,

1499
01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:33.910
if you can do that,
do you want your kid to have blue eyes?

1500
01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:36.480
Like we can do that too.
It's just really easy.
Do you want a blue ivy?

1501
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:37.990
And then you very quickly started seeing the,

1502
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.740
the Gatica scenario start playing out and um,

1503
01:23:40.810 --> 01:23:43.160
and these are going to be really interesting and,
and,

1504
01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:47.710
and serious ethical questions we'll be asking ourselves in terms of like,
I mean,

1505
01:23:47.711 --> 01:23:48.281
I generally,

1506
01:23:48.281 --> 01:23:51.890
I'm on the side where I'd be very happy if a lot of genetic disorders were w

1507
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:54.810
technology was able to remove those things from happening.
Um,

1508
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:58.360
but at what point does it start crossing the line of us tampering too much and

1509
01:23:58.361 --> 01:24:00.670
deciding,
you know,
I don't think there's a line.

1510
01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.040
I think that's what we're here for.
I really do.

1511
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:07.130
I think the idea of us slowing down innovation for some reason,
like,

1512
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:10.720
cause we're crossing a line that we invented ourselves.
It's ridiculous.

1513
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:13.670
I think there's a pattern and I think if you look at that pattern,

1514
01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:17.770
the pattern is constant,
exponential growth of technology and innovation.

1515
01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:20.620
And it's a thing that human beings are thirsty for,

1516
01:24:20.621 --> 01:24:22.740
were freaking out about the galaxy.
S five came out.

1517
01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:27.640
<v 0>Ooh.
You know,
I mean I was at radio shack yesterday getting into some headphones.</v>

1518
01:24:27.641 --> 01:24:31.270
This function,
people that work there,
they're still radio shack shack.

1519
01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:33.290
I don't know if radio checks us.
I'm sorry.

1520
01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:41.580
Ham Radio Parts online tutorial customers.

1521
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:45.730
But the bottom line is I was there because I needed to get ahead heads,

1522
01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:50.710
phone for my,
uh,
my cell phone and uh,
I go,
uh,
I go when does that,

1523
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.540
cause I knew it was out.
Like sometime this week I go,

1524
01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:56.050
what does that galaxy has five hours it out today or tomorrow?
This guy,

1525
01:24:56.051 --> 01:25:00.020
first thing I was off,
I'm going to get it before you do.
Really?
Ooh.

1526
01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:04.200
Wow.
That's the thing.
Like everybody wants to have it first

1527
01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.410
<v 5>given name up to 1100 stores.
No radio shack.</v>

1528
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.980
I got my first job as a copy.
You,
I say,
uh,

1529
01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:14.900
I was not sad about seeing them close though.
I was,
I was at 13,
13,

1530
01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:20.020
14 year old pudgy kid who was demoing video games and why it was mostly like

1531
01:25:20.591 --> 01:25:23.380
computer hardware in the middle of a comp USA.
Um,

1532
01:25:23.381 --> 01:25:26.800
for like every 30 minutes I'd have to get on the headset microphone with a big

1533
01:25:26.801 --> 01:25:27.880
TV behind me demo,

1534
01:25:27.881 --> 01:25:32.881
like Madeline's like language learning software and I'd have the same routine

1535
01:25:33.071 --> 01:25:34.960
for like 15 minutes every 30 minutes.

1536
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:37.960
And like literally no one would be watching.
And here I am,

1537
01:25:37.961 --> 01:25:40.930
this like teenager going through puberty and I've got people,

1538
01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:45.370
people would walk up to me and be like,
no one's listening,
kid.
Just stop.

1539
01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.100
No one's listening.
And it's like,
oh,
I don't play me for hating me.

1540
01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:51.730
But it was great because it got all of my public speaking fears out of the way

1541
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:56.800
because I spent two years being ignored,
uh,
every,
every 30 minutes.

1542
01:25:56.870 --> 01:26:00.430
That seems like a really good way.
Actually it was,
I was getting paid for it.

1543
01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:03.740
The company I technically work for was called [inaudible],
s I.
D e a,

1544
01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:04.040
but they were

1545
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.810
<v 2>one of the casualties of the tech boom.</v>

1546
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.280
That seems like a really good idea to like if you wanted to alleviate your fear,

1547
01:26:10.450 --> 01:26:13.550
put yourself in one of the most uncomfortable situations and get numb to it

1548
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:17.690
through.
Yes.
APPS and people ask me,
oh well you know,
cause tech,
there are some,

1549
01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.730
there are some very good public speakers and tack,
but they're,
you know,

1550
01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:23.180
the common stereotype is that they're not.
And so a lot of people ask like,
oh,

1551
01:26:23.181 --> 01:26:26.150
how'd you get good at this?
And I said,
cause I did a ton,

1552
01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:29.780
my first job was getting paid to just do it while going through puberty.

1553
01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:34.400
So if you want to get good at it,
just do it 10,000 hours.
Right.
Just just get up,

1554
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:38.210
get awkward,
get in front of people and embarrass yourself.
That's fascinating.

1555
01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:42.590
That job probably pilot really played a pivotal role in your life.
Dude.

1556
01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:47.330
Real talk.
I have the card,
I still have the business card from Carlos,

1557
01:26:47.331 --> 01:26:49.670
who's the guy who hired me.
It's idea.
Um,

1558
01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:53.230
cause he was the first guy gave me a shot.
I wonder if he's Carlos,
this idea,

1559
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:58.040
if you're watching created this monster.
Yeah,
that's a,
that's an important thing,

1560
01:26:58.041 --> 01:27:02.200
man.
Sometimes things will happen to you when you're young,
when you know you're,

1561
01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.990
you think it's just a shit job.
But it really is some weird life lesson.

1562
01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.350
Dude did too.
I always tell people,
fuck getting an MBA.

1563
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:13.580
I got a job doing public speaking as a teenager,
being embarrassed routinely.

1564
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:16.640
And then my next job was in the service industry and I waited tables and cooked

1565
01:27:16.641 --> 01:27:18.200
at pizza hut and,

1566
01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:22.880
and like series like that will teach you the show much about entrepreneurship.

1567
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:26.030
Right?
Cause at the end of the day,
you were on the front lines for you.
I mean,

1568
01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.790
your pay is coming from that tip.
And it's a matter of balancing,
you know,

1569
01:27:29.791 --> 01:27:33.560
satisfying the customer.
The customer's not always right,
but almost always right.

1570
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:38.420
And uh,
and just,
and,
and dealing with it and solving problems with other humans.

1571
01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:42.320
And if you can make,
if you can bridge that gap of like empathy,
man,

1572
01:27:42.321 --> 01:27:45.560
I tell you that every single day as an entrepreneur,
every single day.
Absolutely.

1573
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:49.580
And he and also I think the shitty jobs that you have when you're growing up

1574
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:52.700
inspire you to not want to have shitty jobs.
Yes.

1575
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:56.540
I worked with my friend Jim drew,
my pal Jimmy lawless.

1576
01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:58.370
I worked with him for like two weeks.

1577
01:27:58.371 --> 01:28:02.260
One summer he was a carpenter and I was like,
uh,
he was a,

1578
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:06.590
he graduated a year ahead of me and he had like always had his eyes on doing

1579
01:28:06.591 --> 01:28:10.160
carpentry.
I was just looking for like a Labor Gig for the summer.

1580
01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:14.540
But within two weeks,
I don't even think I lasted two weeks.

1581
01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:19.400
It was fucking brutal.
We were building a knights of Columbus Wheelchair Ramp,

1582
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:22.880
so in Knights of Columbus Hall,
so the entire day,

1583
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:27.470
every day was spent carrying bags of cement and pressure treated lumber.

1584
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:32.330
She's just huge wheelchair ramp.
So just bag after bag of cement,

1585
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:37.250
just carrying these fucking bag poem,
carrying these logs.

1586
01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:40.880
Poem.
That was the whole day.
And by the end of the day,
you were dead.

1587
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:45.050
You couldn't do anything.
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't last.
I wouldn't last three hours.

1588
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:49.370
I lasted like two weeks,
but I used to think about it forever.

1589
01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.590
I would think about that Gig and I'd be like,

1590
01:28:51.591 --> 01:28:54.710
that's what it's like when you doing something that you don't want to be
knowing.

1591
01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.510
It's unbelievably difficult.

1592
01:28:56.511 --> 01:28:59.420
That's the life and that would like motivate me to get things done.

1593
01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:04.470
If I never had that Gig,
I probably wouldn't know how hard a job can suck.

1594
01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:08.070
I really wouldn't know.
That's the truth man.
That's what that should be.

1595
01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:09.930
I don't know if there there's like,
but that is,

1596
01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:14.270
that is top flight advice for any especially cause like I know those of us

1597
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.470
supposed to get into tech.
It's a hot industry right now.
Right?

1598
01:29:16.471 --> 01:29:19.530
There's more money than ever going into it.
Making a lot of people rich.

1599
01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.820
There are a lot of kids coming out of college who want to be the next CSEC or

1600
01:29:23.821 --> 01:29:26.640
the next to whoever they want to be.
Mexican know commsec is suck.

1601
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:30.840
You want to be the next duck rolls.
So Cobell was like,
cause you know him.

1602
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:33.850
So go back.
That's how were you guys when you're young?
We,

1603
01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.080
I've met him once or twice,
but we're not,
we're not friends.
I mean,

1604
01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:41.070
I'm not saying that we're not like there's no,
I'm,
I live in New York.
I'm not,

1605
01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:46.050
I'm not in the silicon valley world.
I dabbled,
but I just,
I just visit.
Right,

1606
01:29:46.051 --> 01:29:46.510
I hear Ya.

1607
01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:49.920
That's probably the best way to be because then you would start talking like a

1608
01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:53.370
one of those west coast ticky.
Yes.

1609
01:29:53.371 --> 01:29:58.050
And so it's over annunciating so that is,
that's the problem I think for a lot.

1610
01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.600
I think I,
I'm just getting a sense,
and I'm generalizing here,

1611
01:30:00.601 --> 01:30:03.880
but I think a lot of the kids right now who are trying to get into that,
um,

1612
01:30:03.930 --> 01:30:05.310
maybe never had that job,

1613
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:09.870
maybe never had that bit of perspective that I think has helped me a ton.

1614
01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:12.660
Tremendous.
I think it's obviously helped lots of people over many,

1615
01:30:12.661 --> 01:30:16.950
many centuries to just understand,
get to get a bit of sense.
I mean,
even,
I mean,

1616
01:30:16.951 --> 01:30:20.100
I know I live in a bubble now.
I,
as much as I wish I didn't,

1617
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:21.900
I know I to some extent live in a bubble,

1618
01:30:21.901 --> 01:30:26.901
but I still try to keep that perspective as best I can,

1619
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:29.790
which is hard.
But,
um,
it's the fact,

1620
01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.530
and look what you're talking about that at skilled labor,

1621
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.410
like speaking of things like with the robots,

1622
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:37.680
skilled labor is something that's still like when robots can do that,

1623
01:30:37.681 --> 01:30:41.820
they will enslave us.
So it's those jobs or what I'm trying to say is,

1624
01:30:41.821 --> 01:30:44.340
are going to be really their fundamental already,

1625
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:48.420
but they're only going to continue to be important because humans have to do

1626
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:52.740
them and they are Shitty,
hard work.
But we don't have enough people.
I don't,

1627
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:56.520
Mike Rowe has a really good campaign actually for getting more young people

1628
01:30:56.521 --> 01:31:00.330
interested in the trades because there is a huge demand for welders,

1629
01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:01.164
for carbon and for all,

1630
01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.560
for all these people because we don't have a generation coming up now that knows

1631
01:31:04.561 --> 01:31:07.590
how to do this stuff.
I mean,
I can barely put together Ikea furniture myself.

1632
01:31:07.591 --> 01:31:10.810
And I'm lucky because I'm good with like a laptop.
But,
um,

1633
01:31:10.890 --> 01:31:14.880
it's a real need and it's hard to fucking work.
Well not only that,

1634
01:31:14.881 --> 01:31:18.960
I mean doing carpentry,
like building a house,
it's really kind of fun.

1635
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.760
Building a house is very rewarding if you're a guy that has developed,

1636
01:31:23.761 --> 01:31:24.600
like I grew up,

1637
01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:27.720
my dad and my step dad was an architect and so I grew up around a lot of work

1638
01:31:27.721 --> 01:31:29.910
developers and a lot of construction guys.

1639
01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:33.420
I got to see the pride that they take when they've completed a job and built a

1640
01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:36.900
building that they design.
They all worked together on this.
It's,
it's cool thing.

1641
01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:40.290
It's a cool thing to see and watch and you know,

1642
01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:43.890
the fact that that's sort of like a dwindling part of,
you know,

1643
01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:48.810
what kids are looking to do and tomorrow's age,
it's kind of sad.

1644
01:31:48.811 --> 01:31:51.030
So problem.
It is a problem,
but it's kind of sad.

1645
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:52.950
I mean there's always going to be people that appreciate it though.

1646
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.890
There's always going to be someone that builds an awesome log house that's in

1647
01:31:55.891 --> 01:31:59.100
demand cabin porn.
I think that's actually a website.

1648
01:31:59.670 --> 01:32:02.910
Don't say it out loud unless you're affiliated.
No,

1649
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:05.200
but like I hope actually,
I don't know.

1650
01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:08.230
I'm trying to remember what Mike Rowe's organization is called,
but it's it,

1651
01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:11.200
it's trying to push a for that and I took him around.

1652
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:12.820
I am the guy who is also telling people like,

1653
01:32:12.821 --> 01:32:15.610
learn how to code if you want the super power for this century.

1654
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:18.130
It's learning how to code.
That takes a lot of time.

1655
01:32:18.131 --> 01:32:21.640
Jamie and I were talking about that yesterday.
Too much work.
Sorry.
Well,

1656
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:26.490
uh,
I guess you're,
I guess you're not going to be a mark Zuckerberg,
Joe.
Yeah,

1657
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:31.410
I'm not,
I'm not going to be a CSEC.
I'm not coding.
It's not happening yet.

1658
01:32:31.411 --> 01:32:36.190
It also like if someone else did what I did,
it would be a harrowing experience.

1659
01:32:36.191 --> 01:32:39.100
They wouldn't enjoy it,
you know?
And if I did what they did,

1660
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:42.520
it's different strokes for different folks and my friend.
Yes,
indeed.

1661
01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:45.850
When you look at the future,

1662
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.030
when you see what's happened just in the short amount of time that red it's been

1663
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:52.620
around,
you see what happens.
And you know the time,
the,

1664
01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:57.490
your first computer when you were on were you on AOL,
which was a little late.
Uh,

1665
01:32:57.491 --> 01:33:02.170
it was an ISP.
Compuserve.
Oh you have a regular ice 33,
six.

1666
01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:05.320
I was a little late.
Oh really?
Late.
It was my first month at a 14,
four,

1667
01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:11.970
1414 I remember 56 k blew my fucking mind.

1668
01:33:12.521 --> 01:33:14.260
This can't be real easy.

1669
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:18.820
And then it was like dual line 56 K so you could get like two 56 case together

1670
01:33:18.821 --> 01:33:22.630
and share bandwidth,
insanity,
insanity,

1671
01:33:23.610 --> 01:33:24.630
all the stuff you could download it.

1672
01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:26.830
When you look at that and you look at the future,

1673
01:33:26.831 --> 01:33:29.500
do you think the future is going to be in some sort of a,
like a,

1674
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:34.420
an implant or some smaller and smaller device that lets you interface with the

1675
01:33:34.421 --> 01:33:38.710
web?
I,
I hope it's not too invasive.

1676
01:33:38.711 --> 01:33:39.461
I mean there's already there,

1677
01:33:39.461 --> 01:33:41.950
right there already people living that kind of Cyborg lifestyle.

1678
01:33:41.951 --> 01:33:46.390
Now we've seen the transhuman community.
Like it's,
you know,
the,
the,

1679
01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:47.410
the basic levels,

1680
01:33:47.411 --> 01:33:50.320
just quantified self and like having a thing that counts your steps but like,

1681
01:33:50.321 --> 01:33:54.840
or Google glass.
But you know,
there are next level,
it's all theirs,

1682
01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:55.781
but their next level,

1683
01:33:55.781 --> 01:33:58.400
I mean there really is a trans human community of people who have,
you know,

1684
01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.830
cybernetic i's who have,
um,
you know,
cybernetic guys.

1685
01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:06.010
There's a filmmaker,
a Canadian filmmaker actually who's got,

1686
01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:09.790
he lost an eye and a shooting accident,
replaced it.
Um,
and,
and you know,

1687
01:34:09.791 --> 01:34:14.650
as a filmmaker,
it actually,
at least he argues,
helped him with his craft.
Wow.

1688
01:34:14.651 --> 01:34:16.060
There,
you know,
people who have lost limbs.

1689
01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:21.010
One of the things that actually really intrigued me about the world is that,

1690
01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:24.700
you know,
you have people who have lost limbs,
for instance,

1691
01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:25.600
were born without them.

1692
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.960
And replacement limb technology basically hasn't changed at all.

1693
01:34:31.231 --> 01:34:34.840
Like it's,
it's the same civil war,
revolutionary war replacement up until very,

1694
01:34:34.841 --> 01:34:37.480
very recently.
It's basically just like,
here's a stick.
Um,

1695
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.020
and there's been so much innovation on the last couple of decades to help with

1696
01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:42.280
limb replacement,
right,

1697
01:34:42.281 --> 01:34:45.700
where you can actually move digits on fingers based on impulses from your
armpit.

1698
01:34:46.570 --> 01:34:51.250
You obviously there's the blade runner.
Um,
and,
and to see the improvements on,
uh,

1699
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:52.270
on,
on,
on,

1700
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:56.110
on feet where you can actually run faster on these artificial limbs than on the

1701
01:34:56.111 --> 01:34:57.980
real ones.
Like it's,
there are people who are

1702
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.190
<v 1>living through this right now because of how the were because of whether they</v>

1703
01:35:01.191 --> 01:35:03.440
were born this way or some injury that happened.
Um,

1704
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:07.730
but you're also seeing people who are deciding to enhance themselves,

1705
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:11.480
um,
through this technology,
this bionic.

1706
01:35:11.481 --> 01:35:15.760
I think it's freaking me the fuck out.
This is a,

1707
01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:20.300
uh,
apparently I don't think they have a completely bionic eye,

1708
01:35:20.301 --> 01:35:24.350
but they have chips that they've installed in eyes.

1709
01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:30.200
Yeah,
he's,
I,
you had the filmmakers,
I can't remember the name.

1710
01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:35.060
Uh,
they've figured out what I saw.
I don't think it's a totally fake.

1711
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:39.230
I think what,
unless it's a totally different story,

1712
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.100
is that live science,
what does it say?
Robot madness.

1713
01:35:43.101 --> 01:35:44.910
Human Becomes Eyeborg rob spend.

1714
01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.130
Say One I'd filmmaker holds up a prosthetic eye in the Camry.
Hopes to fit.

1715
01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:53.210
He can fit inside.
And I don't know how the old that article is,
but I,

1716
01:35:54.090 --> 01:35:56.240
oh,
from 2009,
nevermind.
But,
um,

1717
01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:59.290
but he's been doing a lot of work in this area and meeting a bunch of,
you know,

1718
01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.870
fellow cyborgs all over the world talking about this.
And I'm like,

1719
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:05.720
there's a transhuman subreddit.
If you go to r slash trans human,

1720
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:07.280
there's an entire community of people,

1721
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:10.940
hundreds of thousands who were talking about all of this.

1722
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Here's the article about him that's really recent for March 21st and it says a

1723
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:20.300
colorblind,
it says call Lou or in the English way of announcing,

1724
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:21.560
this is why we had that revolution.

1725
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:24.760
Colorblind artists becomes world's first I Borg.

1726
01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:27.710
An artist is born literally colorblind,

1727
01:36:27.711 --> 01:36:30.500
is able to hear different colors through an eye,

1728
01:36:30.501 --> 01:36:35.390
Borg and Tena that he has now had implanted into the back of his head.

1729
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:39.480
Whoa.
Just for colors,
just for colors.
It's just colorblind.

1730
01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:43.540
He's not even line 31 year old near Harbison that this guy really wants to get

1731
01:36:43.541 --> 01:36:46.310
callers from camp.
How will we know if he's seeing them,

1732
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:50.450
if he doesn't never seen him before.
Holly know what the fuck that is,

1733
01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:53.170
maybe thinks it's collars and you're like,
can I borrow your eyes?
Bitch.

1734
01:36:53.171 --> 01:36:56.060
You don't see color fucking shitty as eyes back.

1735
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:59.360
It's like people who were trying to convince you that the first droids were were

1736
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:01.280
good too.
It's just like an iPhone.
Okay,
let me,

1737
01:37:01.281 --> 01:37:03.470
let me try and make a text message and why is it,

1738
01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:07.250
why does it vibrate when I touch?
You can't talk Shit Outta here.

1739
01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:12.100
It until you touched it.
Blackberry with the fucking push button.
Screen Click,

1740
01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:13.370
click.
Do you remember that?

1741
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:17.930
I had a blackberry for a minute and like 2005 2006 but I,
that was,

1742
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:20.480
well they were not bad at the time doing great.

1743
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:24.170
But there was a blackberry attempted an iPhone like device.
Do you remember that?

1744
01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.950
Oh it was deaf touch or something like something like that.

1745
01:37:27.951 --> 01:37:31.460
I think that's exactly what it was.
Oh,
poor dog shoe.

1746
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:36.490
Soon guys too soon had that number and you had to go to a website and then type

1747
01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:42.200
in the number just to see like a very small photo.
Tiny ass little thing.

1748
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:43.780
Yeah.
So this guys,

1749
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:49.570
I mean he's crazy as fuck because he can see and so just to get colors,

1750
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:56.110
but this is the artist color blind artist or there's a a,
there's a,
it's just

1751
01:37:56.110 --> 01:38:00.810
<v 2>if a filmmaker who just lost an eye,
oh they see all this is happening.</v>

1752
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:02.850
All of this is to say,
I think we are,

1753
01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.140
we're approaching a point where these technologies basically the Internet,
uh,

1754
01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.830
have a much more seamless interaction with us.
But uh,

1755
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:15.440
we just think a little while still got,
it's still got a little bit.
Yeah.
Um,

1756
01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:19.200
but whatever and enjoy this moment because when it hits,

1757
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:21.200
it's going to be so fucking weird when,
when,

1758
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.040
when the singularity does take place,

1759
01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:26.580
which I personally think he's going to be some sort of an artificial creation,

1760
01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:31.350
whether it's a artificial intelligence or a network that can think for itself

1761
01:38:31.351 --> 01:38:33.630
essentially on my matrix work.
Yeah.

1762
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:36.990
One of those things is going to happen and it's going to be a motherfucker,
man.

1763
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:41.460
It's going to be a,
it's going to be a complete flipping of the board table.
No,

1764
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:46.470
it's what I like about Kurzweil and the whole singularity push is they are

1765
01:38:46.861 --> 01:38:49.080
optimistic.
A futurist.

1766
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:51.090
There are definitely a lot of futurists who are just going to read their real

1767
01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:55.160
downers.
Um,
but the Kurzweil one is a pretty,
uh,

1768
01:38:55.230 --> 01:38:59.520
pretty positive one and dude,
who wouldn't,
I mean the,
the crazy thing is right,

1769
01:38:59.521 --> 01:39:03.060
if we have enough processing power,
all right,
okay.
If life is just perception,

1770
01:39:03.061 --> 01:39:06.250
write a little thing that goes,
again,
not a scientist.
Um,

1771
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.650
but it's things that fire that make us feel like we're perceiving this world of

1772
01:39:09.651 --> 01:39:11.130
that sandwich or that beer or whatever.

1773
01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.580
Like if you have enough processing power to reproduce the human brain,

1774
01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.920
how can we actually tell the difference?
I mean,

1775
01:39:16.921 --> 01:39:20.560
if at the end of the day it's doing all the same things,
right?
That's it.

1776
01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:23.160
We're just perceiving a world.
Uh,

1777
01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:26.400
it really starts the question like consciousness in humanity and all kinds of

1778
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:29.400
really big awesome things.
Absolutely.

1779
01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:33.120
What is humanity and is it just the standards that we've accepted?

1780
01:39:33.121 --> 01:39:36.810
Because this is what we're accustomed to and this is our culture.
And so we just,

1781
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:42.200
we don't want to change things or in the face of some overwhelming intelligent

1782
01:39:42.331 --> 01:39:45.720
life that we've created ourselves.
It literally becomes God's around us.

1783
01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:49.080
We're going to have some weird decisions to make as to what should we keep

1784
01:39:49.081 --> 01:39:49.680
fucking,

1785
01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.590
these guys are way better than us and they come back to class and they couldn't

1786
01:39:52.591 --> 01:39:56.820
save us once.
I mean,
this is,
this is getting real now.
I don't want to worry.

1787
01:39:56.821 --> 01:40:00.850
You guys know much about skynet.
Don't,
don't,
don't,
I mean,

1788
01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:05.340
don't worry about it.
Scare the shit out of us.
No,
it's,
these are,
I mean,

1789
01:40:05.341 --> 01:40:07.020
I don't have answers to this stuff.
Um,

1790
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.810
I've got a front row seat and it's been fascinating.
Um,

1791
01:40:09.811 --> 01:40:13.740
that's one of the things I'm,
so y Combinator was the VC from the seed stage,

1792
01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:16.680
VC firm,
the first invested in me and Steve like nine years ago.

1793
01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:21.630
And I work as a sort of advisor,
an ambassador for them these days.

1794
01:40:21.631 --> 01:40:25.380
But like the companies that come through there,
like,
I mean,
yeah,

1795
01:40:25.381 --> 01:40:26.820
me and Steve got through with reddit.

1796
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.490
I think if we'd applied today we would just been laughed at.

1797
01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.600
What do you mean apply the Co if we'd applied today with what we did nine years

1798
01:40:33.601 --> 01:40:36.840
ago,
we would have been laughed out of the room because the,
the applications,

1799
01:40:36.841 --> 01:40:39.960
the quality,
the richness,
how much they've created and how far they've come.

1800
01:40:39.961 --> 01:40:43.380
It's so much further along.
And so we're,
you know,
you know,

1801
01:40:43.381 --> 01:40:47.130
companies like Airbnb and Dropbox for instance also went through y Combinator,

1802
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:50.670
multibillion dollar companies that started the same way we did just a couple of

1803
01:40:50.671 --> 01:40:54.070
founders and pizza and working and um,

1804
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:56.710
<v 0>and we're seeing companies now that are doing like there's a self driving car</v>

1805
01:40:56.711 --> 01:40:57.990
company.
I went through the last batch there,

1806
01:40:58.210 --> 01:41:03.210
there are a couple of engineers were who have outfitted their Audi with a self

1807
01:41:03.401 --> 01:41:06.430
driving car.
It looks like a,
the thing on top of the police car.

1808
01:41:06.431 --> 01:41:09.790
It looks like one of those things and it's just all the sensors and um,

1809
01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:12.040
they can do highway driving in this Audi,

1810
01:41:12.041 --> 01:41:15.760
you can actually like sit in this thing while it drives into this a self driving

1811
01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:19.990
car.
The three engineers have been hacking on for the last six months.
Like,

1812
01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:24.640
it's just,
it's it,
you can just drop your jaw and be like,
Holy Shit.
Like this is,

1813
01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:28.570
this is a wild future that is being created right before our eyes by,
you know,

1814
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:32.650
people just like me and things like the Google glass,

1815
01:41:32.651 --> 01:41:37.360
which I think is just a step along the way.
It's gap.
The gap has to be bridged.

1816
01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:41.160
I mean,
it's not going to be bridged in one instant application.
That's a,

1817
01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:45.610
an injection of nanoparticles into your body that allows to you to interface

1818
01:41:45.611 --> 01:41:46.510
your,
you know,

1819
01:41:46.511 --> 01:41:50.500
your retina and your visual Cortex with the worldwide web is distributed through

1820
01:41:50.501 --> 01:41:51.940
government Wifi.
I mean,

1821
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.020
that's probably a hundred years from now or whatever it is 10 years from now.

1822
01:41:56.021 --> 01:42:00.070
Who knows how things get crazy you probably next week.
But the,

1823
01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:02.410
the Google glass is the bridge.
I mean,
it has to be,

1824
01:42:02.411 --> 01:42:05.800
there's gotta be a Google glass and there's gotta be a Google contact lens and

1825
01:42:05.801 --> 01:42:08.650
then there's gotta be something else and it's,
it's going to happen.

1826
01:42:08.651 --> 01:42:11.680
Just like we went from the brick phone,
you know,

1827
01:42:11.681 --> 01:42:14.310
they were in the rap videos and everybody was balling.

1828
01:42:14.311 --> 01:42:16.210
It had that big ass brick phone.
Yeah,
bitch,

1829
01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.940
I'm talking to you and you ain't no one near me.
Saved by the bell,

1830
01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.420
Zack Morris phone or the ones that were in the suitcase.

1831
01:42:22.421 --> 01:42:24.790
That was another whole interaction with the court.

1832
01:42:24.791 --> 01:42:27.040
It was Courtney's phone in a suitcase.
Hello.

1833
01:42:27.190 --> 01:42:31.780
I'm walking down the street on the phone.
That's how important I am.

1834
01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:33.850
You know?
And people would get real,

1835
01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:36.760
real angry and uppity when they would see those.
They didn't like it.

1836
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:40.930
People get upset.
I could see that.
They didn't like it.
Look,
it's fucking,
man.

1837
01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:44.260
I saw what?
It's fucking phone coming out of a suitcase you should be using now.

1838
01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:48.460
Folfiri,
a home or a,
why don't you go get a job?
Get a fucking job.
You home.

1839
01:42:48.461 --> 01:42:52.240
I'll walking around with your phone.
But now it's changed.

1840
01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.460
It's so small.
I mean,

1841
01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:58.240
they're sliding into pockets and you opened them up and they'd fucking show you

1842
01:42:58.241 --> 01:42:59.074
the world.

1843
01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.850
And I think no one who had one of those stupid brick phones ever saw that
common?

1844
01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:05.620
No.
No,
definitely not.

1845
01:43:05.621 --> 01:43:10.450
And that's a bridge that's been gapped in my lifetime through my memory.
Gets,

1846
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:15.220
uh,
yeah,
and I'm,
I'm 100% aware of when it happened.
I had a really,

1847
01:43:15.221 --> 01:43:19.660
I had a cell phone in 1989 at a cell phone in my car.

1848
01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.360
We'd like a car phone.
Yeah.
I had a car phone.
We would it,
uh,

1849
01:43:25.450 --> 01:43:29.110
how would that work and cigarette lighters stuck into the,
into the car?

1850
01:43:29.111 --> 01:43:33.010
It was installed in the car itself.
Baller buttons or Claire?
Well,
it was,

1851
01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:35.770
it was a girl that I was dating her.
Um,

1852
01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.550
I wound up buying the car from her and her parents bought her a car,

1853
01:43:39.551 --> 01:43:43.260
but she got a standard,
like a stick shift.
She didn't know how to drive.

1854
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:47.430
She hated driving a standard.
And so,
uh,
I was dating her at the time,

1855
01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:50.800
so I wound up taking the car and then eventually paying her for it.

1856
01:43:50.801 --> 01:43:55.280
But it was like she installed this car phone.
What'd you make?

1857
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:59.960
Would you make to make a habit of taking calls from it?
No,
no,
no,
you can't.

1858
01:43:59.961 --> 01:44:03.620
It was stupid,
stupid expensive.
And it was like right after it all happened.

1859
01:44:03.621 --> 01:44:06.440
Like we started breaking up so it was like she couldn't even drive the car.

1860
01:44:06.441 --> 01:44:09.050
So I drove,
I was driving the car and then I was sending her money for,

1861
01:44:09.051 --> 01:44:11.090
it was the whole thing.
It was a disaster.
Okay,

1862
01:44:11.091 --> 01:44:14.840
so the lesson learned is never buy a car with a car phone.
Yeah.
Well No.

1863
01:44:14.841 --> 01:44:17.820
At the time it was ridiculous thing to have,
but it was pretty crazy.

1864
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:21.710
I don't remember why she wanted again,
why we wound up getting a phone.

1865
01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.180
No one needed it at the time.

1866
01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:27.380
It was only like a few people that even knew that I ever seen with the time.

1867
01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:28.910
Yeah.
There's a guy named Jackie Flint,

1868
01:44:28.930 --> 01:44:31.130
you know Jackie Flynn is Jackie Flynn's a comic.

1869
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:33.860
He's been in a bunch of the Farrelly brothers movies.
Very funny guy.

1870
01:44:33.861 --> 01:44:36.890
He was the first guy that I ever saw that had a car phone and I was like,

1871
01:44:36.891 --> 01:44:38.660
this is the craziest fucking thing ever.

1872
01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:41.330
This guy can just call people anytime he wants.

1873
01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:44.540
It's stupid expensive and it wouldn't work everywhere.

1874
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:47.930
It would like you would drive down the street.
Well,
it wasn't like now,

1875
01:44:47.931 --> 01:44:51.740
like it's odd to get shitty service.
Then it was fairly standard,

1876
01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:55.080
like most of the time you got shit.
Sorry.
If you're driving,

1877
01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:57.030
you're constantly going in and out of services.

1878
01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.530
You'd pull over to the side of the road and just wait,
oh,

1879
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:03.350
you keep driving it so you got good enough service.
Then immediately pull over.

1880
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:06.980
Yeah,
that was a big one.
Yeah.
Especially if it's an important call.

1881
01:45:06.981 --> 01:45:10.650
You can't go over the hump.
You can't to this day can't go over Laurel Canyon.

1882
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:14.490
If you've got something to say,
I can't trust them for sure.

1883
01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:17.340
With everybody's phone is going to be a bump in the road.
I'm still,
see,

1884
01:45:17.341 --> 01:45:18.950
I'm still still learning about this whole la thing.

1885
01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:22.400
The four oh five don't fuck around the four or five when you come over that
hill,

1886
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:23.540
when you're going into the valley,

1887
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:26.060
if you're coming from Santa Monica and you're going over that hill,

1888
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:30.200
prepare for death,
no cell phone coverage,
and you got over that Hump.

1889
01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.660
I don't know why they can't fix that.
You know,
it's,

1890
01:45:32.661 --> 01:45:34.850
there's two 20 it's 21st century.
Not only that,

1891
01:45:34.851 --> 01:45:37.700
they're building a 19 lane highway up there.

1892
01:45:37.701 --> 01:45:39.920
I mean the highway is fucking enormous.

1893
01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:42.110
It's the biggest highway you've ever seen in your life.

1894
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:46.820
And I don't know how many lanes it illegal saying they're so big.

1895
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:51.860
I grew up in Boston and the first time I came to California I went to um,
uh,

1896
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:55.850
Bellflower.
I took a ride down to Bellflower,
which is uh,
um,

1897
01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.580
down down the four or five and to the 91.

1898
01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:03.260
But I couldn't believe how big the highway was.
I couldn't believe it.

1899
01:46:03.261 --> 01:46:06.680
I was driving,
I was like,
this is insane.
The amount of concrete,

1900
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:11.480
cause all those old Boston highways were all like four lanes,
two up to back.

1901
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:16.250
That's it.
These things were giant,
like multiple lanes,
five,
six,

1902
01:46:16.251 --> 01:46:17.840
seven lanes on each side.

1903
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:21.020
So you guys know what you're doing here with the car thing.
Oh that's 20 people.

1904
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:23.000
And that's why self driving cars to change everything I'm telling you.

1905
01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.440
Is that going to ever be there is purportedly,
I'm a,

1906
01:46:25.441 --> 01:46:28.280
I mean I'm in New York guy now,
so like I love by public transportation.

1907
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:29.143
Do you guys is,

1908
01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:32.450
<v 4>is that it's non existence that happen,
isn't there?</v>

1909
01:46:33.190 --> 01:46:35.510
I mean I busted it depends where you want to go.

1910
01:46:35.511 --> 01:46:38.810
Like I live in Burbank and so there's like a right in north Hollywood,

1911
01:46:38.811 --> 01:46:40.460
there's a station he can get take.

1912
01:46:40.461 --> 01:46:43.400
It pretty much dropped the car off and go right to the staples center.

1913
01:46:43.401 --> 01:46:46.370
So if there was an event at the staple center,
you just go in and out.

1914
01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:50.070
But other than that,
the problem is that they don't have it good.
Like

1915
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.300
<v 1>they don't have in Santa Monica,</v>

1916
01:46:51.301 --> 01:46:55.410
they don't have it like the beach towns and it's uh,
it's just not as cool.

1917
01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:57.730
Like you have to,
it's not good service system.

1918
01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:00.390
The also like the city is so spread out,

1919
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:05.640
like California is so spread out and people are not really into the idea of

1920
01:47:05.641 --> 01:47:07.410
being in a car with a bunch of other people.

1921
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:10.320
Everybody's so self important on here.

1922
01:47:10.321 --> 01:47:13.200
And so nonintegrated it's one of the things that I,

1923
01:47:13.201 --> 01:47:16.110
one of the things I was thinking of when,
uh,
uh,

1924
01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.720
I was starting to raise my kids,

1925
01:47:18.721 --> 01:47:22.800
I was thinking maybe my kids would probably do better if they lived somewhere

1926
01:47:22.801 --> 01:47:26.820
like New York where they kind of had to interface with people all the time on a

1927
01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:28.830
regular basis,
a bunch of different strangers all the time.

1928
01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:30.930
Whereas like California,
where everybody's like,

1929
01:47:30.931 --> 01:47:34.080
we go from one box and to another box and occasionally we see people to step out

1930
01:47:34.081 --> 01:47:36.840
of their boxes and then they go in their boxes and we all go our separate way.

1931
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:41.370
Whereas in New York,
everybody sorta like meshing,
bumping in Boston too.
Yeah.

1932
01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:46.470
Which less?
Boston would you ever move baggies?
No,
too.
It's too cold.
Wow.
Wow.

1933
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:50.820
You're just wrong.
Kind of cold.
That wet cold.
Colorado dry cold.

1934
01:47:50.850 --> 01:47:53.300
I like the wet cold is ridiculous.
See I,

1935
01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:57.510
I was born and raised on the east coast,
man.
I don't know if I could ever,

1936
01:47:58.020 --> 01:47:59.750
I could ever give it up.
Oh,
that's so good.

1937
01:47:59.850 --> 01:48:02.320
I lived in San Francisco for two minutes.
If it fell into the ocean,

1938
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:06.700
you'd still stay alive.
Stay.
Oh,
you'd figure it out.
Sign away.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1939
01:48:06.710 --> 01:48:11.700
but what I'm saying,
yeah.
All right.
But I,
I,
I uh,
I just never,
I dunno.

1940
01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:12.271
And there's so much,

1941
01:48:12.271 --> 01:48:15.030
obviously there's so much in tech going on in San Francisco and actually at

1942
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:17.520
least tech scene,
not too shabby.
Not too surely.

1943
01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.590
We'll snapchat's the one everyone talks about right now.

1944
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:24.300
That's all Dick pics fueled by China's tinder's is La as well.

1945
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:28.140
It,
what do you think about snapchat?
I just,
I don't,

1946
01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:31.320
I tried using it for a minute,
but I just don't,

1947
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:34.410
does it get to a point that just like every kind of technology do you get to a

1948
01:48:34.411 --> 01:48:36.630
certain age that you start not getting it?
Oh,
that's,

1949
01:48:36.631 --> 01:48:38.850
maybe that's what that's actually,
that's definitely what it is.

1950
01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:42.300
That's what it is.
Cause I,
the college story,
every,
every kid snap chatting,

1951
01:48:42.301 --> 01:48:46.590
all the things,
every growing,
no snapchat.
Yeah.
People like it and whatever,

1952
01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:50.670
it's fine.
People will look for fun shit to do on their phone,
you know?

1953
01:48:50.671 --> 01:48:54.030
And if something comes along,
it gives you a time limit.
On a picture.

1954
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:59.230
There's my asshole,
you know,
do you motherfucker,
you took a screenshot,

1955
01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:02.830
he'd let me know.
Yeah,
but I,
it's kind of close to home.
Joseph.

1956
01:49:02.890 --> 01:49:05.250
What doesn't have to,
first of all,
you don't.
If people are so stupid,

1957
01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:08.110
all you have to do is take a picture of the fucking screen with Hannah.

1958
01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:10.650
That's really bad.
So dumb.
It's like it's not,

1959
01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.970
you don't really need to snapshot it.
There's no,
nothing goes away anymore.

1960
01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:18.120
I mean you can't send it to someone and I hope it goes away.
First rule,

1961
01:49:18.121 --> 01:49:19.890
assume if it is digital,
it is everywhere.

1962
01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.250
And then the second rule is as soon as there's a photo of you online somewhere,

1963
01:49:23.251 --> 01:49:24.900
someone is Photoshop to dick in your mouth.

1964
01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.350
And now even more with this new heartbleed exploit that's going on that the

1965
01:49:28.351 --> 01:49:31.200
government made,
I mean a hacker made.
Oh that's good.

1966
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:34.000
That's what I was going to ask you.
I forgot what,

1967
01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:37.860
what percentage of people on Reddit are government disinformation agents that

1968
01:49:37.861 --> 01:49:40.830
are designed to interrupt conversations and turn the tide

1969
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:44.810
on climate control?
Let's say if you go to Reddit,
Reddit,
what?

1970
01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:48.130
What the climb like troll arguments are actually one of the,
one

1971
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:51.250
<v 3>of the subs I don't remember cause every sub red is its own form,</v>

1972
01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:52.810
its own community with its own moderators.

1973
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:55.930
One of them actually banned climate deniers.

1974
01:49:56.230 --> 01:49:58.500
Like they basically said we're not going to,
and then you know it,

1975
01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:01.570
what typically happens is this is like any wordpress blog deciding,
hey,

1976
01:50:01.571 --> 01:50:04.660
we're no longer going to post stories about blah.
So if people really want it,

1977
01:50:04.661 --> 01:50:06.070
they go and create a new sub.
Right.
And they're like,

1978
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:10.660
fuck you guys were creating real politics or really real politics or whatever it

1979
01:50:10.661 --> 01:50:15.190
is.
So it's a,
it's a,
it's a robust enough system that like new things rise.

1980
01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:16.030
But so the Bot

1981
01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:19.740
<v 0>band climate deniers from one form,
but the climate deniers can open up</v>

1982
01:50:19.770 --> 01:50:20.600
<v 3>their own forums.</v>

1983
01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:24.360
Well basically like creating a subreddit is really like creating a wordpress

1984
01:50:24.361 --> 01:50:28.290
blog,
but you're part of a much larger network.
And so every sub reddit,

1985
01:50:28.291 --> 01:50:30.760
it has its own moderation team.
Like snoop for instance,

1986
01:50:30.761 --> 01:50:35.670
as a moderator of our trees.
That's ridiculous.
Amazing.
Snoop moderates.
Yeah,
he's,

1987
01:50:35.671 --> 01:50:40.660
he's active,
quite active.
It is dope.
It's dope.
As it,
yeah,
it's,

1988
01:50:40.661 --> 01:50:44.200
it's pretty,
it's pretty spectacular.
But like fresh nose on my nose will,

1989
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:46.300
people can create,
uh,
the,

1990
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:48.630
the sort of forms and these communities and run them as they see fit.

1991
01:50:48.631 --> 01:50:51.330
And if people don't like it,
they create another one.
That's amazing.

1992
01:50:51.630 --> 01:50:56.610
But on the whole,
we work really,
really,
really hard to mitigate,
um,

1993
01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:01.640
sort of ring voting and cheating to try to goose up stories or goose down down.

1994
01:51:02.251 --> 01:51:06.220
So I mean,
I'm sure,
you know,
as soon as red it became,
as you know,
200 whatever,

1995
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:06.691
a million people,

1996
01:51:06.691 --> 01:51:10.020
as soon as it became as large as it was or at some point it tipped over and

1997
01:51:10.021 --> 01:51:13.110
people realized it is in our best interest to be here.

1998
01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:16.860
Now there are always there the social media douchebags who are uploading all

1999
01:51:16.861 --> 01:51:18.510
their garbage marketing content,

2000
01:51:19.170 --> 01:51:24.150
but I'm sure I'd be naive to say that there weren't states trying to help

2001
01:51:24.151 --> 01:51:28.470
encourage and some content and discourage others.
But we,
like I said,

2002
01:51:28.471 --> 01:51:31.770
we work really hard and I think there's no perfect system.
Um,

2003
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:33.030
but I'm sure people are trying,

2004
01:51:33.031 --> 01:51:36.030
but the vast majority of people are just regular people.

2005
01:51:36.090 --> 01:51:38.190
<v 0>Uh,
yeah,
I,
I agree with you.
I think,
um,</v>

2006
01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:41.480
there's always gonna be someone who tries to do that,

2007
01:51:41.481 --> 01:51:45.440
but you're dealing with the numbers of humans are so great.

2008
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:49.280
It would be really difficult for someone to subvert that system as like a

2009
01:51:49.281 --> 01:51:54.281
climate of Stein group trying to intercept ideas and throw disinformation into

2010
01:51:54.681 --> 01:51:58.640
them.
There's just so many really smart people out there that can see through

2011
01:51:58.641 --> 01:52:01.020
bullshit.
And then we'll post,
you know,

2012
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:05.960
like contradicting information and show what's wrong with this and then spend a

2013
01:52:05.961 --> 01:52:07.580
lot of time to make you look stupid.

2014
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:11.100
<v 3>Yes.
Those guys are good at it,
man.
There's some fucking,
yeah.</v>

2015
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:14.670
<v 0>Awesome discussions on,
on whether it's on reddit or,</v>

2016
01:52:14.671 --> 01:52:19.180
I have a message board that's been around since 1998 aren't here.
No Jima.

2017
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:23.200
No,
exactly.
In this form as a,
like a vbulletin.

2018
01:52:23.250 --> 01:52:26.640
It's been around since 2001,
you know.
Um,

2019
01:52:26.730 --> 01:52:30.180
and it's not the best system though.
It's a good system.

2020
01:52:30.181 --> 01:52:32.310
It's easy to go back and read,
you know,

2021
01:52:32.311 --> 01:52:36.120
but it's not the best system as far as like the getting the best stuff to rise

2022
01:52:36.121 --> 01:52:40.890
to the top.
It's like the reddit system of vote ups and vote downs.
That's like,

2023
01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:45.920
it seems to be like a really good way of eradicating shitty ideas or at least

2024
01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:50.030
non,
you know,

2025
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:55.660
non unanimous opinions or opinions that you unanimously voted against.

2026
01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:59.840
<v 3>Do.
Uh,
do you guys know,
check out our Joe Rogan?
I wonder,</v>

2027
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:04.760
I imagine there's an active Joe Rogan.
So yeah,
there's Joburg and experiences,

2028
01:53:04.761 --> 01:53:09.290
which I always online.
And then there's a,
here's the Joe Rogan experience,

2029
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:11.510
which is pretty,
pretty good.
There's a,

2030
01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:15.590
I think 21,000 people that,
that do it.
Oh snap.

2031
01:53:15.591 --> 01:53:18.170
And so subscribers,
you know,
those are like Twitter followers,
right?

2032
01:53:18.171 --> 01:53:22.100
So subscribers are about maybe a 10th of the actual people looking because only

2033
01:53:22.101 --> 01:53:23.840
about a 10th will be subscribed.

2034
01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.900
So there's probably about 200,000 so almost a quarter million.

2035
01:53:27.010 --> 01:53:29.440
<v 0>Now.
How do you keep someone from,</v>

2036
01:53:29.441 --> 01:53:34.441
like say if someone was a on reddit and they were posting something about an ex

2037
01:53:34.571 --> 01:53:38.710
girlfriend or being rude about information photos,

2038
01:53:38.890 --> 01:53:39.780
how do you stop that

2039
01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:43.910
<v 3>stuff from happening?
Well,
I mean it depends.
It depends on the situation,
right?</v>

2040
01:53:43.911 --> 01:53:48.650
Like reddit as a platform,
like Twitter doesn't actually,

2041
01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:51.950
actually,
no,
Twitter does host,
sorry,
so read it.
Read.
It does not host content.

2042
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:56.990
So we,
well I guess we host texts but we don't host images or video.
Um,

2043
01:53:56.991 --> 01:54:00.440
so often times those things will be on youtube or imager and that's,
you know,

2044
01:54:00.441 --> 01:54:03.980
we're kind of like a traffic sign or like a map to win,

2045
01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:08.000
but we can't do anything about the actual content.
Um,
and in the event of,

2046
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:12.650
you know,
content that's posted,
the generally accepted rule is if it is legal,

2047
01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:17.060
then we will let it stand.
And that has been,
you know,

2048
01:54:17.061 --> 01:54:19.670
it every,
like I said,
every sub,
right.
It gets moderated.

2049
01:54:19.671 --> 01:54:24.440
So most the vast majority of them are moderated such that like garbage content

2050
01:54:24.441 --> 01:54:25.610
like that,
like on your form,

2051
01:54:25.611 --> 01:54:27.890
you wouldn't want a bunch of garbage content floating up like that,

2052
01:54:27.891 --> 01:54:31.790
that wasn't adding any value.
And so you have the opportunity to,
you know,

2053
01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.180
as a moderator bandit.
Um,
but as a general platform,
uh,

2054
01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:40.160
the thinking is if it is legal,
we're okay with it.
Um,
even if you know,

2055
01:54:40.161 --> 01:54:41.870
in some instances it is distasteful.

2056
01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.130
The vast lakes of the vast majority of the content is just harmless or good.

2057
01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:46.990
<v 0>It's also,</v>

2058
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:50.110
I feel like with a lot of the distasteful stuff that people were getting really

2059
01:54:50.111 --> 01:54:50.741
upset about,

2060
01:54:50.741 --> 01:54:54.100
I think that it's one of those things that the human race is just going to have

2061
01:54:54.101 --> 01:54:54.934
to go through.

2062
01:54:55.010 --> 01:55:00.010
It's like a phase or a stage in this integration with information that we're

2063
01:55:00.341 --> 01:55:00.881
going through.

2064
01:55:00.881 --> 01:55:05.830
There's still anonymity and the anonymity is something that people cherish and

2065
01:55:05.831 --> 01:55:09.790
they cherish their quote unquote privacy and their rights to privacy and they

2066
01:55:09.791 --> 01:55:11.380
have all these ideas about it.
But that's,

2067
01:55:11.770 --> 01:55:14.500
that's going to be like saying you don't want to see people anymore.

2068
01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:17.470
It's really what it's going to be like.
I reserve the right to not see people.

2069
01:55:17.471 --> 01:55:20.470
Okay,
well if you go in the woods and go deep,
deep,
deep,
deep,

2070
01:55:20.471 --> 01:55:24.700
deep in the woods where there's no people,
you can not see people.
However,

2071
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:27.760
if you want to be in cities,
you're going to have to see people fuck.

2072
01:55:28.210 --> 01:55:32.290
And that's sort of what's going to happen when it comes to people being assholes

2073
01:55:32.291 --> 01:55:36.850
online.
It's not going to be as simple as you're hiding behind a duck.

2074
01:55:36.851 --> 01:55:38.530
Talk 69,
you know,

2075
01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:43.531
that's your name and you're distributing all sorts of nasty evil shit.

2076
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.840
And then what did you think about,
here's a good example.
That one guy that he,

2077
01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.760
he was on reddit and he was like,

2078
01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.670
apparently he was very rude and put a lot of nasty shit on.

2079
01:55:53.671 --> 01:55:58.290
They found out who he was and he got fired from his job and it turned out like

2080
01:55:58.291 --> 01:55:58.801
this is a guy,

2081
01:55:58.801 --> 01:56:02.670
he's got a family and he had to support them and now he's like been publicly

2082
01:56:02.671 --> 01:56:04.920
shamed.
What was your feeling on that?

2083
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:09.110
<v 3>Um,
well,
which part?
Like,
you know,</v>

2084
01:56:09.111 --> 01:56:14.111
what the price you pay for a freedom or for the freedom to post stuff is to

2085
01:56:15.141 --> 01:56:18.470
take,
have to take responsibility for it as a content creator.

2086
01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:23.620
And uh,
you know,
it's like at the end of the day,
you know,
you create the soapbox.

2087
01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:27.230
So like we created a kind of soapbox or a printing press or a hammer,
right?

2088
01:56:27.231 --> 01:56:29.180
Like any kind of tool.
And so at the end of the day,

2089
01:56:29.181 --> 01:56:30.380
we're not responsible for what,

2090
01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:34.310
like ultimately someone does with a hammer or a printing press.

2091
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:39.380
The vast majority of which is good sometimes cannot be.
And you know,

2092
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:43.910
he,
he essentially paid the price for that.

2093
01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:49.730
Um,
and it's,
it's frustrating because Ah,
I'm the whole,

2094
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:53.200
the vast majority of people who pick up that hammer are,
you know,

2095
01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.090
like any random Twitter user or any random for any random person,

2096
01:56:56.091 --> 01:56:59.540
like just being reasonable,
normal people.
And some of them aren't.

2097
01:57:00.050 --> 01:57:04.070
And you know,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a matter of saying,
you know what,

2098
01:57:04.071 --> 01:57:08.390
we want to have this be that open platform.
There's no,
fundamentally,

2099
01:57:08.391 --> 01:57:12.590
there's no way to stop or police every single thing that gets done in real time.

2100
01:57:12.970 --> 01:57:13.370
Um,

2101
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:17.270
we make our best effort and when on occasion there are things that are illegal

2102
01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:19.390
while we do what we need to do.
But um,

2103
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:24.330
<v 0>well apparently this guy was a real douchebag online just as a real asshole and</v>

2104
01:57:24.331 --> 01:57:29.331
rude and so people sort of justified that he could be taken down because of

2105
01:57:30.001 --> 01:57:34.500
that.
But in his defense and it's sketchy defense.
Um,

2106
01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.840
what I would say is that if you,

2107
01:57:36.930 --> 01:57:41.280
if the precedent's been set and the precedent is anonymity and there's some

2108
01:57:41.281 --> 01:57:46.281
people that get a charge out of using that anonymity to poke at people and be

2109
01:57:47.101 --> 01:57:51.930
rude and nasty and they get some weird sort of sick charge out of it.
Okay.

2110
01:57:51.931 --> 01:57:55.200
Yes,
they definitely are causing discomfort.
Yes,

2111
01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:58.620
they are definitely probably quote unquote cyber harassing.

2112
01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:03.980
But that precedent of anonymity is very strange because once we've established

2113
01:58:04.621 --> 01:58:09.180
sort of what we think is going to be the,
the standard reaction to these things,

2114
01:58:09.181 --> 01:58:11.130
people are going to get upset.
They're going to ban screen names,

2115
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:14.160
but they're not going to do is find out who you are and then go to your employer

2116
01:58:14.161 --> 01:58:18.210
and expose all your shit.
And once that does happen,
it's like,
Whoa,
wait a minute,

2117
01:58:18.211 --> 01:58:20.590
wait a minute.
Wait.
I thought we were playing a game.
Like he,

2118
01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:21.900
he might've gotten out of hand,

2119
01:58:21.901 --> 01:58:26.820
but he probably thought at least part of it was him playing this game that was

2120
01:58:26.821 --> 01:58:31.470
afforded to him by anonymity and probably what we understand the laws to be.

2121
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:36.780
<v 3>I think,
uh,
the,
the real,
so,</v>

2122
01:58:36.781 --> 01:58:41.781
so one of the things that has is generally accepted is this idea of I'm not the

2123
01:58:43.781 --> 01:58:48.340
challenges,
so this is,
this is pseudonymity.
And then he had a pseudonym.
He,

2124
01:58:48.610 --> 01:58:52.540
he did not,
or any one of us who goes online to use a pseudonym,

2125
01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:57.610
still has some kind of a persona online and they probably use that account

2126
01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:00.740
elsewhere.
They,
they do or maybe they don't.
Um,

2127
01:59:00.970 --> 01:59:05.970
but there's some acceptance in this new world that like all of you in one can

2128
01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:12.100
find out almost anything about sort of public available stuff about us with

2129
01:59:12.101 --> 01:59:15.130
enough searching with enough sleuthing on that phone calls and enough tenacity,

2130
01:59:15.131 --> 01:59:16.870
right?
Every investigative journalists been doing this forever.

2131
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:21.730
But like there is this challenge that like there is no,

2132
01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:25.870
there is no easy answer for this because ultimately there is going to be right,

2133
01:59:25.871 --> 01:59:29.230
that's going to show up as a website.
It's going to show up as blobbity Blahs,

2134
01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:32.890
real identity.com and some really determined person is going to create that

2135
01:59:32.891 --> 01:59:34.870
thing that's going to out whatever it is.

2136
01:59:34.871 --> 01:59:39.871
And there aren't very clear laws around this just because it hasn't really,

2137
01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:44.470
it happened.
There's no precedent for it.
And,
uh,
and so for the time being,

2138
01:59:44.471 --> 01:59:47.950
it becomes,
you know,
try as much as possible to discourage it.

2139
01:59:47.951 --> 01:59:51.870
This idea of like quote unquote doxing.
Um,
but there's no other,

2140
01:59:51.871 --> 01:59:55.120
they call it docs.
Uh,
I'd actually don't know the etymology of it,

2141
01:59:55.210 --> 01:59:59.260
but like to find the documents around,
I presume,
I don't actually know.

2142
01:59:59.850 --> 02:00:02.980
Um,
and that's the kind of phrase for it,
but uh,

2143
02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:05.920
but it's a matter of figuring that out and I'm not,
I,

2144
02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:10.490
I think we are still as a society figuring that out,
um,
because it,

2145
02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:16.170
<v 0>but we like trolls in a way.
Like people like funny trolls.
Like I,</v>

2146
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:18.150
I'd like some trolls on the message board.

2147
02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:21.210
I've got some people in my mess where they're just hilarious.
There are,

2148
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:23.670
and it's so tough to draw that distinction because I know what you're talking

2149
02:00:23.671 --> 02:00:24.420
about.

2150
02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:28.620
It's a kind of a game they're playing and the kind of a game is that trying to

2151
02:00:28.621 --> 02:00:30.570
piss people off and they're,

2152
02:00:30.571 --> 02:00:34.110
they're trying to get people to argue with them and sometimes they'll argue both

2153
02:00:34.111 --> 02:00:36.010
sides,
you know,
they're just there,

2154
02:00:36.150 --> 02:00:40.440
they're having fun and they might do it and some people take it real deep.

2155
02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:43.170
Just like I was saying that if Stan hope was in the room and I was on stage

2156
02:00:43.171 --> 02:00:46.440
talking shit,
I might say something extra fucked up just to make him laugh.

2157
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:49.110
I think they do that with each other as well.

2158
02:00:49.111 --> 02:00:50.820
And I'm not saying that it's all innocent,

2159
02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:55.500
but I am saying that if you do look at it all honestly and objectively,

2160
02:00:55.501 --> 02:00:58.890
you've got to leave room for the entertainment value of people fucking with

2161
02:00:58.891 --> 02:01:01.550
people on the Internet because there's something to it.
Yeah.

2162
02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:04.350
And there is look and there is a,
there's a,
there's a precedent for this,
right?

2163
02:01:04.351 --> 02:01:06.240
In meet space like hecklers for instance,

2164
02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.370
there is Meat Space as opposed to cyberspace.
Like,

2165
02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:13.400
like there's a precedent for this.
And I think there is

2166
02:01:14.090 --> 02:01:14.530
<v 3>and,
and,</v>

2167
02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:19.530
and one thing I should stress is that just having a real identity does not stop

2168
02:01:19.571 --> 02:01:22.930
people from being assholes on the Internet.
Facebook is a perfect example,
right?

2169
02:01:22.931 --> 02:01:25.570
You can have your photo,
your full name,
and trust me,

2170
02:01:25.571 --> 02:01:26.680
we've all seen those screenshots.

2171
02:01:26.710 --> 02:01:30.040
Maybe we've even seen them on our friends' posts.
But like people say something

2172
02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:34.230
<v 0>full offensive,
horrible stuff and just on Facebook with their name next to it,</v>

2173
02:01:34.231 --> 02:01:37.080
like I say some unbelievably dumb shit too.
So,
so having,

2174
02:01:37.110 --> 02:01:40.040
having a real id will not people from

2175
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.010
<v 3>being obnoxious or stupid or you know,
whatever adjective.</v>

2176
02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.830
<v 0>Well,
I don't think it'll stop them,</v>

2177
02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:49.150
but what it will do is open them up for the consequences of such behavior that

2178
02:01:49.151 --> 02:01:52.960
they may have been unaware of and that's what the interaction that the Internet

2179
02:01:52.961 --> 02:01:57.790
provides to the average Douche Wad from 20 years ago.
Never experienced.

2180
02:01:57.970 --> 02:01:59.230
You're not going to experience if you,

2181
02:01:59.350 --> 02:02:03.430
if you're just one of those guys that has some fucking racist thing that you

2182
02:02:03.431 --> 02:02:07.190
spout out in your neighborhood and nobody calls you on it,
you know,

2183
02:02:07.210 --> 02:02:10.240
maybe cause you're big or maybe because you're important.

2184
02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:11.410
Maybe it's because of the neighborhood,

2185
02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:14.680
but if you put that shit on your Facebook page and someone takes a photo of it

2186
02:02:14.681 --> 02:02:17.980
and then puts it on Reddit,
boom,
Schelok lock,
boom,

2187
02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.050
it's coming at you son fucking thousands of people you never met calling you a

2188
02:02:23.051 --> 02:02:25.090
cunt saying they know where you live,

2189
02:02:25.150 --> 02:02:28.390
saying they're going to find you and smack the Shit Outta you saying they're

2190
02:02:28.391 --> 02:02:31.410
going to shit in your mouth and hold it down.
That's really specific.

2191
02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:35.680
People are looking at specific but then of course they get in trouble for

2192
02:02:35.681 --> 02:02:39.100
violence and threats because that becomes non anonymous as well.

2193
02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:41.450
<v 3>That's why you should make a real value on Karma points.</v>

2194
02:02:41.530 --> 02:02:44.510
Then people wouldn't be dicks and they could actually get something.
You know?

2195
02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:48.230
How could you have a real witch?
The exchange that for US dollars,
I don't know,

2196
02:02:48.231 --> 02:02:53.060
make it an exchange of coins or angels and demons.
Bitcoin.

2197
02:02:54.110 --> 02:02:56.930
Bitcoin is like a,
well now what do you feel I'm going to,

2198
02:02:56.931 --> 02:03:00.500
I'm actually an investor in a couple of bitcoin stuff so I'm pretty,

2199
02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:04.640
I'm pretty bullish.
I'm not like,
I'm not like this is going to,

2200
02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:09.020
I'm not at the 10 level where this is like end of governments and of states like

2201
02:03:09.021 --> 02:03:11.900
we are living in it but I am.
I am.

2202
02:03:11.901 --> 02:03:16.850
I think I'm most interested in the fact that these like basically transferring

2203
02:03:16.851 --> 02:03:21.851
units of value has been really hard and needlessly expensive for too long

2204
02:03:22.431 --> 02:03:25.370
because banks make a lot like the taking,
I have to think,

2205
02:03:25.371 --> 02:03:29.270
Bank of American charges me $25 to do an overnight wire and it's like,

2206
02:03:29.271 --> 02:03:31.010
come on guys,
it's ones and Zeros you don't need,

2207
02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:32.930
there's not a bunch of guys in the factory floor being like,

2208
02:03:32.931 --> 02:03:36.500
we've got to get this wire to Denmark tomorrow.
Like that's absurd.

2209
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:38.800
And so there's so much,

2210
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:43.810
the financial system has these like a lot of revenue tied into moving ones and

2211
02:03:44.151 --> 02:03:45.510
Zeros,
cryptocurrency,

2212
02:03:45.710 --> 02:03:50.040
whether it's bitcoin or whether it's Doge coin or whether it's whatever coin,
um,

2213
02:03:50.110 --> 02:03:53.610
pause coins he's going to be really is a pocket.
Of course there is.
Yep.

2214
02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:56.130
How's the Kardashians coin to?
Wasn't there a Kim Kardashian?

2215
02:03:56.131 --> 02:03:59.260
It was a kind of don't want to talk about on this podcast.
All right,
Kim,

2216
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:04.220
prior to the Armenian people and

2217
02:04:04.530 --> 02:04:08.370
<v 0>you can't deny the ass I that is,
that is undeniable.
I'm,</v>

2218
02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:10.840
the whole thing is a mess,
but hey,
what are you going to do?
Yeah.

2219
02:04:10.930 --> 02:04:12.310
It's part of what makes us fun.

2220
02:04:12.610 --> 02:04:14.770
I think part of what makes people find as are falling,

2221
02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:19.120
I think that we were all beautiful and perfect and Dalai Lama ask,
come on,
man.

2222
02:04:19.121 --> 02:04:21.490
A bunch of people wearing an orange everywhere and no one's getting a dick

2223
02:04:21.491 --> 02:04:25.030
sucked.
It'd be ridiculous.
It'd be boring.
It wouldn't sound like fun at all.

2224
02:04:25.031 --> 02:04:29.530
Exactly.
There'd be no freakness and people like that wrong or right.

2225
02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:31.090
They provide that extra,

2226
02:04:32.710 --> 02:04:35.680
that extra stupidity to life that makes the flavor.

2227
02:04:35.681 --> 02:04:38.250
It's just like a hint basil in a stew

2228
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:41.360
<v 1>that just makes the whole thing you can get by without the Bazell,</v>

2229
02:04:41.370 --> 02:04:45.930
but it just adds something to it.
Yeah.
The ridiculous fucking dance that we do.

2230
02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:49.900
A lot of notes are involved in this ridiculous dance.
All of it together.

2231
02:04:49.901 --> 02:04:53.490
It's beautiful though.
Wow.
This symphony of life.
Symphony of life.

2232
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:57.320
Bittersweet is rogue and may be connection to,

2233
02:04:59.070 --> 02:05:03.150
but yes,
bullish on cryptocurrencies.
I think it's,
it's gonna be,

2234
02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:06.870
it's gonna be real interesting.
Do you owe a Andrea's Antonopoulos?

2235
02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:11.700
I feel like I should have.
He should.
He's the Jesus of Bitcoin.
Oh,

2236
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:16.080
he would be on the podcast again on the 22nd and he said he's been preparing for

2237
02:05:16.081 --> 02:05:19.440
you.
Brian,
are you hearing,
are you a skeptic Brian?

2238
02:05:19.441 --> 02:05:24.360
Through some surprise curve balls at him?
I did.
And he got no,

2239
02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:30.140
you were a slight living Brian Skeptical about bitcoin more than I am.

2240
02:05:30.150 --> 02:05:34.320
Weird thing is,
is that I don't like how your Ip address is public.

2241
02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:39.030
They say it's not like it.
They say it's not.
It is though.
But apparently,
um,

2242
02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:42.270
I dunno,
but according to them they say this way is that it's not,

2243
02:05:43.810 --> 02:05:46.800
let's find out right now.
Immediately after he gave me some bitcoins,

2244
02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:49.950
some other person just gave me some big points.
I'm like,
all right,

2245
02:05:49.951 --> 02:05:54.060
so somebody is now stalking me because I've got three points they're giving you.

2246
02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:58.290
Oh,
where did this person just immediately just giving you money?

2247
02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:01.560
Is this guy just tracking every number and don't be a pushy guy is trying to

2248
02:06:01.561 --> 02:06:04.440
give you some money.
And then with the tracking of the Ip address,

2249
02:06:04.441 --> 02:06:06.840
I feel like that there's just some weird,

2250
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:09.690
there's something going on that I don't know about.
Yeah,
they don't like it.

2251
02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:13.020
Like the Ip address things freaks me out.
All right.

2252
02:06:13.021 --> 02:06:16.560
Here it says doing so might leak the fact that you are using bitcoin fog but no

2253
02:06:16.561 --> 02:06:20.370
other details.
Um,
okay,
so there's ways around it.

2254
02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:25.320
Bitcoin fog is a way around it apparently.
Yeah,

2255
02:06:25.770 --> 02:06:28.930
sure.
There's a way around it.
You got use floss.
Yeah.

2256
02:06:29.010 --> 02:06:31.770
For the highest level anonymity you need tour.

2257
02:06:32.130 --> 02:06:36.360
You wouldn't get tour tours and open source,
open source,
open source,

2258
02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:38.310
open source,

2259
02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:43.020
anonymization network for short overview tor,

2260
02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:44.580
the tor browser bundle.

2261
02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:47.980
So now that the only people that know what you're doing is this company that

2262
02:06:47.981 --> 02:06:51.590
just,
I not,
I'm not,
the government says no,

2263
02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:55.380
no towards towards legit.
You say so.
But when the fucking tour train,

2264
02:06:56.090 --> 02:06:59.190
not the fucking train and into the woods,
where are you going to be?

2265
02:06:59.250 --> 02:07:02.580
I'll tell you what we're going to be going to be selling books here is without

2266
02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:06.870
their permission.
By Alexis.
Oh,
Hanya.
It's the name of,
Oh,
thank you.
Yeah.

2267
02:07:06.871 --> 02:07:09.360
There's no,
there's no title on the cover.
Just the symbols man.

2268
02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:13.170
Without their permission.
The,
um,
but real talk,

2269
02:07:13.410 --> 02:07:17.430
is this the name of the book without the Oh yeah.
The uh,

2270
02:07:17.850 --> 02:07:21.510
the real talk though,
you know,
there is going to be real right now.
Oh yeah.

2271
02:07:21.550 --> 02:07:26.050
You keep it in real.
This technology tour is amazeballs.
Uh,

2272
02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:28.800
it is the thing when you hear about Chinese dissidents who were looking at

2273
02:07:28.801 --> 02:07:31.980
Tienanmen square massacre photos,
right?
Even though there's the great firewall,

2274
02:07:31.981 --> 02:07:35.980
it's cause of the tour.
Whoa.
Really?
And this is,
I mean it's been,
it's been like,

2275
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:41.170
<v 3>it is,
it really is one of those pure forms of,
so it's open source software,</v>

2276
02:07:41.171 --> 02:07:43.750
right?
So you can take a look at the source anytime for,
you know,

2277
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:47.370
not only improving it but also just sort of promoting that transparency.
Um,

2278
02:07:47.530 --> 02:07:52.530
but it's the thing that lets us actually get through any of the states that want

2279
02:07:53.351 --> 02:07:54.730
to try their hardest.
I mean,
China's bet,

2280
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:57.970
a lot of money and a lot of time and a lot of smart people trying to keep the

2281
02:07:57.971 --> 02:08:02.290
internet down.
But thanks for the tour and resourceful humans they lose.

2282
02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:05.400
<v 0>That's pretty fucking bad ass.
I love hearing shit like that.</v>

2283
02:08:05.401 --> 02:08:06.650
That's such an interesting thing.

2284
02:08:06.651 --> 02:08:11.651
When something comes along that just is built by people smarter than your press

2285
02:08:12.110 --> 02:08:14.320
<v 3>and not a business.
It's,
it's an open source project.</v>

2286
02:08:14.321 --> 02:08:17.750
It's like a bunch of people got their leg.
I think software is best explained is,

2287
02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:18.441
well maybe not best,

2288
02:08:18.441 --> 02:08:22.100
but I like explaining it as like Legos and so a bunch of people through the

2289
02:08:22.101 --> 02:08:24.950
Internet with like pseudonyms,
so maybe never even met each other in real life.

2290
02:08:25.190 --> 02:08:29.030
Brought together their digital lego kits to build something cool that no one had

2291
02:08:29.031 --> 02:08:32.070
built before that now lets anyone,
like I said,
open,
uh,

2292
02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:35.870
openly surf the Internet in spite of some of the most powerful and repressive

2293
02:08:35.871 --> 02:08:36.704
states in the world.

2294
02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:38.820
<v 0>What did you think when that um,</v>

2295
02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:44.010
older Japanese gentleman who they credited with creating bitcoin but apparently

2296
02:08:44.011 --> 02:08:49.011
maybe didn't they really hounded this fucking guy and waited outside his house

2297
02:08:49.261 --> 02:08:51.990
and knocked on his door and this is scary stuff.

2298
02:08:52.070 --> 02:08:55.510
<v 3>It seemed,
it seemed like some rather excessive journalism to say</v>

2299
02:08:55.970 --> 02:09:00.650
<v 0>not just excessive but in correct harassment when they,
but then they</v>

2300
02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:04.320
<v 3>have,
they not,
I know they responded by saying we're sticking to the story.</v>

2301
02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:05.520
I don't know if they've since,

2302
02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:08.240
<v 0>well,
of course,
why not stick this story?
It's just some poor little man.</v>

2303
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:12.940
He'd fucking harass.
Even if he did correct,
encrypted or whatever.

2304
02:09:12.941 --> 02:09:14.170
A figure it out coded.

2305
02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:17.920
If he did create bitcoin or it was one of the people who created Bitcoin,

2306
02:09:17.921 --> 02:09:21.040
you have no right to hound him like that and he made it very clear he didn't

2307
02:09:21.041 --> 02:09:21.791
want,
yeah,

2308
02:09:21.791 --> 02:09:25.330
I mean attention doesn't want anything and you're standing outside of his house

2309
02:09:25.331 --> 02:09:29.110
ringing his doorbell,
sticking cameras in his face.
Fuck you man.

2310
02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:31.750
You can't do that.
Just the,
there's proper channels.

2311
02:09:31.751 --> 02:09:35.230
He's sending a letter or an email.
Would you like to be interviewed?
If not,

2312
02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:39.070
leave them the fuck alone.
Yeah.
What the,
what did the guy do that so awful?

2313
02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:42.970
The guy came up with some sort of an algorithm to make an alternative currency.

2314
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.450
So you think that you're okay to stick a fucking camera in his face and

2315
02:09:46.451 --> 02:09:50.200
broadcasted Jim edge without his permission to the whole fucking world.

2316
02:09:50.710 --> 02:09:54.430
And now that they're not sure whether or not they're correct or not and it's

2317
02:09:54.431 --> 02:09:58.540
awkward.
God Damn,
it's awkward.
It seems like that guy should be getting paid.

2318
02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:02.500
<v 3>What was his name?
Satoshi.
Well,
so Toshi,
he his,</v>

2319
02:10:02.710 --> 02:10:07.570
I don't remember what his actual name was.
That was a a pseudonym.

2320
02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:11.000
<v 0>Yeah.
Fucking,
it's scary shit man.</v>

2321
02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:14.070
<v 4>So you can't mask the thing.
That's good.</v>

2322
02:10:14.071 --> 02:10:18.690
But the thing that freaked me out though was how in private sort of,

2323
02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.530
I guess somebody gave me some bitcoins just to show me how to do it and then

2324
02:10:22.531 --> 02:10:25.220
later that night I just got who poke but like,

2325
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:30.060
and then so did jam free money.
I know,
but,
but that's like,
that freaks me out.

2326
02:10:30.061 --> 02:10:30.301
It's like,

2327
02:10:30.301 --> 02:10:33.060
why are people just sending me money now that don't even know who I am?

2328
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:34.100
It's just because of my IP

2329
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:36.860
<v 5>address.
They have a vested interest in you joining.</v>

2330
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:40.490
Like it's the kind of system that gets more valuable as more people join it and

2331
02:10:40.491 --> 02:10:44.630
do business on it.
And I'm just like,
you know,
dollars,
right?
I mean dollars.

2332
02:10:44.631 --> 02:10:49.280
You're a store that's valued over most parts of the world because people are

2333
02:10:49.281 --> 02:10:51.400
cool doing business in it.
Uh,
so similar idea.
So like,

2334
02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:54.180
because it's still at the four,
uh,

2335
02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:59.270
everyone who's into this is pretty bullish on it and they want as many other

2336
02:10:59.271 --> 02:11:01.430
people that can get on.
I mean,
what's crazy

2337
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:05.620
<v 0>well you have to do is have people involved that want it to work,</v>

2338
02:11:05.650 --> 02:11:08.980
legitimizes it work.
Yeah.
It's just going to take time.

2339
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:10.340
<v 5>And it's,
it's been,</v>

2340
02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:13.880
the challenge for Bitcoin is now is this going to be something people are going

2341
02:11:13.881 --> 02:11:17.540
to be buying stuff in online.
So like overstock made headlines,
um,

2342
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:18.820
they partnered with Coinbase,

2343
02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:23.030
which is one of those companies I backed by accepting bitcoin and like,
you know,

2344
02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:24.860
processing non trivial amounts of money.

2345
02:11:24.861 --> 02:11:26.770
People buying furniture in bitcoin online,

2346
02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:30.060
<v 0>uh,
tiger direct doing it on computer.</v>

2347
02:11:30.061 --> 02:11:33.360
You guys taking bitcoin donations now we don't take gyrations.
Nope.

2348
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:36.170
There's no only youtube.
My Ip address.

2349
02:11:38.070 --> 02:11:40.980
I don't know,
I don't take any direct donations.

2350
02:11:41.110 --> 02:11:45.910
<v 5>Is it safe to put your bitcoin Ip address out to accept bitcoins?</v>

2351
02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:49.000
Meaning like I was thinking about doing it but then I was like wait,

2352
02:11:49.001 --> 02:11:50.590
so then I have people are like,
no,

2353
02:11:50.591 --> 02:11:54.880
you don't want to put your number out publicly,
not your encrypted.
Uh,
this is,

2354
02:11:54.970 --> 02:11:58.570
well there is one you definitely do not want to share publicly.
Right.

2355
02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:00.820
But you can generate,
so if you use Columbus,
you something else,

2356
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:06.030
you can generate a key that's free to distribute that people will use to give

2357
02:12:06.551 --> 02:12:08.530
you a currency sit.

2358
02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.010
It's very confusing for like that cause I think I almost put out my bad plenty

2359
02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:12.893
out to everybody.

2360
02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:16.440
<v 0>There was a combat so then people can just take your,</v>

2361
02:12:16.990 --> 02:12:20.410
they take the value that's stored.
Yeah.
Like that Mt.
Gox Shit.

2362
02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:23.020
I mean that was one of the most hilarious stories of all time.

2363
02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:27.530
The fact that it's all magic,
the gathering and loving life change.

2364
02:12:27.550 --> 02:12:31.090
And then from there it becomes one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges on the

2365
02:12:31.091 --> 02:12:35.770
internet and it's totally not coded correctly and people are just sticking knife

2366
02:12:35.890 --> 02:12:39.250
holes into the bottom of the bag.
It's stealing blood.

2367
02:12:39.650 --> 02:12:44.110
The point where hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin is missing.
Yeah.

2368
02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:47.680
God cost her who stole all that money?
Do you know?
I,
you know,

2369
02:12:47.681 --> 02:12:51.570
what would you tell him?
I'm not allowed to tell you.
You guys don't take guys.

2370
02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:56.050
There's plenty.
There's,
there's already plenty of it.
And that's speculation.

2371
02:12:56.500 --> 02:13:00.430
Well,
um,
it's weird because it seems like you should be able to track them.

2372
02:13:01.090 --> 02:13:02.620
It seems like she'd be able to know where they are.

2373
02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:05.800
It seems like that's just another step that's missing from this equation that

2374
02:13:05.801 --> 02:13:07.950
would make money all the more,
I mean,

2375
02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:11.170
it would really make it all the more tangible if you could track it,

2376
02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:14.380
if you know where it was.
I mean,
you have a,

2377
02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:18.070
I actually don't know the specifics of the Mt Gox heist.
Um,

2378
02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:18.970
but generally speaking,

2379
02:13:18.971 --> 02:13:23.050
any one of those transactions is a part of the public register or public record.

2380
02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:24.940
Like it's that much.
I mean,

2381
02:13:24.941 --> 02:13:29.030
you don't know a lot know or they didn't pay attention while I was going on.
No,

2382
02:13:29.050 --> 02:13:32.220
I don't,
I don't actually know the specifics of it.
I think the general consensus

2383
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:36.610
<v 3>online was it was some kind of an inside job as part of the yeah,</v>

2384
02:13:37.190 --> 02:13:38.990
that motherfucker.
I Dunno.
But yeah,

2385
02:13:38.991 --> 02:13:43.530
he looks like he might be the inside job type shifty looking,

2386
02:13:43.531 --> 02:13:47.640
fuck,
where's my bitcoins?
Yeah.
The uh,
but,
but here's the thing.

2387
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:49.350
After all of those,
you know,

2388
02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:53.700
there've been a number of quote unquote crashes and Bitcoin continues to

2389
02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:56.130
persevere,
continues to expand.
I mean,
it's it,

2390
02:13:56.230 --> 02:14:00.060
and ultimately it may not be bitcoin.
It may be another cryptocurrency.

2391
02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:02.880
And I mean,
the Doge coin is an amazing community.

2392
02:14:02.881 --> 02:14:06.440
They sponsored a NASCAR at Talladega.
Really?
Um,
they,

2393
02:14:06.450 --> 02:14:09.880
they got the Olympic or they got the Jamaican bobsled team.

2394
02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:14.120
The Olympics at Sochi.
True Story.
Really?
Yeah.
They did a big fundraiser.

2395
02:14:14.130 --> 02:14:15.830
Own crowd tilt raise like 30 grand.

2396
02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.430
Disney risen to the fucking Olympics.
How about you

2397
02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:26.370
cut them checks.
Jesus.
Tiffany [inaudible] come on.
Yeah,
they got it.
Boy,

2398
02:14:26.371 --> 02:14:28.860
that was like a big thing for a while.
Like everybody was like,

2399
02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:31.500
Megan filed the Jamaican bobsled team.
How hilarious it was.

2400
02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.420
Then it just lost its novelty.
So they're Doge quarterback,

2401
02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:39.990
a resurrection.
So you're more bullish on Doge coin than bitcoin.

2402
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:44.790
You know,
I'm,
no,
I'm,
I'm excited about cryptocurrency as a whole.

2403
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.720
I think bitcoin certainly come the farthest.
Um,
in terms of mainstream,

2404
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:49.170
like there's,

2405
02:14:49.170 --> 02:14:52.740
they're random subways in Pennsylvania taking dose coins for your $5 foot long.

2406
02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:54.360
Really.
But yeah,
but,

2407
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:59.390
but dozes is this satire that people are actually taking seriously?

2408
02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:03.390
Like it's,
it's like,
it's very clearly a joke that everyone's in on,

2409
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:06.810
but even that spirit,
lots of people are like,
yeah,
look,

2410
02:15:06.811 --> 02:15:09.600
it's taking the piss out of cryptocurrency and like that's kind of funny.

2411
02:15:09.630 --> 02:15:13.940
And its mascot as a she Beano and yeah,
why not?
Uh,
and it's,

2412
02:15:13.941 --> 02:15:18.941
it's bizarrely gotten momentum in part on the heels of this tipping system.

2413
02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:24.430
So like forever and a day people have pitched Mike Rowe tips,
um,

2414
02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:27.360
like decided like flatter was one.
There's another one called tip joy,

2415
02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:28.540
where it was like if you're a blogger,

2416
02:15:28.541 --> 02:15:31.650
you're a podcast or one of your users can come on and be like,
that was cool.

2417
02:15:31.651 --> 02:15:35.700
Here's 5 cents.
And,
and that was really the idea,
saw a lot of pitches for this.

2418
02:15:35.730 --> 02:15:37.950
None of them took off.
Uh,
for a variety reasons.

2419
02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:42.390
What doge coin has been able to do,
and it exists on Reddit,
it exists on Twitter,

2420
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:47.160
is developers have created these tip bots so that if you say something cool on

2421
02:15:47.161 --> 02:15:51.690
Reddit,
you just type in a comment with this particular syntax and it'll tell me,

2422
02:15:51.691 --> 02:15:54.450
oh look,
Joe Rogan just tip me 5,000 doge coins.

2423
02:15:54.451 --> 02:15:58.980
Now that's actually not a lot of USD,
but it feels like,
hey,
it's 5,000 things.

2424
02:15:58.981 --> 02:16:02.640
What is this?
Let me go collect it.
And like,
weirdly enough,

2425
02:16:02.670 --> 02:16:05.070
it has gotten a lot of momentum.
And so there's a,
there's,

2426
02:16:05.071 --> 02:16:08.500
there are Twitter bots where people are routinely tipping each other in Doge.

2427
02:16:08.650 --> 02:16:12.030
But that's a nice sentiment,
like the idea behind it,
but it's all,

2428
02:16:12.031 --> 02:16:14.670
and it's all this,
this farce of like to the moon,

2429
02:16:14.671 --> 02:16:18.740
which is the ultimate ambition of Doge coin people.
It,

2430
02:16:18.741 --> 02:16:22.740
it was originally a bitcoin thing that has really been embraced by the Doge coin

2431
02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:24.630
community.
Um,
and I met God.

2432
02:16:24.631 --> 02:16:27.540
I met people all over the country where you were at University of central

2433
02:16:27.541 --> 02:16:32.410
Florida and some students up on stage with a giant Doge coin.

2434
02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:35.500
It wasn't a check,
but like equivalent of what it looked like,

2435
02:16:35.501 --> 02:16:40.501
one to present to me because they really wanted me on board with a judge going,

2436
02:16:40.581 --> 02:16:44.890
I guess that makes me a Sheba.
She'd know.
Wow.
But a dark,

2437
02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:47.470
oh,
there he go.
See?
Oh Wow.

2438
02:16:47.471 --> 02:16:50.920
When the Doge coin community finds out about this Joe big deal,

2439
02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:55.590
it's going to be a huge deal.
He's half bull dog though.
He's a little guy.
Oh,

2440
02:16:55.930 --> 02:16:59.220
bull bull sheep.
What was your sister?
Oh,
I'm going to call him.

2441
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:04.230
<v 0>Nice dog.
He's a sweetie.
He's very friendly because don't have a photo.</v>

2442
02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:08.770
He's got arthritis of my dog.
No,
I don't put pictures of my dogs up online.

2443
02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:13.110
You're using Instagram all wrong man.
I got a photo of my cat like every 10.

2444
02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:16.620
It's good to move.
Why put your picture up drawing that's not going to get you.

2445
02:17:16.621 --> 02:17:20.720
Oh that,
that'll get you a few up votes to something.
I don't know.

2446
02:17:21.210 --> 02:17:24.390
Whatever it works,
whatever it gets.
Um,

2447
02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:29.420
would you look at the potential that places like reddit and these information

2448
02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:32.370
sort of a distribution networks have,

2449
02:17:32.730 --> 02:17:35.550
does it kind of freak you out that you're a part of that?
Like you're,

2450
02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:38.490
well you're a part of one of the biggest ones.
Like as far as

2451
02:17:38.610 --> 02:17:41.190
<v 3>it wakes me a little bit just cause I still think like,
I,</v>

2452
02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:44.200
I still think of it as a project.
My buddy and I just graduated from college.

2453
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:47.030
Like we were eating pizza.
How many employees do you read?

2454
02:17:47.410 --> 02:17:50.170
It's up to 40 I'm on the board now,

2455
02:17:50.171 --> 02:17:54.370
so I don't see your outside collect and fat checks.

2456
02:17:54.670 --> 02:17:55.660
It's not quite

2457
02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:58.040
<v 0>driving around,
grabbing your balls everywhere</v>

2458
02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:02.850
<v 3>is like you were a fly on my wall,
Joe.
I know how you think.</v>

2459
02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:04.260
I can tell guys like you,

2460
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:07.380
you got a certain look about you when them ball grabbing stuff.

2461
02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:11.900
<v 0>Myelin.
Do Dee just driving down the street?
It's like you're in my head man.</v>

2462
02:18:12.010 --> 02:18:15.140
Um,
does it,
does it feel weird to be a part of it?

2463
02:18:15.141 --> 02:18:17.120
Do you feel like an obligation?

2464
02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:19.430
<v 3>Um,
in any way?
I mean,</v>

2465
02:18:19.550 --> 02:18:23.990
I think the biggest obligation I felt was during,
uh,

2466
02:18:23.991 --> 02:18:27.830
it was two years ago.
The,
so these Sopa Pipa bills,
he's too awful bills.

2467
02:18:27.831 --> 02:18:30.650
We're going to break the Internet.
What got me at the time,

2468
02:18:30.651 --> 02:18:35.300
I was working on another startup called Hipmunk.
I travel search website and,

2469
02:18:35.330 --> 02:18:37.670
and then the Sopa Pipa thing happened and all my friends were like,

2470
02:18:37.730 --> 02:18:41.300
please explain to people who don't know what sober people,
um,

2471
02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:45.870
the stop online piracy act and the protect Ip act.
And the first is a house bill.

2472
02:18:45.871 --> 02:18:48.840
The second was a Senate bill.
Um,
uh,

2473
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:52.070
the entertainment industry basically spent almost a hundred million dollars

2474
02:18:52.071 --> 02:18:55.610
lobbying for these two bills to curb piracy.
That was the intent.

2475
02:18:56.060 --> 02:18:56.893
And that's what they said,

2476
02:18:56.900 --> 02:19:00.620
except the lobbyists who wrote these bills were the like it was,

2477
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:04.010
the bills were embarrassing in terms of how broad and overreach.

2478
02:19:04.011 --> 02:19:08.330
He was like a sledge hammer for what they said was a scalpel and it would have

2479
02:19:08.331 --> 02:19:09.290
really fucked up the Internet.

2480
02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:11.810
It would would've made reddit impossible for me and Steve to start.

2481
02:19:11.811 --> 02:19:16.811
It would have made all user generated content a particularly difficult to to

2482
02:19:17.331 --> 02:19:19.430
have.
Like it would've really,
really screwed things up.

2483
02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:24.460
And I got involved because everyone in DC who knew better than me about politics

2484
02:19:24.771 --> 02:19:27.440
said these two bills were inevitable and then was like,

2485
02:19:27.441 --> 02:19:29.090
well that's going to really screw things up.

2486
02:19:29.091 --> 02:19:34.091
So I borrowed a tie for my dad and I started going and lobbying and like meeting

2487
02:19:35.121 --> 02:19:37.700
with senators and representatives and telling them,
look,
I'm an entrepreneur.

2488
02:19:37.701 --> 02:19:42.560
I lived this amazing entrepreneurial life thanks to the open internet and if you

2489
02:19:42.561 --> 02:19:45.610
pass either these bills,
my story never would have happened.
And,

2490
02:19:45.670 --> 02:19:47.510
and so many others just like it never would have.

2491
02:19:47.511 --> 02:19:51.170
And you're really screwing up one of the most viable technologies we have.
And I,

2492
02:19:51.171 --> 02:19:51.771
long story short,

2493
02:19:51.771 --> 02:19:56.330
we won and I say we and I mean hundreds of thousands if not millions of people

2494
02:19:56.331 --> 02:19:59.630
who called in like melted the phone lines.
Um,

2495
02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:04.220
the webs like 3000 websites went dark on January 18th,

2496
02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:07.130
um,
protesting this and it was,
it was amazing.

2497
02:20:07.131 --> 02:20:09.980
I had never been a part of something like that that was so successful.

2498
02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:13.490
Those bills became toxic for anyone else.
All these senators,

2499
02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:17.720
representatives just ran away from them almost overnight and a,
and we won.

2500
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:20.690
Now we haven't totally one cause there's still lots of things that are hurting

2501
02:20:20.691 --> 02:20:23.410
the internet.
But um,
that's,
that's where I feel responsibility.

2502
02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:24.130
I feel responsible,

2503
02:20:24.130 --> 02:20:28.280
be responsible because I know how much this has benefited me and I get to see,

2504
02:20:28.281 --> 02:20:30.560
like I said,
I'm on the front lines as an investor these days,

2505
02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:33.410
I get to see the kids who were doing even cooler things.

2506
02:20:33.411 --> 02:20:37.370
We're going to be even bigger and better things and I don't want to lose that.

2507
02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:42.400
I don't want to miss out on so much innovation because we fuck it up because

2508
02:20:42.810 --> 02:20:45.440
it's partly in debt.
Like it's partly that I feel indebted,

2509
02:20:45.441 --> 02:20:47.150
but it's partly because I just want better stuff.

2510
02:20:47.151 --> 02:20:49.640
I want better music and I want better,
I want better politics,

2511
02:20:49.641 --> 02:20:52.400
I want better technology.
And the Internet is a gateway for that.

2512
02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:56.660
Do you think the Internet is safe?
Do you think it's passed through that?
No,

2513
02:20:56.690 --> 02:21:01.220
definitely not.
What could be done?
I mean,
how,
how,
how do you stop this tide?

2514
02:21:01.530 --> 02:21:05.200
All right.
So first and foremost,
um,
so net neutrality took a huge blow.
And,

2515
02:21:05.210 --> 02:21:09.920
and let me say this like I'm,
I'm fond of saying the world isn't flat.
Uh,
sorry,

2516
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:11.960
Tom Freeman.
But the worldwide web is,

2517
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:14.750
and what that means is I can start a website with my buddy.

2518
02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:17.420
We have no connections and we just have like an Internet connection and some

2519
02:21:17.421 --> 02:21:21.080
laptops and we can build something that nine years later we'll have more traffic

2520
02:21:21.081 --> 02:21:24.560
than the c New York Times or CNN.
And that works because all,

2521
02:21:24.561 --> 02:21:28.730
all bits are created equal.
You can get to my brand new website,
reddit.com,

2522
02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:29.593
you know,
nine years ago,

2523
02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:32.600
just as easily as New York times.com and you get to decide,

2524
02:21:32.601 --> 02:21:34.640
do I want to go to read it or do you want to go to New York Times?

2525
02:21:34.641 --> 02:21:39.410
It's just as easy to get to.
We're now in a position where cable companies,

2526
02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:41.930
because they basically,
I have,
um,
oligopolies,
right?

2527
02:21:41.931 --> 02:21:45.260
There's only a handful of them,
um,
want to break this.

2528
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:48.140
They don't want the Internet to be flat.
They want it to look like your cable.

2529
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:50.810
They want you to have a basic package,
right where you get,

2530
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:54.080
you get being searched for free because they've made a deal with Microsoft.

2531
02:21:54.081 --> 02:21:56.750
If you want Google,
it's an extra $10 a month,

2532
02:21:56.751 --> 02:21:59.450
but it's a really good search engine,
so you'll,
you'll pay for it,
right?

2533
02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:03.320
But then if you want,
if you want,
you know,
Joe sixpacks new search engine,

2534
02:22:03.321 --> 02:22:05.810
well that's,
that's gonna be an extra 50,
but you probably don't want that anyway.

2535
02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:08.450
And so now the entrepreneur,
the upstart,

2536
02:22:08.451 --> 02:22:12.050
the nobody's in the apartment have a much smaller percentage of the market

2537
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.800
because they're not part of the default Internet package anymore.
Right.

2538
02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:18.350
So trying to start your own cable company.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Yeah,
good luck.

2539
02:22:18.470 --> 02:22:21.950
And it rather than just getting a youtube channel and start the broadcast.

2540
02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:25.850
And so what used to be a flat internet will become hierarchical and will be
like,

2541
02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:28.320
you'll have that cable bill or you'll have that internet,

2542
02:22:28.321 --> 02:22:30.000
but looking just like your cable bill and,
and it's,

2543
02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:33.750
it breaks the foundation of what makes the Internet work.
All bits being equal.

2544
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:38.730
And we're at a point now where judges in the federal courts recently ruled it

2545
02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:42.580
pretty much were cable companies can have their way now.
And,

2546
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:46.410
and at this point in my,
but my buddy,
I'm at the verge now,
he's at vox,

2547
02:22:46.411 --> 02:22:51.340
but wrote an article called the Internet is fucked.
Uh,
and,
uh,

2548
02:22:51.370 --> 02:22:51.521
Neil,

2549
02:22:51.521 --> 02:22:55.200
I really nailed it with this and he basically had a nice little call to arms

2550
02:22:55.201 --> 02:22:59.820
that was like,
listen,
at this point,
call the FCC.
I know it seems ridiculous.
Um,

2551
02:22:59.910 --> 02:23:03.090
call the FCC and let them know they need to give this thing teeth because the

2552
02:23:03.091 --> 02:23:06.590
internet is a utility.
Like it is like electricity.
Uh,

2553
02:23:06.690 --> 02:23:09.540
it is the kind of thing where we all know we need it.

2554
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:13.710
We couldn't imagine a world without it and every one of us should have the same

2555
02:23:13.711 --> 02:23:16.710
open flat internet no matter what.
And,

2556
02:23:16.770 --> 02:23:19.830
and we're at an interesting time because there was a time in America when you

2557
02:23:19.831 --> 02:23:24.831
know kids and in New York we're playing by radios with electricity and kids in

2558
02:23:25.261 --> 02:23:29.790
the south.
We're still using candles like this.
We've seen this disparity before,

2559
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:32.640
but um,
we,
we,
we can change it.

2560
02:23:32.641 --> 02:23:34.980
We just have to make sure the Internet becomes a utility that we know.

2561
02:23:35.010 --> 02:23:39.030
The last thing we want is the internet only to be available in its fullest form

2562
02:23:39.031 --> 02:23:43.130
to people that pay for the premium subscription rate.
Shad since Sam oven.

2563
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:46.980
Oh yeah.
It is insanity.
And it's,
it's anti innovation.
I mean,

2564
02:23:47.250 --> 02:23:50.990
and anybody that would want that,
it's just trying to control innovation.

2565
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:54.480
That's absolutely,
you just try and control information.
Do you think,

2566
02:23:54.780 --> 02:23:59.250
is there a way to stop that?
At this point in time.
I mean,
I mean realistically,

2567
02:23:59.251 --> 02:24:02.700
seriously call the FCC,
you can read the article if you're not totally convinced,

2568
02:24:02.701 --> 02:24:06.920
he goes in,
I mean it's like 30 pages but worth reading.
Um,
but really that's,

2569
02:24:06.921 --> 02:24:08.390
that's a big part of it.
Another part of it is,

2570
02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:12.270
is frankly having representatives in office who understand and will fight for

2571
02:24:12.271 --> 02:24:14.890
our Internet rights and there aren't a lot of them there.

2572
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:19.230
Maybe like six or eight.
Now there's not a lot.
And um,

2573
02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:22.620
I mean we talked earlier about our uplifting discussion about the future of

2574
02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:25.890
politics and politicians,
but like that's,
that's where we're at right now.

2575
02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:29.280
Unfortunately.
That's what it comes down to.
And then you have to call the FCC.

2576
02:24:29.281 --> 02:24:33.090
That's the only way to sort of game and,
and call,
I mean having,
here's,

2577
02:24:33.091 --> 02:24:34.860
here's the other thing that I hope can come out of this,
right?

2578
02:24:35.550 --> 02:24:39.000
The first political thing I ever got involved with,
with Sopa Pipa.

2579
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:42.990
And that was a dangerous thing for a lot of us to get involved with because it

2580
02:24:42.991 --> 02:24:47.430
worked out so well.
Like we actually did the thing democracy was supposed to do,

2581
02:24:47.431 --> 02:24:51.780
which is let a bunch of informed citizens take action,
phone calls,
petitions,

2582
02:24:51.781 --> 02:24:52.591
letters,
all that stuff,

2583
02:24:52.591 --> 02:24:56.910
and change people's minds in the face of millions of dollars in lobbying.

2584
02:24:57.240 --> 02:24:59.640
And we did it.
And it was a,
it was a great high,

2585
02:25:00.090 --> 02:25:02.460
especially for like a first foray into politics.

2586
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:05.250
But the fact is there are many more of those fights that we need to keep

2587
02:25:05.251 --> 02:25:08.880
fighting.
And like,
I want,
I hope a more connected,

2588
02:25:08.881 --> 02:25:13.080
I hope a more connected citizen feels entitled to this kind of stuff.

2589
02:25:13.081 --> 02:25:15.720
I hope we feel entitled to more transparency from our government.

2590
02:25:15.721 --> 02:25:18.720
I hope we feel entitled to like,
like to pick on Kim.

2591
02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:21.870
Like we can look on Kim's in Instagram right now and see what she's having for

2592
02:25:21.871 --> 02:25:25.060
breakfast or what you had for,
and that's ridiculous.
That's absurd.

2593
02:25:25.061 --> 02:25:27.520
But it's accessible to millions of people right now.
24,
seven.

2594
02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:30.490
I want that same level of accountability for the people who represent me in

2595
02:25:30.491 --> 02:25:33.670
government for my government.
Uh,
and there's no reason why we can't get it.

2596
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.460
We just need to be asking for it.
Yeah.

2597
02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:39.760
But not necessarily the same their lines,
but yeah.

2598
02:25:39.770 --> 02:25:43.240
See important bills that they're working on and what's going on at any given

2599
02:25:43.241 --> 02:25:46.960
moment.
Probably having,
they should have 24 hour.
Camera's on them.
Fuck it.

2600
02:25:46.990 --> 02:25:51.670
Fuck it.
I'm gonna read your email image.
I can't edit.
You even get to read them.

2601
02:25:51.730 --> 02:25:55.750
They get to read ours,
so they're already ruined them.
It's only fox.
Um,

2602
02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:59.920
tell me about Aaron Schwartz.
Well,
wow.
Um,

2603
02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:04.660
so he was in the same round of y Combinator that Steve and I were,

2604
02:26:04.661 --> 02:26:09.370
he was working on a startup called Infogami.
Um,
we didn't talk a lot then,
um,

2605
02:26:09.490 --> 02:26:13.330
but maybe six months after,
um,
he,

2606
02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:14.940
his company pretty much folded his cofounder,

2607
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:19.150
went back to Denmark and Paul Graham who organized the y Combinator.
It was like,

2608
02:26:19.151 --> 02:26:22.900
Hey,
Steve,
Alexis,
you guys need more developers.
Why don't you work with Erin?

2609
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:27.040
And we acquired his company.
He moved in with us.

2610
02:26:27.370 --> 02:26:31.570
We worked together for a little bit.
Um,
we,
gosh,

2611
02:26:31.930 --> 02:26:35.650
not long thereafter got acquired.
Um,
once we got acquired,
it was clear.

2612
02:26:35.651 --> 02:26:37.900
Aaron was not,
not really that into it.

2613
02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:42.460
And he left and we stayed in touch for a little bit thereafter,

2614
02:26:42.461 --> 02:26:45.520
but not long.
Uh,
and then he got really into politics,

2615
02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:48.880
really started getting involved in a lot of that great work for the open

2616
02:26:48.881 --> 02:26:53.440
Internet.
Um,
we shared a lot of common friends and you know,

2617
02:26:53.770 --> 02:26:56.470
he,
he did some very,

2618
02:26:58.330 --> 02:27:01.900
he did some very unfairly punished things.

2619
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:04.900
Like he did the entire thing.

2620
02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:08.150
He a broken to a storeroom and MIT,
um,

2621
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:11.630
downloaded using MIT's credentials,
a bunch of these documents,
uh,

2622
02:27:11.650 --> 02:27:15.190
research papers.
But Jason,
we're like,
these are academic articles,

2623
02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:19.380
downloaded a bunch of them and um,
and put them online.
All right.

2624
02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:21.030
Well he didn't actually put them online.
Um,

2625
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:23.950
but he did download them and there was presumed intent,
but none of that.

2626
02:27:23.951 --> 02:27:26.080
That was all presumed.
And,
uh,

2627
02:27:26.081 --> 02:27:31.081
the state or the prosecutor there in Boston came down so incredibly and unjustly

2628
02:27:31.451 --> 02:27:34.300
hard on him.
Uh,
the charges they were levying,
I mean,
I,

2629
02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:37.480
I don't know much more than what probably most people have read a few of the

2630
02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:42.370
articles.
No.
Um,
but he was looking at some very,
very,
very long,

2631
02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:46.390
serious jail time for this.
Um,
it was one of those very clear,

2632
02:27:46.690 --> 02:27:50.050
the punishment did not fit the crime situations.

2633
02:27:50.051 --> 02:27:52.840
They wanted to make an example of him and,
um,

2634
02:27:52.930 --> 02:27:57.640
he very tragically took his own life.
Um,
rather than risk going to jail.

2635
02:27:57.641 --> 02:28:00.880
Was He prosecuted?
What does that like he,

2636
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:04.270
they'd go through and charge him and,
yeah.
I mean,

2637
02:28:04.271 --> 02:28:08.200
did he believe you get found guilty?
Oh,
no,
this is,

2638
02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:13.090
I don't know enough.
Okay.
I have stuff of it.
Um,
he was,
he was being investigated.

2639
02:28:13.091 --> 02:28:13.571
His friends,

2640
02:28:13.571 --> 02:28:18.430
his family were being subpoenaed and question what these papers that he put up,

2641
02:28:18.431 --> 02:28:21.810
were they available?
Could you get those?
Yes.
If

2642
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:24.710
<v 2>they weren't secret,
know what it is.
This is,</v>

2643
02:28:24.711 --> 02:28:26.730
this is one of those really unjust things.
Um,

2644
02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:29.300
there's a lot of research that's done,
like federal research for instance,

2645
02:28:29.301 --> 02:28:33.110
that's funded with our taxpayer dollars that ended up getting locked up in these

2646
02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:37.700
like,
um,
academic journals that you have to pay a subscription for.

2647
02:28:37.970 --> 02:28:41.870
So in this case,
MIT had paid the subscription for and it's a nontrivial amount.

2648
02:28:42.250 --> 02:28:44.600
And,
and he was able to,
anyone on the MIT network,

2649
02:28:44.601 --> 02:28:47.900
anyone at probably any major university network or anyone who wanted to pay

2650
02:28:47.901 --> 02:28:52.490
could view these research documents.
He argued that,

2651
02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:55.100
you know what this is,
this is content we paid for it.

2652
02:28:55.101 --> 02:28:57.140
This research was funded by our tax dollars.

2653
02:28:57.141 --> 02:28:59.780
Why should I have to pay a subscription to some random company who has the

2654
02:28:59.781 --> 02:29:01.340
monopoly on access to this content?

2655
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:06.430
And that is what that is what they charge them with.
Um,
and I mean,

2656
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:09.470
sorry.
Well that,
that is that those are the grounds on which he was charged.

2657
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:14.650
So it was a felony because he was breaking and entering into the system.

2658
02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:18.940
Uh,
I,
I mean I think certain,
but it,
sure.

2659
02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:23.760
That's what the argument is.
And then there was some really egregious,
ah,

2660
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:25.310
like there are,

2661
02:29:25.311 --> 02:29:30.311
there have been a handful of developers or hackers that have been sort of made

2662
02:29:30.591 --> 02:29:34.250
examples of by the government where you have these instances of doing things

2663
02:29:34.251 --> 02:29:35.930
that were not like,
right.
Like I said,

2664
02:29:35.931 --> 02:29:39.650
the severity of the punishment did not even come close to the actual crime,

2665
02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:44.000
especially in this instance where like I said,
this was not actually distributed.

2666
02:29:44.390 --> 02:29:47.630
He was just downloading them,
which again,
he could do within the network,

2667
02:29:47.631 --> 02:29:50.930
but it was technically breaking the,
I don't know,
the level of licensed,

2668
02:29:50.931 --> 02:29:54.540
I guess Jason or I guess.
Okay.
And one of these,

2669
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:58.400
not even like a random outside guy,
like he had access to those files.

2670
02:29:58.930 --> 02:30:00.490
I mean any university student did and,

2671
02:30:00.491 --> 02:30:02.930
and I think the most egregious we'll one of,
okay,

2672
02:30:02.931 --> 02:30:03.830
there are a lot of gauges things,

2673
02:30:03.831 --> 02:30:08.750
but the company Jay Store had actually settled up with him.

2674
02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:12.050
They had actually said,
you know what,
we understand like,
okay,
it's cool.

2675
02:30:12.051 --> 02:30:13.280
We don't want you to press charges.

2676
02:30:13.281 --> 02:30:16.950
So like they actually told the government don't press charges and,

2677
02:30:16.951 --> 02:30:19.020
and they continued.
And um,

2678
02:30:19.430 --> 02:30:23.660
so is that like a prosecutor that just wants to get a win?
Is that what that is?

2679
02:30:23.661 --> 02:30:27.460
That is,
that is what it looked like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,

2680
02:30:27.810 --> 02:30:29.090
just chilling.

2681
02:30:29.091 --> 02:30:32.840
And that takes us back to what we were talking about earlier about private

2682
02:30:32.841 --> 02:30:37.841
prisons and about people making sure that there's jobs for wardens and prison

2683
02:30:38.391 --> 02:30:43.391
guards and they're making sure that certain drug laws stay illegal or stay on

2684
02:30:44.091 --> 02:30:48.320
the books.
God,
yeah,
it's the same thing.
People profiting off of other folks.

2685
02:30:48.340 --> 02:30:52.100
And the idea of someone just wanting to win when they're a prosecutor,

2686
02:30:52.101 --> 02:30:55.040
just getting a case and wanting to close it and make an exam.

2687
02:30:55.041 --> 02:30:58.190
Then there's pressure on you to close that case.
And if you don't,

2688
02:30:58.220 --> 02:31:01.880
you set a precedent.
If the guy gets off then the precedent has been set.

2689
02:31:02.270 --> 02:31:07.040
So it becomes a competitive environment.
Yeah.
Mother fucker and some young guys,

2690
02:31:07.041 --> 02:31:11.570
life is on the line.
It's a,
and I,
and I understand,

2691
02:31:11.810 --> 02:31:13.100
I understand the role.

2692
02:31:13.101 --> 02:31:16.700
I mean like I understand the role of laws and understand the role of a justice

2693
02:31:16.701 --> 02:31:20.190
system and,
and when you see things like that seemed to fall,

2694
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:24.360
<v 3>that seem to go so far astray from the intense,
from the point of having a,</v>

2695
02:31:24.410 --> 02:31:25.950
it just the system is really important.

2696
02:31:26.370 --> 02:31:30.750
But to have it be so just fucked up like gun is,
um,
is,

2697
02:31:31.010 --> 02:31:31.920
is very,
very sad.

2698
02:31:32.490 --> 02:31:33.570
<v 0>Yeah.
It's um,</v>

2699
02:31:33.810 --> 02:31:38.810
it's another symptom of this mad mad civilization that we're a part of.

2700
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:42.420
Like the good things and the bad things.

2701
02:31:42.421 --> 02:31:46.500
They all to come together and law as it is and things.

2702
02:31:46.501 --> 02:31:51.501
He's really rigid ideas of what's legal and illegal with the punishment can and

2703
02:31:52.051 --> 02:31:55.410
can't be.
It's those things are so God damn archaic,

2704
02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:59.890
mandatory minimums.
Mandatory minimums are fucking archaic.
I mean,

2705
02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:04.230
it's one thing if it's violent crime,
I understand that entirely.

2706
02:32:04.231 --> 02:32:08.550
I understand when you're making a victim out of someone or you're stealing

2707
02:32:08.551 --> 02:32:10.650
things from them with violence,
I get that.

2708
02:32:11.010 --> 02:32:14.910
But something like this where the guys just,
it's information.
What's he doing?

2709
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:16.740
This information?
It's going to take down the government.
No,
no,
no.

2710
02:32:16.741 --> 02:32:18.480
He's going to let people learn.
Okay.

2711
02:32:18.481 --> 02:32:22.290
Hold the fuck up because someone in the room stand up.
Yeah.
Like,
hey guys,

2712
02:32:22.350 --> 02:32:26.010
you want to put this guy in a cage and you got a super genius who has some

2713
02:32:26.011 --> 02:32:29.340
incredibly strong morals and ethics when it comes to information.

2714
02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:30.990
And to him he feels,

2715
02:32:30.991 --> 02:32:33.180
I know you got a guy who's at the cutting edge of technology,

2716
02:32:33.181 --> 02:32:35.190
one of the guys who helped invent RSS feeds.

2717
02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:39.210
He's at the cutting edge of the distribution of information and he finds this to

2718
02:32:39.211 --> 02:32:42.960
be a toxic flaw in the system.
He wants it,
whether he's right or wrong,

2719
02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:44.820
you don't have to put them in a fucking cage.

2720
02:32:44.850 --> 02:32:48.810
Like this is the idea that this is the right thing to do.
It's just,

2721
02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:53.910
it's shocking.
It's like,
it's like inquisition style.
Shocking.

2722
02:32:53.911 --> 02:32:58.080
It's like the same thing is any of the other ridiculous,

2723
02:32:58.081 --> 02:33:02.010
archaic things that we don't do anymore.
Yeah.
Fuck man.

2724
02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:05.550
<v 3>And hopefully,
hopefully we can learn from this.
I know,
you know,
I hope so.</v>

2725
02:33:05.710 --> 02:33:10.290
Erin's law.
Uh,
was it bill?
I don't know.
I don't know where it got in the house.

2726
02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:14.130
Um,
but I hope,
I mean this is look right like the,
the,

2727
02:33:14.131 --> 02:33:17.240
the thing that gives me hope is that this system is,
is uh,

2728
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:20.850
like it's like code and that you can,
you can update it.

2729
02:33:20.851 --> 02:33:23.550
You can do a source for video.
Like you can,
you can update this,
right?

2730
02:33:23.551 --> 02:33:25.260
We can make amendments,
we can change things.

2731
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:29.550
We find that they are wrong and Erin's law is a way to hopefully do that.

2732
02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:32.010
But you've got to get a bunch of people who don't understand the Internet to

2733
02:33:32.011 --> 02:33:32.780
agree on stuff.

2734
02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:33.950
<v 0>It's incredibly ironic.</v>

2735
02:33:33.951 --> 02:33:38.300
His solution is reddit have court cases decided through reddit.
Whoa.

2736
02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:43.100
It's the perfect,
no does not.
Well because the alternative is,
whoa.

2737
02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:47.120
The fact that we're using this archaic system of a judge fucking has a mallet

2738
02:33:47.330 --> 02:33:51.140
and slams it on a piece of wood.
What are you doing asshole?
You've got a mallet.

2739
02:33:51.141 --> 02:33:52.490
Get the fuck Outta here with you.

2740
02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:55.310
Why don't you have a a fucking bow and Arrow too,

2741
02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:58.970
and shooting a flaming Arrow through the sky to let us know that the games would

2742
02:33:58.971 --> 02:34:03.971
be gone and the guy next to you as a conch shell off and put your powdered wigs

2743
02:34:04.101 --> 02:34:07.340
on.
You fucking assholes.
Get the fuck out of here with a mallet.

2744
02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:11.100
You can't keep using a mallet.
Stupid Bank Bank Bank.

2745
02:34:11.101 --> 02:34:16.010
Get the fuck Outta here with that stupid archaic nonsense.
Red.
It's the answer.

2746
02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:21.320
No judges get 'em out of reddit.
Subreddits,
subreddits,

2747
02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:25.690
subreddits,
subreddits,
agriculture.
Should we be able to grow hemp?
Shh.
Yes.
Boom.

2748
02:34:25.691 --> 02:34:30.220
We're done.
We're done here.
That went up on to the next one.
Okay.

2749
02:34:30.221 --> 02:34:33.700
Should this guy go to jail because he distributes information that it was freely

2750
02:34:33.701 --> 02:34:38.430
available to college students?
No.
Okay,
we're good.
Let them out.
What's next?

2751
02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:41.660
<v 4>You would run into the problem if there would be somebody that had like a</v>

2752
02:34:41.661 --> 02:34:44.780
stutter or something like that,
or if that joke turned on them,

2753
02:34:44.781 --> 02:34:47.390
then everyone would vote just because of the wrong reason.

2754
02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:52.250
You know how the Internet is what meaning like what if there was somebody that

2755
02:34:52.330 --> 02:34:57.330
came when I had a court case and they were being voted on Reddit and the guy had

2756
02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:00.620
you know,
maybe had a stutter or talked like he was gay or something like that.

2757
02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:04.530
How that could turn and unfairly vote for the wrong reason on the Internet.

2758
02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:07.180
<v 0>I did see that's where the vote up and vote downs come into play.</v>

2759
02:35:09.430 --> 02:35:10.990
I am.
I'm going to be the first to say,

2760
02:35:10.991 --> 02:35:14.280
I am not proposing we throw out our justice system in favor.
I am.

2761
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:16.360
I'll be the first Sam.
All right.

2762
02:35:16.390 --> 02:35:18.140
I'll throw out the justice system and favorite reddit.

2763
02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:20.170
I think it's a better idea.
I think,
look,

2764
02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:22.600
there's certainly should it be experts in all areas,

2765
02:35:22.601 --> 02:35:25.040
whether it's experts on the environment and

2766
02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:28.120
uninfluenced experts,

2767
02:35:28.121 --> 02:35:31.540
experts that have no tie to the political machine experts who have no

2768
02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:33.220
aspirations.
Not only that,

2769
02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:38.320
preclude them from having any sort of off and any sort of position of power or

2770
02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:42.400
any sort of gigantic job inside a corporation,
like what we're seeing.

2771
02:35:42.401 --> 02:35:46.780
Did you see the movie inside job?
Do you ever see that?
Wait,
I feel like I did.

2772
02:35:46.810 --> 02:35:51.550
It was on the financial crisis.
Fascinating documentary.
No,
no really good stuff.

2773
02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:54.580
Let me pull it up.
Yeah,
you,
you want to watch it.

2774
02:35:54.581 --> 02:35:57.670
But one of the interesting things about it was how they highlighted how these

2775
02:35:57.671 --> 02:36:00.850
people that made economic policy,
these professors,

2776
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:05.350
they recommended these positions that,
you know,
we apply to our economy.

2777
02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:09.940
Then they would go on and get these huge jobs afterwards and make fucking

2778
02:36:09.941 --> 02:36:13.360
millions of dollars and interesting coincidence.
Oh,
it's so gross.

2779
02:36:13.361 --> 02:36:17.890
It's one of the grossest things ever.
It's a really good documentaries from 2010.

2780
02:36:18.130 --> 02:36:22.570
Uh,
and uh,
it's by a guy named Charles Ferguson.
And what's interesting is this,

2781
02:36:22.690 --> 02:36:24.190
Charles Ferguson guy is,

2782
02:36:24.191 --> 02:36:28.670
I believe he's the guy that's doing all of all of the,
uh,

2783
02:36:28.671 --> 02:36:32.230
the questions.
Um,
I shouldn't say that cause I'm not really sure,

2784
02:36:32.231 --> 02:36:34.660
but whoever the guy is that the narrator,

2785
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:37.690
you don't see him always questioning people,
boys questioning people.

2786
02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:41.770
He's so knowledgeable about how the system actually works,
that he catches these,

2787
02:36:42.130 --> 02:36:45.200
these like mathematicians and these economic textbook.

2788
02:36:45.210 --> 02:36:46.600
It's being really arrogant.

2789
02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:50.980
And then he faces the them with the truth and you see them scramble and start to

2790
02:36:50.981 --> 02:36:53.500
sweat.
And God,
I should've never agreed to this interview.

2791
02:36:53.501 --> 02:36:56.710
Like you see them realize you're Google what you're going to do with this and

2792
02:36:56.890 --> 02:37:01.690
you see them like fall apart and panic and they fall into this like really sort

2793
02:37:01.691 --> 02:37:06.550
of a aggressive state.
It's,
it's quite fascinating job.
It's really good.

2794
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:11.380
And it just shows you like that.
It's,
it's a mess.
Read it up,
fix it.

2795
02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:15.930
Vote up,
vote down problems.
And I think we aren't dude.
We're selling

2796
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:18.050
<v 5>private about it.
I feel good about this conversation.</v>

2797
02:37:18.350 --> 02:37:21.320
I think we should end here before it gets bad as long as uh,

2798
02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:25.460
as long as we just remember.
Uh,
there's going to be a mascot,
right?

2799
02:37:25.461 --> 02:37:28.850
We're going to keep the,
the red at alien gone.
I liked it.
That's a great mascot.

2800
02:37:28.851 --> 02:37:32.090
It's cute.
Yes.
Sweet.
Doesn't it mean,
have you ever thought about,

2801
02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:35.960
this is probably what happened to dig in a couple other similar sites,

2802
02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:39.200
just redesigning the whole thing.
It's all up.

2803
02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:45.260
You don't want to fuck everything.
But what if it was just an option?

2804
02:37:45.261 --> 02:37:48.290
Almost like,
like you can go into your settings and go,
oh,
new,

2805
02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:51.090
I'll take your modern.
No.
Have you ever thought about it?

2806
02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:55.320
We've definitely thought about modernizing it.
Um,
part of it's just the nurture.

2807
02:37:55.810 --> 02:37:58.280
Like you're,
you're dealing with growth all the time.

2808
02:37:58.281 --> 02:37:59.660
You're dealing with all this other stuff.
It's like,
Oh,

2809
02:37:59.661 --> 02:38:01.980
do we want to rethink how the front page looks like?

2810
02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:05.120
There have been small improvements.
We just added trending subreddits,

2811
02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:08.440
which are pretty damn cool.
Um,
to try to help people realize that,

2812
02:38:08.470 --> 02:38:11.060
that there are these thousands of different communities they should dive into.

2813
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:14.210
Um,
I,
but I wouldn't expect any big changes.
I mean,

2814
02:38:14.211 --> 02:38:17.980
for the reasons we were just joking about it.
Like if it's not broke,
you know,

2815
02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:21.650
I mean,
it's a content distribution network.
Me,
your,
your,
your face,

2816
02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:25.580
you're essentially,
you're allowing people to like really cleanly,

2817
02:38:25.581 --> 02:38:30.440
easily find something they're interested in text form and then go there the best

2818
02:38:30.441 --> 02:38:32.290
way.
Make it light,
keep it light and help me look.

2819
02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:37.010
It's not like there was some minimal vision.
Like when we graduated from college,

2820
02:38:37.011 --> 02:38:39.470
Steven,
I just sucked at html and CSS,

2821
02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:42.710
like this was the first real web app we'd ever made.

2822
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:46.220
We made websites but never like a fully featured web app.
And uh,

2823
02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:48.350
we just weren't very good.
So like,
that's cool.

2824
02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:51.680
That was my fault that that shitty font we use.
Vedana that's,
it was like,
oh,

2825
02:38:51.681 --> 02:38:56.270
this would be a great spot by the domain.
Where you the first yes sir.

2826
02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.680
What was it originally purchased for?
Oh,
it was,
it was unreal.
It was unused nine,

2827
02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:04.500
nine 93 minutes.
Oh,
I was,
I was in the library,

2828
02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:07.910
Eva Alderman Library,
while who,
uh,
and uh,

2829
02:39:08.060 --> 02:39:11.510
and I was trying to come up with something that involves the word read and I was

2830
02:39:11.511 --> 02:39:12.760
like,
Reddit,

2831
02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:16.870
like I read it on Reddit and then I tried different ways of spelling it and red

2832
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:20.530
d it works cause no one had it.
And I also registered Red Itt.

2833
02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:22.340
But then I asked my friend Melissa,
I was like,

2834
02:39:22.341 --> 02:39:25.340
which one of these makes more sense for a bastardization of read it?

2835
02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:28.820
And she was like,
I'll go with the two ds idiot.
And I was like,
that's great man.

2836
02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:30.290
Well listen eats,

2837
02:39:30.291 --> 02:39:34.670
it's what you guys did was nothing short of a cultural revolution I think in my

2838
02:39:34.671 --> 02:39:36.200
opinion.
I think it's,

2839
02:39:36.220 --> 02:39:41.220
it's one of the key components today online as far as like the uh,

2840
02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:46.700
I can asset to distribute information to spread cool shit and to let people,

2841
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.650
you know,

2842
02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:52.130
have like intelligent discussions about it and it really rational way of

2843
02:39:52.131 --> 02:39:56.540
filtering out the fuck heads.
You know?
It's pretty genius stuff man.
Well,

2844
02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:58.370
uh,
thank you.
You're here.
I am.

2845
02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:02.840
I am happy we could do it because I'll tell you man,
it,
it,
it was just,

2846
02:40:02.841 --> 02:40:04.910
we were just trying to live like college students for as long as we could.

2847
02:40:05.210 --> 02:40:08.180
Your book is without their permission.
Is it available in audio?

2848
02:40:08.181 --> 02:40:11.060
Did you do an audio version of it and did the jungle,
did you get to talk?

2849
02:40:11.061 --> 02:40:14.100
It was great.
Yeah,
I they did.
Oh,
they encourage you to

2850
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:16.530
<v 0>fall.
Oh,
that's so good.
It was for the Bain impression.</v>

2851
02:40:16.531 --> 02:40:18.990
What's the thing you like to do on pain?
Impression?
What's your pain impression?

2852
02:40:19.290 --> 02:40:23.800
I mean,
it doesn't Mater Watch you.

2853
02:40:23.810 --> 02:40:28.740
And think of my bedroom pressure.
No,
I know.

2854
02:40:28.741 --> 02:40:31.740
Impression humor is like the lowest form of humor.
The lowest form.

2855
02:40:32.050 --> 02:40:35.160
I don't believe in that,
man.
I think you got an impression.
It's hilarious.

2856
02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:39.300
Hilarious.
People are so pretentious when it comes to that.
We had a laugh track.

2857
02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:43.310
Nope.
We already had a lab track.
He was laughing.
That's the lap traffic.
Okay,

2858
02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:47.960
so without their permission and a audible.com you have the audio version,

2859
02:40:47.961 --> 02:40:52.890
the real version.
We Amazon sell it everywhere you book dead trees,

2860
02:40:52.891 --> 02:40:53.724
everything.

2861
02:40:54.570 --> 02:40:59.570
And how would your grandfather say it on Alexis Ohanian and props for keeping

2862
02:41:00.151 --> 02:41:04.110
the name Alexis because she,
yeah.
Fuck the haters.
Oh yeah.
