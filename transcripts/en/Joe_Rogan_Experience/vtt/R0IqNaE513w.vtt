00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Speaker 1>How long is it gonna take me to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lax and what time should I be there?</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>If you leave at two you have no problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

4
00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Call me if you leave it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind to the coast in are we live,</v>

5
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure out la traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liz Gentlemen,</v>

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you got to plan for that shit to do man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a natural disaster in many ways</v>

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>they're very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I moved to Colorado for just a few</v>

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>months and then came back here was</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous,</v>

9
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>like the recognition of what effect it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has on me.</v>

10
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>You know like every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people you drive and</v>

11
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go somewhere where there's very</v>

12
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>few people you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

13
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>a real feeling of relaxation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's legitimate.</v>

14
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

15
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like if you could buy that</v>

16
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

17
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking this gum.</v>

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>It puts you in like a small town feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like woodsy,</v>

19
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Colorado feel going through evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

20
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>You can buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to get out of out of</v>

21
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

22
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was just thinking if you had a</v>

23
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pill,</v>

24
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>it did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a really expensive pill or a</v>

25
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>patch or some gum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like nicotine gum,</v>

26
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.003
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

27
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peace and quiet.</v>

28
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Gum Transports you to the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much would people pay for that?</v>

29
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like think about the people that buy</v>

30
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Xanax and shit and just anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take a little bit of the edge off</v>

31
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>just to take this edge off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

32
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.843
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I would probably just buy it and smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

34
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's smoked the shit out.</v>

35
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then would you be happy like living</v>

36
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>in downtown La and some graffiti coming?</v>

37
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Building horns go off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the weather here.</v>

38
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why I have to come out</v>

39
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>for work or anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never mind because every day is</v>

40
00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've been here for like four days and</v>

41
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>it's raining most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's my luck.</v>

42
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>But a la traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just basically,</v>

43
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I think you just sort of accept that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to live in your car,</v>

44
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be in your car,</v>

45
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>lock your reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course everybody has a nice cars.</v>

46
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody drives nice cars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

47
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>It's also because we were all really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really shallow.</v>

48
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to show everybody like,</v>

49
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 1>look what I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

50
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that.</v>

51
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I liked cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I you too.</v>

52
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about your song.</v>

53
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>When I drive my bronco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got an,</v>

54
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you got to really Nice Bronco.</v>

55
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I unfortunately no longer have a bronco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a bronco in your life,</v>

56
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>but then I'd have a second car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me five years just to buy my</v>

58
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>first car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

59
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the minimalist type</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

60
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't want to admit they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

61
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.981
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

62
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I got no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably admitting that.</v>

63
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I look like I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's from living out of a bag</v>

65
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>most of my adult life and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

66
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one guitar for the first two or</v>

67
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the road one day you wake up</v>

68
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>and you have five guitars now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a thing where you don't</v>

69
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>really need all these guitars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I only need that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe two guitars is good.</v>

71
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>So if I feel like guitar makers who must</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get you a guitar,</v>

72
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

73
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Does that happen with musicians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I got one Martin made for me</v>

74
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a honor obviously.</v>

75
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.431
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>The old really old historic legacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

77
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then yeah,</v>

78
00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>he buddies build them and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

79
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I've always made my own at apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least telecasters and stuff.</v>

80
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>You can buy parts and assemble them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>just as good as anything coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what like a custom shop might be</v>

82
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.600
<v Speaker 1>for a fraction of the cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

83
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>That I didn't know that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even build an instrument that</v>

84
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.000
<v Speaker 1>more comfortable to play because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>building to the exact specifics that may</v>

86
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>be somebody doesn't mass manufactured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess if you know guitars as well</v>

87
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>as you know them and you've been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>them your whole life,</v>

88
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:39.920
<v Speaker 1>that totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

89
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.540
<v Speaker 1>It's wood in parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Telecasters basically this table bolted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a baseball bat cut in half.</v>

91
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to fuck that up.</v>

92
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>The rest of it's just the electronics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the pickups have a lot in anything</v>

93
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>outside of that's just your fingers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's actually holding the thing.</v>

94
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>But like to build one is not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

95
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Les Paul or a Martin Acoustic Guitar</v>

96
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's literally like a hand shaped,</v>

97
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of work that has to be made from</v>

98
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>start to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>

99
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guitars I'm talking about building,</v>

100
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you're just assembling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like parts that are widely</v>

101
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 1>accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy that's a classical</v>

102
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>guitarist.</v>

103
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always had his nails grow long.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.140
<v Speaker 1>to tape over his fingernails like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did Jujitsu cause he had claw called</v>

108

<v Speaker 1>Like that's what he did.</v>

112
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Like he did everything he did with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's amazing at it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>would do like people would hire him to</v>

118
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>do like parties and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a,</v>

119
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>it's an art form that for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason I don't think gets the kind of</v>

120
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>respect that it deserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No flamenco and classical guitar</v>

121
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:03.641
<v Speaker 1>players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

122
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>that's someone as highly complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>musicianship.</v>

123
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.130

<v Speaker 1>like guitars,</v>

124
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>like how they were constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing to me that there is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

127
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.550

<v Speaker 1>I was at 155 pounds and he was fighting</v>

128
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:30.120

<v Speaker 2>competing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He competed a really high level</v>

145
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:12.730
<v Speaker 2>nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fondant to the one he puts like a</v>

<v Speaker 2>guitarist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

152
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know him?</v>

153
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.920
<v Speaker 2>We used to do taekwondo together when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were kids,</v>

154
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 2>we started out together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

155
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a year younger than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think I was like 15 or 16 when we</v>

156
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 2>met and he was like 14 was he like eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a day sitting homeless guitar?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like all this discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

158
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.330

<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

159
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.483
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

160
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.490
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody that that plays music</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it really gets into it that heavily.</v>

161
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.320
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a,</v>

162
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.120
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an ocd that you have to have a</v>

163
00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:07.500
<v Speaker 4>level of spectrum or to sit and just do</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing over and over</v>

164
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:08.370
<v Speaker 4>repetitively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>

165
00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:11.310
<v Speaker 4>10 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially in as a kid when you're</v>

166
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:13.260
<v Speaker 4>really learning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like when he gets you and you hook</v>

167
00:07:13.261 --> 00:07:14.530
<v Speaker 4>into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you just did this.</v>

168
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:17.460
<v Speaker 4>The other thing that nobody else can be</v>
<v Speaker 4>a part of it.</v>

169
00:07:17.461 --> 00:07:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

170
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.100
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it as an outsider,</v>

171
00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:24.700
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can do some thing and once</v>

172
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:27.310
<v Speaker 2>you start doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must feel amazing to be doing it</v>

173
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:28.230
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

174
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

175
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

176
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I played soccer and stuff when I</v>

177
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 4>was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was always like,</v>

178
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 4>I've never was one of those guys that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the team thing.</v>

179
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was just like introverted and did</v>

180
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 4>and so when I found really found guitar</v>
<v Speaker 4>and got into it as like,</v>

181
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something I can,</v>

182
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.270
<v Speaker 4>it's not a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

183
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

184
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 4>other than what you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're pushing yourself to learn,</v>

185
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.350
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

186
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>

187
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to rely on other people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities or,</v>

188
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what bands are for.</v>

189
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.520

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.900
<v Speaker 4>We're out there doing what we love to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

236
00:09:40.901 --> 00:09:45.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's all the in between and the beat</v>
<v Speaker 4>down your body takes and being out of</v>

237
00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:47.440
<v Speaker 4>any kind of routine and away from your</v>
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>

238
00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:49.570
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the really the thing that you</v>

239
00:09:49.571 --> 00:09:51.670
<v Speaker 4>come off for like four or five weeks</v>
<v Speaker 4>straight or that,</v>

240
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.041
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

241
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:56.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pretty healthy 39 year old dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it takes me four or five days just</v>

242
00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:59.680
<v Speaker 4>to get off the fucking couch after a</v>
<v Speaker 4>month long run.</v>

243
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.140
<v Speaker 4>And my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she finally started to understand like</v>

244
00:10:02.141 --> 00:10:02.974
<v Speaker 4>it's cause you're</v>

245
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.230
<v Speaker 2>the travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

246
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a different kind of exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really articulate.</v>

247
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the sleeping cause usually</v>

248
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get out if you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day to,</v>

249
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:16.100
<v Speaker 2>are you busting it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you flying around buses?</v>

250
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless it's like</v>

251
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 4>the logistics is just crazy but you</v>
<v Speaker 4>still got to be there so you might bust</v>

252
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Speaker 4>part of it and then one night you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>flying everybody or,</v>

253
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.780
<v Speaker 4>or a red light red hour the next morning</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do that thing and then get back to</v>

254
00:10:28.781 --> 00:10:30.220
<v Speaker 4>the bus or meet up with the bus.</v>

255
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 2>What helps me is cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like uh,</v>

256
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.930
<v Speaker 2>when uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I go to a place,</v>

257
00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:36.340
<v Speaker 2>if I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>

258
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I feel like shove like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking tired.</v>

259
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.490
<v Speaker 2>But if I could just force myself to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the gym and just do like 45 minutes</v>

260
00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:44.770
<v Speaker 2>on an elliptical machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that 45 minutes out of the day.</v>

261
00:10:44.771 --> 00:10:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm doing,</v>

262
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing else.</v>

263
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Put the headphones on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to a podcast listener and just</v>

264
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:54.910
<v Speaker 2>get that cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm good,</v>

265
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.800
<v Speaker 2>then I'm straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everything levels out.</v>

266
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.950
<v Speaker 2>But if I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't do that every couple of days,</v>

267
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.080
<v Speaker 2>at least I just feel worn out.</v>

268
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also an endorphin</v>
<v Speaker 4>imbalance.</v>

269
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

270
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.880
<v Speaker 4>my buddy bobby that plays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be,</v>

271
00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:11.560
<v Speaker 4>but he works out like a madman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like it's kind of insane.</v>

272
00:11:11.561 --> 00:11:12.840
<v Speaker 4>You guys would get along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

273
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.430
<v Speaker 4>and I think a lot of those to balance</v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

274
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just energy cause every night you go out</v>

275
00:11:18.821 --> 00:11:21.640
<v Speaker 4>and do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get two hours of cardio right on</v>

276
00:11:21.641 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 4>stage and just massive adrenaline blast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when it really locks in and</v>

277
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:28.840
<v Speaker 4>there's all this energy just slamming</v>
<v Speaker 4>you in the face and then you walk off</v>

278
00:11:28.841 --> 00:11:32.860
<v Speaker 4>stage and it takes like four or five</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours to come down from that every</v>

279
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.490
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

280
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.570
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

281
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:39.040
<v Speaker 4>in the next day now your shit has to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>off balance naturally.</v>

282
00:11:39.041 --> 00:11:41.080
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like you just had this massive</v>

283
00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:44.590
<v Speaker 4>blast of all these chemicals that your</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain's pumping out endorphins.</v>

284
00:11:44.591 --> 00:11:47.290
<v Speaker 4>And now the next day you're just like</v>
<v Speaker 4>waking up trying to figure out where to</v>

285
00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:51.520
<v Speaker 4>take a shit and get a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is there a shower today</v>

286
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 4>and he gets</v>

287
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>weird when you do a bunch of them in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>

288
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how often do you wake up and stare</v>

289
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 1>at the ceiling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly remembering what town you're</v>

290
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

291
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.820
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

292
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.200
<v Speaker 1>that never happens because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

293
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm always staying a week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the adventure,</v>

294
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>the journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

295
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:09.994
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

296
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I do wake up sometimes and just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

297
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 1>honestly it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bitter sweet because the longer</v>

298
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you're out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're playing in,</v>

299
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the better the music gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

300
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the last show you,</v>

301
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 1>there's always this really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

302
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm exhausted.</v>

303
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I really want to go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't believe this.</v>

304
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>We got to take a break now because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything just got super greasy,</v>

305
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

306
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different every night.</v>

307
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 1>But you just the chemistry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and you lock in and you just</v>

308
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 1>kind of getting that head.</v>

309
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine that it's a,</v>

310
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:43.140
<v Speaker 1>comedy is very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar.</v>

311
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're doing like a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch.</v>

312
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I only did it once with Charlie Murphy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and John Heffron.</v>

313
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.970
<v Speaker 1>We did this whole tour together is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only time I've done like 30 days where I</v>

314
00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:56.080
<v Speaker 1>did like 22 dates where it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly out.</v>

315
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I was only home for a day or two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then went back out again.</v>

316
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 1>But you get group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get in that groove,</v>

317
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 1>you just get lawyer where you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed.</v>

318
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you feel it,</v>

319
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.700
<v Speaker 1>you get on this nonexistent Clark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

320
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:10.543
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

321
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a routine of new routine is how I'd</v>

322
00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:14.980
<v Speaker 1>describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every day is the same but completely</v>

323
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

324
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind that man.</v>

325
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of times it feels like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>just back in the navy because we still</v>

326
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>asleep in bunks on the bus.</v>

327
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

328
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 1>we'd go out to sea for like 90 days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and that was,</v>

329
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Speaker 1>that's probably way better for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically when you go onstage than</v>

330
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're staying in some giant suite</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're walking around the suite and</v>

331
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:37.570
<v Speaker 1>they get on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do the hotel rooms,</v>

332
00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:38.231
<v Speaker 1>ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

333
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when he started out and you</v>

334
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>meet all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start going on,</v>

335
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.920
<v Speaker 1>you play like festivals or shows with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your heroes and they're on buses before</v>

336
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:48.660
<v Speaker 1>you are and you go on and you talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys and then you realize like</v>

337
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 1>they live in this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're institutionalized in the back of</v>

338
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:53.080
<v Speaker 1>this bus and they never get off the bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

339
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it happens to you and you</v>

340
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:59.800
<v Speaker 1>realize that that's like this little</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe space,</v>

341
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 1>like a hotel room overnight for me.</v>

342
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go crazy waiting for a show.</v>

343
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:06.370
<v Speaker 1>You're like caged up in this little box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 1>with cable TV and nobody to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got soured on buses when they</v>

345
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:14.200
<v Speaker 1>pulled over willy and arrested him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed on his bus,</v>

346
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess should have been demoted man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

347
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.730
<v Speaker 1>for sure we got Willie on a pot shard as</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you sherlock.</v>

348
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.010
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever you are does things.</v>

349
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:26.440
<v Speaker 1>You just gotta let slide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was in Texas too,</v>

350
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:27.274
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

351
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Texas doesn't play when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed,</v>

352
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really silly.</v>

353
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 1>If it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would change Texas.</v>

354
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.910
<v Speaker 1>It would make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like could relax some of those fucking</v>

355
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>cowboys settled down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why you saying it shouldn't be legal</v>

356
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:43.000
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

357
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.920
<v Speaker 1>The fact that that's still an argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2018 you know,</v>

358
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.220
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a funny one,</v>

359
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the most recent arguments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read,</v>

360
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>was it pedestrians walking</v>

361
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 2>out into traffic because of legal weed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dying.</v>

362
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 2>So like there's been an uptick</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

363
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't laugh at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's rude.</v>

364
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 2>It could be me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

365
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 2>It could be me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I laughing?</v>

366
00:15:04.661 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Almost me this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an asshole.</v>

367
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize,</v>

368
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea that a,</v>

369
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 2>there's an uptick in people just walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in the cars getting hit by cars</v>

370
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 2>cause they're just spacing out cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're high.</v>

371
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I think it should be legal just because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm from Kentucky and if they gave all</v>

372
00:15:22.711 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 4>those farmers and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

373
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>x coal industry employees and an</v>

374
00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:31.830
<v Speaker 4>industry that would really thrive since</v>
<v Speaker 4>it grows extremely well and Kentucky,</v>

375
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

376
00:15:33.361 --> 00:15:36.210
<v Speaker 4>instead of soybeans and tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those guys could actually generate an</v>

377
00:15:36.211 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 4>income.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think is holding it?</v>

378
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.040
<v Speaker 4>The family community politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually that's not true.</v>

379
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Mitch Mcconnell or if they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or somebody somewhere like really</v>

380
00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:47.160
<v Speaker 4>staunch right wing guy in Kentucky came</v>
<v Speaker 4>out and was even pushing for legislation</v>

381
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.500
<v Speaker 4>towards at least the hemp industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would be incredible.</v>

382
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hampton,</v>

383
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:53.190
<v Speaker 2>this tree is a no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can look at the tax numbers</v>

384
00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:55.200
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

385
00:15:55.201 --> 00:15:58.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we buy him for on it and for the longest</v>

386
00:15:58.231 --> 00:16:02.400
<v Speaker 2>time we'd had to buy it in Canada</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you couldn't get it in the</v>

387
00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:05.280
<v Speaker 2>United States because until recently it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't legal to grow.</v>

388
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.030
<v Speaker 2>And so to get like the best stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the highest protein content,</v>

389
00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:10.590
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to fucking ship it in from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

390
00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:13.770
<v Speaker 2>You can't even grow it here now you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

391
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

392
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.210
<v Speaker 2>what did we start on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that long ago,</v>

393
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.980
<v Speaker 2>wants to like seven years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

394
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.030
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like one of the first things</v>

395
00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:24.870
<v Speaker 2>that we did is a make a really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>help,</v>

396
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.020
<v Speaker 2>a hemp protein powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we were looking into it like I</v>

397
00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:30.180
<v Speaker 2>can't even believe that you can't grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

398
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't do anything to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

399
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't affect you at all because</v>

400
00:16:35.221 --> 00:16:37.380
<v Speaker 2>it's related to pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal.</v>

401
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.330
<v Speaker 2>The national hemp</v>

402
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 4>museum is in Versailles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kentucky isn't really where I graduated</v>

403
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:47.150
<v Speaker 4>high school though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it's Woodford county.</v>

404
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 4>Kentucky was at one point the largest</v>
<v Speaker 4>hint producing county in the entire</v>

405
00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:52.360
<v Speaker 4>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

406
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something about the limestone,</v>

407
00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 4>this whole conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the humidity,</v>

408
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.100
<v Speaker 4>sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

409
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 4>shot and hemp grows really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really well.</v>

410
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first legal 508 or acre hemp farm in</v>

411
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky unveiled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it's legal in October.</v>

412
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now they can grow it.</v>

413
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

414
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:13.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't live there anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm out of touch.</v>

415
00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 2>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great news.</v>

416
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 2>That's fantastic news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

417
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just talking about something and</v>

418
00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bring up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

419
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

420
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.100
<v Speaker 2>It's something about something about new</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Nelson,</v>

421
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 2>something new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that had to do with,</v>

422
00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:36.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with legalization of marijuana in</v>

423
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about,</v>

424
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

425
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.400
<v Speaker 2>it's just pretty crazy that you'd have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hemp museum and have it be illegal for</v>

426
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 2>so long with no argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

427
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 2>there's no science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't pollute anything.</v>

428
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:48.470
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dean environment,</v>

429
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 2>the nature makes amazingly</v>

430
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 5>built on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything was made out of that shit.</v>

431
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see the first Henry Ford</v>
<v Speaker 5>model t where he made the fenders out of</v>

432
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 5>hap and he's hitting it with a hammer</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not know that?</v>

433
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 5>Did you gotta Watch this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll play this for you.</v>

434
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.050
<v Speaker 5>It's the craziest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Henry Ford's very first car that he</v>

435
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 5>made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He made the fenders out of hemp and</v>

436
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.730
<v Speaker 5>you're watching him hit this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>fender with a hammer and a hammer is</v>

437
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 5>bouncing off the fender.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Check this out.</v>

438
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

439
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When was this?</v>

440
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 5>What did it say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie was the time it said there.</v>

441
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.010
<v Speaker 5>1941 1941 so in 1941 before it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal,</v>

442
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 5>so it was made,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was made illegal right around the</v>

443
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:29.670
<v Speaker 5>time where alcohol prohibition had ended</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they needed something to go after.</v>

444
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 5>So then they started using the same guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>to go after wheat and this was pre that,</v>

445
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.490
<v Speaker 5>look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's hitting this fucking thing with the</v>

446
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 5>back of an ax and it's just bouncing</v>
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>

447
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.130
<v Speaker 5>It was also a great way to discriminate</v>
<v Speaker 5>against Mexican immigrants.</v>

448
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a black people too.</v>

449
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 5>The whole name marijuana came from a</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexican slang for a while.</v>

450
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 5>Tobacco didn't have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana.</v>

451
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.830
<v Speaker 5>They just created this thing like when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they made it illegal,</v>

452
00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 5>the people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't even understand they're</v>

453
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.450
<v Speaker 5>making hemp illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had to all dad explain it to</v>

454
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:06.450
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they were like tax stamps that you</v>

455
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 5>had to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dupont understood that.</v>

456
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh they incidents then understood the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck out of it.</v>

457
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 5>So that William Randolph hearst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy was the craziest.</v>

458
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.590
<v Speaker 5>The Guy who citizen Kane was a based on</v>
<v Speaker 5>rules boob.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So here it is.</v>

460
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:24.090
<v Speaker 5>This guy's hitting this hemp fender with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fucking hammer,</v>

461
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 5>Henry Rollins testing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Henry Rollins,</v>

464
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 5>it's easy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's so obvious.</v>

467
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.360

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 5>It has all the amino acids you could use</v>
<v Speaker 5>for heating oil.</v>

475
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:10.830

<v Speaker 4>she was pretty old school.</v>

494
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.570
<v Speaker 4>Like knowing there's this thing out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there that that isn't anything that</v>

495
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 4>these doctors are going to offer her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just gonna make her feel awful.</v>

496
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

497
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:06.544
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

498
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or have to go through all of those</v>

499
00:21:08.311 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 4>things that just gives you comfort or</v>
<v Speaker 4>ease,</v>

500
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:13.510
<v Speaker 4>nausea or make you want to eat food or</v>
<v Speaker 4>those kinds of things.</v>

501
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Like why wouldn't you want someone you</v>
<v Speaker 4>love and care about to have that?</v>

502
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.790
<v Speaker 4>But then at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

503
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 4>you want to be the person trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>feed pots,</v>

504
00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 4>your grandmother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

505
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 4>It's a hard sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a hard sell.</v>

506
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just</v>

507
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.003
<v Speaker 4>stunning</v>

508
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.100
<v Speaker 5>how well propaganda from 1933 carried</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the way the fuck to 2018 it's</v>

509
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:41.390
<v Speaker 5>stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>

510
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's almost a hundred years with</v>

511
00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:47.360
<v Speaker 5>what we like the amount of information</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can get on a subject now.</v>

512
00:21:47.361 --> 00:21:50.150
<v Speaker 5>Like say if you're the bit the medical</v>
<v Speaker 5>benefits of cannabis,</v>

513
00:21:50.151 --> 00:21:52.640
<v Speaker 5>just google that and you'll just start</v>
<v Speaker 5>reading all this shit.</v>

514
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.520
<v Speaker 5>Like if it seems to me that enough</v>
<v Speaker 5>people would go,</v>

515
00:21:55.521 --> 00:21:56.570
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing?</v>

516
00:21:56.571 --> 00:21:58.910
<v Speaker 5>Like why is it illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's died from it.</v>

517
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.270
<v Speaker 5>Like no one more people die of aspirin</v>
<v Speaker 5>every year.</v>

518
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.210
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

519
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.600
<v Speaker 5>Cause Zero die from pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's really the number zero.</v>

520
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.450
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean that people aren't going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get high and walk into traffic.</v>

521
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.090
<v Speaker 5>Some psalm we're Gunna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think part of that is because</v>

522
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.460
<v Speaker 5>we're not to teach teaching people how</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get high properly.</v>

523
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.280
<v Speaker 5>Someone gets hired for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 5>you looked up tone or how many of those</v>

524
00:22:17.281 --> 00:22:19.860
<v Speaker 5>people that are getting hit by cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're actually looking at their phones.</v>

525
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.810
<v Speaker 5>Could be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were high and looking at their</v>

526
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:24.240
<v Speaker 5>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't see that here like you doing</v>

527
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.300
<v Speaker 5>in Nashville.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I drove around and I know that's like,</v>

528
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.270
<v Speaker 5>I can't hate that every time I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 5>driving around town and everybody's</v>

529
00:22:30.271 --> 00:22:31.620
<v Speaker 5>texting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's looking at you can always</v>

530
00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:33.000
<v Speaker 5>spot on the interstate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

531
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.890
<v Speaker 5>Weaving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't see that in California.</v>

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today,</v>

535
00:22:38.011 --> 00:22:42.450
<v Speaker 5>some lady had drifted completely in my</v>
<v Speaker 5>lane and I looked over at her and I saw</v>

536
00:22:42.451 --> 00:22:47.010
<v Speaker 5>the the back of her head like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was on her driver's side.</v>

537
00:22:47.011 --> 00:22:50.490
<v Speaker 5>I was on that side looking over at her</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all I saw was the back of rich.</v>

538
00:22:50.491 --> 00:22:54.030
<v Speaker 5>Literally wasn't looking at my car and</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was just looking at her phone and</v>

539
00:22:54.031 --> 00:22:56.400
<v Speaker 5>working her thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And occasionally like looking up at the</v>

540
00:22:56.401 --> 00:22:58.680
<v Speaker 5>screen or looking up at the windshields</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

541
00:22:58.681 --> 00:23:00.150
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you crazy lady.</v>

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.040
<v Speaker 5>You think just cause you're going 40</v>
<v Speaker 5>miles an hour.</v>

543
00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:03.630
<v Speaker 5>That's okay because you were on a side</v>
<v Speaker 5>street.</v>

544
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.570
<v Speaker 5>Like you're not even looking where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>

545
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.220
<v Speaker 5>You travel to a car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you hit a kid?</v>

546
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.140
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

547
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:11.630
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>If you rear end a bike,</v>

550
00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.360

<v Speaker 5>You didn't even notice the bike was</v>

<v Speaker 5>You gotta be real careful today.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

558
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.550
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

562
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 4>It's so surprising that none of that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>really hit the music business as hard as</v>

563
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:55.060

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

583
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.450

<v Speaker 2>that he has some new nuclear missile</v>

584
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:52.760

<v Speaker 2>can deal with it.</v>

588
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 2>So he's basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could kill you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's terrifying is,</v>

595
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.630
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely cause for concern at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

596
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.780
<v Speaker 4>This wall pot's illegal</v>

597
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.570
<v Speaker 2>pot's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's legal to have a guy who was the</v>

598
00:25:28.571 --> 00:25:29.740
<v Speaker 2>host of the apprentice</v>

599
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:34.420
<v Speaker 4>run the nuclear armament or armory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd say armory.</v>

600
00:25:34.421 --> 00:25:36.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

601
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got some trouble a few months ago</v>

602
00:25:38.381 --> 00:25:41.380
<v Speaker 4>because I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had nothing to do one night and I went</v>

603
00:25:41.381 --> 00:25:44.230
<v Speaker 4>down and it was all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing was just the protest,</v>

604
00:25:44.231 --> 00:25:46.510
<v Speaker 4>kind of based on like answering</v>
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>

605
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.330
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the promise I made this buddy of mine</v>

606
00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:52.600
<v Speaker 4>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he videotaped it and he had a press</v>

607
00:25:52.601 --> 00:25:53.550
<v Speaker 4>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't tell us,</v>

608
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.170
<v Speaker 4>turn the camera off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And somebody asked me,</v>

609
00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.540
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about trump?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I answered it.</v>

610
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what they didn't ask,</v>

611
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.480
<v Speaker 4>what do you think of all politicians?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

612
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.390
<v Speaker 4>To me like nothing ever really changes</v>
<v Speaker 4>look right,</v>

613
00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:11.650
<v Speaker 4>left this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all just sort of a different</v>

614
00:26:11.651 --> 00:26:13.930
<v Speaker 4>version of the people you never really</v>
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>

615
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 2>We can't have an Alpha chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

616
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a stupid position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have it anymore.</v>

617
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.690
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have had it a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

618
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.180
<v Speaker 2>We should have figured out a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago do.</v>

619
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:25.670
<v Speaker 2>You can't have one person run the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

620
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.650
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

621
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy for them too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for anybody.</v>

622
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.430
<v Speaker 2>So w w we can't pretend anymore that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>person is special above other people.</v>

623
00:26:34.431 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Like royalty doesn't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

624
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.920
<v Speaker 2>We're all just people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work and you can't get voted</v>

625
00:26:39.921 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 2>into the number one person on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking apparently</v>

626
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.030
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can,</v>

627
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.750
<v Speaker 5>but you shouldn't be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's it's too old.</v>

628
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 5>It's too antiquated and there's way</v>
<v Speaker 5>better options.</v>

629
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 5>There's just way better options.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't have all of us like,</v>

630
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.580
<v Speaker 5>and you can have like some arbitrary</v>
<v Speaker 5>date.</v>

631
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.280
<v Speaker 5>The prevalence [inaudible] episode of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the voices are saying,</v>

632
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.390
<v Speaker 5>well it has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got a timer thing as a buzzer.</v>

633
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 5>The voice now man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

634
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:06.120
<v Speaker 5>that's just how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

635
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.440
<v Speaker 5>or American idol or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bustle big contest.</v>

636
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.260
<v Speaker 5>You mean during the trophy when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you vote there's a buzzer did</v>

637
00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 5>buzzers over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't vote anymore.</v>

638
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

639
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.250
<v Speaker 5>The votes are in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

640
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 5>And the drum roll please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's Showbiz.</v>

641
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense that you,</v>

642
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean I guess it does because then</v>
<v Speaker 5>people could arbitrarily decide to</v>

643
00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:34.290
<v Speaker 5>remove a leader and put a leader back in</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like you would just be able to vote</v>

644
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 5>and change your mind with the tide like</v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly.</v>

645
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 5>But that's one more reason why we</v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't have one person did stupid</v>

646
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.240
<v Speaker 5>should have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

647
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 5>we got to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to overhaul the way we teach</v>

648
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to have more informed people.</v>

649
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 5>Then once you have more informed people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you let them in on what the fuck we</v>

650
00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:57.240
<v Speaker 5>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we all decided as a group,</v>

651
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.040
<v Speaker 5>like the way they do it now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

652
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 5>The way they do it now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

653
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.920
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's bullshit.</v>

654
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:03.900
<v Speaker 5>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're pretending that you have a</v>

655
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 5>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do have a choice.</v>

656
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 5>You have a choice between this guy or</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy,</v>

657
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:07.920
<v Speaker 5>neither one you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so pick it.</v>

658
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:12.270
<v Speaker 5>But both of them are embedded in all of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the special interest groups and all the</v>

659
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 5>lobbyists and was supposed to be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>republic.</v>

660
00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:16.470
<v Speaker 5>It was always supposed to be about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

661
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and by the people.</v>

662
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 5>For the people who know I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

663
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:20.610
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been cooptive by money.</v>

664
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:24.540
<v Speaker 5>It's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Big Pharma and all companies,</v>

665
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.351
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

666
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:28.860
<v Speaker 5>the amount of people that are allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>spend millions and millions of dollars</v>

667
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:30.480
<v Speaker 5>to prop up politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

668
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.930
<v Speaker 5>why would we let that happen on both</v>
<v Speaker 5>sides,</v>

669
00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:35.460
<v Speaker 5>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>both sides.</v>

670
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.130
<v Speaker 5>Why would we let that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems crazy.</v>

671
00:28:38.131 --> 00:28:43.131
<v Speaker 5>That seems like any other job where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>were in a position of influence over</v>

672
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.730
<v Speaker 5>someone else's job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't be able to take money from</v>

673
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:50.790
<v Speaker 5>that person to make sure that you did</v>
<v Speaker 5>the right thing.</v>

674
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 5>That would be called bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

675
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is like bribery.</v>

676
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.970
<v Speaker 5>They do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do do it,</v>

677
00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 5>but they get in be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the one that they get in real big</v>

678
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:01.170
<v Speaker 5>trouble for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's one that I think is interesting.</v>

679
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 5>They um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump recently did something about</v>

680
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 5>steel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about uh,</v>

681
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 5>bringing steel back the United States</v>
<v Speaker 5>and steel manufacturing back in United</v>

682
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:11.730
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>

683
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 5>But before he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of his homeys bought a shit load of</v>

684
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:19.080
<v Speaker 5>stock could steal like one of his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like super rich dudes.</v>

685
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 5>And so then the question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

686
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:23.820
<v Speaker 5>should he have been allowed to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that insider trading?</v>

687
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:25.200
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

688
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 5>You can't just know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I know shit,</v>

689
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:29.640
<v Speaker 5>what am I supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not supposed to buy stock.</v>

690
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well then if you do no shit and you buy</v>

691
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 5>stock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that fair?</v>

692
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 5>I didn't seem fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the answer there?</v>

693
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:42.280
<v Speaker 5>The answer is the system sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got a wacky fucking crazy system</v>

694
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.490
<v Speaker 2>that all your monies based on who people</v>
<v Speaker 2>could just buy and say,</v>

695
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:50.550
<v Speaker 2>sell parts of companies or all or all</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese pretty much bought all the steel</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've got to get the fuck Outta here.</v>

714
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a victim of a pump and dump</v>

715
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Speaker 2>scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

716
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 2>this dude told me to buy the stock and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

717
00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:30.160
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you this talks about to blow</v>

718
00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:31.030
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was a coke dealer,</v>

719
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 2>so I knew he was honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trustworthy,</v>

720
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.323
<v Speaker 2>easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to,</v>

721
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.070
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know he's a coke dealer at the</v>

722
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:38.800
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought he was a comic and so he</v>

723
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 2>would tell me about the stock and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>bought into it.</v>

724
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I bought that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like a few thousand dollars,</v>

725
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.930
<v Speaker 2>which is not that big of a deal if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a,</v>

726
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the greater spectrum of how</v>

727
00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:50.910
<v Speaker 2>much money people lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

728
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.630
<v Speaker 2>In the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a g I lost nothing.</v>

729
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean people lose their whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their whole life savings,</v>

730
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 2>their fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

731
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.340
<v Speaker 2>What they've inherited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can lose it like that in the</v>

732
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:01.090
<v Speaker 2>stock market.</v>

733
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.630
<v Speaker 2>So we bought in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my business manager and it went</v>

734
00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 2>out for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It went up because more people were</v>

735
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:09.760
<v Speaker 2>telling more people to buy it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just crashed.</v>

736
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.610
<v Speaker 2>And when I mean it crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just went to the floor.</v>

737
00:31:12.611 --> 00:31:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Like it didn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

738
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.290
<v Speaker 2>it went from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the number was,</v>

739
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:22.380
<v Speaker 2>but it was like in the many dollars down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like a fraction of a cent or a</v>

740
00:31:22.411 --> 00:31:24.130
<v Speaker 2>center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three San or something like that.</v>

741
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.370
<v Speaker 2>It went down to virtually worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>

742
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got pumped and dumped.</v>

743
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

744
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 2>they pump it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get a bunch of people to join and</v>

745
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 2>then once beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people are buying this stock.</v>

746
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:38.170
<v Speaker 2>They're like abandon ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got fucked.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just assume everything is a pyramid</v>

763
00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:17.770
<v Speaker 2>scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always like a trickle of,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>more stable than money,</v>

766
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I think we just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I think why fuck around.</v>

771
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.390
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all it would take if everybody</v>

772
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 2>just agreed to just use bitcoin</v>

773
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.030
<v Speaker 4>or if everybody agreed to an implant</v>
<v Speaker 4>that had all your info on it and all</v>

778
00:32:58.921 --> 00:33:00.390
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just put this in your Dick.</v>

779
00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.520
<v Speaker 4>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:02.810
<v Speaker 4>they just have it inserted it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but we all have one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

782
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They haven't turned it on.</v>

783
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.480
<v Speaker 4>It's in your pocket and not your wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

784
00:33:09.481 --> 00:33:12.870
<v Speaker 4>some people it's on the rest too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was who I was texting one night with</v>

785
00:33:12.871 --> 00:33:15.370
<v Speaker 4>the guys in the band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was what really scared to show me</v>

786
00:33:15.371 --> 00:33:19.860
<v Speaker 4>where I like I got off social media</v>
<v Speaker 4>while back completely again.</v>

787
00:33:19.861 --> 00:33:20.760
<v Speaker 4>I tried twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ghana,</v>

788
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.620
<v Speaker 4>I told Jason Isabel would give it a</v>
<v Speaker 4>second shot,</v>

789
00:33:22.621 --> 00:33:25.290
<v Speaker 4>but I realize my kids are way more</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting and like I'm trying to,</v>

790
00:33:25.291 --> 00:33:26.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just rather be writing a song or doing</v>

791
00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:27.804
<v Speaker 4>something else.</v>

792
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.250
<v Speaker 4>But one night all we were all had a</v>
<v Speaker 4>group text going on and somebody said</v>

793
00:33:32.251 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 4>something made a joke like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

794
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:39.180
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot of 80s film buffs in our</v>
<v Speaker 4>band and somebody made a John Claude van</v>

795
00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.820
<v Speaker 4>Damme reference and doodling and five</v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes later,</v>

796
00:33:41.821 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in any way exaggerating this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all my wife and I are sitting and</v>

797
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:48.030
<v Speaker 4>watching TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>surfing netflix and instantly it's like</v>

798
00:33:48.031 --> 00:33:52.620
<v Speaker 4>my entire channel is full of John Claude</v>
<v Speaker 4>van Damme selections.</v>

799
00:33:52.621 --> 00:33:54.420
<v Speaker 4>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck is going on?</v>

<v Speaker 4>damn film ever on Netflix.</v>

801
00:33:58.471 --> 00:34:02.160
<v Speaker 4>And now there's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like somehow that got cross</v>

802
00:34:02.161 --> 00:34:06.570
<v Speaker 4>marketed to my television set just cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on my telephone and talking about</v>

<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

806
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.020
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people tell them weird dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were having conversations on the</v>

807
00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 2>phone with someone and then what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about showed up in their</v>

808
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:22.430
<v Speaker 2>google ads on there on their laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that work?</v>

812
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:33.650

<v Speaker 2>Google ads.</v>

834
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people are crazy.</v>

835
00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Having those things in your house that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk to and it listens to</v>

836
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

839
00:35:36.381 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 2>this is just the first drops of water</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going through before our roof</v>

840
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 2>collapses because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

841
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.210
<v Speaker 2>it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know all cars now are more bills.</v>

842
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 2>It's all in electronic systems and GPS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

843
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a techie guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so excuse me if this is a really</v>

844
00:35:52.711 --> 00:35:54.600
<v Speaker 2>ignorant question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like what's to stop somebody from</v>

845
00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:57.300
<v Speaker 2>hacking into your car and crashing you</v>
<v Speaker 2>until fucking wall was,</v>

846
00:35:57.301 --> 00:36:00.950
<v Speaker 2>that was always the case against Michael</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the death of against the definitely</v>

847
00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 2>guy that he's tasted.</v>

848
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:02.703
<v Speaker 2>The CA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

849
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:03.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

850
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know if the CIA or who are</v>

851
00:36:05.981 --> 00:36:06.814
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

852
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:11.990
<v Speaker 2>but he wrote a story for rolling stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was embedded in Iraq or Afghanistan,</v>

853
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote a story about this general,</v>

854
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.750
<v Speaker 2>it was very unflattering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was he got stuck there</v>

855
00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:21.600
<v Speaker 2>with them and he lived with these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time and they let their guard</v>

856
00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

857
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said a bunch shit they would say</v>

858
00:36:24.661 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 2>around each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made a movie about it today.</v>

859
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they?</v>

860
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

861
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they might've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this general,</v>

862
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently got fired and it was one of</v>

863
00:36:34.561 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 2>the best generals that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

864
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:42.080
<v Speaker 2>it was very highly ranked and I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 2>respected by the troops and people were</v>

865
00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:44.910
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really pissed at this guy.</v>

866
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

867
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.420
<v Speaker 2>he was starting to say that he was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger and that his life was in danger.</v>

868
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 2>And I think even said something about if</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason he commit suicide</v>

869
00:36:56.821 --> 00:36:59.180
<v Speaker 2>that he didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

870
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was driving his car and he drove</v>

871
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 2>straight into a treat over a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour,</v>

872
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's car exploded,</v>

873
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engine flew from the car,</v>

874
00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 2>like crazy horrific shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards they talked to these</v>

875
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 2>computer experts and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

876
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:23.490
<v Speaker 2>is it possible to take a modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>automobile with all sorts of,</v>

877
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.120
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of devices inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern cars,</v>

878
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes them hit the brakes.</v>

879
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:32.910
<v Speaker 2>If you're getting too close to something</v>
<v Speaker 2>or literally move out of a lane,</v>

880
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 2>some of them have automatic pilot so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could just fucking press the destination</v>

881
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:39.030
<v Speaker 2>and it just navigates there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

882
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:42.300
<v Speaker 2>that's what in Pittsburgh or was there</v>
<v Speaker 2>some weeks back?</v>

883
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Those are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the self driving Uber's there and</v>

884
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 2>they're getting better and better and</v>
<v Speaker 2>better at that.</v>

885
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.123
<v Speaker 3>Hmm,</v>

886
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.860
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

887
00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you go?</v>

888
00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be trying to shoot humans</v>

889
00:37:59.141 --> 00:38:00.910
<v Speaker 2>through pneumatic tubes or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

890
00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.040
<v Speaker 2>but you think it's people who kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

891
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally for a profession,</v>

892
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professional soldiers,</v>

893
00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.210
<v Speaker 2>especially the ones that this guy mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded in combat.</v>

894
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:14.620
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] I don't think it's outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>the realm of possibility that they would</v>

895
00:38:14.621 --> 00:38:18.910
<v Speaker 2>like that guy up for getting that</v>
<v Speaker 2>general booted out.</v>

896
00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's outside the realm of</v>

897
00:38:21.191 --> 00:38:23.170
<v Speaker 2>possibility at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would think that guy is the enemy.</v>

898
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.940
<v Speaker 2>And they said that he had amphetamines</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his system and for awhile I was like,</v>

899
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:29.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet amphetamines.</v>

900
00:38:29.051 --> 00:38:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I realized that almost all</v>

901
00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:34.360
<v Speaker 2>journalists are taken fucking adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

902
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 2>They're all taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find it.</v>

903
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Amphetamines and methlick substantives</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of them.</v>

904
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them don't get mad if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight.</v>

905
00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:42.541
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

906
00:38:42.541 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 2>all I drink his coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be a dick.</v>

907
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:48.070
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have many friends that are writers or</v>

908
00:38:48.071 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 2>journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can think of two journalists that are</v>

909
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 2>friends of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both take a lot out of Raleigh.</v>

910
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:53.900
<v Speaker 2>I love that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

911
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Good Buddy of mine who's a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just telling me that when he was in</v>

912
00:38:57.971 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 2>college and he was going through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

913
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:04.240
<v Speaker 2>all of examinations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his friends started taking adderall and</v>

914
00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:07.300
<v Speaker 2>he recognizes giant jump in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance and you're just like,</v>

915
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

916
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:10.360
<v Speaker 2>they were smoking me and the grades and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized,</v>

917
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are on pdds.</v>

918
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never did it.</v>

919
00:39:13.711 --> 00:39:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I remember trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

920
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.410
<v Speaker 2>want to try right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really together.</v>

921
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.901
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

922
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of like to be down here.</v>

923
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.033
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

924
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I've never understood that.</v>

925
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it just never appealed to my</v>

926
00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:27.880
<v Speaker 2>disposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I would function if you</v>

927
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:30.580
<v Speaker 2>wanted to build a log cabin right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

928
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.570
<v Speaker 2>might be the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

929
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said when Jack Kerouac wrote on the</v>

930
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:35.010
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

931
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:36.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were on a lot of bins.</v>

932
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Adriene or like this snow and hail and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

933
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 2>They used to borrow them and he'll sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and wrote the whole thing and like</v>

934
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:43.510
<v Speaker 2>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

935
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.850
<v Speaker 2>maybe a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the,</v>

936
00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.491
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:39:45.491 --> 00:39:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a beat efficient auto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that he was,</v>

938
00:39:47.951 --> 00:39:51.790
<v Speaker 2>hopped out of his mind on speed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote the whole Dang thing.</v>

939
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Like in a scroll on a roof in Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 2>while Ginsburg was probably downstairs</v>

940
00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:57.640
<v Speaker 2>molesting a little kid or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

941
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.770
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a dark picture,</v>

942
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.813
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

943
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

944
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.990
<v Speaker 2>There used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

945
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.140
<v Speaker 2>what do you got there Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How a generation of beat writers burnt</v>

946
00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:08.974
<v Speaker 2>out on speed.</v>

947
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.413
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

948
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 2>There was a big pool scene</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

949
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was going to say.</v>

950
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:19.900
<v Speaker 2>There's pool players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

951
00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:22.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing with pool players back then is</v>

952
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 2>that they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

953
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.550
<v Speaker 2>take speed and gamble people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people first found out about speed,</v>

954
00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:31.090
<v Speaker 2>it must have been the most amazing thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever before they realize like how it can</v>

955
00:40:31.091 --> 00:40:33.280
<v Speaker 2>wreck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many think about there's no speed.</v>

956
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.080
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

957
00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 2>20 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's on speed.</v>

958
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened out of nowhere.</v>

959
00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:42.040
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't a bunch of speed burnouts</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody could like look back on</v>

960
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:42.371
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

961
00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:44.350
<v Speaker 2>look at that guy over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn from him.</v>

962
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like adderall.</v>

963
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no burnouts.</v>

964
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.750
<v Speaker 2>So everybody's would just been taking it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a few years ago.</v>

965
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Has it been around 20 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as,</v>

966
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long thing adderall has been around</v>

967
00:40:56.861 --> 00:40:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

968
00:40:58.451 --> 00:41:00.040

971
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.510
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was invented at the same time as</v>

972
00:41:04.511 --> 00:41:05.344
<v Speaker 2>gluten.</v>

973
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Kara whack took so much amphetamine</v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamine when he first discovered the</v>

974
00:41:11.981 --> 00:41:15.400
<v Speaker 2>inhaler high that he lost most of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair and his legs swelled up with,</v>

975
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:20.850
<v Speaker 2>what does that worth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thrombo flebbe Bitas thrombo phlebitis</v>

977
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.600

<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

978
00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.533
<v Speaker 2>Say.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

982
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they call those m artists?</v>

983
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Would they call them Edm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edm,</v>

984
00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.060
<v Speaker 2>all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's got a beard,</v>

986
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

987
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Greg Fitzsimmons and I were going over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunter s Thompson's routine before he</v>

988
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:49.544
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

989
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 2>write and he would just start off like</v>
<v Speaker 2>early in the morning,</v>

990
00:41:52.881 --> 00:41:56.120
<v Speaker 2>drinking a whole laundry list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bleeding until start work at midnight.</v>

991
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.350
<v Speaker 2>It's midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunters Thompson is ready to ride.</v>

992
00:41:58.351 --> 00:41:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

993
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.771
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but him,</v>

994
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:02.900
<v Speaker 2>same thing right in his body just gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>out man,</v>

995
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:05.240
<v Speaker 2>his body was just falling apart by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time he's tired.</v>

996
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:07.460
<v Speaker 2>He just burnt that fucking thing to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crisp.</v>

997
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know what we know now down.</v>

998
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

999
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.730
<v Speaker 2>those guys were riding the lightning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1000
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:14.510
<v Speaker 2>they never thought there'd be any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1001
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think with hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't matter whether or not he knew</v>

1002
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 2>he had done this exact same thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

1003
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was of a mindset that he's just like,</v>

1004
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 2>he's not here for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's here for a good time.</v>

1005
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he did.</v>

1006
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.771
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1007
00:42:30.771 --> 00:42:33.080
<v Speaker 2>that's why people love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the main,</v>

1008
00:42:33.081 --> 00:42:34.730
<v Speaker 2>not just because of his brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>

1009
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 2>but because that mother fucker went for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1010
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.620
<v Speaker 2>And then when it was all over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1011
00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:40.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same fun anymore.</v>

1012
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.920
<v Speaker 2>You take care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a gun to his head.</v>

1013
00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Told everybody who's going to do it to</v>

1014
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.790
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1015
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I want to get to a point where I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this anymore.</v>

1016
00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 2>I got fake hips now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't move always in pain.</v>

1017
00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take care,</v>

1018
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.390
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second you can't walk up or down a</v>

1019
00:42:59.391 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 2>few flights of stairs by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of when it's over.</v>

1020
00:43:01.881 --> 00:43:02.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people,</v>

1021
00:43:02.931 --> 00:43:05.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people manage to still find</v>

1022
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:08.180
<v Speaker 2>some reason to keep going and enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and,</v>

1023
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're fine,</v>

1024
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:16.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's like when you're a guy that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just still hit it hard every day,</v>

1025
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.070
<v Speaker 2>he never got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never sobered up.</v>

1026
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.490
<v Speaker 2>There was no sobering up at high watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what point though,</v>

1027
00:43:21.491 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 2>is that sad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 2>When is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's obviously a pretty</v>

1029
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:29.620
<v Speaker 2>inherent level of self medication going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on to,</v>

1030
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.510
<v Speaker 2>to get through the day so you don't wake</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and blow your brains out.</v>

1031
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:33.373
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1032
00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1033
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.440
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was just me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1034
00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with a guy like him,</v>

1035
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:48.720
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his path was probably pretty clearly</v>

1036
00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:53.470
<v Speaker 2>carved from the time he was very young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

1037
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.560
<v Speaker 2>he wa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1038
00:43:56.561 --> 00:44:00.190
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's so interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and said he was so genuinely</v>

1039
00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.670
<v Speaker 2>thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you really did think about it as</v>

1040
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.880
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest writers of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The questions I'm and a Kentucky and so,</v>

1041
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.733
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

1042
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:09.760
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1043
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I read it way too early because you</v>

1044
00:44:13.271 --> 00:44:13.780
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your,</v>

1045

<v Speaker 2>I was one of those kids got just at</v>
<v Speaker 2>older cousins.</v>

1046
00:44:15.791 --> 00:44:18.790
<v Speaker 2>You get exposed to all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was too soon.</v>

1047
00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably high school.</v>

1048
00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:22.440
<v Speaker 2>I went on to read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>his documentary.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking amazing.</v>

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to just do something with your</v>

1055
00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 1>life after you wash that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to,</v>

1056
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any friends that like way</v>

1057
00:44:45.701 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 1>44 magnums around in their living room</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1058
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1059
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:52.260
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely want to go to that party.</v>

1060
00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to that party too,</v>

1061
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 1>but you might get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't move in.</v>

1062
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1063
00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to the party.</v>

1064
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Depp moved in for like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six weeks?</v>

1065
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.180
<v Speaker 1>All the way they went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went her head too though.</v>

1066
00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he cooked Johnny Depp's</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

1067
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's when giant deb</v>
<v Speaker 1>started going wacky.</v>

1068
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably is.</v>

1069
00:45:11.851 --> 00:45:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to spread it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy theory.</v>

1070
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Jai Dep was reasonable and calm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>polite and had his shit completely</v>

1071
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:22.710
<v Speaker 1>together until he did too much acid with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter s thompson and that's why he's</v>

1072
00:45:22.711 --> 00:45:23.544
<v Speaker 1>wacky now.</v>

1073
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.530
<v Speaker 1>When you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1074
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not outside the realm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility Kentucky too,</v>

1075
00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not going to say damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a full Kentucky House.</v>

1076
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever read the Kentucky Derby is</v>
<v Speaker 1>decadent and depraved?</v>

1077
00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1078
00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it still holds true.</v>

1079
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing book.</v>

1080
00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Are Amazing article rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was,</v>

1081
00:45:41.021 --> 00:45:43.170
<v Speaker 1>that was where he sorta really found the</v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

1082
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 1>That piece in particular was where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1083
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go over here and do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1084
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.420
<v Speaker 1>there was definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that fear and loathing in Las</v>

1085
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Vegas thing to where that started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was pink,</v>

1086
00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:58.491
<v Speaker 1>paid to cover a motorcycle race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became this just fucking crazy screed</v>

1087
00:45:58.501 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 1>about drugs and partying and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of Barstow when the drugs began</v>

1088
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:07.530
<v Speaker 1>to take hold and it's fucking bad to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air and shit that driving a convertible</v>

1089
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 1>cadillac across the country headed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>

1090
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a fucking amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing piece of work.</v>

1091
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:16.440
<v Speaker 1>And it started out as a sports</v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrated story.</v>

1092
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.410
<v Speaker 1>They wanted him to cover race and also a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1093
00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitting and beautiful eulogy to the</v>

1094
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:26.000
<v Speaker 1>whole sixties flower power shift that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just caved on itself.</v>

1095
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that one line to fucking quitters</v>

1096
00:46:30.481 --> 00:46:31.770
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1097
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 1>what do you think happened with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they took away their pot,</v>

1098
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I think took away the acid and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested a bunch of people and they</v>

1099
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:39.840
<v Speaker 1>don't want to clamp down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1100
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a few</v>

1101
00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 1>calls through massacres and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1102
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sensationalization of the Manson</v>

1103
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:51.470
<v Speaker 1>murders probably didn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1104
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it became like a big narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hippies,</v>

1105
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:57.470
<v Speaker 1>LSD Martinson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1106
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.730
<v Speaker 1>it was all all tied in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1107
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:03.660
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the musically since I should stick to</v>

1108
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.340
<v Speaker 1>talking about things I know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is music,</v>

1109
00:47:05.341 --> 00:47:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that that was probably just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best shit that ever happened.</v>

1110
00:47:09.421 --> 00:47:14.421
<v Speaker 1>It never will happen like that 65 to 70</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1111
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.070
<v Speaker 1>it just sort of exploded in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>different directions and a lot of things</v>

1112
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:24.120
<v Speaker 1>happen that maybe they couldn't happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>now or even two decades ago.</v>

1113
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:25.650
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't have happened as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>musician.</v>

1114
00:47:25.651 --> 00:47:29.350
<v Speaker 1>What do you think was the catalyst?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what made them go from the 50 sound</v>

1115
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:30.184
<v Speaker 1>to the sixties</v>

1116
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 4>just experimentation and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and mind,</v>

1117
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:35.950
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1118
00:47:35.951 --> 00:47:40.110
<v Speaker 4>looking for different ways of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Philosophically speaking,</v>

1119
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.930
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what they're all writing about</v>

1120
00:47:41.931 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

1121
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 4>and then some guys were just pushing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sonic limitations of the studio.</v>

1122
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:49.060
<v Speaker 4>Like Hendrix didn't really do that much</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>

1123
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy was all just about like,</v>

1124
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:51.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1125
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 4>he partied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't like a Druggie,</v>

1126
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:56.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he probably ate acid on stage a couple</v>

1127
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.390
<v Speaker 4>times in both of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was spiked.</v>

1128
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:59.531
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:01.420
<v Speaker 4>And the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just a serious blues head and they</v>

1130
00:48:01.421 --> 00:48:06.190
<v Speaker 4>wanted to stretch out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really pushed what the limitations of</v>

1131
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:08.210
<v Speaker 4>the gear at that time in the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1132
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:09.911
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1133
00:48:09.911 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't only want to have eight</v>
<v Speaker 4>channels.</v>

1134
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:12.640
<v Speaker 4>What would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we had 16,</v>

1135
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.550
<v Speaker 4>I'll you have some of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>experimentation things that guys like</v>

1136
00:48:15.551 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 4>him and pink floyd and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>later bands,</v>

1137
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.753
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alo,</v>

1138
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:24.490
<v Speaker 4>just really pushing the parameters of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you could do with a traditional</v>

1139
00:48:24.491 --> 00:48:28.540
<v Speaker 4>style of music in terms of arrangement</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how you frame that.</v>

1140
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I always assumed that because he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested in Toronto with heroin,</v>

1141
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:36.270
<v Speaker 1>that he did drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you have heroin on you,</v>

1142
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you got drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he get busted for,</v>

1143
00:48:37.921 --> 00:48:40.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was barbiturates are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>good question.</v>

1144
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he ever like,</v>

1145
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1146
00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:45.120
<v Speaker 1>It might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be right.</v>

1147
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.510
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says a small amount of heroin and</v>

1148
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.690
<v Speaker 1>hashish</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing the dragon.</v>

1149
00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

1150
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.180
<v Speaker 1>So when I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1151
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.270
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do we know about what Jimmy</v>

1152
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Hendrix did during his day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know how high I'm</v>

1153
00:48:59.011 --> 00:49:01.590
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a of how would they,</v>

1154
00:49:01.591 --> 00:49:02.424
<v Speaker 1>how would they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1155
00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.850
<v Speaker 1>if they see us get high on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know all high I got today.</v>

1156
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they don't even,</v>

1157
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.030
<v Speaker 1>because I could get high before I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

1158
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I might get high when I'm sitting home</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write.</v>

<v Speaker 1>arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>way though.</v>

1208
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 1>There's like a top was made service to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come over your house and they'd take</v>

1209
00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 1>their top off.</v>

1212
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.570
<v Speaker 1>imagine the people that those poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies have to deal with on a daily</v>

<v Speaker 1>you could have a topless maid service,</v>

1216
00:51:25.521 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 1>but you couldn't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come over and wash the house while</v>

1220
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:38.840

<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be pretty weird if you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done beautiful.</v>

1273
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He's prettier than most women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1274
00:53:45.511 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty than a lot of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1275
00:53:46.741 --> 00:53:48.090
<v Speaker 1>If you put him on like a long</v>

1276
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:52.120
<v Speaker 3>hair wig type situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful.</v>

1277
00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.673
<v Speaker 3>There it goes.</v>

1278
00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:57.180
<v Speaker 1>We go on and look at pictures of Jesse</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be half Japanese.</v>

1279
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I think he's supposed to be her misses a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1280
00:53:59.311 --> 00:54:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I better not be cause he's got his hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that anymore.</v>

1281
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 1>That shit is cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to anymore.</v>

1282
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:09.090
<v Speaker 1>But how else was the white dudes going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get you Kusa he's gotta be,</v>

1283
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 1>he's gotta be like a catch there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a soldier that was</v>

1284
00:54:11.941 --> 00:54:14.190
<v Speaker 1>friends with a guy stayed over there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help them.</v>

1285
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a movie today and you have a</v>

1286
00:54:17.161 --> 00:54:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Chinese character in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have a Japanese guy play the</v>

1287
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Chinese character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

1288
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will get angry.</v>

1289
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it anymore.</v>

1290
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:31.530
<v Speaker 1>No more pretending you're someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like can you like if you lost your</v>

1291
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Robert Downey Jr yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could get away with it,</v>

1292
00:54:35.011 --> 00:54:37.320
<v Speaker 1>but not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got away with it and that one movie.</v>

1293
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 1>But like if you were an Asian guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1294
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I firmly believe no one would have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem if they took an Asian guy and</v>

1295
00:54:44.701 --> 00:54:48.210
<v Speaker 1>gave him some sort of facial prosthetics</v>
<v Speaker 1>that turned him into a European looking</v>

1296
00:54:48.211 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 1>guy and then gave him lead roles and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie where he plays a European guy,</v>

1297
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:55.470
<v Speaker 1>people would have to shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be,</v>

1298
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:58.760
<v Speaker 1>they would want to say something within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd go,</v>

1299
00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.840
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1300
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:03.640
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we watch old movies on,</v>

1301
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.270
<v Speaker 1>on the bus sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want,</v>

1302
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 1>if I'm at home and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm by myself,</v>

1303
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:11.430
<v Speaker 1>like I'll watch weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll like old films and a lot of old</v>

1304
00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:15.600
<v Speaker 1>westerns and stuff and I'll watch the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same movies I've seen a hundred times</v>

1305
00:55:15.601 --> 00:55:17.760
<v Speaker 1>over and over as opposed to watching a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the newer shit.</v>

1306
00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do watch a lot of these old westerns</v>

1307
00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:25.530
<v Speaker 1>from the fifties and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all white dues painted up like</v>

1308
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:29.940
<v Speaker 1>native American Indians with the head</v>
<v Speaker 1>resident just looks so cheesy and they</v>

1309
00:55:29.941 --> 00:55:33.000
<v Speaker 1>have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these have affected a horrible accents</v>

1310
00:55:33.001 --> 00:55:34.950
<v Speaker 1>and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did that ever happen?</v>

1311
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:39.420
<v Speaker 1>But then you get to the eighties and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch something like 48 hours now and</v>

1312
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 1>it's the most sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

1313
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:43.410
<v Speaker 1>misogynistic shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1314
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.460
<v Speaker 1>and they were just pumping those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of studios two or three decades ago.</v>

1315
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>

1316
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:53.640
<v Speaker 1>any female characters in those films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're either hooker one or</v>

1317
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.880
<v Speaker 1>secretary at precinct who everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismisses.</v>

1318
00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:58.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those were the only roles.</v>

1319
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:02.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just happened.</v>

1320
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.540
<v Speaker 1>That's when we were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1321
00:56:04.541 --> 00:56:06.130
<v Speaker 1>When we were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1322
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 1>we were on that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just call out specifically.</v>

1323
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:10.900
<v Speaker 1>We washed it on the bus one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were all like,</v>

1324
00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:13.120
<v Speaker 1>this would never fucking get made at</v>
<v Speaker 1>random.</v>

1325
00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:16.030
<v Speaker 1>There's no way so much we'd never get</v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

1326
00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:18.520
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1327
00:56:18.521 --> 00:56:20.380
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that cultural evolution?</v>

1328
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1329
00:56:22.061 --> 00:56:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of it,</v>

1330
00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just like catchphrases and</v>

1331
00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's actually doing something.</v>

1332
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I have weird ideas about this.</v>

1333
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:34.223
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1334
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 5>I really feel like if we weren't</v>
<v Speaker 5>completely embedded in it,</v>

1335
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:43.380
<v Speaker 5>that we would look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like a system that's pulling us</v>

1336
00:56:44.101 --> 00:56:45.120
<v Speaker 5>into its web</v>

1337
00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:48.720
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and forcing us to be more and more</v>

1338
00:56:48.721 --> 00:56:52.890
<v Speaker 5>entangled in this system is the system</v>
<v Speaker 5>of electronics.</v>

1339
00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:57.600
<v Speaker 5>It's like almost like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's preparing for us to give birth to</v>

1340
00:56:57.601 --> 00:57:00.660
<v Speaker 5>artificial life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so in the meantime,</v>

1341
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:05.070
<v Speaker 5>it's completely sucking us in and making</v>
<v Speaker 5>us be completely embedded.</v>

1342
00:57:05.071 --> 00:57:06.600
<v Speaker 5>Phone's in your pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>constant.</v>

1343
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:08.610
<v Speaker 5>Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to everything you do.</v>

1344
00:57:08.611 --> 00:57:13.590
<v Speaker 5>It's all just as deep as it can in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>biological systems world and pill.</v>

1345
00:57:13.591 --> 00:57:16.740
<v Speaker 5>It gives birth and we're going to force</v>
<v Speaker 5>it out of exist,</v>

1346
00:57:16.741 --> 00:57:21.180
<v Speaker 5>force it into existence just by being</v>
<v Speaker 5>completely fascinated with electronics.</v>

1347
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.370
<v Speaker 5>Are We?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to [inaudible].</v>

1348
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:24.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it the universe forcing it into</v>

1349
00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:26.880
<v Speaker 5>exists that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a natural thing.</v>

1350
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:28.830
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always described it as like a,</v>

1351
00:57:28.831 --> 00:57:31.200
<v Speaker 5>it's figured out a way to interconnect</v>
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

1352
00:57:31.201 --> 00:57:32.940
<v Speaker 5>You've been more man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1353
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.980
<v Speaker 5>It has data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.920
<v Speaker 5>And forced progress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like thinking about what they were</v>

1355
00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:39.810
<v Speaker 5>saying about Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if Putin,</v>

1356
00:57:39.811 --> 00:57:41.210
<v Speaker 5>who really does have that later.</v>

1357
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:42.750
<v Speaker 5>So fucking Skynet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1358
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:45.170
<v Speaker 5>It sure is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1359
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:47.910
<v Speaker 5>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if someone has that kind of power,</v>

1360
00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:50.280
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there really is something that a</v>

1361
00:57:50.281 --> 00:57:53.640
<v Speaker 5>person can think up that didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 5>200 years ago,</v>

1362
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:55.230
<v Speaker 5>200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't even the thought of it.</v>

1363
00:57:55.530 --> 00:58:00.530
<v Speaker 5>So in 200 years to small amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 5>measurement of time and relationship to</v>

1364
00:58:00.611 --> 00:58:04.230
<v Speaker 5>the entire age of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could figure out a way to kill</v>

1365
00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:09.231
<v Speaker 5>every person on the planet like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally wreck the planet where no life</v>

1366
00:58:09.661 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 5>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't be possible to have life.</v>

1367
00:58:11.881 --> 00:58:16.881
<v Speaker 5>There's enough nuclear bombs to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it going to be like in to 200</v>

1368
00:58:18.051 --> 00:58:19.910
<v Speaker 5>years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be way,</v>

1369
00:58:19.911 --> 00:58:20.451
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

1370
00:58:20.451 --> 00:58:21.830
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way more accelerated.</v>

1371
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:25.220
<v Speaker 5>Let's almost going to get to the point</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the universe</v>

1372
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.080
<v Speaker 5>is going to be a place where you could</v>
<v Speaker 5>visit.</v>

1373
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:32.630
<v Speaker 5>Like people can go places if not people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things can go go places.</v>

1374
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:36.800
<v Speaker 1>As long as I'm holding a lightsaber</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I die or you'll get one of those,</v>

1375
00:58:36.801 --> 00:58:38.750
<v Speaker 1>it's all fucking worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem,</v>

1376
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.010
<v Speaker 1>the light sabers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always like,</v>

1377
00:58:40.011 --> 00:58:41.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does it end there?</v>

1378
00:58:41.001 --> 00:58:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't it just go on for infinity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lazy boy?</v>

1379
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1380
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Why is it only three and a half feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>long now?</v>

1381
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:49.790
<v Speaker 1>What's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless it was a rod and then the laser</v>

1382
00:58:49.791 --> 00:58:52.010
<v Speaker 1>went around the rob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it knew to stop at the top.</v>

1383
00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:55.460
<v Speaker 1>That would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that laser only extends</v>

1384
00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.010
<v Speaker 1>three feet or whatever it does the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of here.</v>

1385
00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:00.320

<v Speaker 1>stuff coming out.</v>

1408
00:59:54.681 --> 00:59:55.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sterilization,</v>

1416
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 1>I guess is the best way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it definitely works that way for</v>

1417
01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>physical things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1418
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.710
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why the original</v>
<v Speaker 1>alien movie was so terrifying.</v>

1419
01:00:24.711 --> 01:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>It was a physical thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>3000 years later,</v>

1460
01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1461
01:02:15.921 --> 01:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like some of the ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>artwork,</v>

1462
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how about some of the statues are</v>

1463
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>dudes</v>

1464
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>grabbing each other's dicks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling?</v>

1465
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1466
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were wrestling and in the process</v>

1467
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.620
<v Speaker 2>of wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one dude's grabbing of the guy's junk,</v>

1468
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.470
<v Speaker 2>which they did do the crush your balls</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

1469
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 2>That was a move back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all those be honest,</v>

1470
01:02:35.671 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 2>like in a real fight to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the move.</v>

1471
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:41.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely the crush a man's taters</v>

1472
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>or take away his ability to breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fights pretty much over.</v>

1473
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.730
<v Speaker 2>There was actually a mma fight where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took place back when there was no</v>

1474
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named the Pedro and he was</v>

1475
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:52.560
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy named big daddy goodrich and big</v>

1476
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:56.400
<v Speaker 2>daddy reached into his pants and grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hold of his cock and balls and crushed</v>

1477
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 2>it in his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See this guy,</v>

1478
01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:02.430
<v Speaker 2>it's just grabbing Dick's man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy in the bottom is grabbing deck.</v>

1479
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:05.880
<v Speaker 2>He's holding that guy's hog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rude,</v>

1480
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:09.740
<v Speaker 2>but that's how they wrestled back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't give a fuck the,</v>

1481
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.240
<v Speaker 2>the Dick was something you could also</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on to.</v>

1482
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 2>You can hold onto the foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1483
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you hold onto the Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were yanking on decks and</v>

<v Speaker 2>talked about bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1500
01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.400
<v Speaker 2>no new opinions on that.</v>

1501
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a big foot story,</v>

1502
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freely.</v>

1503
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:09.280
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I already told him I made it.</v>

1504
01:04:09.281 --> 01:04:12.520
<v Speaker 4>I think did our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going out.</v>

1505
01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:16.270
<v Speaker 4>I used to live out west a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a buddy of mine were driving up to</v>

1506
01:04:16.271 --> 01:04:20.290
<v Speaker 4>this little town called Leavenworth</v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington to go check out just like</v>

1507
01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:24.880
<v Speaker 4>this weird little aspen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Swedish ski town and fucking northern</v>

1508
01:04:24.881 --> 01:04:26.860
<v Speaker 4>Washington where you go get your potato</v>
<v Speaker 4>soup.</v>

1509
01:04:26.861 --> 01:04:28.540
<v Speaker 4>That's another story though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1510
01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:31.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we stopped at one of these roadside</v>

1511
01:04:31.061 --> 01:04:35.110
<v Speaker 4>coffee stands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are every 300 feet in Washington</v>

1512
01:04:35.111 --> 01:04:37.780
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this one was on like this sort of</v>

1513
01:04:37.781 --> 01:04:42.781
<v Speaker 4>timber road going up through the forest</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you pull over speaking to Harry and</v>

1514
01:04:43.121 --> 01:04:43.841
<v Speaker 4>Henderson's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1515
01:04:43.841 --> 01:04:45.340
<v Speaker 4>It's all serendipitous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1516
01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:48.130
<v Speaker 4>we get out of the car and the wooden</v>
<v Speaker 4>statue from the,</v>

1517
01:04:48.131 --> 01:04:50.860
<v Speaker 4>from the beginning of that movie is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the driveway.</v>

1518
01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:54.560
<v Speaker 4>There was this old sasquatch statute and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1519
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.690
<v Speaker 4>that's where I remembered it from.</v>

1520
01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:57.380
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that looks just like this thing from</v>

1521
01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:58.750
<v Speaker 4>with day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1522
01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.980
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1523
01:04:59.981 --> 01:05:02.620
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bad ass though.</v>

1524
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.810
<v Speaker 4>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of bigfoot sightings out there.</v>

1525
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>funny you should mention that.</v>

1526
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.033
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1527
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:12.880
<v Speaker 4>we're stopping and we're getting coffee</v>
<v Speaker 4>or from this lady and I'm like,</v>

1528
01:05:12.881 --> 01:05:13.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1529
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.310
<v Speaker 4>trying to talk about the statute from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie.</v>

1530
01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:16.331
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1531
01:05:16.331 --> 01:05:18.490
<v Speaker 4>they stopped and here and then she pulls</v>
<v Speaker 4>out these,</v>

1532
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 4>she had these old photo books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the family photo albums,</v>

1533
01:05:22.811 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 4>like huge photo albums.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two or three of them,</v>

1534
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:29.881
<v Speaker 4>at least full of polaroids of sasquatch</v>
<v Speaker 4>that her family had taken in this house.</v>

1535
01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.540
<v Speaker 4>Supposedly it's greatest idea to sell</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee ever.</v>

1536
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Polaroids like photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fucking old of a real sounds.</v>

1537
01:05:39.581 --> 01:05:40.840
<v Speaker 4>Photos of Scat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sab.</v>

1538
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.120
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what she really wanted us to</v>
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

1539
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are just so many of them.</v>

1540
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:49.990
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking like God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she really went to some trouble here</v>

1541
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:52.870
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause there's like giant photo albums of</v>

1542
01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:55.170
<v Speaker 4>sasquatch and they were all sasquatch</v>
<v Speaker 4>photos.</v>

1543
01:05:55.171 --> 01:05:58.590
<v Speaker 4>I'd taken off their back porch or out</v>
<v Speaker 4>the windows of the house and the for,</v>

1544
01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:01.540
<v Speaker 4>cause they lived like right off the side</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the road and it was just fucking</v>

1545
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:02.740
<v Speaker 4>wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1546
01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:05.700
<v Speaker 4>And that's my satisfied story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was</v>

1547
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.400
<v Speaker 2>there any of them that made you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a damn one.</v>

1548
01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I I don't believe in big foot.</v>

1549
01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:13.890
<v Speaker 2>So it definitely used to be a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1550
01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think at one time it definitely</v>

1551
01:06:17.611 --> 01:06:20.850
<v Speaker 2>existed and they're all gone now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an animal called the gigantic</v>

1552
01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Pythagoras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1553
01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:22.710
<v Speaker 2>You know about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1554
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.050
<v Speaker 2>That was a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was basically a big foot.</v>

1555
01:06:25.290 --> 01:06:29.250
<v Speaker 2>There's an eight foot tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic bipedal ape.</v>

1556
01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.340
<v Speaker 2>So they know that that was real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if that was real,</v>

1557
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.330
<v Speaker 2>it's entirely possible that one of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>made it across the bering land mass with</v>

1558
01:06:36.331 --> 01:06:39.960
<v Speaker 2>human beings should entirely possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were from Asia and they</v>

1559
01:06:39.961 --> 01:06:41.970
<v Speaker 2>were from Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A ride around.</v>

1560
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeti.</v>

1561
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Yeti.</v>

1562
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neanderthal.</v>

1563
01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sasquatch.</v>

1564
01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.890
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a bunch of different names</v>

1565
01:06:49.891 --> 01:06:51.990
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a real animal that lived,</v>

1566
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I think they found bones that were as</v>
<v Speaker 2>recent as a hundred thousand years.</v>

1567
01:06:57.570 --> 01:07:02.570
<v Speaker 2>So anatomically modern humans definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in the presence.</v>

1568
01:07:02.671 --> 01:07:04.440
<v Speaker 2>So what do you attribute all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sightings too?</v>

1569
01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:07.080
<v Speaker 2>In the last bull showers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her Blair's hurt.</v>

1570
01:07:07.081 --> 01:07:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bears hurt their paws.</v>

1571
01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:10.950
<v Speaker 2>They walk the walk of Hind feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it all the time.</v>

1572
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of it's bullshit.</v>

1573
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:16.530
<v Speaker 2>The reason I say this because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>real compelling evidence other than like</v>

1574
01:07:16.531 --> 01:07:19.160
<v Speaker 2>a couple of footprints that you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone could have for you actually had</v>

1575
01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:19.591
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't,</v>

1576
01:07:19.591 --> 01:07:20.790
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to show for a while.</v>

1577
01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:22.330
<v Speaker 2>You want her to talk to all these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1578
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Were you ever at any time like this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>might've saw something.</v>

1580
01:07:27.451 --> 01:07:29.790
<v Speaker 2>One lady had think saw something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she was lying,</v>

1581
01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.850
<v Speaker 2>but I think she probably saw wounded</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear and she saw it very briefly.</v>

1582
01:07:32.851 --> 01:07:36.480
<v Speaker 2>And the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with people's memory,</v>

1583
01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.240
<v Speaker 2>especially in some situation that freaks</v>
<v Speaker 2>you out,</v>

1584
01:07:39.241 --> 01:07:40.770
<v Speaker 2>like you think you might've saw a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sasquatch,</v>

1585
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:44.340
<v Speaker 2>your brain starts fucking with you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts filling in the blanks with a</v>

1586
01:07:44.341 --> 01:07:47.700
<v Speaker 2>bunch of shit and then you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeating that shit as if it's that</v>

1587
01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:50.110
<v Speaker 2>enable that something is wrong.</v>

1588
01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:51.890
<v Speaker 2>But I would imagine if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1589
01:07:51.891 --> 01:07:53.100
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've been,</v>

1590
01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lived in Seattle for a while,</v>

1591
01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:55.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a little while.</v>

1592
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:57.510
<v Speaker 2>So you know what it's like when you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>up into those mountains.</v>

1593
01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like so thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

1594
01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was going to go fuck off and get</v>

1595
01:08:01.651 --> 01:08:03.420
<v Speaker 2>lost somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>

1596
01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.880
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's lets us from that some real</v>

1597
01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.260
<v Speaker 2>wilderness Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rainier,</v>

1598
01:08:07.261 --> 01:08:08.094
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:09.120
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gorgeous.</v>

1600
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their wilderness is so dense.</v>

1601
01:08:11.911 --> 01:08:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I was described it as like trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look through a box of q tips.</v>

1602
01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:15.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a petri dish.</v>

1603
01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:17.460
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in the,</v>

1604
01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 5>the ground is so soft and smushy from</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the pine needles.</v>

1605
01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.490
<v Speaker 5>So my point is this lady saw something</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the distance,</v>

1606
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:27.200
<v Speaker 5>she saw elk running,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1607
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 5>And then she saw something standing up</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she looked at his face and she</v>

1608
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 5>realized it was an ape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

1609
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:34.970
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see an ape.</v>

1610
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:37.210
<v Speaker 5>How is there an ape?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then she,</v>

1611
01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:39.380
<v Speaker 5>she said to herself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh it's big foot,</v>

1612
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.830
<v Speaker 5>that's big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it went over through this patch</v>

1613
01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:45.080
<v Speaker 5>of timber cause everything's super,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super dense,</v>

1614
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10,</v>

1615
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 5>20 yards further and you can't see it</v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

1616
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:51.500
<v Speaker 5>She lost it completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it makes sense that a bear was</v>

1617
01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:53.390
<v Speaker 5>chasing elk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they do.</v>

1618
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 5>They do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're probably chasing the elk.</v>

1619
01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:58.350
<v Speaker 5>There's probably a fon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd probably try to get it into the</v>

1620
01:08:58.351 --> 01:08:58.590
<v Speaker 5>bear.</v>

1621
01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:00.510
<v Speaker 5>Might've been heard this shit taste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:03.320
<v Speaker 5>And the bear might might've been hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in which case,</v>

1623
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:05.750
<v Speaker 5>which happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when bears or her,</v>

1624
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 5>they walk on two legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're looking at this thing,</v>

1625
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:11.060
<v Speaker 5>bears can grow nine feet long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1626
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:13.670
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black bears can be nine feet long.</v>

1627
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.760
<v Speaker 5>A really big black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're looking at this thing and</v>

1628
01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:18.020
<v Speaker 5>the Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably rare,</v>

1629
01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 5>but there could be seven feet all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can find a bunch of seven foot black</v>

1630
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:22.431
<v Speaker 5>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are,</v>

1631
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:25.970
<v Speaker 5>those are legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this black bears walking around seven</v>

1632
01:09:25.971 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 5>feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>standing up on its hind legs and you're</v>

1633
01:09:28.701 --> 01:09:30.610
<v Speaker 5>seeing it through the trees 30 yards</v>
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>

1634
01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.431
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1635
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:33.320
<v Speaker 5>I see big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in her head,</v>

1636
01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:37.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't think she was lying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think she definitely saw ash animal.</v>

1637
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.270
<v Speaker 5>She saw elk running and shop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She saw a big ass animal in pursuit,</v>

1638
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.440
<v Speaker 5>but it easily could have been a bear and</v>
<v Speaker 5>she could have filled in the blanks in</v>

1639
01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:48.660
<v Speaker 5>her mind with all these false memories</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are attributing like,</v>

1640
01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:49.610
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw his face,</v>

1641
01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:52.550
<v Speaker 5>it looked at me and annoys and all that</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1642
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:55.580
<v Speaker 5>Like people get wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you think you saw something and you</v>

1643
01:09:55.581 --> 01:09:56.414
<v Speaker 5>didn't.</v>

1644
01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.330
<v Speaker 5>It does no bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

1645
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:01.730
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing like no one's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's found shit.</v>

1646
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:05.060
<v Speaker 5>No one's found anything and not a single</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking bone.</v>

1647
01:10:05.061 --> 01:10:06.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they found this gigantic [inaudible]</v>

1648
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:10.340
<v Speaker 5>bone in an apothecary shop and China,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they did a dig.</v>

1649
01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:12.560
<v Speaker 5>They went back to the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These anthropologist said,</v>

1650
01:10:12.561 --> 01:10:15.950
<v Speaker 5>where the fuck did you get this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They this giant primate tooth.</v>

1651
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.870
<v Speaker 5>There wasn't a gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't a human being.</v>

1652
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:18.980
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where'd you get this?</v>

1653
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:22.640
<v Speaker 5>And they take them to the spot where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got it and they find bones.</v>

1654
01:10:22.641 --> 01:10:25.610
<v Speaker 5>They find job bones that indicate that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was by pedal.</v>

1655
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.670
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of controversial apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but apparently by the way,</v>

1656
01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:31.420
<v Speaker 5>that jaws design,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they knew the distinct stood upright and</v>

1657
01:10:31.421 --> 01:10:32.254
<v Speaker 5>it's huge.</v>

1658
01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.510
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met some dudes from stornoway,</v>

1659
01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Scotland wants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they look like they were from</v>

1660
01:10:39.481 --> 01:10:41.370
<v Speaker 4>another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like the biggest fucking</v>

1661
01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.920
<v Speaker 4>people I've ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's four or five of these guys at</v>

<v Speaker 4>And these are men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not shitting man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>seen and they were all over and they</v>

1666
01:10:56.131 --> 01:11:00.300
<v Speaker 4>were just like fucking mountain mountain</v>
<v Speaker 4>blocked off the light when they walked</v>

1667
01:11:00.301 --> 01:11:02.370
<v Speaker 4>through the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then these like long gray hair and</v>

1668
01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:03.420
<v Speaker 4>beards and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would actually love to go up.</v>

1673
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:16.180
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think of those dudes whenever I think</v>

1674
01:11:16.181 --> 01:11:19.000
<v Speaker 5>of those atlas stones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what atlas stones are like</v>

1675
01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 5>the most manly way to workout ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You basically picking up these enormous</v>

1676
01:11:24.821 --> 01:11:29.000
<v Speaker 5>balls of stone and these dudes lift them</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they get them on their chest.</v>

1677
01:11:29.001 --> 01:11:32.290
<v Speaker 5>They hoist them onto these blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have contest to see who can,</v>

1678
01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.080
<v Speaker 5>like when they do the straw man contest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they picked those atlas stones up and</v>

1679
01:11:35.081 --> 01:11:37.690
<v Speaker 5>put 'em on progressively higher and</v>
<v Speaker 5>higher shelves.</v>

1680
01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.840
<v Speaker 4>Giant,</v>

1683
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.800
<v Speaker 5>giant stone balls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those people,</v>

1684
01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.140

<v Speaker 5>Vikings for sure.</v>

1685
01:11:47.141 --> 01:11:48.340
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

1686
01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.800
<v Speaker 4>That's where the vikings turned around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1687
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:51.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1689
01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:54.800

<v Speaker 5>they shot loads and to everybody it got</v>
<v Speaker 5>winter time and then they bailed old</v>

<v Speaker 4>with my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with these guys and they're both like</v>

1699

<v Speaker 4>hard glaswegians and my friend Lloyd</v>
<v Speaker 4>went to last summer I was over there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>up to the highlands and back down and</v>

1701
01:12:26.351 --> 01:12:30.490
<v Speaker 4>one day I think we got as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oban or,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

1705
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:37.150
<v Speaker 4>it looks like you're on another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1706
01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.000
<v Speaker 4>I can't even describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember we got out of the car and a</v>

1707
01:12:40.001 --> 01:12:43.510
<v Speaker 4>couple of places and you try to wrap</v>
<v Speaker 4>your head around how ancient that shit</v>

1708
01:12:43.511 --> 01:12:46.770
<v Speaker 4>is and everything that took place there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1709
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:47.950
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how,</v>

1710
01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:50.680
<v Speaker 4>you know how one were just standing</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of the car on the side of the</v>

1711
01:12:50.681 --> 01:12:50.860
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>

1712
01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.930
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking freezing to death.</v>

1713
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of August.</v>

1714
01:12:54.821 --> 01:12:58.300
<v Speaker 4>It's just a raining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally upside down and it's not even</v>

1715
01:12:58.301 --> 01:12:59.560
<v Speaker 4>raining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just like this.</v>

1716
01:12:59.561 --> 01:13:01.690
<v Speaker 4>It's some harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brutal shit.</v>

1717
01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:03.730
<v Speaker 4>Always cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always cold,</v>

1718
01:13:03.731 --> 01:13:05.320
<v Speaker 4>always wet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even when it's not,</v>

1719
01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:08.830
<v Speaker 4>somehow I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like sunny and a mile and a half</v>

1720
01:13:08.831 --> 01:13:12.370
<v Speaker 4>later was like a blizzard and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like fucking mental man.</v>

1721
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:14.550
<v Speaker 4>But it looked like another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was only,</v>

1722
01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.431
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like it could,</v>

1723
01:13:15.431 --> 01:13:16.151
<v Speaker 4>could've been a c,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1724
01:13:16.151 --> 01:13:18.670
<v Speaker 4>setting out of star wars or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1725
01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:21.160
<v Speaker 4>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about Scottish people,</v>

1726
01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:22.930
<v Speaker 4>you always think of hardy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1727
01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:23.681
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hardy.</v>

1728
01:13:23.681 --> 01:13:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Tough people instantly comes to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1729
01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that another weird thing about it is you</v>

1730
01:13:29.051 --> 01:13:32.590
<v Speaker 4>always pure Americans especially like</v>
<v Speaker 4>were where you're from your ancestry and</v>

1731
01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:34.150
<v Speaker 4>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>

1732
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.150
<v Speaker 4>grew up in eastern Kentucky and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>moved to Central Kentucky.</v>

1733
01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:42.150
<v Speaker 4>But like most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the early settlers in the Appalachian</v>

1734
01:13:42.731 --> 01:13:45.640
<v Speaker 4>region was really predominantly Scotch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irish and some German.</v>

1735
01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:50.800
<v Speaker 4>So the first time I went to Scotland</v>
<v Speaker 4>to play music,</v>

1736
01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:53.060
<v Speaker 4>I had jet lag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the first morning I woke up like</v>

1737
01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.160
<v Speaker 4>really early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1738
01:13:54.161 --> 01:13:54.791
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1739
01:13:54.791 --> 01:13:56.320
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might as well go walk around and check</v>

1740
01:13:56.321 --> 01:14:00.160
<v Speaker 4>things out and get out of the city and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's kind of coming to life and</v>

1741
01:14:00.161 --> 01:14:02.680
<v Speaker 4>people are going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm looking around at the faces,</v>

1742
01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:03.600
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

1743
01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.260
<v Speaker 4>he realizes like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup,</v>

1744
01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:07.570
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might as well be in Hazard Kentucky</v>

1745
01:14:07.571 --> 01:14:10.570
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same stoic,</v>

1746
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.880
<v Speaker 4>very guarded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1747
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:15.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disposition.</v>

1748
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 4>But then like once you get to know them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially when you become friends,</v>

1749
01:14:18.491 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 4>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would do anything for you.</v>

1750
01:14:20.201 --> 01:14:22.360
<v Speaker 4>But it's very regal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stoic,</v>

1751
01:14:22.361 --> 01:14:24.830
<v Speaker 4>working class city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something really special magic</v>

1752
01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.370
<v Speaker 4>by Glasgow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just kinda hit me like,</v>

1753
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:30.010
<v Speaker 4>this is definitely where my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>people came from.</v>

1754
01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:31.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that might as well be my uncle</v>

1755
01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 4>bobby right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh Damn.</v>

1756
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.610
<v Speaker 4>The people that live there today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1757
01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.600
<v Speaker 4>like they get to go buy castles and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1758
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:45.790
<v Speaker 4>There's castles near that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You drive by every day.</v>

1759
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:48.610
<v Speaker 4>And how old those castles?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's the oldest castle in</v>

1760
01:14:48.611 --> 01:14:49.360
<v Speaker 4>Scotland?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1761
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what the oldest one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's like,</v>

1762
01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't all 1000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the one in Edinburgh is probably</v>

1763
01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.810
<v Speaker 4>1200 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1764
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God been been penicillin matching</v>

1765
01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:04.330
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:06.170
<v Speaker 4>12 can look 14,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1600 years.</v>

1767
01:15:06.171 --> 01:15:06.870
<v Speaker 4>And we played,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1768
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:09.490
<v Speaker 4>there was somewhere in Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little town and across the street</v>

1769
01:15:09.491 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 4>from the hotel was this guard tower that</v>
<v Speaker 4>had been there for 1300 fucking years.</v>

1770
01:15:14.261 --> 01:15:16.260
<v Speaker 4>And there's like viking boats they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>on display around,</v>

1771
01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1772
01:15:18.521 --> 01:15:22.330
<v Speaker 4>somebody a thousand years ago was up in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that window with a bow and Arrow,</v>

1773
01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:25.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all they had.</v>

1774
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:30.010
<v Speaker 4>That's all they had shooting arrows down</v>
<v Speaker 4>at invading people.</v>

1775
01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:32.080
<v Speaker 4>It gives you perspective though when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1776
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:36.820
<v Speaker 4>especially Europe in terms of old world</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that old when you think about</v>

1777
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:38.950
<v Speaker 4>China or a lot of Southeast Asian</v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures,</v>

1778
01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 4>you know you're talking about 10,000 but</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Europe is a good example for me.</v>

1779
01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Every time I go he gives me perspective</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause you think about everything</v>

1780
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.010
<v Speaker 4>happening in our country and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1781
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.720
<v Speaker 4>oh it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking going to hell.</v>

1782
01:15:49.721 --> 01:15:52.940
<v Speaker 4>And you know we're such a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know there's,</v>

1783
01:15:52.941 --> 01:15:56.860
<v Speaker 4>there's churches over there that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>five times older than the United States</v>

1784
01:15:56.861 --> 01:16:01.590
<v Speaker 4>and that it's still working somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The oldest shit we can't have is like</v>

1785
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 4>when I was living in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a cemetery that you can go to,</v>

1786
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:09.220
<v Speaker 4>we could see tombstones from like the 17</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and you barely read it.</v>

1787
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.110
<v Speaker 4>You can pay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all weathered and worn out.</v>

1788
01:16:11.111 --> 01:16:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Cause that shit with it in the 17</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and you could just go over and</v>

1789
01:16:15.941 --> 01:16:16.360
<v Speaker 4>touch it.</v>

1790
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.710
<v Speaker 4>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But people's,</v>

1791
01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:22.510
<v Speaker 4>how'd you too much because it's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the numbers are all fucking worn off and</v>

1792
01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:23.620
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that one right there.</v>

1793
01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Which just one that cathedral built in</v>
<v Speaker 4>1471,</v>

1794
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.470
<v Speaker 4>the oldest building in Glasgow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think 1471.</v>

1795
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.190
<v Speaker 4>The coolest Gig I ever played was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>London at,</v>

1796
01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:39.760
<v Speaker 4>it's called St Pancras as his old church</v>
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>

1797
01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think,</v>

1798
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>monks at one time it was,</v>

1799
01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:49.060
<v Speaker 4>they built it acoustically and designed</v>
<v Speaker 4>it out of stone for acquirers,</v>

1800
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.300
<v Speaker 4>like chamber bars and they didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a PA.</v>

1801
01:16:52.301 --> 01:16:54.790
<v Speaker 4>It was just me and an acoustic guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember sitting there thinking like,</v>

1802
01:16:55.780 --> 01:17:00.250
<v Speaker 4>it was the most insanely beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 4>natural reverb I'd ever heard in my</v>

1803
01:17:00.251 --> 01:17:02.110
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a really,</v>

1804
01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:03.011
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an,</v>

1805
01:17:03.011 --> 01:17:04.830
<v Speaker 4>it's like right around King's cross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1806
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:07.090
<v Speaker 4>kind of a busy intersection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think cause that it right there,</v>

1807
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.610
<v Speaker 4>st pancras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They look older.</v>

1810
01:17:14.041 --> 01:17:19.041
<v Speaker 4>Good St Pancras old church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really special though.</v>

1811
01:17:20.231 --> 01:17:21.850
<v Speaker 4>I remember walking for sound check and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

1812
01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck if anybody comes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

1813
01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:25.570
<v Speaker 4>I just get to sit here and play my</v>
<v Speaker 4>guitar in this room.</v>

1814
01:17:25.571 --> 01:17:26.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is it right here.</v>

01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:32.800
<v Speaker 2>And so in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the way they built the whole place,</v>

1818
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:35.160
<v Speaker 2>it reverberates while the rounded edges</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:38.430
<v Speaker 4>Actually that's the side hall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a,</v>

1820

01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:22.640
<v Speaker 4>They went through a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy page.</v>

1957
01:23:22.641 --> 01:23:23.740
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you put the band together?</v>

1958
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:24.281
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1959
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:29.110
<v Speaker 4>one of my favorite singers of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Robert Plant would always felt</v>

1960
01:23:29.111 --> 01:23:32.770
<v Speaker 4>like if Steve Marriott,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wanted to hear what that would</v>

1961
01:23:32.771 --> 01:23:34.720
<v Speaker 4>sound like if he didn't do the guy from</v>
<v Speaker 4>humble pie.</v>

1962
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.530
<v Speaker 4>Fucking incredible voice and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be,</v>

1963
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say maybe page one Indian,</v>

1964
01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 4>but he couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know they'd talked to maybe Rod</v>

1965
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:48.580
<v Speaker 4>Stewart was it was it faces at the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>or earlier there were there,</v>

1966
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.010
<v Speaker 4>I know Robert Plant wasn't choice number</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

1967
01:23:51.730 --> 01:23:56.440
<v Speaker 4>Do they had to talk Bonderman to taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Gig page and John Paul Jones had</v>

1968
01:23:56.441 --> 01:23:59.800
<v Speaker 4>known each other through session work in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mid sixties and when the yardbirds</v>

1969
01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:04.300
<v Speaker 4>broke up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy somehow thought he had rights to</v>

1970
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:07.210
<v Speaker 4>the name and he wanted to put together</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a super band of all his,</v>

1971
01:24:07.211 --> 01:24:12.211
<v Speaker 4>the his favorite musicians he played</v>
<v Speaker 4>with and bottom was a recommended by the</v>

1972
01:24:12.821 --> 01:24:15.640
<v Speaker 4>Bass player John Paul Jones because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to go and like talk him into it</v>

1973
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.350
<v Speaker 4>because he's playing with bands at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1974
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:19.100
<v Speaker 4>They paid him a lot more money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1975
01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.950
<v Speaker 4>On Jimmy's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I had to explain what they were</v>

1976
01:24:20.951 --> 01:24:24.850
<v Speaker 4>trying to accomplish and sell him on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that was,</v>

1977
01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.660
<v Speaker 4>that was sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every,</v>

1978
01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.290
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about vans that are put</v>
<v Speaker 4>together by labels.</v>

1979
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:33.340
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy page was a genius and a in a very,</v>

1980
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:35.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>visionary kind of guy.</v>

1981
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:39.220
<v Speaker 4>So he knew he needed to build this band</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take over the world and that's what</v>

1982
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1983
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Great producer too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fucking phenomenal guitarist.</v>

1984
01:24:45.461 --> 01:24:48.640
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably one of the most inventive</v>

1985
01:24:48.641 --> 01:24:51.340
<v Speaker 4>guitar players ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people say sometimes,</v>

1986
01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:53.050
<v Speaker 4>especially later when he's on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>morphine.</v>

1987
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Some sometimes it can be a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>sloppy,</v>

1988
01:24:55.871 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 4>but I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

1989
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.950
<v Speaker 4>I hate perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would nothing more boring than</v>

1990
01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:01.100
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is that,</v>

1991
01:25:01.101 --> 01:25:03.850
<v Speaker 4>is the sound of a guitar is similar to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a voice?</v>

1992
01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes to doodle have a raspy</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy fucked up voice and it just makes</v>

1993
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:09.850
<v Speaker 4>it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1994
01:25:09.851 --> 01:25:11.740
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any real artists player with an</v>

1995
01:25:11.741 --> 01:25:15.220
<v Speaker 4>instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what the guitar is</v>

1996
01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:17.770
<v Speaker 4>with amp or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like anybody that has their thing,</v>

1997
01:25:17.771 --> 01:25:20.080
<v Speaker 4>they can pick up anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And within like three notes,</v>

1998
01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:22.980
<v Speaker 4>you just know it's that person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1999
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 4>What do you think of that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you say his name?</v>

2000
01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Lee Ray Lamontagne.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that how you say it?</v>

2001
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:31.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a like a songwriter.</v>

2002
01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that song?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jolene?</v>

2003
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a really cool voice,</v>

2004
01:25:36.041 --> 01:25:39.490
<v Speaker 4>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Buddy Dan did a record with him and</v>

2005
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.580
<v Speaker 4>I've never met him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now he's a really cool</v>

2006
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:47.140
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His voice since think he's Kinda like,</v>

2007
01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 4>he was Sorta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm not mistaken,</v>

2008
01:25:49.841 --> 01:25:51.520
<v Speaker 4>I won't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's more like came into it later</v>

2009
01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:53.680
<v Speaker 4>like I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to jobs and shit before and then</v>

2010
01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:55.600
<v Speaker 4>just started doing it and that makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

2011
01:25:55.601 --> 01:25:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Found successful later on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that makes sense with a lot of</v>

2012
01:25:59.111 --> 01:25:59.740
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2013
01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 4>I just think people like Justin Bieber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's Kinda way</v>

2014
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 1>harder road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So way harder row to try to figure out</v>

2015
01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:10.280
<v Speaker 1>like all things considered.</v>

2016
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.110
<v Speaker 1>He's probably handling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2017
01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:18.350
<v Speaker 1>He's handling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you think about he was,</v>

2018
01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:22.220
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking eight or 24 years?</v>

2019
01:26:22.221 --> 01:26:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Only four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2020
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:27.890
<v Speaker 1>He just told us already having just</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned 24 and he's rolling around on a g</v>

2021
01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:29.660
<v Speaker 1>seven that's his day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2022
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck he wants to do all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2023
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:35.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't pay attention to things.</v>

2024
01:26:35.361 --> 01:26:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not glued into pop culture,</v>

2025
01:26:38.181 --> 01:26:43.181
<v Speaker 1>but somehow like you just can't not know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Justin Bieber's up to once a month</v>

2026
01:26:43.911 --> 01:26:45.530
<v Speaker 1>just walking around in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2027
01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:50.540
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that kid for most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be handed that type of existence and</v>

2028
01:26:51.531 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 1>all of that scrutiny and all the shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes along with that does things</v>

2029
01:26:56.061 --> 01:26:56.990
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2030
01:26:57.230 --> 01:26:59.360
<v Speaker 1>It definitely does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if your personalities not</v>

2031
01:26:59.361 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 1>even formed yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2032
01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine like I'm so grateful I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got into this business at 35 yeah,</v>

2033
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 1>and not 21 because I was talking to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend John this weekend about this and</v>

2034
01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that it's almost like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made an epoxy,</v>

2035
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2036
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:14.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a proxy,</v>

2037
01:27:14.001 --> 01:27:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you have to put a couple ingredients in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's one thing and you mix it</v>

2038
01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:20.990
<v Speaker 1>with another thing and then it hardens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you add some shit in that that's</v>

2039
01:27:20.991 --> 01:27:23.720
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to be there and it's fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>

2040
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.520
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to take that shit out.</v>

2041
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you added oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just wrote some oil in the epoxy</v>

2042
01:27:28.851 --> 01:27:29.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2043
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 1>and now you fucked that whole thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what you're doing to a</v>

2044
01:27:32.151 --> 01:27:34.640
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you raise a person famous,</v>

2045
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:39.340
<v Speaker 1>have you take some reality star from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time they're five and then they're gonna</v>

2046
01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.320
<v Speaker 1>sit calm and a movie and then you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone through your whole,</v>

2047
01:27:42.321 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I said Reality Star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've gone through your whole life.</v>

2048
01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.630
<v Speaker 1>If you're that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're Justin Bieber,</v>

2049
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 1>you've gone through your whole life</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the eye,</v>

2050
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.350
<v Speaker 1>under the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's gotten bigger and bigger and</v>

2051
01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:52.940
<v Speaker 1>bigger and more and more people paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

2052
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Like you never had a moment like you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're working for the railroad</v>

2053
01:27:55.671 --> 01:27:56.504
<v Speaker 1>tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2054
01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2055
01:27:58.431 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I did going on the road for years or do</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the jobs that I had before I was</v>

2056
01:28:02.661 --> 01:28:04.550
<v Speaker 1>ever a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any of those.</v>

2057
01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:07.820
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the wondering if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could pay your bill feeling.</v>

2058
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:09.890
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the,</v>

2059
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.930
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still feel like that,</v>

2060
01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's fucked up.</v>

2061
01:28:13.611 --> 01:28:16.400
<v Speaker 1>My wife just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still like,</v>

2062
01:28:16.401 --> 01:28:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never not feel like that,</v>

2063
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2064
01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:25.590
<v Speaker 1>From never really had money or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that or any aspirations to own a</v>

2065
01:28:26.421 --> 01:28:29.540
<v Speaker 1>house or those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a,</v>

2066
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.910
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2067
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:31.481
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>world in any day of the week.</v>

2073
01:28:46.241 --> 01:28:49.690

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.100
<v Speaker 4>there was no way I don't ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't ever want to wake up and have</v>

2079
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:10.101
<v Speaker 4>that kind of career cause it takes so</v>
<v Speaker 4>many people around you who are on a</v>

2080
01:29:10.471 --> 01:29:13.410
<v Speaker 4>daily basis just to maintain and keep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See it's something,</v>

2081
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 4>a machine that Laura's rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>logistically speaking,</v>

2082
01:29:16.261 --> 01:29:21.261
<v Speaker 4>that you become enslaved to the job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2083
01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Cause you have all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like,</v>

2084
01:29:25.381 --> 01:29:27.930
<v Speaker 4>there's always this name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you have superstar acts,</v>

2085
01:29:27.931 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 4>you know you put this head right here</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then everything below that just to</v>

2086
01:29:31.891 --> 01:29:33.860
<v Speaker 4>make that thing go around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2087
01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:38.430
<v Speaker 4>and it just turns into this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a corporation really like with</v>

2088
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:42.000
<v Speaker 4>20 semi trucks and all this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2089
01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:44.430
<v Speaker 4>and you've got to go out and make that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen because now all these people</v>

2090
01:29:44.431 --> 01:29:48.840
<v Speaker 4>depend on you for their livelihoods and</v>
<v Speaker 4>careers and that's going to affect the</v>

2091
01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 4>artistic decisions you make because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to stay relevant culturally</v>

2092
01:29:53.071 --> 01:29:53.904
<v Speaker 4>speaking.</v>

2093
01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:56.160
<v Speaker 4>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to do something different</v>

2094
01:29:56.161 --> 01:29:58.350
<v Speaker 4>next time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well now this massive fan base isn't</v>

2095
01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:00.030
<v Speaker 4>really going to fucking deal with that</v>
<v Speaker 4>very well.</v>

2096
01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can beastie boys put out Paul's</v>

2097
01:30:03.151 --> 01:30:04.770
<v Speaker 4>Boutique.</v>

<v Speaker 4>People want and what the fuck they want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck.</v>

2099
01:30:06.661 --> 01:30:09.240
<v Speaker 4>But now it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the class most greatest</v>

2100
01:30:09.241 --> 01:30:11.550
<v Speaker 4>records ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But people back then didn't know what</v>

2101
01:30:11.551 --> 01:30:12.930
<v Speaker 4>the handle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know what to do with that.</v>

2102
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.390
<v Speaker 4>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have the beastie boys</v>

2103
01:30:15.391 --> 01:30:17.460
<v Speaker 4>classified in the artist's box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2104
01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:20.700
<v Speaker 4>They had him in the pop music box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is silly.</v>

2105
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.200
<v Speaker 4>You got to fight for your right to</v>
<v Speaker 4>party.</v>

2107
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.800
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden,</v>

2108
01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:28.110
<v Speaker 4>you know Paul's Boutique,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>startups to doing a solo album and like</v>

2111

2114
01:30:40.471 --> 01:30:42.510
<v Speaker 4>playing in theaters when all that shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2131
01:31:25.711 --> 01:31:27.870
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy trying to figure his</v>
<v Speaker 4>life out,</v>

2132
01:31:27.871 --> 01:31:30.820
<v Speaker 4>hanging out with some chick stewards of</v>
<v Speaker 4>bags.</v>

2133
01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Question.</v>

2134
01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.440
<v Speaker 4>What does that song as they called</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maggie Mae?</v>

2135
01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:36.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and Elton John.</v>

2136
01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.490
<v Speaker 4>All those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's,</v>

2137
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.110
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a beast.</v>

2138
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:42.870
<v Speaker 4>A different level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they started wearing like leopard</v>

2139
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:46.470
<v Speaker 4>tight pants and shit cause he could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at that shit.</v>

2140
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:48.960
<v Speaker 4>It ain't like he's not working looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>at luck.</v>

2141
01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.830
<v Speaker 4>He actually was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he almost played professional</v>

2142
01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:55.390
<v Speaker 4>soccer for Celtic or somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2143
01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.750
<v Speaker 4>He's like a really great soccer player</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was a kid,</v>

2144
01:31:57.751 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 4>but he was too small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he had this and he's another one</v>

2145
01:32:00.491 --> 01:32:03.390
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That like basically like you never get</v>

2146
01:32:03.391 --> 01:32:05.200
<v Speaker 4>to see one of those again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2147
01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're never going to see a lot of</v>

2148
01:32:08.201 --> 01:32:10.360
<v Speaker 4>things again just cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just no,</v>

2149
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.630
<v Speaker 4>nobody that's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that might know.</v>

2150
01:32:12.631 --> 01:32:15.370
<v Speaker 4>That's not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might see more things now because</v>

2151
01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:16.413
<v Speaker 4>that's true too.</v>

2152
01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.950
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Getting ahead of myself.</v>

2153
01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:18.461
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2154
01:32:18.461 --> 01:32:19.211
<v Speaker 4>for all intents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2155
01:32:19.211 --> 01:32:20.740
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2156
01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:24.430
<v Speaker 4>That it wasn't an industry creation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2157
01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:27.520
<v Speaker 4>So now like anything really is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2158
01:32:27.521 --> 01:32:29.800
<v Speaker 4>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just have to fight and sift through</v>

2159
01:32:29.801 --> 01:32:34.750
<v Speaker 4>so much shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the mediocrity to get to</v>

2160
01:32:34.751 --> 01:32:37.090
<v Speaker 4>something that really hits you or that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you connect with.</v>

2161
01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're also saying this out of</v>

2162
01:32:38.711 --> 01:32:41.290
<v Speaker 4>your own personal experiences where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize you could,</v>

2163
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:45.060
<v Speaker 4>you could have not been you like easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could have not turned out into being</v>

2164
01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:45.581
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2165
01:32:45.581 --> 01:32:48.670
<v Speaker 4>if I were to sit down in a room with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people who know what's best,</v>

2166
01:32:48.671 --> 01:32:50.470
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't have been me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 4>You and most people that are successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2168
01:32:53.650 --> 01:32:54.580
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just how it is.</v>

2169
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 4>My first record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did shop to a few labels in town,</v>

2170
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:01.800
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a little bit ahead of,</v>

2171
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:06.280
<v Speaker 4>ahead of the whole neo trad curve that</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of kicked off in the last few</v>

2172
01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.410
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made this really traditional country</v>

2173
01:33:08.411 --> 01:33:10.000
<v Speaker 4>record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2174
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:11.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

2175
01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.660
<v Speaker 4>it was like hard country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very,</v>

2176
01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:16.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an album I always wanting to make</v>

2177
01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:20.140
<v Speaker 4>and we shopped it to a few people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just didn't really know it wasn't</v>

2178
01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:22.590
<v Speaker 4>the right time so nothing came of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2179
01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:24.880
<v Speaker 4>so we self released it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then when I did the second one,</v>

2180
01:33:24.881 --> 01:33:28.000
<v Speaker 4>the metal modern and now we've got this</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole record about like,</v>

2181
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mine</v>

2182
01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:34.890
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the journey of the soul or mind or</v>

2183
01:33:34.891 --> 01:33:36.570
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about turtles and fucking</v>

2184
01:33:36.571 --> 01:33:37.470
<v Speaker 4>tripping and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2185
01:33:37.650 --> 01:33:40.860
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew nobody is going to get this.</v>

2186
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:44.820
<v Speaker 4>Like I can waste time trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody to release or we can just put</v>

2187
01:33:44.821 --> 01:33:48.060
<v Speaker 4>the damn thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm so glad we did it that way just</v>

2188
01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:53.070
<v Speaker 4>because I know what happened was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>result of people hearing it and sharing</v>

2189
01:33:53.071 --> 01:33:55.830
<v Speaker 4>that with their friends 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I found out about it.</v>

2190
01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:59.010
<v Speaker 4>I found out about it for people online</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I got to tell you the cover of it</v>

2191
01:33:59.011 --> 01:34:00.090
<v Speaker 4>threw me off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At first.</v>

2192
01:34:00.570 --> 01:34:02.870
<v Speaker 4>The cover of it was that was me being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>smart ass,</v>

2193
01:34:02.871 --> 01:34:04.410
<v Speaker 4>cause I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all this like,</v>

2194
01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:06.203
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2195
01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:09.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to these festivals and stuff,</v>

2196
01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:11.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a grown ass man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2197
01:34:11.391 --> 01:34:15.620
<v Speaker 4>We're fucking stupid jobs now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in this all of a sudden this</v>

2198
01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:19.070
<v Speaker 4>position and going out playing all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>festivals and looking at these kids and</v>

2199
01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:20.600
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it and on this is great.</v>

2200
01:34:20.601 --> 01:34:22.550
<v Speaker 4>You make a lot of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's it,</v>

2201
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.400
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot in any industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of,</v>

2202
01:34:25.401 --> 01:34:28.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like for the wrong reasons,</v>

2203
01:34:28.131 --> 01:34:31.050
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just chasing something that they</v>

2204
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:34.340
<v Speaker 4>want to see themselves in as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>something they see within themselves.</v>

2205
01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:35.120
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2206
01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.790
<v Speaker 4>And so we started doing these festivals</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of like what they call</v>

2207
01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:41.990
<v Speaker 4>like the younger hipster kids and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they had these 10 type photos that</v>

2208
01:34:41.991 --> 01:34:44.150
<v Speaker 4>were really popular a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2209
01:34:44.151 --> 01:34:46.040
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can I out hipster the hipsters?</v>

2210
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:51.470
<v Speaker 4>So I'll do a painting of a 10 type photo</v>
<v Speaker 4>and surrounded by like the tackiest</v>

2211
01:34:51.471 --> 01:34:54.530
<v Speaker 4>outer space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My buddy that I did the thing with,</v>

2212
01:34:54.531 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 4>we were actually trying to make the</v>
<v Speaker 4>worst album cover of the year and we</v>

2213
01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:59.750
<v Speaker 4>ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we ended up making a top 10 list on</v>

2214
01:34:59.751 --> 01:35:01.310
<v Speaker 4>rolling stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We didn't get the cherry,</v>

2215
01:35:01.311 --> 01:35:02.144
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2216
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:06.050
<v Speaker 4>I was loose just making the tackiest</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing we possibly can.</v>

2217
01:35:06.051 --> 01:35:11.051
<v Speaker 4>I like the cheesy fonts and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kinda crazy because the music was</v>

2218
01:35:11.091 --> 01:35:13.370
<v Speaker 4>to me was so heavy and personal and</v>
<v Speaker 4>real,</v>

2219
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:14.721
<v Speaker 4>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2220
01:35:14.721 --> 01:35:17.030
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be the kind of wanting</v>

2221
01:35:17.031 --> 01:35:20.210
<v Speaker 4>to make fun of like the Dude levitating</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the fucking k before,</v>

2222
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:22.160
<v Speaker 4>before people turn you into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2223
01:35:22.161 --> 01:35:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Cause like that's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the shit was just stuff I've</v>

2224
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:28.940
<v Speaker 4>been reading about or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in character.</v>

2225
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was psychedelic country music.</v>

2226
01:35:30.801 --> 01:35:31.431
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2227
01:35:31.431 --> 01:35:34.610
<v Speaker 4>which is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love a lot of sixties rock and some of</v>

2228
01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:37.270
<v Speaker 4>my favorite country records ever made</v>
<v Speaker 4>were made in the late sixties.</v>

2229
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2230
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:42.710
<v Speaker 4>Gene Clark and some of the early vern</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gosdin brothers type stuff.</v>

2231
01:35:42.711 --> 01:35:45.320
<v Speaker 4>There was this level of Psychedelia and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the production that was made.</v>

2232
01:35:45.321 --> 01:35:47.610
<v Speaker 4>It was so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to get a list of shit to listen.</v>

2233
01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.600
<v Speaker 4>Well I'll throw you some shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2234
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:54.870
<v Speaker 4>but then talented guys and I was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a task masker so it's such a,</v>

2235
01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.410
<v Speaker 4>such a young band because they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>play loud and you've got to pull things</v>

2236
01:35:57.411 --> 01:36:00.050
<v Speaker 4>back or like you can only have this</v>
<v Speaker 4>symbol,</v>

2237
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.930
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing and get it down to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the structure of the songs.</v>

2238
01:36:02.931 --> 01:36:07.010
<v Speaker 4>And we spent like three months on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>road just carving those songs out and</v>

2239
01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:07.610
<v Speaker 4>the arrangements.</v>

2240
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:09.340
<v Speaker 4>And I had it pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2241
01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:11.930
<v Speaker 4>Doug Pussy tight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is waterproof.</v>

2242
01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:12.793
<v Speaker 4>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2243
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:16.550
<v Speaker 4>we came off the road and went right into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the studio the next day for four days</v>

2244
01:36:16.551 --> 01:36:18.350
<v Speaker 4>and just banged it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

2245
01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.510
<v Speaker 4>We're in the groove.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2246
01:36:20.511 --> 01:36:23.930
<v Speaker 4>Basically just plug up like five mics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't move anything and just lay it all</v>

2247
01:36:23.931 --> 01:36:25.910
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Dave and I are with the mixing</v>

2248
01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 4>and then he had some great ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 4>postproduction like getting the sounds</v>

2249
01:36:29.421 --> 01:36:33.050
<v Speaker 4>around but then you come back and we had</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these separated recordings.</v>

2250
01:36:33.051 --> 01:36:36.290
<v Speaker 4>So to me I've realized the real fun is</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting everything in sequence and</v>

2251
01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:41.291
<v Speaker 4>making these cycle to maximize I guess</v>
<v Speaker 4>the emotiveness of the records in terms</v>

2252
01:36:42.591 --> 01:36:45.620
<v Speaker 4>of a rollercoaster of emotions if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know instead of just one.</v>

2253
01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:48.710
<v Speaker 4>So like every time we do it now it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>always different.</v>

2254
01:36:49.690 --> 01:36:52.730
<v Speaker 4>Like the record I did after that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>recorded,</v>

2255
01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 4>that one a totally different way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still going fast.</v>

2256
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:59.180
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I are always wanted to make a big kind</v>

2257
01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:01.400
<v Speaker 4>of lush orchestra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all soul record.</v>

2258
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.410
<v Speaker 4>And then what I've learned is that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to be in the music business</v>

2259
01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:09.350
<v Speaker 4>because I'm going just going to be in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the surgical business.</v>

2260
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:13.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's this like the mechanical</v>

2261
01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:16.670
<v Speaker 4>timeline of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the time we go in and make that</v>

2262
01:37:16.671 --> 01:37:20.360
<v Speaker 4>record your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you've been processing and thinking</v>

2263
01:37:20.361 --> 01:37:24.800
<v Speaker 4>about it so much for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for months and you get in and you have</v>

2264
01:37:24.801 --> 01:37:27.710
<v Speaker 4>that release and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I equate it to driving in a</v>

2265
01:37:27.711 --> 01:37:31.070
<v Speaker 4>really heavy downpour rain storm for</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an extended period of time.</v>

2266
01:37:31.071 --> 01:37:34.160
<v Speaker 4>Or it's just like there's a mental</v>
<v Speaker 4>exhaustion that comes for it,</v>

2267
01:37:34.161 --> 01:37:37.220
<v Speaker 4>but you have to just kind of like keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>going and,</v>

2268
01:37:37.221 --> 01:37:40.610
<v Speaker 4>but by the time it's finished and mixed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've heard this thing like a thousand</v>

2269
01:37:40.611 --> 01:37:42.350
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't ever want to hear it again.</v>

2270
01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:45.070
<v Speaker 4>But now you got to go out and play it on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the road every night,</v>

2271
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:48.320
<v Speaker 4>a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were constantly trying to reinvent</v>

2272
01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 4>every night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to keep that fresh and exciting</v>

2273
01:37:51.210 --> 01:37:54.860
<v Speaker 4>while while holding the pause button on</v>
<v Speaker 4>going over here and recording what</v>

2274
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 4>creatively</v>

2275
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:58.350
<v Speaker 1>you may already be on to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2276
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:01.440
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized this year I'm going to take</v>

2277
01:38:01.441 --> 01:38:04.710
<v Speaker 1>the reins and want to do like I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play 30 festivals because those</v>

2278
01:38:04.711 --> 01:38:07.680
<v Speaker 1>things are always so fun just to go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get all the energy in your face.</v>

2279
01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:11.660
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to do probably a</v>
<v Speaker 1>double album and another record and just</v>

2280
01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:15.120
<v Speaker 1>recorded also that when I do turn around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and want to go do like a really big long</v>

2281
01:38:15.121 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 1>two year tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have all this new material and the</v>

2282
01:38:17.821 --> 01:38:20.190
<v Speaker 1>old stuff to pull from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like how you,</v>

2283
01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you're approaching it and so like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching like a plan.</v>

2284
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It is a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at it like a plan.</v>

2285
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you think everybody does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2286
01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:30.870
<v Speaker 1>there's all kinds of different plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know it works for me.</v>

2287
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I've learned more importantly what works</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my family and my sanity.</v>

2288
01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to go play 300 shows a</v>

2289
01:38:36.481 --> 01:38:38.550
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2290
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather go play</v>

2291
01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:46.800
<v Speaker 1>30 or 60 shows and know that every one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those was 110% as opposed to,</v>

2292
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got the Tuesday and Wednesday shows</v>

2293

<v Speaker 1>to get you to this weekend market where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's counting their checks</v>

2294

<v Speaker 1>already and shit and you're exhausted</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the show suffer and these people</v>

2295
01:38:55.831 --> 01:38:58.220
<v Speaker 1>pay money or maybe they don't realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2296
01:38:58.221 --> 01:39:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't hear anything for 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes cause you don't ever want her</v>

2297
01:39:00.871 --> 01:39:03.810
<v Speaker 1>project negativity from the stage if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can help it.</v>

2298
01:39:03.811 --> 01:39:06.690
<v Speaker 1>But there's going to be bad nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went every night to be great and</v>

2299
01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:10.290
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly right now for me,</v>

2300
01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the fun is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the studio and the,</v>

2301
01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:17.940
<v Speaker 1>the process of trying to push it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to what's next.</v>

2302
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.040
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you totally different albums.</v>

2303
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Every time you put an album out it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like completely [inaudible].</v>

2304
01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm a music listener in lover first and</v>
<v Speaker 1>foremost.</v>

2305
01:39:24.991 --> 01:39:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Probably musicologists more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>musician at this.</v>

2306
01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that a word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess that's my field of study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2308
01:39:30.991 --> 01:39:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Ecologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2309
01:39:31.710 --> 01:39:36.150
<v Speaker 1>If I had to like say that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed over one subject enough to</v>

2310
01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:38.760
<v Speaker 1>where somebody should probably give me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking piece of paper that says I know</v>

2311
01:39:38.761 --> 01:39:40.170
<v Speaker 1>what I'm talking about is probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

2312
01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>

2313
01:39:44.050 --> 01:39:46.500
<v Speaker 1>when did it start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have this your whole life early,</v>

2314
01:39:46.501 --> 01:39:48.000
<v Speaker 1>early after a whole life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2315
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Probably honestly first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2316
01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:53.850
<v Speaker 1>from Michael Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was like,</v>

2317
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:55.560
<v Speaker 1>you know what's Kinda fucked up about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

2318
01:39:55.650 --> 01:40:00.650
<v Speaker 1>But you wouldn't have been you if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't come into this so late.</v>

2319
01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.000
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

2320
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.420
<v Speaker 1>your hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then your hard life,</v>

2321
01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:04.231
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your whole life.</v>

2322
01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:05.550
<v Speaker 1>You'd loved music.</v>

2323
01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:08.450
<v Speaker 1>You could have easily just been on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>path from the time you were in high</v>

2324
01:40:08.451 --> 01:40:09.870
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll always played.</v>

2325
01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm glad I never like right.</v>

2326
01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Recorded anything right until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2327
01:40:14.761 --> 01:40:15.720
<v Speaker 1>cause when you're younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2328
01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Eric Clapton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love her clapping.</v>

2329
01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Huge influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never met the guy.</v>

2330
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:21.820
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great documentary that came</v>

2331
01:40:21.821 --> 01:40:23.190
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can look back in his career.</v>

2332
01:40:23.191 --> 01:40:26.730
<v Speaker 1>He was so young and passionate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented.</v>

2333
01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one particular record he did</v>

2334
01:40:29.071 --> 01:40:31.530
<v Speaker 1>with a guy named John Mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like kind of the birth of like</v>

2335
01:40:31.531 --> 01:40:34.530
<v Speaker 1>rock and roll guitar tone is the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time everybody plugged a Les Paul and a</v>

2336
01:40:34.531 --> 01:40:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Marshall and just crank the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and that record that sound,</v>

2337
01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:41.580
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the thing that happened.</v>

2338
01:40:41.581 --> 01:40:45.330
<v Speaker 1>But you can look at his career and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was such a chameleon going through all</v>

2339
01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:49.500
<v Speaker 1>these phases and a lot of it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>emulation or re-interpretation because</v>

2340
01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:49.860
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2341
01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 1>got into substance abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see how much his career</v>

2342
01:40:53.711 --> 01:40:57.340
<v Speaker 1>shaped him more so than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the people he'd been around and</v>

2343
01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.940
<v Speaker 1>was friends with an exposed to and him</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbing off on them and vice a versa.</v>

2344
01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you'll,</v>

2345
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody in their twenties is still,</v>

2346
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.140
<v Speaker 1>anybody I know in their twenties is</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely still figuring out who they</v>

2347
01:41:08.141 --> 01:41:09.970
<v Speaker 1>are as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much less than artist.</v>

2348
01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost 40 and I'm still figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I am as an artist,</v>

2349
01:41:13.661 --> 01:41:15.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause every year,</v>

2350
01:41:15.431 --> 01:41:17.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel different every</v>

2351
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:18.520
<v Speaker 1>fucking day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less two years from now and it's</v>

2352
01:41:18.521 --> 01:41:19.920
<v Speaker 1>time to make a record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.790
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to change it up as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see fit.</v>

2354
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:25.570
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go with what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in your mind right now.</v>

2355
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful thing.</v>

2356
01:41:27.101 --> 01:41:27.934
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a,</v>

2357
01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean even though you have like a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of entity behind you in terms of</v>

2358
01:41:32.531 --> 01:41:35.560
<v Speaker 1>like people carrying your stuff and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jazz,</v>

2359
01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:37.420
<v Speaker 1>it's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the equipment that's involved in</v>

2360
01:41:37.421 --> 01:41:39.400
<v Speaker 1>doing one of your shows are very few</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2361
01:41:39.490 --> 01:41:40.323
<v Speaker 1>How many people you got?</v>

2362
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

2363
01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 1>three members of the band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a tour manager,</v>

2364
01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.570
<v Speaker 1>we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our side monitor sound guy,</v>

2365
01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the front sound guy and my merch girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See he got blind penile keep us with,</v>

2366
01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:01.460
<v Speaker 1>with the driver's side and I'll always</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in one bus and we got one truck to</v>

2367
01:42:01.571 --> 01:42:06.220
<v Speaker 1>haul the gear and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty minimal compared to some</v>

2368
01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:08.290
<v Speaker 1>bands in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in respect.</v>

2369
01:42:08.291 --> 01:42:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Like what you do kind of shows you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to that.</v>

2370
01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:12.610
<v Speaker 1>That is pretty minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2371
01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I would like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would keep it there as long as</v>

2372
01:42:14.591 --> 01:42:18.130
<v Speaker 1>possible no matter what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because,</v>

2373
01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been like a big lights guy or</v>

2374
01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.650
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just putting away,</v>

2375
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:24.640
<v Speaker 1>those guys in my band are all pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing players.</v>

2376
01:42:24.641 --> 01:42:28.700
<v Speaker 1>We try to go out and put a show on if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were doing something else though,</v>

2377
01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:32.140
<v Speaker 1>like say if you are a part of a band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that band was being promoted very</v>

2378
01:42:32.141 --> 01:42:35.590
<v Speaker 1>heavily by some record company that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the band together,</v>

2379
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2380
01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do like those manufactured bands or</v>

2381
01:42:39.281 --> 01:42:40.114
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2382
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:44.200
<v Speaker 1>You'd be in a situation where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically required to do commercially</v>

2383
01:42:44.201 --> 01:42:48.370
<v Speaker 1>successful and viable music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't just free ball like you're</v>

2384
01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:51.190
<v Speaker 1>doing and doing whatever you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2385
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I honestly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2386
01:42:53.531 --> 01:42:56.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I know is that what's happened to me</v>

2387
01:42:57.730 --> 01:43:00.100
<v Speaker 1>and most of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my friends are people that are</v>

2388
01:43:00.101 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 1>just kind of do their thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's definitely is that element.</v>

2389
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:04.743
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2390
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:07.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only,</v>

2391
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I'd ever sign with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>record label.</v>

2392
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2393
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:13.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never had any interest in it whatsoever.</v>

2394
01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we,</v>

2395
01:43:16.481 --> 01:43:18.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

01:43:23.611 --> 01:43:27.270
<v Speaker 1>just sort of subcontractor my team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing I,</v>

2399
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:32.460
<v Speaker 1>the only reason any artist should ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>signed with a record label is for larger</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still recording that,</v>

2407
01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2408
01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:54.650
<v Speaker 4>my favorite city of Nashville is nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>fancy about it.</v>

2409
01:43:54.651 --> 01:43:59.651
<v Speaker 4>It's just money for players and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and gear you might not have or a and</v>

2410
01:44:01.431 --> 01:44:05.030
<v Speaker 4>then mixing and then the more time to</v>
<v Speaker 4>spend in the studio,</v>

2411
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:06.321
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2412
01:44:06.321 --> 01:44:06.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2413
01:44:06.851 --> 01:44:09.110
<v Speaker 4>we did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did matter modern and three or four</v>

2414
01:44:09.111 --> 01:44:11.660
<v Speaker 4>days because we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't necessarily,</v>

2415
01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark side of the moon was made like nine</v>

2416
01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:14.340
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2417
01:44:14.370 --> 01:44:15.500
<v Speaker 4>That's a funny way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2418
01:44:15.501 --> 01:44:17.300
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was definitely like two separate</v>

2419
01:44:17.301 --> 01:44:18.780
<v Speaker 4>extended sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2420
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:22.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't just for me it's the,</v>

2421
01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 4>that's the fun is sitting in that room</v>
<v Speaker 4>and figuring out how to break shit and</v>

2422
01:44:25.671 --> 01:44:28.190
<v Speaker 4>make sounds I haven't heard before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you need time to do that.</v>

2423
01:44:28.191 --> 01:44:29.870
<v Speaker 4>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2424
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:32.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

2425
01:44:33.570 --> 01:44:34.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can,</v>

2426
01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:37.430
<v Speaker 4>you can make great records for very</v>
<v Speaker 4>little money to,</v>

2427
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.250
<v Speaker 4>so what's the benefit of having a record</v>
<v Speaker 4>company?</v>

2428
01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.320
<v Speaker 4>They pay for the gear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2429
01:44:42.321 --> 01:44:44.950
<v Speaker 4>they pay for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the benefit of having a record company</v>

2430
01:44:44.951 --> 01:44:46.190
<v Speaker 4>is simply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2431
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.720
<v Speaker 4>somebody else pockets or you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all comes back on you.</v>

2432
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:52.490
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't want to pull the curtain back</v>

2433
01:44:52.491 --> 01:44:53.660
<v Speaker 4>too much here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're basically,</v>

2434
01:44:53.661 --> 01:44:56.090
<v Speaker 4>I looked at it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2435
01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.630
<v Speaker 4>going into business with a bank for at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least two records,</v>

2436
01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:02.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take out a loan that I'm pretty sure</v>

2437
01:45:02.271 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll never pay back because I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 4>recoup,</v>

2438
01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:06.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in there.</v>

2439
01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:11.801
<v Speaker 4>But I feel like I'm more of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all comes down to the bean counters</v>

2440
01:45:12.621 --> 01:45:13.191
<v Speaker 4>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2441
01:45:13.191 --> 01:45:17.210
<v Speaker 4>I know my records sell to 300,000 copies</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at some point they'll have to decide</v>

2442
01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:21.440
<v Speaker 4>whether that's fiscally viable to them</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore because they don't,</v>

2443
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:24.080
<v Speaker 4>they don't make any money off me unless</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sell records.</v>

2444
01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:25.940
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't,</v>

2445
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 4>it was a very friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>structured deal like touring and all</v>

2446
01:45:28.821 --> 01:45:28.970
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2447
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:31.460
<v Speaker 4>Publishing shits completely separate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has nothing to do.</v>

2448
01:45:31.461 --> 01:45:35.990
<v Speaker 4>I just make records and they have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sell them and I get to make the records</v>

2449
01:45:35.991 --> 01:45:38.390
<v Speaker 4>that I maybe couldn't or would make on</v>
<v Speaker 4>my own,</v>

2450
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:40.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But outside of that,</v>

2451
01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:41.970
<v Speaker 4>a record company or perform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2452
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:47.590
<v Speaker 4>provides marketing or reach or push or</v>
<v Speaker 4>even sadly in the music business,</v>

2453
01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:51.170
<v Speaker 4>there's probably less bullshit and</v>
<v Speaker 4>politics.</v>

2454
01:45:51.171 --> 01:45:53.180
<v Speaker 4>There may even be less politics and</v>
<v Speaker 4>politics.</v>

2455
01:45:53.210 --> 01:45:54.770
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2456
01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:58.460
<v Speaker 4>I probably would not have been up for</v>
<v Speaker 4>album of the year at the grammy's last</v>

2457
01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:01.670
<v Speaker 4>year had I been on 30 tigers as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to Atlantic records.</v>

2458
01:46:01.671 --> 01:46:03.510
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2459
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:05.480
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a great record.</v>

2460
01:46:05.481 --> 01:46:08.720
<v Speaker 4>I know I deserve to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wouldn't have happened if you</v>

2461
01:46:08.721 --> 01:46:11.660
<v Speaker 4>didn't have that kind of weight at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>table.</v>

2462
01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 4>It's very honest and that can make you</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like jaded against it all.</v>

2463
01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:16.850
<v Speaker 4>Or you can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2464
01:46:16.851 --> 01:46:20.620
<v Speaker 4>well you know Wiz Khalifa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably spend more money on</v>

2465
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:24.410
<v Speaker 4>marketing one single for Wiz Khalifa</v>
<v Speaker 4>than the mind higher project costs.</v>

2466
01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:29.540
<v Speaker 4>So because they make all those records</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Bruno Mars or whoever sells 18</v>

2467
01:46:29.541 --> 01:46:33.980
<v Speaker 4>gazillion records,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys like me get to make records and</v>

2468
01:46:33.981 --> 01:46:37.280
<v Speaker 4>that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a trickle down</v>

2469
01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:41.750
<v Speaker 4>and it's all based on the money that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made from a long time ago.</v>

2470
01:46:41.751 --> 01:46:43.680
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then maintaining some sort of,</v>

2471
01:46:43.690 --> 01:46:44.960
<v Speaker 4>they're still making money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2472
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:46.460
<v Speaker 4>The streaming thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2473
01:46:46.461 --> 01:46:49.070
<v Speaker 4>they're all in bed now with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>streaming services we've talked about.</v>

2474
01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 4>Province</v>

2475
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.470
<v Speaker 1>steadily climbed back down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not really for me.</v>

2476
01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Really truly artists crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing against spotify.</v>

2477
01:46:55.771 --> 01:46:57.360
<v Speaker 1>I know people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that shit,</v>

2478
01:46:57.361 --> 01:47:00.210
<v Speaker 1>but look at it like this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are streaming music,</v>

2479
01:47:00.450 --> 01:47:03.690
<v Speaker 1>they're not buying records anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still finding your music.</v>

2480
01:47:03.691 --> 01:47:04.920
<v Speaker 1>There's still telling their friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2481
01:47:04.921 --> 01:47:08.310
<v Speaker 1>They're still coming to your show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how we get paid playing shows.</v>

2482
01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:13.050
<v Speaker 1>They're still your family so you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>either embrace it or go fucking do</v>

2483
01:47:13.051 --> 01:47:14.870
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2484
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:16.260
<v Speaker 1>that's good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now when,</v>

2485
01:47:16.261 --> 01:47:18.840
<v Speaker 1>when spotify starts kicking songwriters</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 points,</v>

2486
01:47:18.841 --> 01:47:21.690
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do commercials for them until then,</v>

2487
01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are doing,</v>

2488
01:47:23.761 --> 01:47:27.230
<v Speaker 1>whether you realize it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it does count up but it counts</v>

2489
01:47:27.231 --> 01:47:28.860
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is a weird thing when it's very</v>

2490
01:47:28.861 --> 01:47:31.410
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All is based on you selling art and you</v>

2491
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.180
<v Speaker 1>don't pay for it specifically.</v>

2492
01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Even even with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel more like Atlantic went into</v>

2493
01:47:35.641 --> 01:47:38.640
<v Speaker 1>business with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fill in many ways still feel like a</v>

2494
01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 1>very independent minded artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

2495
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's telling me what to do.</v>

2496
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a manager or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically a publicist at this point.</v>

2497
01:47:47.401 --> 01:47:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sort of floating and making</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing songs and making records and</v>

2498
01:47:51.421 --> 01:47:53.970
<v Speaker 1>then we'd go play shows and that's if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just keep that.</v>

2499
01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

2500
01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:59.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've in the last figure five years,</v>

2501
01:47:59.311 --> 01:48:04.311
<v Speaker 1>figured out where I want to be and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of it mean and something to me and</v>

2502
01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm getting and giving back with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fans.</v>

2503
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also when,</v>

2504
01:48:10.591 --> 01:48:13.890
<v Speaker 1>if you can stick into that groove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay in that groove right there.</v>

2505
01:48:13.891 --> 01:48:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You can maintain who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

2506
01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you could still explore new ideas.</v>

2507
01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:20.130
<v Speaker 1>You can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

2508
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not being pushed too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2509
01:48:22.021 --> 01:48:23.970
<v Speaker 1>if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were like being pushed to</v>

2510
01:48:23.971 --> 01:48:27.030
<v Speaker 1>constantly produce new stuff and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

2511
01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine that wears on artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2512
01:48:29.511 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I just spent so much of my early life</v>
<v Speaker 1>working for other people.</v>

2513
01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I just made a 0.1 day where I'm before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to Nashville.</v>

2514
01:48:35.401 --> 01:48:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to work for anybody else</v>

2515
01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.330
<v Speaker 1>unless it's something somebody I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>admire or as like a really exciting</v>

2516
01:48:42.331 --> 01:48:46.020
<v Speaker 1>creative thing that like I feel like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could benefit from or learn from being</v>

2517
01:48:46.021 --> 01:48:48.780
<v Speaker 1>involved with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that thousand percent but</v>

2518
01:48:48.781 --> 01:48:50.580
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is when I talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast,</v>

2519
01:48:50.581 --> 01:48:54.210
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people who don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do work for someone to have a job.</v>

2520
01:48:54.211 --> 01:48:55.740
<v Speaker 1>They get upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like,</v>

2521
01:48:55.741 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like you're talking down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

2522
01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is you're working there</v>
<v Speaker 1>for money.</v>

2523
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.700
<v Speaker 1>We've all done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worked for my boys worth</v>

2524
01:49:03.730 --> 01:49:04.830
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of my jobs,</v>

2525
01:49:04.831 --> 01:49:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I loved the railroad game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this all gave up tomorrow,</v>

2526
01:49:07.471 --> 01:49:08.790
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be just fine.</v>

2527
01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I go back to the railroad and be totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to go out and throw switches 12</v>

2528
01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:13.770
<v Speaker 1>hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having my four days off and make a good</v>

2529
01:49:13.771 --> 01:49:15.630
<v Speaker 1>salary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2530
01:49:15.631 --> 01:49:17.190
<v Speaker 1>whistle while I work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that Shit,</v>

2531
01:49:17.191 --> 01:49:18.024
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2532
01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but a plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hurt to have a plan B,</v>

2533
01:49:21.781 --> 01:49:25.110
<v Speaker 1>but no working for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was never something I enjoyed,</v>

2534
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:29.190
<v Speaker 1>but I think anybody that even hears a</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that the reality is if someone gave</v>

2535
01:49:29.191 --> 01:49:31.350
<v Speaker 1>them the option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to work ever again.</v>

2536
01:49:32.150 --> 01:49:32.830
<v Speaker 1>They'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2537
01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 1>what would you do though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd do whatever you want.</v>

2538
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:36.390
<v Speaker 1>What I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2539
01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I would fill my day up with learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2540
01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.020
<v Speaker 1>You're one of the busiest fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2541
01:49:40.021 --> 01:49:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I know though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a job,</v>

2542
01:49:41.491 --> 01:49:42.630
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2543
01:49:42.850 --> 01:49:45.660
<v Speaker 1>you were very proactive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human being.</v>

2544
01:49:46.290 --> 01:49:47.123
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

2545
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>you want all day long,</v>

2546
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:50.360
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean you're not working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not benefit.</v>

2547
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I do whatever I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I earn it like I do shit.</v>

2548
01:49:53.650 --> 01:49:55.210
<v Speaker 4>I earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I have to,</v>

2549
01:49:55.211 --> 01:49:57.820
<v Speaker 4>I have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing with my job does,</v>

2550
01:49:57.821 --> 01:49:59.980
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't feel like work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2551
01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:04.870
<v Speaker 4>There are parts that did feel like work</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I identified that really have</v>

2552
01:50:04.871 --> 01:50:08.100
<v Speaker 4>nothing to do with what I want to wake</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and do this now.</v>

2553
01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:11.620
<v Speaker 4>I just don't do those things and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2554
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:13.343
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2555
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:18.460
<v Speaker 2>the travel sometimes feels like work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that I do or don't feel like</v>

2556
01:50:18.461 --> 01:50:20.410
<v Speaker 2>working like this does definitely never</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like work.</v>

2557
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Podcasts don't feel like work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stand up doesn't feel like work.</v>

2558
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Working for the UFC doesn't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2559
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Those things don't feel like work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff in between those things to</v>

2560
01:50:28.391 --> 01:50:30.310
<v Speaker 2>make sure those things work well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the work.</v>

2561
01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do,</v>

2562
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:36.430
<v Speaker 2>do you handle the day to day admin or</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% yeah.</v>

2563
01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have an assistant.</v>

2564
01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.580
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my take is always,</v>

2565
01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.980
<v Speaker 2>if you need an assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do less shit.</v>

2566
01:50:43.410 --> 01:50:47.920
<v Speaker 2>You don't want someone that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly check in on and make sure</v>

2567
01:50:47.921 --> 01:50:50.130
<v Speaker 2>that they've got their shit together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had some friends that had</v>

2568
01:50:50.131 --> 01:50:53.340
<v Speaker 2>assistants and then your life becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life and your problems come their</v>

2569
01:50:53.341 --> 01:50:56.070
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their problems become your problems as</v>

2570
01:50:56.071 --> 01:50:57.990
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody you invite into your life,</v>

2571
01:50:57.991 --> 01:50:59.720
<v Speaker 2>you're inviting their problems into your</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

2572
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.430
<v Speaker 2>That's ultimately what I've learned and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

2573
01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think in my case</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary.</v>

2574
01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe other people are more busy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need assistance and nine,</v>

2575
01:51:08.190 --> 01:51:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of friends who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>assistants a lot,</v>

2576
01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just thought,</v>

2577
01:51:13.951 --> 01:51:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't function that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I I want to,</v>

2578
01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.970
<v Speaker 2>when I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I set my,</v>

2579
01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I have a bunch of Shit I'm going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2580

<v Speaker 2>schedule.</v>

2586
01:51:29.901 --> 01:51:32.720
<v Speaker 4>most empathetic human being I've ever</v>

<v Speaker 2>feel good.</v>

2617
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me good.</v>

2618
01:52:45.261 --> 01:52:47.870
<v Speaker 2>It's when I get shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes me feel like shit is when I'm</v>

2619
01:52:47.871 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 2>lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I get anxiety depressed,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I'm getting anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>done and people think that,</v>

2622
01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:57.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I work hard and I'm constantly</v>

2623
01:52:57.681 --> 01:53:00.200
<v Speaker 2>doing something that I never feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that now I definitely will feel like</v>

2624
01:53:00.201 --> 01:53:02.120
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw something recently.</v>

2625
01:53:02.630 --> 01:53:07.630
<v Speaker 2>They proved that task completion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain releases a chemical that</v>

2626
01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:10.100
<v Speaker 2>makes you fucking feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man,</v>

2627
01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did something on purpose.</v>

2628
01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.900
<v Speaker 2>When you finish your album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're done phasing.</v>

2629
01:53:15.110 --> 01:53:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also terrifying.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Of course I'm short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2631
01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:19.370

<v Speaker 2>I got to like release that.</v>

2632
01:53:19.630 --> 01:53:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to hear that shit.</v>

2633
01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.810
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does feel like</v>

2634
01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 2>a release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the best way to put it.</v>

2635
01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody should experience</v>

2636
01:53:31.281 --> 01:53:32.300
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in a small,</v>

2637
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I think little kids get that when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>earn their fucking karate belt belts and</v>

2638
01:53:36.281 --> 01:53:38.970
<v Speaker 2>they see a little kid get a yellow belt</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they tie it on there beaming it's</v>

2639
01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:40.160
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2640
01:53:40.161 --> 01:53:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

2641
01:53:41.661 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And give him my oldest to hire fire for</v>

2642
01:53:44.181 --> 01:53:48.170
<v Speaker 2>anything and it's like you see them</v>
<v Speaker 2>light up that affirmation.</v>

2643
01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting something done.</v>

2644
01:53:49.521 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 2>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't,</v>

2645
01:53:50.391 --> 01:53:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about what specialty when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about like little</v>

2646
01:53:53.031 --> 01:53:55.970
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my seven year old loves to draw.</v>

2647
01:53:55.971 --> 01:54:00.290
<v Speaker 2>She's really into art and like she takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of paper and this is not a big</v>

2648
01:54:00.291 --> 01:54:03.290
<v Speaker 2>deal to us as grown men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She takes a piece of paper and that</v>

2649
01:54:03.291 --> 01:54:06.410
<v Speaker 2>paper is blank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in her little brain she decides it's</v>

2650
01:54:06.411 --> 01:54:07.610
<v Speaker 2>going to be on that paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2651
01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to draw a dog and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a dog and I'm going to draw a dog</v>

2652
01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:12.344
<v Speaker 2>that has a wing,</v>

2653
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 5>also has a tail and has a tale that</v>
<v Speaker 5>grows out of his forehead and they just</v>

2654
01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:19.130
<v Speaker 5>make wacky shit up and she thinks it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking hilarious.</v>

2655
01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:22.130
<v Speaker 5>Like gluck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a tail on his head high,</v>

2656
01:54:22.370 --> 01:54:26.570
<v Speaker 5>but in her little mind she's learning</v>
<v Speaker 5>that she can do whatever the fuck she</v>

2657
01:54:26.571 --> 01:54:29.660
<v Speaker 5>wants with that time then you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>

2658
01:54:29.690 --> 01:54:32.750
<v Speaker 5>No one's saying anything and little kids</v>
<v Speaker 5>gravitate towards that man.</v>

2659
01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:36.980
<v Speaker 5>When little kids start drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they gravitate towards this expansion of</v>

2660
01:54:36.981 --> 01:54:40.250
<v Speaker 5>the creative aspects of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like whatever it is in your mind that</v>

2661
01:54:40.251 --> 01:54:43.400
<v Speaker 5>causes you to have these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever in your mind that causes you to</v>

2662
01:54:43.401 --> 01:54:48.110
<v Speaker 5>think of a story that you want to write</v>
<v Speaker 5>down or up a drawing that you want to</v>

2663
01:54:48.111 --> 01:54:52.130
<v Speaker 5>try to accomplish and try to put down</v>
<v Speaker 5>those little things to a kid or magical</v>

2664
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:54.290
<v Speaker 5>because they didn't have any of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

2665
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:56.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just learned how to talk.</v>

2666
01:54:56.361 --> 01:54:58.790
<v Speaker 5>She seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's only been talking for five and a</v>

2667
01:54:58.791 --> 01:55:00.140
<v Speaker 5>half years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2668
01:55:00.141 --> 01:55:03.230
<v Speaker 5>all that other stuff before is jibberish</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all of a sudden she's sitting in</v>

2669
01:55:03.231 --> 01:55:05.030
<v Speaker 5>front of the pad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one tells her what to do.</v>

2670
01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.590
<v Speaker 5>Little seven year old like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hmm,</v>

2671
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:08.770
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm going to paint today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She gets,</v>

2672
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:10.910
<v Speaker 5>gets out the paint and it just puts a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little,</v>

2673
01:55:10.911 --> 01:55:11.744
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little of that.</v>

2674
01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:14.120
<v Speaker 5>You're flexing those little muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2675
01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:18.020
<v Speaker 5>just as if you were doing pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your flex in those creative fields,</v>

2676
01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:21.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to encourage that with kids.</v>

2677
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:24.530
<v Speaker 5>That's what we all love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all love doing something and people</v>

2678
01:55:24.531 --> 01:55:24.921
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2679
01:55:24.921 --> 01:55:27.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm not very creative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just like working with wood tea that</v>

2680
01:55:27.771 --> 01:55:30.500
<v Speaker 5>is fucking creative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like carpenters,</v>

2681
01:55:30.501 --> 01:55:32.180
<v Speaker 5>a guy named Craig,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you built a house,</v>

2682
01:55:32.181 --> 01:55:34.280
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you understand you can't do that.</v>

2683
01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.540
<v Speaker 5>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in,</v>

2684
01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:39.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm in all of that pleasing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grew up around construction.</v>

2685
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.500
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You build a bad ass house.</v>

2686
01:55:42.501 --> 01:55:44.670
<v Speaker 5>That shit is to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or people that are like highly</v>

2687
01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:48.180
<v Speaker 5>mechanical inclined can can just take a</v>
<v Speaker 5>car completely appointing and put it</v>

2688
01:55:48.181 --> 01:55:50.310
<v Speaker 5>back together in the garage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always been really envious.</v>

2689
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 5>Build cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's art.</v>

2690
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.960
<v Speaker 5>That's art mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's an art to even being a mechanic.</v>

2691
01:55:54.961 --> 01:55:56.130
<v Speaker 5>Just doing it all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>

2692
01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:58.110
<v Speaker 5>Putting it together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>using your mind,</v>

2693
01:55:58.111 --> 01:56:01.740
<v Speaker 5>thinking out how did it maybe a good</v>
<v Speaker 5>bore out this and put that in and swap</v>

2694
01:56:01.741 --> 01:56:03.870
<v Speaker 5>this out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what's the issue with the vehicle?</v>

2695
01:56:03.871 --> 01:56:06.390
<v Speaker 5>And there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's like there's a creative aspect</v>

2696
01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:09.600
<v Speaker 5>to anything that's really satisfying and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

2697
01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we kinda pound that out of kids,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2699
01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:13.493
<v Speaker 5>I think that's</v>

2700
01:56:15.410 --> 01:56:17.650
<v Speaker 4>very true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We pounded out of true,</v>

2701
01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:18.261
<v Speaker 4>we will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2702
01:56:18.261 --> 01:56:20.900
<v Speaker 4>it has no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't serve capitalism.</v>

2703
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2704
01:56:22.131 --> 01:56:23.330
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2705
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:25.070
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2706
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:30.140
<v Speaker 4>like I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this just train job and the first</v>

2707
01:56:30.141 --> 01:56:31.790
<v Speaker 4>year I was there I was just like out on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground,</v>

2708
01:56:32.410 --> 01:56:35.150
<v Speaker 4>like throwing the switches and</v>
<v Speaker 4>disconnect and the trains and hooking</v>

2709
01:56:35.151 --> 01:56:37.520
<v Speaker 4>them back up and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I got,</v>

2710
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:41.120
<v Speaker 4>I got promoted to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they call the yard master or like</v>

2711
01:56:41.121 --> 01:56:44.090
<v Speaker 4>whether you your a yard balls and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the truck and you're sort of in</v>

<v Speaker 4>charge of the inbound and outbound</v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest and everything that comes in</v>

2713

<v Speaker 4>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what gets blocked apart and switched</v>

2714
01:56:50.691 --> 01:56:53.200
<v Speaker 4>over to this track and you're building</v>
<v Speaker 4>other trains and you've got to get them</v>

2715
01:56:53.201 --> 01:56:55.330
<v Speaker 4>out of Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like as soon as they put me in that</v>

2716
01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:57.470
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like the greatest job I've ever</v>

2717
01:56:57.471 --> 01:56:58.790
<v Speaker 4>had because I was playing tetris.</v>

2718
01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.210

<v Speaker 4>cause it's high pressure.</v>

2723
01:57:12.381 --> 01:57:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only three guys out there and</v>

<v Speaker 4>desperation.</v>

2752
01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:27.580
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the man I think of those men</v>

2753
01:58:27.581 --> 01:58:31.540
<v Speaker 4>that have fallen into some salary</v>
<v Speaker 4>position where they're not happy and</v>

2754
01:58:31.541 --> 01:58:33.910
<v Speaker 4>they want to get out and they don't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>how well they have.</v>

2755
01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:36.760
<v Speaker 4>They have the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the downfall of being highly efficient</v>

2756
01:58:36.761 --> 01:58:39.760
<v Speaker 4>individuals and other ceos recognize</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and be like,</v>

2758
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.620
<v Speaker 1>hours a week and you're going to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>done because you won't let yourself</v>

2759
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:47.410
<v Speaker 1>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll probably fucking drink five</v>

2760
01:58:47.411 --> 01:58:49.670
<v Speaker 1>pots of coffee a day and listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>sturgeon.</v>

2761
01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you keep going,</v>

2762
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:52.660
<v Speaker 1>you've got a good position in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

2763
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a bright future.</v>

2764
01:58:54.850 --> 01:58:58.090
<v Speaker 1>He didn't make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>401K 51,</v>

2765
01:58:58.091 --> 01:59:00.400
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I'm making those numbers up.</v>

2766
01:59:01.450 --> 01:59:02.800
<v Speaker 1>All that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2767
01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.560
<v Speaker 1>It's most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2768
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:10.540
<v Speaker 1>people get tired of people hearing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know what to do.</v>

2769
01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And so I didn't know what to do forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2770
01:59:13.901 --> 01:59:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I would just work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2771
01:59:15.130 --> 01:59:16.270
<v Speaker 1>but then you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2772
01:59:16.271 --> 01:59:19.270
<v Speaker 1>you always played music but never</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was something you could even</v>

2773
01:59:19.271 --> 01:59:22.240
<v Speaker 1>do for a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have non well known where to</v>

2774
01:59:22.241 --> 01:59:26.320
<v Speaker 1>go or how to do that until uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary's my loss Martin mean Wednesday and</v>

2775
01:59:26.321 --> 01:59:26.831
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2776
01:59:26.831 --> 01:59:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm really unhappy.</v>

2777
01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:29.470
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're supposed to be</v>

2778
01:59:29.471 --> 01:59:30.760
<v Speaker 1>playing music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb ass.</v>

2779
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:32.620
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

2780
01:59:32.650 --> 01:59:33.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably true.</v>

2781
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you did it earlier,</v>

2782
01:59:36.370 --> 01:59:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest thing ever.</v>

2783
01:59:38.711 --> 01:59:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like you had to go through all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit to get the sound that you have</v>

2784
01:59:41.681 --> 01:59:44.080
<v Speaker 1>now to get to the soul behind it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have now.</v>

2785
01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:47.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the sound of a man who suffered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2786
01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:50.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a sound of a man who understands</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the woes as me.</v>

2787
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.020
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real,</v>

2788
01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:54.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a real emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2789
01:59:54.970 --> 01:59:57.070
<v Speaker 1>like that Jolene song that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2790
01:59:57.180 --> 01:59:58.540
<v Speaker 1>it's your all is lost though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2791
01:59:58.541 --> 02:00:00.970
<v Speaker 1>If it had happened when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had been way more interesting to</v>

2792
02:00:00.971 --> 02:00:03.370
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have fucked it up so hard.</v>

2793
02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

2794
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:10.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's props to Justin Bieber and</v>

2795
02:00:10.841 --> 02:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>we were hitting me and I'm just keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>it together.</v>

2796
02:00:13.450 --> 02:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2797
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to complain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2798
02:00:17.651 --> 02:00:18.760
<v Speaker 1>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a great,</v>

2799
02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.860
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great band and families healthy.</v>

2800
02:00:21.150 --> 02:00:24.040
<v Speaker 1>You're in the groove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the room doing my thing as far as</v>

2801
02:00:24.041 --> 02:00:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in what my friend Vinny shoreman</v>

2802
02:00:26.801 --> 02:00:31.801
<v Speaker 1>calls Hakalau it's when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a hypnotherapist.</v>

2803
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Trains does a lot of mind work with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>

2804
02:00:34.450 --> 02:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>like a mind coach and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this state that you get in where</v>

2805
02:00:39.491 --> 02:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>everything just flows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's flows.</v>

2806
02:00:42.821 --> 02:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's does what you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you figured out how to do so</v>

2807
02:00:46.451 --> 02:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly in your life is after you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been through a bunch of bullshit,</v>

2808
02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.860
<v Speaker 1>he figured out to get to a place of</v>
<v Speaker 1>success and then you're able to just do</v>

2809
02:00:53.861 --> 02:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2810
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>that's your flow.</v>

2811
02:00:56.530 --> 02:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Like you found your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>

2812
02:00:59.110 --> 02:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had to learn that even in the last</v>

2813
02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2814
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:05.240
<v Speaker 1>cause it's so easy when I've always</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2815
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>you use a metaphor and you're on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>

2816
02:01:07.451 --> 02:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell how fast it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly where it's going.</v>

2817
02:01:12.101 --> 02:01:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of times you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any control or even say so in that</v>

2818
02:01:16.691 --> 02:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some regards,</v>

2819
02:01:17.681 --> 02:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to know how the sausage</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets made.</v>

2820
02:01:20.441 --> 02:01:25.441
<v Speaker 1>But then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am at a point now where as,</v>

2821
02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I ever want to go because I,</v>

2822
02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all the freedom to do what I want</v>

2823
02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>and it might not sell as good or as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as great as the last one did.</v>

2824
02:01:35.531 --> 02:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>But like I'm having fun and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be okay.</v>

2825
02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're going to have any</v>

2826
02:01:41.211 --> 02:01:41.960
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

2827
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I think the real issues have always been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past about distribution in terms</v>

2828
02:01:45.621 --> 02:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>of like radio play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a album sales,</v>

2829
02:01:48.531 --> 02:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>so we don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I like you.</v>

2830
02:01:49.731 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a guy like you,</v>

2831
02:01:50.691 --> 02:01:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you're so locked in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in,</v>

2832
02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you came along at the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2833
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>you came a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd locked in the Zeitgeists but you</v>

2834
02:01:56.751 --> 02:02:01.180
<v Speaker 1>came along at the right time of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet where like you're like she'll</v>

2835
02:02:01.610 --> 02:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>look and right time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean definitely not all luck,</v>

2836
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>but there was definitely like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roto song about turtles that year cause</v>

2837
02:02:10.821 --> 02:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>it would have been very different</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

2838
02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>It would have been like that year that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had the two meteor movies.</v>

2839
02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2840
02:02:17.901 --> 02:02:18.734
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2841
02:02:18.930 --> 02:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

2842
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Canada</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a book this year with the same</v>

2843
02:02:25.161 --> 02:02:28.310
<v Speaker 1>title as long as me and he's getting all</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of shit on her and I was like,</v>

2844
02:02:28.311 --> 02:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fucking come up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't send this to me.</v>

2845
02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stole it.</v>

2846
02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turtles all the way down.</v>

2847
02:02:35.691 --> 02:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to look into things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what it meant until he</v>

2848
02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>explained it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't still don't know what it means.</v>

2849
02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:41.144
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2850
02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was cool.</v>

2851
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Now I know what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a very dumbed down for the fit to</v>

2852
02:02:46.191 --> 02:02:48.920
<v Speaker 1>make this a standalone podcast explained</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people what turtles all the way?</v>

2853
02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a jocular expression,</v>

2854
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:51.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of,</v>

2855
02:02:51.651 --> 02:02:52.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2856
02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:59.420
<v Speaker 4>a funny way to put what is originally a</v>
<v Speaker 4>concept as far as I know that was first</v>

2857
02:03:00.150 --> 02:03:03.610
<v Speaker 4>described in detail by a swit priest's</v>
<v Speaker 4>name appeared on Chardanne.</v>

2858
02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.570
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all about how about the Omega point,</v>

2859
02:03:06.571 --> 02:03:10.620
<v Speaker 4>the universe and how all consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 4>amidst from this one central point of</v>

2860
02:03:10.621 --> 02:03:13.020
<v Speaker 4>origin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the whole thing banged out from,</v>

2861
02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.460
<v Speaker 4>and it's all just expanding and</v>
<v Speaker 4>reciprocating back to itself and like</v>

2862
02:03:17.461 --> 02:03:21.030
<v Speaker 4>absorbing everything going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's this one point where all things</v>

2863
02:03:21.031 --> 02:03:22.860
<v Speaker 4>spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific,</v>

2864
02:03:22.861 --> 02:03:25.260
<v Speaker 4>metaphysical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all matter in the universe,</v>

2865
02:03:25.261 --> 02:03:29.370
<v Speaker 4>all fucking knowledge emits from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he got blackballed from the Vatican</v>

2866
02:03:29.371 --> 02:03:31.470
<v Speaker 4>for preaching that Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause he was like,</v>

2867
02:03:31.471 --> 02:03:35.400
<v Speaker 4>you don't necessarily need to stand in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>building to talk to God because God is</v>

2868
02:03:35.401 --> 02:03:38.190
<v Speaker 4>everywhere and all around you and inside</v>
<v Speaker 4>you all the time,</v>

2869
02:03:38.670 --> 02:03:42.570
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want God to be or you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2870
02:03:42.630 --> 02:03:43.463
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2871
02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:46.540
<v Speaker 4>I got it from a Stephen Hawking book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2872
02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:48.380
<v Speaker 4>and it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go around the world and there's</v>

2873
02:03:48.381 --> 02:03:51.390
<v Speaker 4>all these ancient civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it be some native American</v>

2874
02:03:51.391 --> 02:03:55.650
<v Speaker 4>tribes or parts of Far Eastern Asia</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they find like these adherence to</v>

2875
02:03:55.651 --> 02:03:58.710
<v Speaker 4>turtles and elephants and older culture</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Hindu mythology.</v>

2876
02:03:59.130 --> 02:04:02.820
<v Speaker 4>There's even a Hindu illustration</v>
<v Speaker 4>representing sort of a similar figure or</v>

2877
02:04:02.821 --> 02:04:07.821
<v Speaker 4>myth that it all set on the back of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>great turtle like flying around in space</v>

2878
02:04:07.831 --> 02:04:09.000
<v Speaker 4>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hills,</v>

2879
02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:13.860
<v Speaker 4>those animals in such regard as old and</v>
<v Speaker 4>wise creatures actually turtles are the</v>

2880
02:04:13.861 --> 02:04:18.210
<v Speaker 4>oldest living species on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They predate crocodiles.</v>

2881
02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.270
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

2882
02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:20.740
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2883
02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:23.520
<v Speaker 4>the symmetry of their shell designs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what species,</v>

2884
02:04:23.521 --> 02:04:27.000
<v Speaker 4>it's always 13 pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which a lot of the old tribes thought</v>

2885
02:04:27.001 --> 02:04:30.690
<v Speaker 4>had something to do with the lunar</v>
<v Speaker 4>phases of the sun and how it was all</v>

2886
02:04:30.691 --> 02:04:32.190
<v Speaker 4>tied in together with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2887
02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:34.033
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2888
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2889
02:04:35.651 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>lost along the way of saying that song</v>
<v Speaker 1>was</v>

2890
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 4>written as a result of a lot of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading.</v>

2891
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:42.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily taking drugs,</v>

2892
02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:45.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't that the original,</v>

2893
02:04:45.930 --> 02:04:48.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the more original calendars.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it's all these things I sort of</v>

2898
02:04:59.490 --> 02:05:03.270
<v Speaker 4>found or symbiotically we're connected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was reading at the time and it just,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as a traditional country record and</v>

2904
02:05:13.741 --> 02:05:16.590
<v Speaker 4>then incorporate some classic rock</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelia.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the first time I did that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what it was.</v>

2933
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:21.900
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just pulled it like it was a big old</v>

<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just started getting really cold and</v>

02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:03.940
<v Speaker 1>He like shoots a beam and ignites the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flower of Jesus like that.</v>

2974
02:08:03.941 --> 02:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Why is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the fuck's that guy?</v>

2975
02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:07.053
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2976
02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:10.690
<v Speaker 1>The thing is they might be curing cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>space colonies that somebody is going to</v>

2977
02:08:10.691 --> 02:08:12.910
<v Speaker 1>need to build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how many cancer patients are</v>

2978
02:08:12.911 --> 02:08:15.340
<v Speaker 1>taking dabs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be the key out here.</v>

2979
02:08:15.341 --> 02:08:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Probably a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get them on it.</v>

2980
02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:18.070
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had,</v>

2981
02:08:18.310 --> 02:08:21.580
<v Speaker 1>if I was dying of terminal cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you want to be that high.</v>

2982
02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:22.443
<v Speaker 1>But at this thing,</v>

2983
02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:24.250
<v Speaker 5>do that again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

2984
02:08:25.630 --> 02:08:26.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2985
02:08:26.771 --> 02:08:28.270
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this thing.</v>

2986
02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:30.740
<v Speaker 5>Of course he had a fucking hates the</v>
<v Speaker 5>light laser.</v>

2987
02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:34.210
<v Speaker 5>This is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now how do you not go blind staring at</v>

2988
02:08:34.211 --> 02:08:35.830
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's heating it up.</v>

2989
02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:38.830
<v Speaker 5>It's cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good question.</v>

2990
02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:42.310
<v Speaker 5>And then he takes a big hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2991
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:43.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2992
02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:44.641
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2993
02:08:44.641 --> 02:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>the medical strength stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand.</v>

2994
02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>And this seems like you go blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were standing at a welder.</v>

2995
02:08:49.970 --> 02:08:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you have to wear a welding</v>

2996
02:08:51.981 --> 02:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>mask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My very,</v>

2997
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:57.960
<v Speaker 1>very close to my life in my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently that went,</v>

2998
02:08:58.050 --> 02:08:59.450
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was dealing with that,</v>

2999
02:09:00.050 --> 02:09:00.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vertigo,</v>

3000
02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:03.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like heavy medical issues,</v>

3001
02:09:03.621 --> 02:09:07.580
<v Speaker 1>health issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we got him some edibles and he's</v>

3002
02:09:07.581 --> 02:09:10.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only thing that made it okay.</v>

3003
02:09:10.190 --> 02:09:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Like that discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I had to have a sinus</v>

3004
02:09:14.211 --> 02:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this when we played the</v>

3005
02:09:17.481 --> 02:09:20.900
<v Speaker 1>grammys out here last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sick as fuck man.</v>

3006
02:09:20.901 --> 02:09:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I was getting all year for like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year and a half on the road.</v>

3007
02:09:23.631 --> 02:09:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I was getting his horrible sinus</v>
<v Speaker 1>infections all the time.</v>

3008
02:09:25.761 --> 02:09:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just assumed it was allergies.</v>

3009
02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee's really bad about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd go to Texas or Atlanta places</v>

3010
02:09:33.111 --> 02:09:35.840
<v Speaker 1>in October when all these crazy dogwoods</v>
<v Speaker 1>are kicking off.</v>

3011
02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:38.540
<v Speaker 1>And I would lose my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3012
02:09:38.541 --> 02:09:41.000
<v Speaker 1>by no fault of my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became very frustrating from a</v>

3013
02:09:41.001 --> 02:09:43.670
<v Speaker 1>touring standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I felt like I was always sick.</v>

3014
02:09:43.710 --> 02:09:45.890
<v Speaker 1>And it was because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3015
02:09:45.891 --> 02:09:48.860
<v Speaker 1>we flew out into the grammys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was all plugged up,</v>

3016
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:51.650
<v Speaker 1>couldn't sing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously biggest gig in my life,</v>

3017
02:09:51.651 --> 02:09:55.160
<v Speaker 1>kind of stress in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the label guys sent me to this doctor</v>

3018
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:59.180
<v Speaker 1>who looked up in there and realizing I</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably had my nose broken at some</v>

3019
02:09:59.181 --> 02:10:02.180
<v Speaker 1>point or just a really deviated septum</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger.</v>

3020
02:10:02.181 --> 02:10:05.820
<v Speaker 1>So I like a broken air filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when they did the scan,</v>

3021
02:10:05.821 --> 02:10:08.750
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the cavities were just completely</v>

3022
02:10:08.751 --> 02:10:11.480
<v Speaker 1>caked with residual bacteria and</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection.</v>

3023
02:10:11.481 --> 02:10:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3024
02:10:12.351 --> 02:10:15.020
<v Speaker 1>if you get on a plane and fly home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably going to get meningitis.</v>

3025
02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.300
<v Speaker 1>So we had to play the grammys.</v>

3026
02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:19.340
<v Speaker 1>He put you like nuked me with all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3027
02:10:19.341 --> 02:10:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it opened it up for like a day.</v>

3028
02:10:22.210 --> 02:10:24.830
<v Speaker 1>It's where I was able to sing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next day,</v>

3029
02:10:24.831 --> 02:10:26.090
<v Speaker 1>the whole band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they flew home.</v>

3030
02:10:26.091 --> 02:10:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I just stay out here for like nine days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think can go in every morning,</v>

3031
02:10:30.110 --> 02:10:32.900
<v Speaker 1>twice a day for Ivs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for him to clean that shit out so I</v>

3032
02:10:32.901 --> 02:10:34.330
<v Speaker 1>could home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3033
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:37.550
<v Speaker 1>So then we came back and did the surgery</v>
<v Speaker 1>to correct it all,</v>

3034
02:10:37.710 --> 02:10:40.400
<v Speaker 1>like went in there and scraped and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaned them all out and shit.</v>

3035
02:10:41.090 --> 02:10:42.530
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the,</v>

3036
02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:46.010
<v Speaker 1>the Septum they fixed the Septum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't had a single issue since</v>

3037
02:10:46.011 --> 02:10:47.960
<v Speaker 1>all that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been sick one time,</v>

3038
02:10:47.961 --> 02:10:51.440
<v Speaker 1>which is like changing my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But while I was recuperating,</v>

3039
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to take any of the opioid</v>

3040
02:10:54.501 --> 02:10:57.980
<v Speaker 1>or the fucking pills that they gave me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with the pain.</v>

3041
02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking that shit.</v>

3042
02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:00.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to give me this for four</v>

3043
02:11:00.591 --> 02:11:01.490
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

3044
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:04.760
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I just got a bunch of medical</v>

3045
02:11:04.761 --> 02:11:07.580
<v Speaker 1>strength edibles and my wife and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

3046
02:11:07.581 --> 02:11:10.490
<v Speaker 1>they had to come my way to run a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had it bad to be here to like recover</v>

3047
02:11:10.491 --> 02:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>and Shit and man just laying in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to headphones stoned out of my</v>

3048
02:11:15.051 --> 02:11:19.820
<v Speaker 1>mind for like a week recovering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's was kind of awesome because</v>

3049
02:11:19.821 --> 02:11:24.821
<v Speaker 1>you feel like when you're actually in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain or when you need that type of heavy</v>

3050
02:11:26.690 --> 02:11:28.160
<v Speaker 1>type of alleviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3051
02:11:28.190 --> 02:11:31.700
<v Speaker 1>what it is actually doing an offering</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in terms of relief.</v>

3052
02:11:31.701 --> 02:11:35.000
<v Speaker 1>And it gave me a whole new understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>and respect for like the medical side of</v>

3053
02:11:35.001 --> 02:11:36.560
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are back on pot again.</v>

3054
02:11:36.561 --> 02:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then my buddy who dealt some pretty</v>

3055
02:11:39.531 --> 02:11:43.070
<v Speaker 1>serious cancer said it was literally the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing that made him feel better.</v>

3056
02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:44.740
<v Speaker 1>So what did it do for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like see your,</v>

3057
02:11:44.770 --> 02:11:48.410
<v Speaker 1>your terrible agony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah that was all fucks all plugged up.</v>

3058
02:11:48.411 --> 02:11:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I had like all this galls in your shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and know I could feel where they'd been</v>

3059
02:11:52.191 --> 02:11:54.410
<v Speaker 1>in there like behind right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been scraping and I can just,</v>

3060
02:11:54.411 --> 02:11:56.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it immediately like all that was gone</v>

3061
02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>and you just sorta get really docile and</v>
<v Speaker 1>euphoric and rely on me so fucking high.</v>

3062
02:12:02.841 --> 02:12:05.840
<v Speaker 1>But like it didn't affect me in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an overdose.</v>

3063
02:12:05.841 --> 02:12:09.830
<v Speaker 1>He nauseous sorta way like too many</v>
<v Speaker 1>edibles cause your body actually needs</v>

3064
02:12:09.831 --> 02:12:10.664
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Needs it.</v>

3065
02:12:10.730 --> 02:12:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I laid there listening to headphones and</v>

3066
02:12:13.611 --> 02:12:15.470
<v Speaker 1>came up with the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on that.</v>

3067
02:12:15.650 --> 02:12:18.740
<v Speaker 1>That's great for me cause it was like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I want to do next,</v>

3068
02:12:18.741 --> 02:12:20.180
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3069
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:21.313
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3070
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:23.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those edibles.</v>

3071
02:12:23.301 --> 02:12:25.610
<v Speaker 1>But if you can take that ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get something out of it.</v>

3072
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes people take the ride and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling is just to,</v>

3073
02:12:29.690 --> 02:12:33.110
<v Speaker 1>to self examine a tuna the nor yet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sing.</v>

3074
02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes she just can't handle a on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass legality issue.</v>

3075
02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>

3076
02:12:39.501 --> 02:12:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I know it's just gonna fuck pot up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3077
02:12:41.581 --> 02:12:44.090
<v Speaker 1>But from a medical stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

3078
02:12:44.210 --> 02:12:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any reason why we're still</v>
<v Speaker 1>even talking about this.</v>

3079
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3080
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:50.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense.</v>

3081
02:12:50.631 --> 02:12:54.470
<v Speaker 1>We were were being fucked over by giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies that are making</v>

3082
02:12:54.471 --> 02:12:59.090
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize how much more money they would</v>

3083
02:12:59.091 --> 02:13:03.170
<v Speaker 1>be losing every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If marijuana becomes fully legal,</v>

3084
02:13:03.230 --> 02:13:06.260
<v Speaker 1>they've already lost money for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you there's people that are</v>

3085
02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:09.890
<v Speaker 1>buying edible marijuana right now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have bought pain pills.</v>

3086
02:13:09.891 --> 02:13:11.610
<v Speaker 1>They know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also insurance companies,</v>

3087
02:13:12.210 --> 02:13:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the job accidents.</v>

3089
02:13:14.991 --> 02:13:17.630

<v Speaker 1>So I got my life insurance now.</v>

3090
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

3091
02:13:19.551 --> 02:13:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I did one of the first interviews I ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

3092
02:13:21.771 --> 02:13:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I think I talked about what like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time I moved to Nashville and how</v>

3093
02:13:26.271 --> 02:13:30.800
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't really know anybody and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like 2005 and it was a different</v>

3094
02:13:30.801 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>town then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I basically</v>

3095
02:13:32.210 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 4>I said I spent most of my time listening</v>
<v Speaker 4>and playing blue grass and drinking,</v>

3096
02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty much what everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>

3097
02:13:40.110 --> 02:13:42.550
<v Speaker 4>The first year they moved to Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

3098
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:44.760
<v Speaker 4>then I said like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after that,</v>

3099
02:13:44.761 --> 02:13:48.150
<v Speaker 4>while I moved out to Utah and got this</v>
<v Speaker 4>job and you've got sober was working on</v>

3100
02:13:48.151 --> 02:13:51.210
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So somebody put on my wikipedia page</v>

3101

<v Speaker 4>that I've talked about my struggles with</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol and those people read that Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like they showed up,</v>

3104
02:13:57.870 --> 02:13:59.460
<v Speaker 4>they'd read all the interviews and like,</v>

3153
02:15:34.831 --> 02:15:38.190
<v Speaker 5>it's more likely to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no statistics to back that up.</v>

3154
02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:41.790
<v Speaker 5>There's no statistics that say that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people smoke pot or more likely to get</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

3215
02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:13.910
<v Speaker 2>a weird contradiction we have in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

3216
02:18:13.911 --> 02:18:16.550
<v Speaker 2>We were constantly drinking drugs in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of caffeine,</v>

3217
02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:20.540
<v Speaker 2>constantly getting drugs in the form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever your doctor prescribes you for</v>

3218
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:25.490
<v Speaker 2>depression or anxiety or adhd or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

3219
02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Constantly going out and having drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking drugs,</v>

3220
02:18:29.630 --> 02:18:31.250
<v Speaker 2>the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being alcohol,</v>

3221
02:18:31.310 --> 02:18:34.490
<v Speaker 2>taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a whiskey drug and a vodka drug</v>

3222
02:18:34.491 --> 02:18:36.270
<v Speaker 2>and no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one thinks anything of it.</v>

3223
02:18:36.271 --> 02:18:36.681
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3224
02:18:36.681 --> 02:18:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs all day,</v>

3225
02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:42.680
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so few people who don't do any</v>

3226
02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:46.570
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some drugs are super beneficial.</v>

3227
02:18:46.571 --> 02:18:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those we'd edibles that made you write</v>

3228
02:18:48.861 --> 02:18:51.110
<v Speaker 2>this album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a beneficial,</v>

3229
02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:52.760
<v Speaker 2>what didn't make you right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3231
02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:55.630
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well I'll give it a little credit.</v>

3232
02:18:55.650 --> 02:18:58.280

<v Speaker 4>early love and it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

3249
02:19:34.881 --> 02:19:36.470
<v Speaker 4>And the gentleman was filled with</v>
<v Speaker 4>speakers.</v>

3250
02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:38.740
<v Speaker 4>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it to uh,</v>

3251
02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:42.740
<v Speaker 4>my name drop real quick cause yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 4>was probably one of those,</v>

3252
02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:44.990
<v Speaker 4>one of those days were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3253
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:46.630
<v Speaker 4>this is why I do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3254
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:53.300
<v Speaker 4>well I ended up going up to Malibu to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rick Rubin's house and it was playing</v>

3255
02:19:53.301 --> 02:19:55.550
<v Speaker 4>him some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of this record I'm working on just</v>

3256
02:19:55.551 --> 02:19:58.420
<v Speaker 4>to get some feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of those moments when you</v>

3257
02:19:58.421 --> 02:20:02.060
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize you're sitting like Rick</v>

3258
02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:04.880
<v Speaker 4>Rubin's like all engine stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His cows head banging like a fucking</v>

3259
02:20:04.881 --> 02:20:09.350
<v Speaker 4>cave man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he had literally the best sounding</v>

3260
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:12.500
<v Speaker 4>stereo system I've ever heard in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

3261
02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:15.950
<v Speaker 4>Could only imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean better than any top Ray's studio</v>

3262
02:20:15.951 --> 02:20:17.390
<v Speaker 4>monitors I've ever sat in front of.</v>

3263
02:20:17.390 --> 02:20:19.860
<v Speaker 4>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup,</v>

3264
02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.960
<v Speaker 4>it's really Rick Ruben too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other is the coolest part was</v>

3265
02:20:24.970 --> 02:20:28.610
<v Speaker 4>that was the only thing that was in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking room was the couch.</v>

3266
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:31.610
<v Speaker 4>He was like literally like the Tiki,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy sitting in the chair in front of</v>

3267
02:20:31.611 --> 02:20:32.241
<v Speaker 4>this town,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3268
02:20:32.241 --> 02:20:36.350
<v Speaker 4>it's like just the stereo on the floor</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is fucking empty room and I</v>

3269
02:20:36.351 --> 02:20:38.270
<v Speaker 4>don't know what it was or what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>speakers even were.</v>

3270
02:20:38.271 --> 02:20:42.320
<v Speaker 4>I'd never seen anything like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I bet it's like when Mason's has</v>

3271
02:20:42.470 --> 02:20:44.540
<v Speaker 4>Henry Rollins says these speakers we</v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about the other day,</v>

3272
02:20:44.541 --> 02:20:46.370
<v Speaker 4>they're like a quarter million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what they were?</v>

3273
02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:50.150
<v Speaker 4>Quarter million dollar speakers in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>living room these days.</v>

3274
02:20:50.151 --> 02:20:51.470
<v Speaker 4>Towers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these two towers.</v>

3275
02:20:51.890 --> 02:20:53.450
<v Speaker 4>And they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3276
02:20:53.451 --> 02:20:55.310
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never experienced it,</v>

3277
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:59.120
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got to assume that you've spent a</v>

3278
02:20:59.120 --> 02:20:59.953
<v Speaker 4>quarter million dollars for some</v>
<v Speaker 4>speakers.</v>

3279
02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:02.090
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I'd heard some pretty</v>

3280
02:21:02.091 --> 02:21:04.250
<v Speaker 4>impressive speakers in my time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this was like,</v>

3281
02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:08.720
<v Speaker 4>like some really holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This exists kind of moment.</v>

3282
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:09.470
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3283
02:21:09.470 --> 02:21:11.540
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even have to be that loud.</v>

3284
02:21:11.541 --> 02:21:13.670
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that the sound is so powerful.</v>

3285
02:21:13.671 --> 02:21:14.500
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3286
02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:15.770
<v Speaker 4>The only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want a car,</v>

3287
02:21:15.771 --> 02:21:18.110
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want a Samurai sword and written</v>

3288
02:21:18.111 --> 02:21:19.410
<v Speaker 4>Ruben's home stereo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3289
02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:24.520
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm aspiring to now at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bronco and the light Saber Bronco</v>

3290
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:25.180
<v Speaker 4>lightsaber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3291
02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:26.320
<v Speaker 4>I gave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a bronc out,</v>

3292
02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:28.940
<v Speaker 4>a bad ass bronco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My second one we moved,</v>

3293
02:21:28.941 --> 02:21:30.940
<v Speaker 4>we moved to Nashville and Bronco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife,</v>

3294
02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:34.700
<v Speaker 4>my wife's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it died and I ended up scoring a sweet</v>

3295
02:21:34.701 --> 02:21:36.650
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this redneck and Livingston,</v>

3296
02:21:36.651 --> 02:21:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Tennessee or somewhere a borrow from</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

3297
02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:42.280
<v Speaker 4>It was a [inaudible] 92 and he'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt blacked it out.</v>

3298
02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:45.530
<v Speaker 4>My buddy bobby took it for like a month</v>
<v Speaker 4>while I was on tour in Europe and</v>

3299
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:47.120
<v Speaker 4>stripped all the interior out.</v>

3300
02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:49.910
<v Speaker 4>We rhino hide the entire liner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took all the,</v>

3301
02:21:49.970 --> 02:21:51.080
<v Speaker 4>all the plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

3302
02:21:51.081 --> 02:21:53.150
<v Speaker 4>It was just like a fucking Mad Max death</v>
<v Speaker 4>trap.</v>

3303
02:21:53.151 --> 02:21:55.430
<v Speaker 4>And we had these bucket cold beer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leather racing seats.</v>

3304
02:21:55.431 --> 02:21:56.970
<v Speaker 4>We bolted in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

3305
02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:59.360
<v Speaker 4>And then I had two kids and mom and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

3306
02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:03.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to die driving in this thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and had a 400 wins or rebuild with</v>

3307
02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:05.660
<v Speaker 4>Kansas header is the whole God damn</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3308
02:22:05.661 --> 02:22:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Like when neighbors hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3309
02:22:07.461 --> 02:22:09.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave it to my drummer when his truck</v>

3310
02:22:09.381 --> 02:22:14.000
<v Speaker 4>died and he actually liked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unlike most kids of the millennial era,</v>

3311
02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:16.940
<v Speaker 4>really put time and money and effort and</v>
<v Speaker 4>work into,</v>

3312
02:22:16.941 --> 02:22:18.620
<v Speaker 4>it was like fixing it up and making it</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

3313
02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:20.870
<v Speaker 4>and then he's getting married so he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting a tree,</v>

3314
02:22:20.871 --> 02:22:22.910
<v Speaker 4>got a real trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that Bronco is gone.</v>

3315
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's probably time to find a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweet bronco.</v>

3316
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:28.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good era to the ojs bronco year</v>

3317
02:22:28.681 --> 02:22:30.600
<v Speaker 4>is more understated Bronco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

3318
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:34.050
<v Speaker 4>The locking hubs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the move is to get one of those and keep</v>

3319
02:22:34.051 --> 02:22:37.340
<v Speaker 4>it plain Jane on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But on the inside just put a battery.</v>

3320
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:42.360
<v Speaker 4>That's where I really want to do is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3321
02:22:42.390 --> 02:22:43.920
<v Speaker 4>cause I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to have,</v>

3322
02:22:43.921 --> 02:22:45.330
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very unassuming.</v>

3323
02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:48.600
<v Speaker 4>And then on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just look like a rocket ship with all</v>

3324
02:22:48.601 --> 02:22:51.750
<v Speaker 4>the accoutrement that can be done</v>
<v Speaker 4>easily.</v>

3325
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:54.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and very modernized,</v>

3326
02:22:54.511 --> 02:22:56.040
<v Speaker 4>user friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they give you what you're going to</v>

3327
02:22:56.041 --> 02:22:56.910
<v Speaker 4>pay to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

3328
02:22:56.911 --> 02:22:59.190
<v Speaker 4>you could fucking go by 1970 [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>

3329
02:22:59.450 --> 02:23:00.690
<v Speaker 4>You can buy a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3330
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:02.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could buy a house where you live for</v>

3331
02:23:02.881 --> 02:23:04.680
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3332
02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:07.140
<v Speaker 4>By a fat piece of land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually Nashville,</v>

3333
02:23:07.141 --> 02:23:10.350
<v Speaker 4>the real estate has gotten pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't live in Nashville anymore,</v>

3334
02:23:10.351 --> 02:23:13.740
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know it much like Austin.</v>

3335
02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:17.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean five years from now there may not</v>
<v Speaker 4>be any music in Nashville cause I don't</v>

3336
02:23:17.761 --> 02:23:19.470
<v Speaker 4>know how many musicians are gonna afford</v>
<v Speaker 4>to live there.</v>

3337
02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:20.713
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I keep,</v>

3338
02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:22.860
<v Speaker 4>it's so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an explosion,</v>

3339
02:23:22.861 --> 02:23:24.960
<v Speaker 4>an explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it logistically in the</v>

3340
02:23:24.961 --> 02:23:27.390
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure of the traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a marriage reversion la.</v>

3341
02:23:27.391 --> 02:23:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Now when did it start?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hard to say.</v>

3342
02:23:30.331 --> 02:23:31.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I are,</v>

3343
02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:35.170
<v Speaker 4>the first time I lived there it was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>2005 and it was a different city than</v>

3344
02:23:35.171 --> 02:23:37.140
<v Speaker 4>none of this had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3345
02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:40.020
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the hip bars now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that could have been eight people</v>

3346
02:23:40.021 --> 02:23:41.550
<v Speaker 4>in there on a Friday night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3347
02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:47.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I moved there 2011 and I think it was</v>

3348
02:23:48.161 --> 02:23:50.190
<v Speaker 4>right in the last two or three years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3349
02:23:50.290 --> 02:23:53.970
<v Speaker 4>or all the gentrification started around</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and they were building these,</v>

3350
02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:55.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what used to be the blown out</v>

3351
02:23:55.861 --> 02:23:57.680
<v Speaker 4>dilapidated parts of town in the high</v>
<v Speaker 4>rises,</v>

3352
02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:59.190
<v Speaker 4>started going up and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3353
02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:01.440
<v Speaker 4>and shopping centers and that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3354
02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:04.440
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's still very much the old</v>

3355
02:24:04.441 --> 02:24:05.430
<v Speaker 4>Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>

3356
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:08.340
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like two or three different</v>
<v Speaker 4>cities in some cases in terms of</v>

3357
02:24:08.341 --> 02:24:13.341
<v Speaker 4>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the influx and all this change is</v>

3358
02:24:13.351 --> 02:24:15.690
<v Speaker 4>sort of changed what it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is.</v>

3359
02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:18.780
<v Speaker 4>But like Austin used to be a thriving</v>
<v Speaker 4>music scene,</v>

3360
02:24:18.781 --> 02:24:21.540
<v Speaker 4>but now it's like all the tech industry</v>
<v Speaker 4>moves down to the cost of living and</v>

3361
02:24:21.541 --> 02:24:24.870
<v Speaker 4>properties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just insane.</v>

3362
02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Like struggling service industry job day</v>
<v Speaker 4>to day as we say,</v>

3363
02:24:29.161 --> 02:24:30.870
<v Speaker 4>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people trying to make it can't,</v>

3364
02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:34.380
<v Speaker 4>they're all having to live like an hour</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of town and commute in for the</v>

3365
02:24:34.381 --> 02:24:36.000
<v Speaker 4>gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3366
02:24:38.390 --> 02:24:39.900
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what did,</v>

3367
02:24:39.901 --> 02:24:41.430
<v Speaker 4>what do you think was the catalyst?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

3368
02:24:41.431 --> 02:24:44.780
<v Speaker 4>what caused the launch became a cool</v>
<v Speaker 4>place to be.</v>

3369
02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:46.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3370
02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:47.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>

3371
02:24:47.181 --> 02:24:48.480
<v Speaker 4>well there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>

3372
02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:51.171
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3373
02:24:51.171 --> 02:24:53.390
<v Speaker 4>it terms of what's always been a</v>
<v Speaker 4>publishing hub,</v>

3374
02:24:53.540 --> 02:24:53.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3375
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:55.130
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a music town,</v>

3376
02:24:55.131 --> 02:24:56.750
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's all kinds of music.</v>

3377
02:24:56.751 --> 02:25:00.080
<v Speaker 4>They're not just country music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but about when did that TV show come</v>

3378
02:25:00.081 --> 02:25:02.630
<v Speaker 4>out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a big Nashville TV show that</v>

3379
02:25:02.631 --> 02:25:04.070
<v Speaker 4>would have been about four or five years</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

3380
02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:06.230
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those Dorks,</v>

3381
02:25:06.231 --> 02:25:06.791
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3382
02:25:06.791 --> 02:25:07.910
<v Speaker 4>go to live there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3383
02:25:07.911 --> 02:25:10.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's definitely tours from</v>
<v Speaker 4>that TV show,</v>

3384
02:25:10.470 --> 02:25:11.810
<v Speaker 4>kind of a match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mason Jar.</v>

3385
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:16.790
<v Speaker 4>It's such a soap opera version that</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't really that far enough away from</v>

3386
02:25:16.791 --> 02:25:19.670
<v Speaker 4>how that world probably works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never saw it.</v>

3387
02:25:19.730 --> 02:25:22.250
<v Speaker 4>I didn't either watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife watched it one night and I just</v>

3388
02:25:22.251 --> 02:25:23.084
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

3389
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:29.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been there a bunch of times playing</v>

3390
02:25:29.281 --> 02:25:30.114
<v Speaker 2>xannies</v>

3391
02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:31.131
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3392
02:25:31.131 --> 02:25:34.400
<v Speaker 4>Now that little street where you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about that corner on eighth</v>

3393
02:25:34.401 --> 02:25:36.260
<v Speaker 4>avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're xannies.</v>

3394
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:40.190
<v Speaker 4>You got doug was corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then there's like some,</v>

3395
02:25:40.430 --> 02:25:43.250
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of shops that I go to on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sundays there,</v>

3396
02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:44.360
<v Speaker 4>the auctioneers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3397
02:25:44.361 --> 02:25:45.750
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the oldest state sales and then</v>

3398
02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:47.930
<v Speaker 4>really cool furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that little pocket,</v>

3399
02:25:47.931 --> 02:25:52.931
<v Speaker 4>that intersection is probably one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>few remaining bastions of funk left in</v>

3400
02:25:54.891 --> 02:25:56.630
<v Speaker 4>Nashville.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's probably my favorite little</v>

3401
02:25:56.631 --> 02:25:59.630
<v Speaker 4>corner in Nashville cause I can just</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand there and it still feels like</v>

3402
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:03.440
<v Speaker 4>relatively similar to what it probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>felt like 30 years ago.</v>

3403
02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:05.970
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3404
02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:11.300
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of other things change around</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that don't.</v>

3405
02:26:11.301 --> 02:26:12.980
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does make sense.</v>

3406
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are cool little pockets then,</v>

3407
02:26:15.471 --> 02:26:16.304
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3408
02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:18.860
<v Speaker 4>I think I got a good friend Billy Wayne</v>
<v Speaker 4>Davis.</v>

3409
02:26:18.861 --> 02:26:20.270
<v Speaker 4>I met him at xannies</v>

3410
02:26:21.490 --> 02:26:23.610
<v Speaker 2>one night back when I was on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

3411
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:25.570
<v Speaker 2>he reached out like a plane here</v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight,</v>

3412
02:26:25.571 --> 02:26:26.980
<v Speaker 2>free tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my wife and I went,</v>

3413
02:26:26.981 --> 02:26:30.150
<v Speaker 2>we liked comedy and got to know him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended up opening a tour.</v>

3414
02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Forming that place is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>places where you know it's good and old</v>

3415
02:26:35.171 --> 02:26:37.300
<v Speaker 2>based on the number of dead people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall.</v>

3416
02:26:37.450 --> 02:26:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just walking around and you</v>

3417
02:26:39.141 --> 02:26:40.050
<v Speaker 2>let go up Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jenny,</v>

3418
02:26:40.051 --> 02:26:42.140
<v Speaker 2>you can walk in and taste cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3419
02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:43.313
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3420
02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:43.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3421
02:26:43.781 --> 02:26:45.530
<v Speaker 2>the photos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head shots,</v>

3422
02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:46.750
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A dead comedians.</v>

3423
02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:48.640
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3424
02:26:48.641 --> 02:26:50.620
<v Speaker 2>that place has been around for ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you?</v>

3425
02:26:50.621 --> 02:26:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Coming to Nashville?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3426
02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:52.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might come through again and do</v>

3447
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:32.230
<v Speaker 2>xannies um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after this,</v>

3448
02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:34.270
<v Speaker 2>when I write my new hour just to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

3449
02:27:34.271 --> 02:27:37.720
<v Speaker 2>stretch it out because you really want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stretch it out at a comedy club.</v>

3450
02:27:37.721 --> 02:27:39.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to stretch it out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of 3000 people.</v>

3451
02:27:39.701 --> 02:27:42.520
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good sign of good,</v>

3452
02:27:42.521 --> 02:27:44.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>development ground.</v>

3453
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:47.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not the room to try things out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big rooms in the room,</v>

3454
02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:49.270
<v Speaker 2>that's when you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got it.</v>

3455
02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:51.250
<v Speaker 2>You got the set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what you're doing,</v>

3456
02:27:51.251 --> 02:27:53.950
<v Speaker 2>you fuck around while you're up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you basically have a structure for</v>

3457
02:27:53.951 --> 02:27:56.020
<v Speaker 2>your act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a structure for each bit and</v>

3458
02:27:56.021 --> 02:27:59.950
<v Speaker 2>occasionally y'all deviate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I don't want to do,</v>

3459
02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to work out brand new</v>
<v Speaker 2>material in front of 3000 people.</v>

3460
02:28:02.831 --> 02:28:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that</v>

3461
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:04.751
<v Speaker 4>one night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3462
02:28:04.751 --> 02:28:06.700
<v Speaker 4>I think what came to watch your show at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the store?</v>

3463
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:08.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this was,</v>

3464
02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:10.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a year ago and you had to jet right</v>

3465
02:28:10.781 --> 02:28:12.630
<v Speaker 4>after the set and go to Pasadena for</v>
<v Speaker 4>another set.</v>

3466
02:28:13.130 --> 02:28:15.610
<v Speaker 4>My buddy that I brought with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were going to hang here,</v>

3467
02:28:16.690 --> 02:28:19.630
<v Speaker 4>see who comes out and like Jeff Ross or</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody comes out and he's doing his</v>

3468
02:28:19.631 --> 02:28:21.230
<v Speaker 4>bit and right in the fucking middle of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3469
02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:26.090
<v Speaker 4>the back curtain opens and Chappelle</v>
<v Speaker 4>walks out and just kind of like taps</v>

3470
02:28:26.091 --> 02:28:27.950
<v Speaker 4>were also on the corner on the shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fuck off,</v>

3471
02:28:27.951 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 4>I got this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3472
02:28:28.850 --> 02:28:31.880
<v Speaker 4>and just jacks the mic and pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody else has set who was supposed</v>

3473
02:28:31.881 --> 02:28:34.460
<v Speaker 4>to perform that night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he stands there for like three</v>

3474
02:28:34.461 --> 02:28:35.294
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3475
02:28:35.890 --> 02:28:36.800
<v Speaker 4>just sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3476
02:28:36.801 --> 02:28:38.510
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this will probably never happen again in</v>

3477
02:28:38.511 --> 02:28:40.880
<v Speaker 4>your lifetime so I'm not fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaving.</v>

3478
02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:45.020
<v Speaker 4>And we just sat through the whole time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he sat there rocking Tequila bombs</v>

3479
02:28:45.021 --> 02:28:49.100
<v Speaker 4>and get drunk and just really talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were times where it was the</v>

3480
02:28:49.101 --> 02:28:51.410
<v Speaker 4>funniest thing I've ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally.</v>

3481
02:28:51.411 --> 02:28:53.540
<v Speaker 4>And there were times where like it kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of got dark and you're like,</v>

3482
02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:55.490
<v Speaker 4>where's the fuck's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's this going?</v>

3483
02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:59.480
<v Speaker 4>And he was working things out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then later on those netflix specials</v>

3484
02:28:59.481 --> 02:29:01.070
<v Speaker 4>land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I realize I've already heard like</v>

3485
02:29:01.071 --> 02:29:05.000
<v Speaker 4>90% of these jokes and cause the guy was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just saying I'm going to go hijack the</v>

3486
02:29:05.001 --> 02:29:06.980
<v Speaker 4>main room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work my shit out.</v>

3487
02:29:06.981 --> 02:29:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Cause I got it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Dave Chappelle,</v>

3488
02:29:08.661 --> 02:29:10.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was fucking amazing.</v>

3489
02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:14.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah he does that a lot where he'll just</v>
<v Speaker 5>drop it into place and just do a set and</v>

3490
02:29:14.641 --> 02:29:16.890
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how he kind of works as material</v>

3491
02:29:16.891 --> 02:29:18.150
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3492
02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:22.300
<v Speaker 5>he just kind of drops in and keeps</v>
<v Speaker 5>tweaking it and it,</v>

3493
02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:24.210
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's if he has a structure,</v>

3494
02:29:24.211 --> 02:29:24.601
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3495
02:29:24.601 --> 02:29:26.730
<v Speaker 5>if he has a few ideas that he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

3496
02:29:27.330 --> 02:29:30.600
<v Speaker 5>he can just riff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And especially if he's drinking,</v>

3497
02:29:30.601 --> 02:29:33.720
<v Speaker 5>just go on stage and then the drinking</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he's always got dudes behind</v>

3498
02:29:33.721 --> 02:29:37.350
<v Speaker 5>them that are taken down notes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>letting them know like all you talked</v>

3499
02:29:37.351 --> 02:29:40.140
<v Speaker 5>about this day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm sure they record it too.</v>

3500
02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:44.520
<v Speaker 5>And they'll go over it and eventually</v>
<v Speaker 5>boil it down to like what that Netflix</v>

3501
02:29:44.521 --> 02:29:49.440
<v Speaker 5>special was the two Netflix back that</v>
<v Speaker 5>shows you how prolific that dude is to</v>

3502
02:29:49.441 --> 02:29:53.250
<v Speaker 5>put out a Netflix special and then a</v>
<v Speaker 5>year later put out to Netflix specials,</v>

3503
02:29:53.251 --> 02:29:53.880
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3504
02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:55.680
<v Speaker 5>And then Netflix is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll take it what he got.</v>

3505
02:29:55.681 --> 02:29:56.341
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3506
02:29:56.341 --> 02:30:00.480
<v Speaker 5>I wrote this one this month and I'd like</v>
<v Speaker 5>to put it down for all eternity.</v>

3507
02:30:00.510 --> 02:30:03.810
<v Speaker 5>He cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But most people like you write something</v>

3508
02:30:03.811 --> 02:30:08.160
<v Speaker 5>and it's a good solid year before you</v>
<v Speaker 5>even consider putting it in a special,</v>

3509
02:30:08.370 --> 02:30:09.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some guys were doing like a special</v>

3510
02:30:09.841 --> 02:30:12.870
<v Speaker 5>year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but too much of it was like half cooked.</v>

3511
02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:15.120
<v Speaker 5>It was like if you just waited six more</v>
<v Speaker 5>months,</v>

3512
02:30:15.121 --> 02:30:17.430
<v Speaker 5>this thing would be like an all time</v>
<v Speaker 5>great special.</v>

3513
02:30:17.490 --> 02:30:20.070
<v Speaker 5>But instead you're banging them out one</v>
<v Speaker 5>a year.</v>

3514
02:30:20.071 --> 02:30:22.800
<v Speaker 5>You never get the essence of the thing.</v>

3515
02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:26.780
<v Speaker 4>Well his thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he part of his thing I think is is</v>

3516
02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:31.580
<v Speaker 4>making it look like it's so easy because</v>
<v Speaker 4>the night at the comedy store and it</v>

3517
02:30:31.581 --> 02:30:33.320
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it did feel like he was just sort of</v>

3518
02:30:33.321 --> 02:30:36.030
<v Speaker 4>making this shit up on the spot and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see the netflix specials in,</v>

3519
02:30:36.031 --> 02:30:39.590
<v Speaker 4>it sort of feels the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's just being dave and be like,</v>

3520
02:30:39.591 --> 02:30:43.940
<v Speaker 4>he would was a little subtle things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I noticed like probably 10 times</v>

3521
02:30:43.941 --> 02:30:47.930
<v Speaker 4>throughout the night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really awkward moments.</v>

3522
02:30:47.931 --> 02:30:50.330
<v Speaker 4>He would call the waitress to get him</v>
<v Speaker 4>another drink,</v>

3523
02:30:50.331 --> 02:30:52.490
<v Speaker 4>but he would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would only say borrow whore.</v>

3524
02:30:53.330 --> 02:30:55.670
<v Speaker 4>And every time you say it they get a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little,</v>

3525
02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:58.670
<v Speaker 4>a little more awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little less appropriate each and</v>

3526
02:30:58.671 --> 02:31:00.270
<v Speaker 4>every fucking town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're probably like it.</v>

3527
02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:01.850
<v Speaker 4>Eventually everybody in the room was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3528
02:31:01.970 --> 02:31:05.000
<v Speaker 4>that's not really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then at the end of the night,</v>

3529
02:31:05.001 --> 02:31:06.280
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last thing he says like,</v>

3530
02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:09.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm really sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called you bar hourage don't have any</v>

3531
02:31:09.201 --> 02:31:11.030
<v Speaker 4>fucking jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he walked off the stage.</v>

3532
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:12.043
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3533
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:15.650
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how Dave writes.</v>

3534
02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:18.170
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the ways he writes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's,</v>

3535
02:31:18.171 --> 02:31:19.590
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got it down,</v>

3536
02:31:19.620 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's</v>

3537
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:22.740
<v Speaker 2>got it down to a science and the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing he does is he just travels to</v>

3538
02:31:22.741 --> 02:31:24.910
<v Speaker 2>towns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just decides to travel to a town and</v>

3539
02:31:24.911 --> 02:31:26.580
<v Speaker 2>then go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show up.</v>

3540
02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:28.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll feel more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3541
02:31:28.711 --> 02:31:29.640
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even,</v>

3542
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:31.080
<v Speaker 2>he'll do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's booked.</v>

3543
02:31:31.081 --> 02:31:33.590
<v Speaker 2>He books that you have to craft a book</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit nine months.</v>

3544
02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if he works somewhere else,</v>

3545
02:31:35.851 --> 02:31:38.220
<v Speaker 2>he just shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll work at a comedy club and</v>

3546
02:31:38.221 --> 02:31:39.120
<v Speaker 2>just show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

3547
02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:41.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I was in Denver wants and he</v>

3548
02:31:41.101 --> 02:31:43.230
<v Speaker 2>just showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came in the green room after the show.</v>

3549
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:45.180
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the late show,</v>

3550
02:31:45.181 --> 02:31:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Friday night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went backstage and Dave's in the green</v>

3551
02:31:48.071 --> 02:31:48.481
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3552
02:31:48.481 --> 02:31:49.860
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3553
02:31:49.861 --> 02:31:50.491
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it goes,</v>

3554
02:31:50.491 --> 02:31:53.580
<v Speaker 2>hey Joe Downs fucking around here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to go on stage?</v>

3555
02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:54.241
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

3556
02:31:54.241 --> 02:31:54.750
<v Speaker 2>I ain't go fuck.</v>

3557
02:31:54.750 --> 02:31:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grabbed them,</v>

3558
02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:57.930
<v Speaker 2>bring the people back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were already getting up and</v>

3559
02:31:57.931 --> 02:31:58.764
<v Speaker 2>leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3560
02:31:58.850 --> 02:32:00.330
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back.</v>

3561
02:32:00.450 --> 02:32:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Dave Chappelle's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he wants to go on stage as</v>

3562
02:32:03.421 --> 02:32:04.950
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is he there twice.</v>

3563
02:32:04.951 --> 02:32:06.720
<v Speaker 2>It's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does his thing,</v>

3564
02:32:06.721 --> 02:32:08.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just weird to say like,</v>

3565
02:32:08.130 --> 02:32:11.460
<v Speaker 2>oh like this guy is so free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could just fly into a town where he</v>

3566
02:32:11.461 --> 02:32:13.770
<v Speaker 2>knows his friends are going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even have to call you in</v>

3567
02:32:13.771 --> 02:32:14.730
<v Speaker 2>advance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3568
02:32:14.731 --> 02:32:16.590
<v Speaker 2>he just flew in and I see him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3569
02:32:16.591 --> 02:32:17.760
<v Speaker 2>get up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>

3570
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:21.600
<v Speaker 2>he's his free as a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does like whatever he wants and then</v>

3571
02:32:21.601 --> 02:32:24.990
<v Speaker 2>he does these netflix specials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pay my ass load of money and then</v>

3572
02:32:24.991 --> 02:32:29.610
<v Speaker 2>he just does shows whenever he wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his creative process is like almost</v>

3573
02:32:29.611 --> 02:32:33.780
<v Speaker 2>like engineered around being loose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like doing whatever he wants,</v>

3574
02:32:33.781 --> 02:32:34.800
<v Speaker 2>go on where he wants to go.</v>

3575
02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Doing what every once and then writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3576
02:32:38.101 --> 02:32:41.430
<v Speaker 2>and then figuring out on then riff in it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just fucking around.</v>

3577
02:32:41.940 --> 02:32:44.010
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating to watch.</v>

3578
02:32:44.830 --> 02:32:46.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like jazz almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3579
02:32:46.051 --> 02:32:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it's very much like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3580
02:32:47.611 --> 02:32:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's also got B and Dave Chappelle down</v>

3581
02:32:51.811 --> 02:32:53.820
<v Speaker 2>to a science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you were saying that you are in the</v>

3582
02:32:53.821 --> 02:32:56.700
<v Speaker 2>sturgill simpson business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in the Dave Chappelle business.</v>

3583
02:32:56.701 --> 02:32:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3584
02:32:58.390 --> 02:33:01.140
<v Speaker 2>It does what Dave Chappelle wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the key,</v>

3585
02:33:01.141 --> 02:33:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the key.</v>

3586
02:33:02.491 --> 02:33:05.760
<v Speaker 2>If we could all be in the business of</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever the fuck you are,</v>

3587
02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:11.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever you do well is I like to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>songs and make rutgers and pretty much</v>

3588
02:33:11.711 --> 02:33:12.840
<v Speaker 2>say no to everything.</v>

3589
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave seems to be on a,</v>

3590
02:33:20.431 --> 02:33:22.800
<v Speaker 2>on a much grander scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ain't like yourself.</v>

3591
02:33:22.801 --> 02:33:25.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any point of the day,</v>

3592
02:33:25.231 --> 02:33:27.510
<v Speaker 2>were you ever do anything you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do?</v>

3593
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:28.980
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>

3594
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:30.541
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3595
02:33:30.541 --> 02:33:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I do things that I know I have to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not looking forward to,</v>

3596
02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:36.720
<v Speaker 2>but that's mostly like exercise shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3597
02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:38.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes I'm just not looking</v>

3598
02:33:38.431 --> 02:33:41.910
<v Speaker 2>forward to it and I have to force myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it or writing.</v>

3599
02:33:41.970 --> 02:33:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I love writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I have to force myself to</v>

3600
02:33:44.071 --> 02:33:46.710
<v Speaker 2>sit down in front of the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

3601
02:33:46.730 --> 02:33:48.480
<v Speaker 2>like I know it on a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3602
02:33:48.810 --> 02:33:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3603
02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3604
02:33:51.391 --> 02:33:52.380
<v Speaker 2>write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3605
02:33:52.381 --> 02:33:54.480
<v Speaker 2>write by hand too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I write by hand,</v>

3606
02:33:54.481 --> 02:33:57.660
<v Speaker 2>it's really just rehashing things right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I ride on a computer,</v>

3607
02:33:57.661 --> 02:34:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I see there's no way I can write with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands as quickly as I can type.</v>

3608
02:34:02.490 --> 02:34:04.500
<v Speaker 2>I can type pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm,</v>

3609
02:34:04.501 --> 02:34:06.810
<v Speaker 2>if I have an idea and I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear my voice,</v>

3610
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:08.550
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to say it into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone,</v>

3611
02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to just figure out what the beats</v>
<v Speaker 2>are of things.</v>

3612
02:34:12.090 --> 02:34:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3613
02:34:13.351 --> 02:34:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Well I was gonna say that I always write</v>
<v Speaker 2>by hand because</v>

3614
02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:23.000
<v Speaker 1>usually the meter or the phrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a way it makes me think about</v>

3615
02:34:23.001 --> 02:34:25.850
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes down right the first time or as</v>

3616
02:34:25.851 --> 02:34:29.270
<v Speaker 1>opposed to them just like writing poetry</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a computer screen or whatever,</v>

3617
02:34:29.271 --> 02:34:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't necessarily have a sense of</v>

3618
02:34:31.711 --> 02:34:32.544
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beat,</v>

3619
02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:35.930
<v Speaker 1>whereas like I want things to flow a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way and land on,</v>

3620
02:34:36.770 --> 02:34:39.590
<v Speaker 1>on hits and that and I usually just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw all the continents away.</v>

3621
02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:41.513
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

3622
02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:44.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton wrote his entire memoir on</v>

3623
02:34:44.931 --> 02:34:46.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like legal paper.</v>

3624
02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:48.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote it on lecture.</v>

3625
02:34:49.090 --> 02:34:51.610
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your writing as well?</v>

3626
02:34:52.250 --> 02:34:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I think he wrote it on like a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>notebook,</v>

3627
02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:57.560
<v Speaker 1>like maybe one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3628
02:34:58.170 --> 02:35:00.560
<v Speaker 1>black and white ones that used to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were with the,</v>

3629
02:35:00.570 --> 02:35:04.890
<v Speaker 1>with the splatter recovers stacks of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things the best.</v>

3630
02:35:05.310 --> 02:35:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I still reach out to those when I write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3631
02:35:08.311 --> 02:35:10.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I write on a piece of paper,</v>

3632
02:35:10.711 --> 02:35:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm really just reminded myself most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

3633
02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally I have an idea that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like circle and I put an x next to it</v>

3634
02:35:16.471 --> 02:35:18.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's all slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you read my notebook,</v>

3635
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:20.880
<v Speaker 1>you think I was a crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something to that too.</v>

3636
02:35:20.881 --> 02:35:25.620
<v Speaker 1>In terms of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I learned a long time ago,</v>

3637
02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:29.220
<v Speaker 1>if there's a song I want to learn and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to remember all the words,</v>

3638
02:35:29.730 --> 02:35:31.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to remember him until I</v>

3639
02:35:31.591 --> 02:35:34.890
<v Speaker 1>just sit down and write that song down</v>
<v Speaker 1>on paper.</v>

3640
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Like one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I write it on paper and see it,</v>

3641
02:35:37.411 --> 02:35:38.244
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's there.</v>

3642
02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3643
02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:42.870
<v Speaker 1>And like whether it's mine or somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only forget the words to the shit I</v>

3644
02:35:42.871 --> 02:35:43.471
<v Speaker 1>write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weirdly.</v>

3645
02:35:43.471 --> 02:35:46.740
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shows it never fails.</v>

3646
02:35:46.830 --> 02:35:50.150
<v Speaker 1>If I get lost or forget something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always a song I wrote.</v>

3647
02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Never really 8,000 old country and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bluegrass songs like would just pull out</v>

3648
02:35:53.851 --> 02:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>of my ass on a diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember all that shit.</v>

3649
02:35:55.741 --> 02:35:58.170
<v Speaker 1>But it's always the ones I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why.</v>

3650
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3651
02:35:59.770 --> 02:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense to elect,</v>

3652
02:36:01.561 --> 02:36:02.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the other ones that you</v>

3653
02:36:02.941 --> 02:36:05.190
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just had an impact on you.</v>

3654
02:36:05.430 --> 02:36:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Like they mean something to you or it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one you wrote,</v>

3655
02:36:07.531 --> 02:36:11.310
<v Speaker 1>like he like comes out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes through you to your pad.</v>

3656
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3657
02:36:13.050 --> 02:36:16.730
<v Speaker 1>it's almost hard to recapture that state</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like a normal person</v>

3658
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:19.080
<v Speaker 1>trying to remember what you thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were in that zone.</v>

3659
02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if it was a song that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else made.</v>

3660
02:36:22.170 --> 02:36:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3661
02:36:22.650 --> 02:36:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the song.</v>

3662
02:36:23.530 --> 02:36:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's like,</v>

3663
02:36:25.351 --> 02:36:28.530
<v Speaker 1>because you're reacting to it strongly</v>
<v Speaker 1>more strongly.</v>

3664
02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3665
02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:33.690
<v Speaker 1>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a thing of creativity</v>

3666
02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:36.030
<v Speaker 1>that involves the no self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3667
02:36:36.450 --> 02:36:37.980
<v Speaker 1>There's that state that you get when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3668
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:40.260
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit that I write where</v>

3669
02:36:40.261 --> 02:36:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I go back over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3670
02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I write that bit out?</v>

3671
02:36:44.010 --> 02:36:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd go back and read it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't remember any of this.</v>

3672
02:36:47.130 --> 02:36:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Half of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

3673
02:36:48.241 --> 02:36:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I took us the hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardest part though,</v>

3674
02:36:50.211 --> 02:36:52.680
<v Speaker 1>those getting to that lack of self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3675
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean even I think that's with any art</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not thinking about it or</v>

3676
02:36:56.731 --> 02:37:00.870
<v Speaker 1>self aware or have any preconceived</v>
<v Speaker 1>notions about where it wants to go.</v>

3677
02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3678
02:37:02.310 --> 02:37:03.240
<v Speaker 1>do you smoke weed and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3679
02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:06.220
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3680
02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever like do one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>

3681
02:37:09.971 --> 02:37:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I have written while I'm high</v>

3682
02:37:12.770 --> 02:37:13.630
<v Speaker 1>written one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3683
02:37:13.631 --> 02:37:15.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about performing</v>

3684
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:17.450
<v Speaker 4>generally?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't enjoy,</v>

3685
02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:19.310
<v Speaker 4>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

3686
02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:21.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really like to smoke weed</v>

3687
02:37:21.681 --> 02:37:23.810
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something about the way it hits me</v>

3688
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:27.690
<v Speaker 4>when I inhale it and hide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes more heady and internalize</v>

3689
02:37:27.691 --> 02:37:30.170
<v Speaker 4>and like any anxiety or the paranoia of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people talk about that.</v>

3690
02:37:30.171 --> 02:37:32.930
<v Speaker 4>The only time I've ever experienced that</v>
<v Speaker 4>is when one of smoked weed.</v>

3691
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:38.590
<v Speaker 4>But my problem is I don't like going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>stage stone anymore because you're so</v>

3692
02:37:38.691 --> 02:37:41.990
<v Speaker 4>ultra sensitive my ear because like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>already struggle with it enough.</v>

3693
02:37:41.991 --> 02:37:45.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm hearing everything happening and</v>
<v Speaker 4>dissecting it all,</v>

3694
02:37:45.351 --> 02:37:50.210
<v Speaker 4>like hypercritical in real time and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't do that and performing let go.</v>

3695
02:37:50.211 --> 02:37:52.910
<v Speaker 4>So you kind of have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's two different brains.</v>

3696
02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:55.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I'm up there singing and looking</v>

3697
02:37:55.881 --> 02:37:57.290
<v Speaker 4>at an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm a stone,</v>

3698
02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:59.420
<v Speaker 4>I know enough about myself to know like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

3699
02:37:59.421 --> 02:38:03.320
<v Speaker 4>I'll get internalized and just only</v>
<v Speaker 4>start listening to the band and the</v>

3700
02:38:03.321 --> 02:38:03.710
<v Speaker 4>music.</v>

3701
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:06.020
<v Speaker 4>And you sort of forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's all these people there.</v>

3702
02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:09.080
<v Speaker 4>You have to give a show too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

3703
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:11.720
<v Speaker 4>maybe that is the show and we get lost</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the music.</v>

3704
02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:15.410
<v Speaker 4>And then I've also played some of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>best gigs I've ever played in my life,</v>

3705
02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:18.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on edibles.</v>

3706
02:38:19.450 --> 02:38:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3707
02:38:20.130 --> 02:38:25.130
<v Speaker 4>sort of like an anti anxiety and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like very free and you feel everything</v>

3708
02:38:25.431 --> 02:38:28.700
<v Speaker 4>much more delicately and in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 4>response,</v>

3709
02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:31.520
<v Speaker 4>but it's not something I would like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3710
02:38:31.521 --> 02:38:33.350
<v Speaker 4>we got to get high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good trump template gig.</v>

3711
02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:35.480
<v Speaker 4>You do or you don't?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't honestly kind,</v>

3712
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:38.440
<v Speaker 4>but I mean is you do what you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want.</v>

3713
02:38:38.441 --> 02:38:39.001
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3714
02:38:39.001 --> 02:38:40.250
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you are,</v>

3715
02:38:40.251 --> 02:38:41.890
<v Speaker 4>it's just this is tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3716
02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:44.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like you have a ritual,</v>

3717
02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:45.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3718
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:48.080
<v Speaker 4>I like a drink right before I go onstage</v>
<v Speaker 4>a shot.</v>

3719
02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:50.570
<v Speaker 4>So that messes lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll call messes with my voice.</v>

3720
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:51.920
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta stay away from it.</v>

3721
02:38:52.010 --> 02:38:52.770
<v Speaker 4>I just like</v>

3722
02:38:52.770 --> 02:38:54.540
<v Speaker 5>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just that little feeling that you get</v>

3723
02:38:54.541 --> 02:38:55.320
<v Speaker 5>with one shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3724
02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:56.340
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here we go.</v>

3725
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3726
02:38:58.731 --> 02:38:59.331
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

3727
02:38:59.331 --> 02:39:00.350
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about food?</v>

3728
02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that man,</v>

3729
02:39:04.310 --> 02:39:06.710
<v Speaker 4>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like eating close to a show,</v>

3730
02:39:06.711 --> 02:39:08.300
<v Speaker 4>especially certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just not good.</v>

3731
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll eat a big lunch and then just fast</v>

3732
02:39:13.461 --> 02:39:16.820
<v Speaker 4>and I'll eat after the gig most times</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I jumped around a lot and get</v>

3733
02:39:16.821 --> 02:39:17.750
<v Speaker 4>into shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3734
02:39:17.751 --> 02:39:18.500
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3735
02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:22.940
<v Speaker 4>and then one time we did this like radio</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing or some shit and I was,</v>

3736
02:39:22.941 --> 02:39:24.350
<v Speaker 4>or I couldn't fucking sing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>

3737
02:39:24.351 --> 02:39:27.860
<v Speaker 4>My voice was going as this freebie</v>
<v Speaker 4>throwaway thing for serious and we'd</v>

3738
02:39:27.861 --> 02:39:31.790
<v Speaker 4>been in there setting up and rehearsing</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the studio all day and then they</v>

3739
02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:32.331
<v Speaker 4>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3740
02:39:32.331 --> 02:39:33.740
<v Speaker 4>we haven't eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking starving.</v>

3741
02:39:33.741 --> 02:39:36.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna play gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we had some fid delivered and I ate</v>

3742
02:39:36.231 --> 02:39:38.660
<v Speaker 4>it like 10 minutes before we're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be correctly.</v>

3743
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:41.780
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't even know what fun and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3744
02:39:42.350 --> 02:39:44.090
<v Speaker 4>it just bombed me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

3745
02:39:44.110 --> 02:39:46.580
<v Speaker 4>Like your worst nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're out there like trying to really</v>

3746
02:39:46.581 --> 02:39:49.490
<v Speaker 4>push and singing on a microphone and not</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit your pants.</v>

3747
02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:51.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I've learned my lesson.</v>

3748
02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:52.320
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3749
02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:55.800
<v Speaker 5>hit the wall the other day in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the hell I ate,</v>

3750
02:39:55.830 --> 02:40:00.720
<v Speaker 5>but I literally had to put my hand on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>railing so I could squeeze my butt</v>

3751
02:40:00.721 --> 02:40:03.420
<v Speaker 5>cheeks together harder so I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit myself.</v>

3752
02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:04.380
<v Speaker 5>Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

3753
02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:08.670
<v Speaker 5>it broke through some weird barrier</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I thought I knew I had to take a</v>

3754
02:40:08.671 --> 02:40:11.150
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was thinking maybe I could let a</v>

3755
02:40:11.151 --> 02:40:13.680
<v Speaker 5>far to how first when I'm on my way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>bathroom,</v>

3756
02:40:13.681 --> 02:40:15.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The gambler,</v>

3757
02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:19.590
<v Speaker 5>Bret took a step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took a step and all of a sudden it's</v>

3758
02:40:19.591 --> 02:40:22.710
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if I had a water bag inside my body</v>

3759
02:40:22.711 --> 02:40:27.711
<v Speaker 5>and it just broke and then I'm holding</v>
<v Speaker 5>it all together with my asshole and</v>

3760
02:40:27.931 --> 02:40:31.740
<v Speaker 5>squeezing my ass cheeks and the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>abdominal pain is like,</v>

3761
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:34.020
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The litter,</v>

3762
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:36.030
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like you remember when you were a</v>

3763
02:40:36.031 --> 02:40:38.760
<v Speaker 5>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to put your thumb over the garden</v>

3764
02:40:38.761 --> 02:40:43.761
<v Speaker 5>hose and just try to really clamp that</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking thing down and like you got to a</v>

3765
02:40:44.161 --> 02:40:47.040
<v Speaker 5>place where you stopped all the water</v>
<v Speaker 5>from coming out of the garden hose,</v>

3766
02:40:47.041 --> 02:40:49.650
<v Speaker 5>but barely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean fucking barely.</v>

3767
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:52.860
<v Speaker 5>That was my ass hall the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm holding onto the railing,</v>

3768
02:40:52.861 --> 02:40:56.970
<v Speaker 5>just wheezing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I did these little baby steps like</v>

3769
02:40:56.971 --> 02:41:00.420
<v Speaker 5>this towards a toilet where I was not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't even picking up my legs.</v>

3770
02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:03.510
<v Speaker 5>I was just sliding my legs over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>barely,</v>

3771
02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:08.730
<v Speaker 5>barely got my pants off and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a broken fire hydrant came out of my</v>

3772
02:41:08.731 --> 02:41:11.940
<v Speaker 5>asshole just uhg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3773
02:41:11.941 --> 02:41:13.980
<v Speaker 5>where was this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where'd this come from?</v>

3774
02:41:13.981 --> 02:41:16.680
<v Speaker 5>Like five minutes ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was nothing wrong with me.</v>

3775
02:41:16.681 --> 02:41:19.800
<v Speaker 5>I felt 100% normal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have imagined that this could</v>

3776
02:41:19.801 --> 02:41:20.520
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3777
02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:24.770
<v Speaker 5>And then all sudden it's flying at me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's terrifying to think could happen</v>

3778
02:41:24.771 --> 02:41:25.950
<v Speaker 5>at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can be on a plane.</v>

3779
02:41:26.310 --> 02:41:29.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stuck in your seat and you just shit all</v>

3780
02:41:29.311 --> 02:41:33.060
<v Speaker 5>over your socks and your pants and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>just runs up your back and down your</v>

3781
02:41:33.061 --> 02:41:33.900
<v Speaker 5>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can happen</v>

3782
02:41:33.930 --> 02:41:36.240
<v Speaker 4>in anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had full blown,</v>

3783
02:41:37.050 --> 02:41:40.750
<v Speaker 4>absolutely horrible food poisoning and</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out both ends and you literally</v>

3784
02:41:40.770 --> 02:41:41.760
<v Speaker 4>think I might die.</v>

3785
02:41:41.850 --> 02:41:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3786
02:41:42.721 --> 02:41:44.520
<v Speaker 5>I had a real bad once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3787
02:41:44.521 --> 02:41:48.330
<v Speaker 5>I've had it real bad twice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that Barracuda than I used to have</v>

3788
02:41:48.331 --> 02:41:51.090
<v Speaker 5>this cool 1970 barracuda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was named the sick fish.</v>

3789
02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:53.970
<v Speaker 5>The reason why I named it the sick fish</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I got food poisoning.</v>

3790
02:41:54.510 --> 02:41:56.670
<v Speaker 5>I ain't linguine with clams and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Illinois.</v>

3791
02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:59.220
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking clams anywhere near</v>
<v Speaker 5>Illinois.</v>

3792
02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:02.220
<v Speaker 5>And those things got me hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3793
02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:05.250
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't even make a fist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The next day I was walking around like a</v>

3794
02:42:05.251 --> 02:42:06.930
<v Speaker 5>Zombie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was dead.</v>

3795
02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:10.950
<v Speaker 5>I spent the whole night throwing up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitting myself and then the next day I</v>

3796
02:42:10.951 --> 02:42:13.590
<v Speaker 5>was just dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I drank like five or six cups of coffee</v>

3797
02:42:13.591 --> 02:42:15.060
<v Speaker 5>cause we had a film,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing where we were,</v>

3798
02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:18.360
<v Speaker 5>they were putting the engine in the car</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they were going over the design.</v>

3799
02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:20.760
<v Speaker 5>I was like barely able to stay awake</v>
<v Speaker 5>while I was doing that.</v>

3800
02:42:20.761 --> 02:42:21.780
<v Speaker 5>I was so wrecked.</v>

3801
02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:25.590
<v Speaker 4>It's all I had at one time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3802
02:42:25.690 --> 02:42:29.020
<v Speaker 4>from this Chinese buffet and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>for or you know,</v>

3803
02:42:29.410 --> 02:42:33.100
<v Speaker 4>it hit me hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was later that night and all of a</v>

3804
02:42:33.101 --> 02:42:36.610
<v Speaker 4>sudden it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was in this bathroom for four or five</v>

3805
02:42:36.611 --> 02:42:41.560
<v Speaker 4>hours and it was those things like it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the worst shape I've ever been in.</v>

3806
02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:43.180
<v Speaker 4>But in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the back of your mind,</v>

3807
02:42:43.210 --> 02:42:44.043
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3808
02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:45.710
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

3809
02:42:45.850 --> 02:42:47.950
<v Speaker 4>I know this is food poisoning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like it's good.</v>

3810
02:42:48.010 --> 02:42:49.210
<v Speaker 4>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to hit,</v>

3811
02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:52.000
<v Speaker 4>it's going to go to a point and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it just,</v>

3812
02:42:52.001 --> 02:42:54.430
<v Speaker 4>throughout the night it just kept</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting worse and I kept asking,</v>

3813
02:42:54.431 --> 02:42:57.430
<v Speaker 4>where's this point going to be or do I</v>
<v Speaker 4>need to go to the hospital?</v>

3814
02:42:57.431 --> 02:43:02.431
<v Speaker 4>Because there was very uncommon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know like up.like abdominal tremors,</v>

3815
02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:07.660
<v Speaker 4>shit from puking so hard and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>muscles are just spasming and no,</v>

3816
02:43:07.661 --> 02:43:10.300
<v Speaker 4>you can die from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people have died from Eco Lye</v>

3817
02:43:10.301 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 4>poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a</v>

3818
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:14.980
<v Speaker 1>scene in food inc where they talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this little kid,</v>

3819
02:43:14.981 --> 02:43:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they got food poisoning from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was at Jack in the box and he</v>

3820
02:43:18.290 --> 02:43:20.800
<v Speaker 1>wound up dying was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3821
02:43:20.801 --> 02:43:23.320
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible way to die and you're</v>

3822
02:43:23.321 --> 02:43:26.470
<v Speaker 1>ingesting some sort of a poison and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just takes over.</v>

3823
02:43:26.471 --> 02:43:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Your system just kills your cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body can't process it quickly</v>

3824
02:43:29.621 --> 02:43:30.850
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get it out enough.</v>

3825
02:43:31.090 --> 02:43:34.300
<v Speaker 1>You're shitting yourself and throwing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing everything you can to get</v>

3826
02:43:34.301 --> 02:43:36.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck is inside you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3827
02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All at food.</v>

3828
02:43:38.891 --> 02:43:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Food on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we play it pretty safe.</v>

3829
02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll skip meals.</v>

3830
02:43:42.461 --> 02:43:46.210
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times I'll not eat if the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative is something like really</v>

3831
02:43:46.211 --> 02:43:47.090
<v Speaker 1>shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3832
02:43:47.210 --> 02:43:49.240

<v Speaker 1>not because like,</v>

3833
02:43:49.270 --> 02:43:50.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a health nut,</v>

3834
02:43:50.981 --> 02:43:52.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

3835
02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I bring a lot of protein bars.</v>

3836
02:43:54.450 --> 02:43:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring a ton of protein bar,</v>

3837
02:43:55.881 --> 02:43:59.350
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm stuck and I need eat something</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just down like,</v>

3838

3839
02:44:01.061 --> 02:44:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Protein bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like those.</v>

3840
02:44:02.291 --> 02:44:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I like those quest bars and I mean sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>in them.</v>

3841
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I like a Mussel farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I some good bars just,</v>

3842
02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't live off of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's way better than that.</v>

3843
02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:12.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting a burger or you eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar?</v>

3844
02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>

3845
02:44:13.961 --> 02:44:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give him like last night I had a</v>

3846
02:44:15.581 --> 02:44:16.630
<v Speaker 1>piece of apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhubarb,</v>

3847
02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:19.540
<v Speaker 1>strawberry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhubarb pie though with whipped cream.</v>

3848
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went deep,</v>

3849
02:44:21.430 --> 02:44:24.250
<v Speaker 1>but that's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a thing a while back.</v>

3850
02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I kind of got pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I tried to see just how long,</v>

3851
02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:30.820
<v Speaker 1>as long as I could without any sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbs you go.</v>

3852
02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like 12 days something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3853
02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:34.410
<v Speaker 1>it was nice man.</v>

3854
02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:38.050
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is hard because everything has</v>

3855
02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:40.760
<v Speaker 1>sugar in it and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and then,</v>

3856
02:44:40.761 --> 02:44:44.020
<v Speaker 1>but after even just abstaining that</v>
<v Speaker 1>short amount of time when I did eat it</v>

3857
02:44:44.021 --> 02:44:46.240
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first it was like everything tasted</v>

3858
02:44:46.241 --> 02:44:50.110
<v Speaker 1>so sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could really understand how much</v>

3859
02:44:50.111 --> 02:44:52.540
<v Speaker 1>we're getting drugged with food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3860
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:55.090
<v Speaker 1>but my thing is coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drink coffee in the morning.</v>

3861
02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a breakfast guy voted in but I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't drink it straight cause it</v>

3862
02:44:57.641 --> 02:45:00.640
<v Speaker 1>takes like a bucket full asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to cut it with something.</v>

3863
02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I could cut out coffee with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could probably cut out sugar.</v>

3864
02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh did you say you cut it with some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sugar cream and sugar and they</v>

3865
02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:08.950
<v Speaker 1>usually see I just used cream man or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink these.</v>

3866
02:45:08.951 --> 02:45:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Did you like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Caveman's I get a bunch of those in</v>

3867
02:45:11.101 --> 02:45:11.440
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

3868
02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'll have lunch sent to you.</v>

3869
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:14.950
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the mud but down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3870
02:45:14.951 --> 02:45:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get my bud from this.</v>

3871
02:45:16.670 --> 02:45:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I ate that made me get</v>

3872
02:45:18.311 --> 02:45:18.791
<v Speaker 1>mud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3873
02:45:18.791 --> 02:45:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out to not be anything.</v>

3874
02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I had that one terrible shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the rest of the day was golden.</v>

3875
02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:27.920
<v Speaker 1>It was no problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like something got in there and</v>

3876
02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:31.870
<v Speaker 1>microbacteria I ate a lot of probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that helps.</v>

3877
02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that that helps and that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat something funky,</v>

3878
02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:39.160
<v Speaker 1>all the good stuff that I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I eat Kimchi almost every day.</v>

3879
02:45:39.490 --> 02:45:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I drink every day,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was out in Utah,</v>

3894
02:46:14.501 --> 02:46:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I worked with this kid who was a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter and he would bring in elk,</v>

3895
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:20.660
<v Speaker 1>like filet medallions that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>hamburger and he that he,</v>

3896
02:46:20.690 --> 02:46:23.090
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived in Wyoming so he could pull</v>

3897
02:46:23.091 --> 02:46:28.040
<v Speaker 1>like two or three extra tags year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like the 18 deep freezers full of</v>

3898
02:46:28.041 --> 02:46:31.340
<v Speaker 1>every possible cut of meat you can think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of made from elk meat.</v>

3899
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And he would bring it in sometimes when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were working and cook that shit in</v>

3900
02:46:34.581 --> 02:46:36.290
<v Speaker 1>the first time I ever tasted it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ever tasted in my life.</v>

3903
02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I basically eat it almost every day.</v>
