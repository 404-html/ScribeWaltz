00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>My father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father used to say,</v>

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>if someone doesn't say the word fuck or </v>
<v Speaker 1>if their name is an initial,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never know.</v>

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a hard fast rule.</v>

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Shut the front door is one like moms </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to do around their kids.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was like A.</v>

18
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Richard is like him on the sunset strip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows.</v>

19
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Surprisingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't swear.</v>

20
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Teddy Atlas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know teddy.</v>

21
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

22
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animated it.</v>

23
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get very animated.</v>

24
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't really like fricking this and</v>

25
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>fricking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>What the Frick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says what the Frick.</v>

27
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also doesn't swear Henry rollins.</v>

29
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Rollins does not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not swear.</v>

30
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>It makes note of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Note that I don't swear he,</v>

31
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.623
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that happened in the second </v>

32
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>half of his life because black flag </v>
<v Speaker 1>records,</v>

33
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I think he's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>get more people to listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying to be more mainstream,</v>

36
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>but he's trying to eliminate the noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

37
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>In what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

38
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

39
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Unlike me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:41.481
<v Speaker 1>you're really Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've hit a little snag here.</v>

42
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Teddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlas Jordan Peterson,</v>

43
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry rollins.</v>

44
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Than this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

45
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love your music.</v>

46
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of here.</v>

47
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.863
<v Speaker 1>Now you're saying you were saying you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about fuckups before the show </v>

48
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>saying I don't know anybody who's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artist who doesn't fuck things up.</v>

49
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really creative,</v>

50
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>there's something about being like </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimately creative.</v>

51
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>There has to be something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're wired differently.</v>

52
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So what we perceive as what people see </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive as fucking up isn't to us.</v>

53
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So technically it's a fuck up,</v>

54
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>but in reality to us it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just behavioral.</v>

55
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just traits.</v>

56
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>If you were working at an office in </v>
<v Speaker 1>human resources,</v>

57
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you would use the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I'd be gone in like three</v>

58
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:27.774
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before that I probably put a bullet </v>

59
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>through man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was in a cubicle,</v>

60
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>just give up at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people can do it though.</v>

61
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>So people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a problem.</v>

62
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wired that way.</v>

63
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>But I knew from such an early age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not wired this way.</v>

64
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified of getting a job when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a child.</v>

67
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fearful.</v>

68
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>But now what you've done though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

69
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you how much of a fan I am,</v>

70
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:03.621
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a fan of how punk rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've built all of this outside of the,</v>

71
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 2>what you were expected to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This show is a fuck you really.</v>

72
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

73
00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:15.624
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens when you don't </v>

74
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:17.940
<v Speaker 2>calculate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cow.</v>

76
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Just do what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what happened.</v>

77
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:22.500
<v Speaker 2>When people don't have the balls to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

78
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit balls.</v>

79
00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:27.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gave me a lot of financial freedom.</v>

80
00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:28.554
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

81
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>That helped too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

82
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 2>When you radio news radio did a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

83
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:35.010
<v Speaker 2>but fear factor did way more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just gave you.</v>

84
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Gave me enough money so I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

85
00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:38.000
<v Speaker 2>the money part I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.440
<v Speaker 2>So now let's just have some fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

87
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.170
<v Speaker 2>But look what it's become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Changed People's lives,</v>

88
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:44.160
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

89
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the weird part that that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

90
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.770
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a part of the plan.</v>

91
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.230
<v Speaker 2>It was just supposed to be smoking weed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and having a good time.</v>

92
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not aware until you're aware,</v>

93
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.800
<v Speaker 2>until people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

113
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.320

<v Speaker 1>one of the worst things,</v>

114
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>but when you're living a certain way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's fast,</v>

115
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.840
<v Speaker 1>same with comedy and you're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're grinding it out,</v>

116
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.460
<v Speaker 1>you can always analyze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can always step back and say,</v>

117
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 1>this is why things are fucked up because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's moving so fast.</v>

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.340
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't until I took that time and</v>

119
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.174
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's cancers in my life that are </v>

120
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.613
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're basically their emotional </v>

121
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>barnacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.650
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you,</v>

123
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.653
<v Speaker 1>once you cut the cancer out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see how different things become and </v>

124
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

125
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it was that easy.</v>

126
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do it,</v>

127
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.240
<v Speaker 2>you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to them too,</v>

128
00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:36.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a good lesson for them to be cast </v>
<v Speaker 2>aside and for them,</v>

129
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.320
<v Speaker 2>if they're smart or if they have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness or some objectivity,</v>

130
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:41.580
<v Speaker 2>they're going to look at themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

131
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking mess.</v>

132
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.843
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm negative all the time and people </v>

133
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be around me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was real negative when I was young.</v>

134
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:48.870
<v Speaker 2>So as I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

135
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.381
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

136
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:50.214
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that's </v>

137
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.620
<v Speaker 2>insurmountable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get over.</v>

138
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

139
00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

140
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.483
<v Speaker 1>whatever hand you've been dealt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to realize the reality of </v>

141
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

142
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.150
<v Speaker 1>There's people living in mud huts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>places that are smiling and the,</v>

143
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.423
<v Speaker 1>and I have the balls to be complaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your writing and not getting </v>

144
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.400
<v Speaker 1>enough sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to travel.</v>

145
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.650
<v Speaker 1>You just really have to assess that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

146
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.733
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the way I should be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>or processing information because we're </v>

147
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>blessed to do what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

148
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>You make people laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

149
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>For living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know</v>

150
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.193
<v Speaker 2>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a balance that you can achieve </v>

151
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:32.354
<v Speaker 2>between discipline and the creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like we were talking about like </v>

152
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:40.230
<v Speaker 2>yourself who are just off hand tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wacky shows,</v>

153
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.520
<v Speaker 2>something about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People see you though.</v>

154
00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is this guy doing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow you when you're walking through a</v>

155
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:46.034
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a balance between that </v>

156
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 2>and then real disciplined people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

157
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 2>fucking navy seal type cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You learn from them too.</v>

158
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you go well that you can incorporate</v>

159
00:06:56.661 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 2>some of that into your life as well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps balance out all the wacky,</v>

160
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 2>creative aspects of it and it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more productive,</v>

161
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 2>a little bit happier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit dead.</v>

162
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Prez had a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a song.</v>

163
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>A discipline makes things easier to </v>
<v Speaker 2>great fucking salt is,</v>

164
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a great song because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

165
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 2>It really does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Discipline makes things easier.</v>

166
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 2>It Israel organize your life</v>

167
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Speaker 1>like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I feel most,</v>

168
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.951
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:28.784
<v Speaker 1>because of how you live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your body feeds into your how your </v>

170
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>mind works when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

171
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.003
<v Speaker 1>when I'm bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was talking about that now I'm </v>

172
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Negative years.</v>

173
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:44.490
<v Speaker 1>It was also dictated by terrible diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>

174
00:07:44.491 --> 00:07:45.324
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that I'm in great shape or anything </v>

175
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've changed things and I felt it up</v>

176
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

177
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what people don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel it in your brain.</v>

178
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a different person man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After I,</v>

179
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>after I spar a little bit or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

180
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.550
<v Speaker 1>feel different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

181
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.393
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got more energy where you would think </v>

182
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>logic would dictate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get tired.</v>

183
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm ready to write now I'm crazy.</v>

184
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

185
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

186
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's um,</v>

187
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

188
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 1>it's discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

189
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

190
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother's making gravy and meatballs.</v>

191
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.940
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike said,</v>

192
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.173
<v Speaker 1>settle down.</v>

193
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 2>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat that once a week,</v>

194
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.510
<v Speaker 2>once a week you go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go whole hog gravy.</v>

195
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:32.890
<v Speaker 2>That's such an east coast Italian word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandparents in New Jersey,</v>

196
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:33.724
<v Speaker 2>it was gravy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apologize to everyone that's not in New </v>

197
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.960
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philly and Jersey,</v>

198
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:39.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barely New York.</v>

199
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll fight and they'll fight you.</v>

200
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.450
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sauce,</v>

201
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.700
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy,</v>

202
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:47.260
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not do this.</v>

203
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gravies,</v>

204
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.170
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey.</v>

205
00:08:50.171 --> 00:08:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Like old school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian soprano style.</v>

206
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.060
<v Speaker 2>That's gravy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philly's gravy.</v>

207
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Then you go south</v>

208
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>of Philly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Become sauce again.</v>

209
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking good.</v>

210
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>No matter what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

211
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how like if you go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to Italy?</v>

212
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my families to lower there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The food is fucking fantastic.</v>

213
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Next level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different kind of food.</v>

214
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>It's Italian Americans did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

215
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>is a totally different cuisine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

217
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Is the meatballs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lasagna,</v>

218
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>they will put some shit in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what it is,</v>

219
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

220
00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:28.900
<v Speaker 1>let's have at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.803
<v Speaker 1>The Italian food in Italy is lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more fish and then you have </v>

222
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:35.754
<v Speaker 1>the regions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're north of your south of here </v>

223
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:38.141
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

224
00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:39.610
<v Speaker 1>if you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

225
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.940
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

226
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is odd.</v>

227
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.763
<v Speaker 1>It was culture shock just to think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've been eating for my mother's </v>

228
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 1>food and grandparents and you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean?</v>

229
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just different.</v>

230
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.533
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother was fresh off the boat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she used to cook everything from </v>

231
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 1>scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomato sauce from scratch,</v>

232
00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>everything to pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would roll the pasta herself.</v>

233
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 1>She read everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would make her own bread.</v>

234
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 1>She would do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything from scratch.</v>

235
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.563
<v Speaker 1>The bread wasn't all there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bread was occasional because a lot </v>

236
00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:09.964
<v Speaker 1>of the times there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they lived in New Jersey there was </v>

237
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:12.414
<v Speaker 1>a store that they would go to a bread </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that you would go and buy fresh </v>

238
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 1>bread basically every couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

239
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.273
<v Speaker 1>And it would go bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like within hours because it was real </v>

240
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.443
<v Speaker 1>bread without 8,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now today I had a piece of bread the </v>

241
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 1>other day and it was sitting on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen table for like a few hours.</v>

242
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.953
<v Speaker 1>I left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back.</v>

243
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It was still soft as fuck because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all filled with chemicals.</v>

244
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.411
<v Speaker 1>Horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

245
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:35.244
<v Speaker 1>Everything is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is what it's like when you </v>

246
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:41.960
<v Speaker 1>realize that there's fluoride in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking water and people are just start</v>

247
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 1>right with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that that's.</v>

248
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.133
<v Speaker 1>That should be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read that I read about Florida and </v>

249
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 1>a drink of water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the pros and cons.</v>

250
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 1>The pros don't make any sense to me like</v>
<v Speaker 1>brush your fucking teeth.</v>

251
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Pitch use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the uh,</v>

253
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

254
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think Andre.</v>

255
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 1>and then you get into all the conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

257
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:09.800
<v Speaker 1>That's when you got to wade through all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit.</v>

258
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.643
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

259
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.020
<v Speaker 1>it was a Nazi plot to soften minds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

260
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.133
<v Speaker 1>Or was it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like somebody just got a lot of </v>

261
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:18.564
<v Speaker 1>flora they're trying to sell and they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got some sort of a deal with the </v>

262
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:22.130
<v Speaker 1>government that's put into the wall.</v>

263
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing,</v>

264
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 1>the thing is with all that conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

265
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to sift through shit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are kernels in their problem,</v>

266
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.040
<v Speaker 1>but they liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liked the more ridiculous,</v>

267
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.533
<v Speaker 1>the more ridiculous the theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better it is for them because that </v>

268
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>it seems more ridiculous in that year </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

269
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Oh,</v>

270
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.244
<v Speaker 1>you mean they're like the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whoever is dumped on the floor or </v>

271
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>whoever they in bags of Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when your grandma used to say,</v>

272
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.653
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go girl whose day they say that </v>

273
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.500
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's they?</v>

274
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But whoever that is,</v>

275
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more ridiculous things seem.</v>

276
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.993
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It nullifies some more realistic things </v>

277
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:09.220
<v Speaker 1>like pumping into food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into cattle,</v>

278
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.850
<v Speaker 1>steroids in cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

279
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were younger bro,</v>

280
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 1>white girls didn't have fat ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

281
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:17.140
<v Speaker 1>but they learned squats.</v>

282
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.520
<v Speaker 1>You think that's what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do with cattle or.</v>

283
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think it's squashed.</v>

284
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of white girls out there with flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>asses to this day,</v>

285
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>they're just lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

286
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to trust you because you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe you.</v>

287
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 1>You're a gym guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of what's going on with food is not</v>

288
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:34.174
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of what's going on with food is </v>

289
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics because they're getting sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>from eating corn.</v>

290
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch,</v>

291
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:41.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great documentary,</v>

292
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:46.231
<v Speaker 1>king corn and it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It documents how a lot of cows have huge</v>

293
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 1>issues digesting all that corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a natural thing for them.</v>

294
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to eat grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

295
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:51.803
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

296
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.833
<v Speaker 1>The fuck up and make some quite tasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's really not what they're </v>

297
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

298
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I always started the chemically </v>

299
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:02.074
<v Speaker 1>speaking that that's what was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>pumped into everything now because it's </v>

300
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

301
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 1>They don't need to do it either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in Mexico,</v>

302
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:09.754
<v Speaker 1>they still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how Canelo got paired with the </v>

303
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.980
<v Speaker 1>clench and I air quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>

304
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 1>he got clipped things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clenbuterol came from mistake.</v>

305
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.703
<v Speaker 1>I got a fucking bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can get it from mistake </v>

306
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

307
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fighters that say,</v>

308
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trained them Mexican.</v>

309
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Someone recently said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see this fight.</v>

310
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

311
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's got cleanliness.</v>

312
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the why didn't you get popped?</v>

313
00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't inject it.</v>

314
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That was his line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

315
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some shenanigans going on in all</v>

316
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.750
<v Speaker 1>combat sports and all professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

317
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 1>You get a little edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the money involved.</v>

318
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to,</v>

319
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and teddy loses his mind with that.</v>

320
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Rightly so when someone's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate about anything.</v>

321
00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus man,</v>

322
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.550
<v Speaker 1>like said treasure.</v>

323
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an American treasure.</v>

324
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

325
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 1>He was great man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stories about his dad.</v>

326
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.020
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear it?</v>

327
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear the Pi?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watched half of it,</v>

328
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>but I read his book so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

329
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:14.980
<v Speaker 1>teddy bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teddy was a goon man.</v>

330
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

331
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:16.984
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where he got that slice was </v>

332
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.780
<v Speaker 1>hanging in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His face was hanging off.</v>

333
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

334
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:21.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

335
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

336
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Well the Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

337
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm in awe of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating gentleman.</v>

339
00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is just scary.</v>

340
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

341
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

342
00:14:34.881 --> 00:14:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

343
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I would just crumble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to have a conversation with.</v>

344
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just like a nitwit you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch up.</v>

345
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened two days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends.</v>

346
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.413
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you are around a certain </v>

347
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 1>caliber thinker than your vibration</v>

348
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.203
<v Speaker 3>sort of matches their operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're around people that are way </v>

349
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 3>smarter than you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize like,</v>

350
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some shortcuts to think and that</v>

351
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's some,</v>

352
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:01.843
<v Speaker 3>there's some pitfalls and the way I </v>
<v Speaker 3>analyze things and these people don't </v>

353
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 3>have those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then my vocabulary stunted.</v>

354
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should increase my vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just start reading more,</v>

355
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.450
<v Speaker 3>reading the things and that it just with</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people,</v>

356
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:15.284
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing as with fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amount of how much time you put in </v>

357
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 3>for how long and that's the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your intellect.</v>

358
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:23.840
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>stability.</v>

359
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.943
<v Speaker 3>It's how much energy and effort and </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus have you put into it and for how </v>

360
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 3>long?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

361
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.770
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

362
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.720
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said though,</v>

363
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:31.603
<v Speaker 3>to be around someone like Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're naturally going to fall into a </v>

364
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 3>line of thinking where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

365
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 3>this guy's got his understanding of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>calmness man.</v>

366
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

367
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't see that guy being rattled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched the debates and he's just,</v>

368
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.120
<v Speaker 3>he's so confident in what he believes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

369
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I started things through clearly not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>silly person.</v>

370
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.510
<v Speaker 3>I think I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the problem.</v>

371
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am too.</v>

372
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a nitwit.</v>

373
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.770
<v Speaker 3>So watching him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

374
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:06.770
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

375
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.663
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's humbling to watch someone like him </v>

376
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:15.200
<v Speaker 3>that's got it together and has that </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of understanding because I spend a</v>

377
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 3>lot of my life trying to get to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of understanding.</v>

378
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.970
<v Speaker 3>So to watch someone that's there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

379
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.980
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just humbling to.</v>

380
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm just curious where he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go because him being known is relatively</v>

381
00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:34.050
<v Speaker 3>new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

382
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.130
<v Speaker 3>This isn't a guy who's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

383
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.330
<v Speaker 3>a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

384
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 3>When he said what you would call like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>public superstar intellectual,</v>

385
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 3>now that's a new thing.</v>

386
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.333
<v Speaker 3>It is really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really hasn't existed over the last </v>

387
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.230
<v Speaker 3>decade or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't been,</v>

388
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.153
<v Speaker 3>and now they're starting and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of Youtube and podcasts and </v>

389
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys are getting super popular.</v>

390
00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:54.944
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's selling out places where fucking </v>

391
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.150
<v Speaker 3>iron maiden plays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

392
00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

393
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:04.260
<v Speaker 3>And he talks about the book is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you told me that,</v>

394
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 3>that a place where maiden would sell </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

395
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:09.400
<v Speaker 3>someone will go talk to a modern day </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosopher.</v>

396
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't believe that because it's </v>

397
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 3>idiocracy now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

398
00:17:13.461 --> 00:17:15.250
<v Speaker 3>he only eats meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he eats.</v>

399
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

400
00:17:16.281 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 3>he's on this carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

401
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.710
<v Speaker 3>No vegetables at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No salt in meat and water.</v>

402
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

403
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:23.654
<v Speaker 3>he's so wacky with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me that he had like a glass of </v>

404
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:31.661
<v Speaker 3>cider and he couldn't sleep for 24 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's not okay.</v>

405
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.680
<v Speaker 3>He's eccentric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in a heavy way.</v>

406
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a heavy guy.</v>

407
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

408
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

409
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.103
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a burden being that guy as a </v>

410
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:43.334
<v Speaker 3>burden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

411
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.263
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't mean that in a negative or </v>

412
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 3>derogatory way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to be that smart.</v>

413
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:49.720
<v Speaker 3>And now don't you feel historically </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

414
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

415
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:55.430
<v Speaker 1>they're the people who are the most sad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and broken and as they know too much,</v>

416
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.430
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing worse than knowing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dumbest people I know are happy as a</v>

417
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 1>fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an input people.</v>

418
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.563
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's obviously his level of </v>

419
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:09.384
<v Speaker 1>intellect is next level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even being a bright guy or seeing </v>

420
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.663
<v Speaker 1>just being a rita or or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reading Kafka and Salinger and </v>

421
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.303
<v Speaker 1>whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just becoming aware of certain </v>

422
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:23.004
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize certain times realizations </v>

423
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:27.774
<v Speaker 1>are always the greatest things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to teach that to kids when I was </v>

424
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:33.710
<v Speaker 1>coaching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was coaching a martial artists.</v>

425
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're scared because you're smart.</v>

426
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See these people around you that aren't </v>

427
00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:39.090
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're stupid.</v>

428
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.403
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand the possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of the dangers and all the </v>

429
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:44.424
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to put that aside and just </v>

430
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.690
<v Speaker 1>constantly trade on your technique and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your task at hand.</v>

431
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.390
<v Speaker 1>But the reason why you're scared is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're smart.</v>

432
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life exists around fear.</v>

433
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not healthy.</v>

434
00:18:58.021 --> 00:19:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not healthy mentally because of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how to shake that,</v>

435
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's what kind of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

436
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.340
<v Speaker 1>my father died when I was 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have the,</v>

437
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.780
<v Speaker 1>like Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom's my best friend,</v>

438
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's 72 now.</v>

439
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.750
<v Speaker 1>So like just everyday is worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

440
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.243
<v Speaker 1>about in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even driven by anything that </v>

441
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:22.440
<v Speaker 1>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like she's sick,</v>

442
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.300
<v Speaker 1>she's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

443
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 1>She's 72.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to Jay Z and wears Jordans.</v>

444
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Does she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

445
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.393
<v Speaker 1>she's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a long of course I to get </v>

446
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:34.614
<v Speaker 1>a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

447
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.360
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

448
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's fear of not having her fear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown.</v>

449
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fear the unknown.</v>

450
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I fear what if this all ends?</v>

451
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I've lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

452
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my adult life has been what I do,</v>

453
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 1>which is music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's yours has been true.</v>

454
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.024
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how to do anything </v>

455
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.720
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to fix the fucking car.</v>

456
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

457
00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally don't have to do anything.</v>

458
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 1>But that fears for mechanics too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're like,</v>

459
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:07.110
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if there's no more cars?</v>

460
00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:09.720
<v Speaker 1>What if these electric cars come along?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to work a computer.</v>

461
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going to be computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled.</v>

462
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.593
<v Speaker 1>I mean the people's business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who can think about the poor bastard </v>

463
00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:16.080

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just spending money,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

467
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.261
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got this,</v>

468
00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:23.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new thing.</v>

469
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's called a of the apple TV.</v>

470
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.270
<v Speaker 1>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck appletv.</v>

471
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mindset going.</v>

472
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.273
<v Speaker 1>Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blockbuster is not living in a box </v>

473
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:31.660
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

474
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.220
<v Speaker 1>They'll probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

475
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>you probably sold for smart and probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the writing on the wall.</v>

476
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

477
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and people find a way to make.</v>

478
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you get through whatever made you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful rapper?</v>

479
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You could be successful at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I want that.</v>

480
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to.</v>

481
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Luckily I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be a.</v>

482
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't want either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want the.</v>

483
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 1>The fear of not being able to continue </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I continue.</v>

484
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.120
<v Speaker 1>I know again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from being a fan how you look,</v>

485
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.630
<v Speaker 1>you do what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

486
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Of course work is work and even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>we love it,</v>

487
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:10.414
<v Speaker 1>it's still working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we both had people in our lives </v>

488
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:12.994
<v Speaker 1>that don't get that.</v>

489
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.220
<v Speaker 1>They think that it's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk,</v>

490
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:16.054
<v Speaker 1>when you were in Philly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people hit you up the day of the </v>

491
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you get me to patches back?</v>

492
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 1>But like it's a fucking body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your job,</v>

493
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:23.944
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

494
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.500
<v Speaker 1>it's how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how you,</v>

495
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.443
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put food on the table and I think </v>

496
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:29.014
<v Speaker 1>there's a disconnect there with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't live in that world that they </v>

497
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 1>think everything we do is have a party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

498
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.554
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about earlier that you </v>

499
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 1>got to love it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to have the discipline</v>

500
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:44.020
<v Speaker 1>to get the work done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

501
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

502
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.383
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with people that don't </v>

503
00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 1>understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is discipline involved.</v>

504
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.103
<v Speaker 1>They think that there's not that we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky we didn't when we did and we </v>

505
00:21:58.001 --> 00:21:58.834
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

506
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.220
<v Speaker 1>We did get lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We created.</v>

507
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 1>We created our own luck though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of that for sure.</v>

508
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.910
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in America.</v>

509
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.320
<v Speaker 1>We weren't born in the shack and sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's luck,</v>

510
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also you have to put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work and you have to figure it out.</v>

511
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just open ended puzzle.</v>

512
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.520
<v Speaker 1>You make what you make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You turn it into something,</v>

513
00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:23.320
<v Speaker 1>but you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did it.</v>

514
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.213
<v Speaker 1>You started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got your shot and you took it and </v>

515
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.250
<v Speaker 1>had the balls to run with that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people fumble the ball.</v>

516
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 1>The death is a lot of fumblers out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

517
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Then I fumbled a bunch to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you just get back up.</v>

518
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I figured out why you fumbled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fumbled,</v>

519
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but I knew that I had to get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people found,</v>

520
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 1>fumbled the ball and then go into a woe </v>
<v Speaker 1>is me,</v>

521
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:43.490
<v Speaker 1>woe is me.</v>

522
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.080
<v Speaker 1>The Universe is out to get me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't catch a break.</v>

523
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.470
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't and that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say all,</v>

524
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it is self inflicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

525
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.171
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

526
00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:55.420
<v Speaker 1>instead of looking at that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they should look at it.</v>

527
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I know how not to do it.</v>

528
00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now this is going to make me better.</v>

529
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:00.663
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn from everything that </v>

530
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:03.610
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not,</v>

531
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.033
<v Speaker 1>it's your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father would say it's not a mistake </v>

532
00:23:06.881 --> 00:23:08.260
<v Speaker 1>if you learn from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

533
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:13.330
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's adapt or die.</v>

534
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blockbuster.</v>

535
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so adapt or die.</v>

536
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Everything's changing with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

537
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.420
<v Speaker 1>The podcast is bigger than shows on </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrestrial radio.</v>

538
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 1>If you told me that back when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to the Stern,</v>

539
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:26.284
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you even talking about the </v>

540
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 1>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could not.</v>

541
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.453
<v Speaker 1>What is a podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big could that be in your bigger </v>

542
00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:33.450
<v Speaker 1>than radio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What person?</v>

543
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that when I did it too,</v>

544
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:38.470
<v Speaker 1>when I first started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought it was gonna be a thing.</v>

545
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it for fun.</v>

546
00:23:40.781 --> 00:23:41.614
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would respond to someone on </v>

547
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:44.230
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just fuck it.</v>

548
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Just have some fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

549
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>

550
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you change culture.</v>

551
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 3>You've shifted culture and how people </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with this show.</v>

552
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.553
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be very proud of that man if </v>

553
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 3>you're not already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think about it.</v>

554
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I think if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll trip over your own feet.</v>

555
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.673
<v Speaker 3>I don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone could give me the best </v>

556
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 3>compliment ever and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a piece of garbage.</v>

557
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.820
<v Speaker 3>You're better off that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust Joe.</v>

558
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:09.703
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like you were saying about your </v>

559
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:14.660
<v Speaker 3>fear of it all going away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that fear is what makes you show</v>

560
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:18.140
<v Speaker 3>up at the studio 10 minutes early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fear is what makes you get out that</v>

561
00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 3>notebook and start writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

562
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.593
<v Speaker 3>That fear is what makes you sit alone </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about how you're gonna </v>

563
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.930
<v Speaker 3>structure this or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write your next this or that's,</v>

564
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.580
<v Speaker 3>that's it's all important.</v>

565
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.563
<v Speaker 3>People think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a guy like you who's a successful </v>

566
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 3>rapper or a comedian that's successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just got no worries anymore.</v>

567
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.023
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have more worries now that I've ever </v>

568
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:41.080
<v Speaker 3>had in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have way more worries.</v>

569
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.933
<v Speaker 3>The one I had nothing in my pocket and </v>
<v Speaker 3>high school and I was rapping on street </v>

570
00:24:44.391 --> 00:24:45.224
<v Speaker 3>corners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about it all the time at Howard </v>

571
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:48.763
<v Speaker 3>that and now I look at the worries I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>then and that laughable I ground right </v>

572
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.950
<v Speaker 3>crack at the shit that used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to bother me.</v>

573
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.911
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting?</v>

574
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine going back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first day,</v>

575
00:24:58.251 --> 00:25:00.920
<v Speaker 3>starting from scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing what you know now,</v>

576
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.120
<v Speaker 3>how much better you would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

577
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I can't even imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of that in the future as of now.</v>

578
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's heavy.</v>

579
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I look back on yourself,</v>

580
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a 60 year old man looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>back at yourself,</v>

581
00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vinny had the world by the balls.</v>

582
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Of course the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

583
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem with living in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

584
00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.373
<v Speaker 3>I'm always thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramifications of that moment while the </v>

585
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:29.600
<v Speaker 3>moment is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

586
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:30.890
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

587
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

588
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.160
<v Speaker 3>it's detrimental to my mental health to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that way.</v>

589
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.050
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I can't,</v>

590
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 3>I see people live in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see people that just are able to,</v>

591
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.733
<v Speaker 3>to let things wash over them and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>envious of that because everything is </v>

592
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.860
<v Speaker 3>overanalyzing and every way possible and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it eats at me,</v>

593
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:55.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

594
00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 3>but I think that that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why your lyrics are so good.</v>

595
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person has that sort of the,</v>

596
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:02.990
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

597
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.823
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the over analyzing aspect of you is </v>

598
00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:06.944
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes you go over all these details </v>

599
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:13.760
<v Speaker 3>and find better hooks and find a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to phrase things.</v>

600
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.160
<v Speaker 3>And this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be complacent.</v>

601
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:16.994
<v Speaker 3>You just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wish I could just only exist in </v>

602
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:21.350
<v Speaker 3>that place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it works,</v>

603
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody that I talked to,</v>

604
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:25.130
<v Speaker 3>the successful is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all a mess.</v>

605
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to do about that?</v>

606
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I just gotTa keep fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just got to not give a fuck and keep</v>

607
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:35.330
<v Speaker 3>pressing forward and know that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just part of who you are.</v>

608
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean if we go back historically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's alone.</v>

609
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 3>That was brilliant.</v>

<v Speaker 3>if you're going to her for,</v>

635
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.400
<v Speaker 3>for uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>if you're going to her for political </v>

637
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:40.104
<v Speaker 3>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might want to reevaluate your life </v>

638
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.820
<v Speaker 3>problems on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

641
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:50.700
<v Speaker 3>agree with exactly what you wrote.</v>

642
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 3>It's just how she got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's also why she's so funny.</v>

643
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back and watch Roseanne in the</v>

644
00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.660
<v Speaker 3>early days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that show was fucking heavy and it was a</v>

645
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:03.420
<v Speaker 3>great show and her standup before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even before,</v>

646
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:07.540
<v Speaker 3>that was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put her in the top 20 of all time.</v>

647
00:28:07.541 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 3>She was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was brilliant.</v>

648
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:12.390
<v Speaker 3>But it's also a monster man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was nobody like her before.</v>

649
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Like she was just as brash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't gather five.</v>

650
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like a man he'll like,</v>

651
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:19.970
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

652
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.530
<v Speaker 3>like a world class standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

653
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember like when that show </v>
<v Speaker 3>came on,</v>

654
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:26.514
<v Speaker 3>just seeing that house as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a house like that on </v>

655
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:31.070
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

656
00:28:31.071 --> 00:28:34.940
<v Speaker 3>Like closer to what we knew then what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had ever seen.</v>

657
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.320
<v Speaker 3>I my house didn't look like the kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>bees,</v>

658
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

659
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.760
<v Speaker 3>I was maybe archie bunker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

660
00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:41.594
<v Speaker 3>it was like a little bit closer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's when people are batshit crazy </v>

661
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.300
<v Speaker 3>and someone reacts to that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>confusion,</v>

662
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.470
<v Speaker 3>not confusion with contempt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

663
00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:53.304
<v Speaker 3>you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're batshit crazy and it's part of </v>

664
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:58.160
<v Speaker 3>why they got to where they're at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

665
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.183
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't act surprised now that someone </v>

666
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 3>said something looney yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This many years after.</v>

667
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.653
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seemed strange to me that now </v>

668
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:09.720
<v Speaker 3>you're blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's been saying bad shit.</v>

669
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:10.554
<v Speaker 3>Crazy shit for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also part of this new </v>

670
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:16.380
<v Speaker 3>culture that we have in where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

671
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.400
<v Speaker 3>they find a target and they attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

672
00:29:19.401 --> 00:29:21.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have,</v>

673
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:22.883
<v Speaker 3>if there's any sort of weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you have chickens and one </v>

674
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:29.610
<v Speaker 3>chicken gets sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what that pecking order thing is.</v>

675
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Sean chicken doesn't feel good.</v>

676
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.370
<v Speaker 3>The other chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

677
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.090
<v Speaker 3>they don't like make moral judgments on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this chicken.</v>

678
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.150
<v Speaker 3>They just find a target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So along with that chicken.</v>

679
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:40.480
<v Speaker 3>So they start fucking it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

680
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.580
<v Speaker 3>And it happens with dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

681
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an animal thing in human beings.</v>

682
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 3>We have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to be real,</v>

683
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 3>if we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to be compassionate,</v>

684
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 3>we're really going to be compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we're really gonna,</v>

685
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.970
<v Speaker 3>like try to engineer a better culture </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a better community.</v>

686
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 3>We got to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

687
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 3>We've got to just stop attacking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she didn't.</v>

688
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 3>I believe I talked to her on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just me and her.</v>

689
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.830
<v Speaker 3>She did not know that lady was black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that lady.</v>

690
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she looked Jewish.</v>

691
00:30:12.101 --> 00:30:14.160
<v Speaker 3>She looks like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just,</v>

692
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 3>when she said I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe her too.</v>

693
00:30:16.571 --> 00:30:18.130
<v Speaker 3>I think she was just cracking a joke.</v>

694
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 3>Fucked up on Ambien and drinking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking weed all night.</v>

695
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.760
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no one cares what her intent was.</v>

696
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.650
<v Speaker 3>All they care is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a green light.</v>

697
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.530
<v Speaker 3>That's a target we're going to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

698
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:34.040
<v Speaker 3>here's my issue with the modern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The modern left is,</v>

699
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.520
<v Speaker 3>is they taught compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they pounce.</v>

700
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:39.863
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a man with no country now </v>

701
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.700
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't,</v>

702
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.713
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The modern left isn't something that I </v>

703
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:47.314
<v Speaker 3>gravitate towards and neither is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right and when I was growing up and </v>

704
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:53.130
<v Speaker 3>listening to public enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

705
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:58.150
<v Speaker 3>at the end that left of it changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changed and I didn't.</v>

706
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

707
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.680
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you and you have these people.</v>

708
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where I stand anymore,</v>

709
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:10.804
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's this rational left </v>

710
00:31:13.511 --> 00:31:14.344
<v Speaker 3>leaning people that are against </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination and for welfare and for </v>

711
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:19.721
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>

712
00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 3>I was on welfare when I was a kid.</v>

713
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 3>If people say I shouldn't be on welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what the fuck?</v>

714
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents were on welfare.</v>

715
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.833
<v Speaker 3>All came from a poor family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had food stamps and eventually </v>

716
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:32.980
<v Speaker 3>they did better and we got off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you want to tell me that,</v>

717
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:35.210
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fed me absolute.</v>

718
00:31:35.211 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 3>So how could I ever go against that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a part of my childhood.</v>

719
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:43.840
<v Speaker 3>I think all these things that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to associate with being,</v>

720
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with left or right.</v>

721
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I think there's just a gigantic problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with pink people being tribal.</v>

722
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tribalism at its,</v>

723
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:57.310
<v Speaker 3>at its highest degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in since I've been alive,</v>

724
00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.233
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never seen it like this before and I </v>

725
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:01.570
<v Speaker 3>think we know why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

726
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Well it's facilitated not just by trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

727
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's also by the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate instantaneously.</v>

728
00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without any consideration,</v>

729
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.893
<v Speaker 3>you can just tweet something or make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube video about something </v>

730
00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:13.180
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

731
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne's ability to tweet that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

732
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:21.030
<v Speaker 3>That quickly with the phone is why </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sankar show cost millions of dollars.</v>

733
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.720
<v Speaker 3>People lost their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ABC Junk,</v>

734
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's either going to do the connors,</v>

735
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.580
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That show's gonna fucking sink.</v>

736
00:32:27.581 --> 00:32:28.414
<v Speaker 3>Like the titanic course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's combined Roseanna Roseanne with </v>

737
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

738
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Three episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like flavor free diet coke,</v>

739
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 3>tastes like water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just</v>

740
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
<v Speaker 1>have water motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's diet coke,</v>

741
00:32:45.301 --> 00:32:49.610
<v Speaker 1>but without the flavor what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true and I don't.</v>

742
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.093
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

743
00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:56.220
<v Speaker 1>it's the hypersensitivity and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability for anyone right or wrong to</v>

744
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 1>be able to say something right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then where you would have,</v>

745
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:00.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

746
00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing fear factor in rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone interviewed you,</v>

747
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a thought process there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's editing and you're sitting there</v>

748
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 1>and you're talking with a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that's gone,</v>

749
00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:13.244
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it that that's what it's come </v>

750
00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 1>down to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

751
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.283
<v Speaker 1>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

752
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.183
<v Speaker 1>all three of us had phones in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets and can see something crazy </v>

753
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:23.430
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we stubbed our toe right,</v>

754
00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.310
<v Speaker 1>studied y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

755
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.000
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah,</v>

756
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.630
<v Speaker 1>and all the sudden you had done your son</v>
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

757
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.573
<v Speaker 2>good in that because the tyranny of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these gigantic organizations like if </v>

758
00:33:31.581 --> 00:33:34.560
<v Speaker 2>they were tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they did have an agenda,</v>

759
00:33:34.561 --> 00:33:36.470
<v Speaker 2>if you we're trying to smear you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are fucked.</v>

760
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:39.140
<v Speaker 2>You had no recourse and they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too many people.</v>

761
00:33:39.141 --> 00:33:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's unscrupulous </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>

762
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 2>but also journalistic integrity takes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>backseat to.</v>

763
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Because now they have to get clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these people are real.</v>

764
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Journalists are fighting for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

765
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because these publications going under</v>

766
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.190
<v Speaker 1>real journalism is almost dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not totally dead,</v>

767
00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:58.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hurt.</v>

768
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.310
<v Speaker 1>But like I was of Emphysema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Alex Jones thing,</v>

769
00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:03.144
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether I agree with shit he says are </v>

770
00:34:04.081 --> 00:34:09.081
<v Speaker 1>not corporations shut him down and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that's scary that the corporations</v>

771
00:34:11.641 --> 00:34:16.641
<v Speaker 1>can decide what we are able to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

772
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.913
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having a good conversation about </v>

773
00:34:18.671 --> 00:34:19.504
<v Speaker 2>this last night with some friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about whether or not </v>

774
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.103
<v Speaker 2>things like youtube or twitter or </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram should be regulated like </v>

775
00:34:26.201 --> 00:34:29.420
<v Speaker 2>utilities where anybody can use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

776
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.690
<v Speaker 2>like you have the right to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

777
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a house,</v>

778
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.190
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the right to pay your money,</v>

779
00:34:36.191 --> 00:34:38.350
<v Speaker 2>you get your power turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a utility.</v>

780
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a channel like that,</v>

781
00:34:41.231 --> 00:34:43.930
<v Speaker 2>whether it's youtube or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

782
00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe a channel should be treated like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>utility,</v>

783
00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.183
<v Speaker 2>but then the question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it exactly that is good enough </v>

784
00:34:52.181 --> 00:34:55.420
<v Speaker 2>to get you kicked off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've seen some horrible shit.</v>

785
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I want people to read or written rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter that.</v>

786
00:34:58.841 --> 00:34:59.674
<v Speaker 2>And they're still on.</v>

787
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I've seen shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

788
00:35:02.061 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 1>He's being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

789
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:08.790
<v Speaker 1>You know why he was brought down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people say much worse</v>

790
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.203
<v Speaker 2>was the sandy hook and it was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sandy hook thing was he said that he </v>

791
00:35:15.561 --> 00:35:18.320
<v Speaker 2>thought that it was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sends disavowed that,</v>

792
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.330
<v Speaker 2>but they don't care if you disavow </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

793
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 2>They have this thing on you now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that the kids didn't die.</v>

794
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 2>They definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get rid of you.</v>

795
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.200
<v Speaker 2>But are you saying that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to make mistakes?</v>

796
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to evolve their thinking?</v>

797
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:33.944
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to say things that are wrong </v>

798
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people say things in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

799
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.410
<v Speaker 2>but is it only things that are wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>about children?</v>

800
00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:41.244
<v Speaker 2>Like where is the line where lines are </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore and I don't know who's the one </v>

801
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 2>drawing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

802
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:51.411
<v Speaker 2>it's these people that either are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceos or the stockholders or the CFO's,</v>

803
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.003
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is that that is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting that's dictating these </v>

804
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:56.694
<v Speaker 2>standards.</v>

805
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.593
<v Speaker 2>They're deciding these are gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations that we were just talking </v>

806
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:01.344
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they ever anticipated </v>

807
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:04.464
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when they made twitter they </v>

808
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:06.630
<v Speaker 2>thought it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Jamie was saying,</v>

809
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 2>it was a fun way to like tell your </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

810
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.780
<v Speaker 2>you know Vinny Paz and Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go into the movies.</v>

811
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you would do.</v>

812
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.690
<v Speaker 2>Twitter was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

815
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:18.683
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't anything crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people started using as a </v>

816
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:21.744
<v Speaker 2>platform for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know why Sam Harris has been tweeting </v>

817

<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

821
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.730
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

822
00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Jack just won't respond to him anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>exclamation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All caps.</v>

834

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like my.</v>

835
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.313
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we get through this without getting </v>

836
00:37:15.011 --> 00:37:15.844
<v Speaker 1>blown up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to look back and laugh at </v>

837
00:37:16.991 --> 00:37:18.550
<v Speaker 1>the trump days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be fun.</v>

838
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.583
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long we're end to his </v>

839
00:37:21.131 --> 00:37:21.964
<v Speaker 1>presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I walked by the TV and hear </v>

840
00:37:23.681 --> 00:37:26.530
<v Speaker 1>someone say president trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have a little,</v>

841
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be,</v>

842
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it might not be a belly laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still crack up.</v>

843
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Well it's been two years because my lap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I know.</v>

844
00:37:36.631 --> 00:37:37.464
<v Speaker 2>I know by Netflix specials because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>last netflix special was exactly two </v>

845
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:43.740
<v Speaker 2>years ago and during that special I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

846
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:46.860
<v Speaker 2>we are that close to president trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people are laughing like,</v>

847
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.670
<v Speaker 2>ha ha.</v>

848
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I was laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

849
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I went to bed or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

850
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that there was zero chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

851
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.483
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't think Hillary was a great </v>

852
00:37:56.451 --> 00:37:57.284
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought of fucking cardboard box </v>

853
00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:01.940
<v Speaker 1>would beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

854
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought people would.</v>

855
00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I think of him as more of a liability </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything.</v>

856
00:38:05.021 --> 00:38:08.170
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Middle America just don't feel</v>

857
00:38:08.171 --> 00:38:09.004
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel disrespected and not </v>

858
00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:13.980
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he figured that out and tapped into.</v>

859
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.963
<v Speaker 1>I did well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw Jordan Peterson say something in </v>

860
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:21.900
<v Speaker 1>this interview and it made me think </v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously with joking right now,</v>

861
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:26.270
<v Speaker 1>and the joke about him and south dummy </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't Jordan Peterson said the bit,</v>

862
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.203
<v Speaker 1>the reason he's in and the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake Americans have made is </v>

863
00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:32.800
<v Speaker 1>underestimating him and thinking he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb.</v>

864
00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

865
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just does dumb shit.</v>

866
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's definitely an EGOMANIAC.</v>

867
00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.093
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he has narcissistic personality </v>

868
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:43.960
<v Speaker 1>disorder and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you're stupid.</v>

869
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

870
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.800
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

871
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.860
<v Speaker 1>He took advantage of exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>

872
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a big portion of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been there.</v>

873
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's where you're an east coast guy.</v>

874
00:38:58.171 --> 00:39:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm an east coast guy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're both on the west coast.</v>

875
00:39:00.991 --> 00:39:02.910
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of what we do,</v>

876
00:39:02.911 --> 00:39:03.744
<v Speaker 1>these are the worlds we know and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're surrounded by and that my father </v>

877
00:39:07.681 --> 00:39:09.480
<v Speaker 1>used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't live near a coast,</v>

878
00:39:09.481 --> 00:39:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you're a retard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't have to come in the more than half</v>

879
00:39:14.221 --> 00:39:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the country hates me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that,</v>

880
00:39:15.481 --> 00:39:16.770
<v Speaker 1>but my father said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

881
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:22.370
<v Speaker 1>and when you go through the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country on tour and you meet people,</v>

882
00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

883
00:39:24.321 --> 00:39:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I've never met anyone like this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In a good way or bad way.</v>

884
00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.693
<v Speaker 1>You're not around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around them and they probably feel like </v>

885
00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.880
<v Speaker 1>no one has ever spoken for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

886
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if a dimwit does,</v>

887
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.190
<v Speaker 1>that's better than no one's speaking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

888
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.043
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's better than someone just calling </v>

889
00:39:42.931 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 1>them fly overstays disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

890
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:46.350
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

891
00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:47.640
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I was younger,</v>

892
00:39:47.641 --> 00:39:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I did it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked that way.</v>

893
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.353
<v Speaker 1>I went towards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get booked or I don't want to go </v>

894
00:39:52.291 --> 00:39:53.830
<v Speaker 1>there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just use it.</v>

895
00:39:53.831 --> 00:39:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

896
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it's ego of being where you're from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the east coat.</v>

897
00:39:57.961 --> 00:39:58.794
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously everyone on the east coast is </v>

898
00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:03.570
<v Speaker 1>very proud of that fact that everyone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West is very proud of that fact.</v>

899
00:40:03.571 --> 00:40:04.404
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

900
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

901
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about Arkansas,</v>

902
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just not able to.</v>

903
00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.410
<v Speaker 1>It's because they just don't know anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>there all,</v>

904
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.660
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking Italians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

905
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a while my family from Italy,</v>

906

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like it's just not able to.</v>

907
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:20.723
<v Speaker 1>And it's being an ignorant American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time like that until I </v>

908
00:40:25.321 --> 00:40:27.150
<v Speaker 1>saw the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the country,</v>

909
00:40:27.151 --> 00:40:31.200
<v Speaker 1>the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being on different continents.</v>

910
00:40:31.201 --> 00:40:33.000
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes your thinking man.</v>

911
00:40:33.001 --> 00:40:33.834

<v Speaker 1>a crazy night out.</v>

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Why is that not happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could be the reason autism,</v>

929
00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.820
<v Speaker 1>autism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autism,</v>

930
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.340
<v Speaker 1>autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Autism.</v>

931
00:41:31.341 --> 00:41:32.081
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

932
00:41:32.081 --> 00:41:32.980
<v Speaker 1>the disease?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

933
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said an artist</v>

934
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:35.180
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

935
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.320
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

936
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:37.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either.</v>

937
00:41:37.201 --> 00:41:39.730
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to let you.</v>

938
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:40.900
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at me like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think.</v>

939
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.650
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was trying to figure out if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you met artisan handcraft.</v>

940
00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:45.411
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

941
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Autism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Autism.</v>

942
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that accent pro.</v>

943
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

944
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.490
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>

945
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.570
<v Speaker 3>it's more common I think now than ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

946
00:41:56.571 --> 00:41:57.404
<v Speaker 3>But the question is whether it's more </v>
<v Speaker 3>common because it's more diagnosed or </v>

947
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:03.380
<v Speaker 3>whether it's more common because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>more incidents of it.</v>

948
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of questions as to why one</v>

949
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:09.350
<v Speaker 3>of the big ones is apparently older </v>
<v Speaker 3>people having kids,</v>

950
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:13.220
<v Speaker 3>people waiting and putting off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>children and particularly men.</v>

951
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Apparently there's a big risk for older </v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

952
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 3>older men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times have autistic kids.</v>

953
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 3>I have more than a couple of friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>with autistic children.</v>

954
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:22.343
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

955
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.193
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

956
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I just it like.</v>

957
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:26.923
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when we were younger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think like the first time I even </v>

958
00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 3>was aware it was probably the movie rain</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

959
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My being funny about two percent.</v>

960
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.873
<v Speaker 3>First Time I was aware they didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wasn't diagnosed or something about </v>

961
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:38.984
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they made it up for the </v>

962
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:40.960
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the disease came along.</v>

963
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.023
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

964
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

965
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.360
<v Speaker 3>but what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to Kevin is a chemical.</v>

966
00:42:47.361 --> 00:42:48.194
<v Speaker 3>Is it people that were on drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it things or did it just wasn't </v>

967
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.810
<v Speaker 3>undiagnosed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a bunch of factors.</v>

968
00:42:56.811 --> 00:42:57.644
<v Speaker 3>I think undiagnosed is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think also the ability to exchange </v>

969
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:01.214
<v Speaker 3>information now allows you to be aware </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it much quicker because of the </v>

970
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:04.784
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people text and tweet and do </v>

971
00:43:06.681 --> 00:43:10.310
<v Speaker 3>these things on phones now you hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations about autism and all these</v>

972
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 3>different things that you don't hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>about before.</v>

973
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.570
<v Speaker 3>And then I think it's entirely possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

974
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.493
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all there's definitely more </v>

975
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:16.904
<v Speaker 3>people show than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because of more people are going to </v>

976
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:21.200
<v Speaker 3>have more incidences of all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases,</v>

977
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:23.510
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is that the question is,</v>

978
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.960
<v Speaker 3>is it more per capita or is it more </v>
<v Speaker 3>period?</v>

979
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Because there's more people now I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know the answer.</v>

980
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:30.703
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you said about more knowledge and </v>

981
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:33.260
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to be shit.</v>

982
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I have a dissociative disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called depersonalization disorder.</v>

983
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.873
<v Speaker 3>What does that do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically I'll be sitting here </v>

984
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:43.530
<v Speaker 3>talking to you and I'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My body,</v>

985
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 3>my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind,</v>

986
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:46.940
<v Speaker 3>body and soul will remove itself from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

987
00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm floating down over my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

988
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I look at my hands and they won't feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like mine.</v>

989
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Do you smoke weed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

990
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll,</v>

991
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.283
<v Speaker 3>it'll trigger it.</v>

992
00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

993
00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now if we got high,</v>

994
00:43:59.090 --> 00:43:59.923

<v Speaker 3>I would fucking take that deer head and </v>

996
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:09.644
<v Speaker 3>envious.</v>

997
00:44:12.471 --> 00:44:14.940
<v Speaker 3>many people and that it can help me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It makes me be I smoked when I was young</v>

<v Speaker 3>a dpd and people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1001
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:28.070
<v Speaker 3>it could be a traumatic event,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gun To my head,</v>

1003
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 3>I would say it was my father dying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it</v>

1004
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.813
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen right away because he died</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 10 and it started when I was </v>

1005
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 1>14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smoked a blunt and dust.</v>

00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:46.221
<v Speaker 1>And for about 18 months I know lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was in purgatory.</v>

1008
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>

1009
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 1>14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1010
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not in heaven.</v>

1011
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Whatever those might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1012

<v Speaker 1>Yo Man,</v>

1013
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.333
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is back then there is no twitter </v>

1014
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:01.833
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't even know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a doctor and told him what </v>

1015
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:06.210
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't do that again.</v>

1019
00:45:09.751 --> 00:45:12.320
<v Speaker 1>And they never left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I get these episodes out.</v>

1020
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.660

<v Speaker 1>Czech Republic,</v>

1021
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.030
<v Speaker 1>washing my hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closing my eyes,</v>

1022
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:19.590
<v Speaker 1>and I opened them and not know where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

1023
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:24.290
<v Speaker 1>No clue where I'm at and I feel like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>floating outside of my body,</v>

1024
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you would hear the stories of </v>

1025
00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 1>people dying in an outer body </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

1026
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 1>that's literally my disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't thought about experience once I</v>

1027
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 1>took Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1028
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:35.163
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was over here like floating above my </v>

1029
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.670
<v Speaker 1>pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you scared about myself now?</v>

1030

<v Speaker 1>I was tripping balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1031
00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1032
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm doing the Fred Sanford,</v>

1033
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming to see,</v>

1034
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:48.120
<v Speaker 1>hear those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1035
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:50.850
<v Speaker 1>those drug stories where a guy gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up for like a year.</v>

1036
00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Those securities shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened.</v>

1037
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.813
<v Speaker 1>Mark man was telling us about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he did coke with Sam Kennison for </v>

1038
00:45:56.881 --> 00:45:57.714
<v Speaker 1>like a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't sleep and he was fucked up for </v>

1039
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:01.280
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole year.</v>

1040
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.440
<v Speaker 1>He heard voices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would trade being fucked up for a year</v>

1041
00:46:04.441 --> 00:46:05.650
<v Speaker 1>to do coke with Sam kinison.</v>

1042
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was like it was like 18 months</v>

1043
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 1>in my life and like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they don't believe in it.</v>

1061
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.380
<v Speaker 1>If I broke my leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that woman would do everything for me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the immigrant mentality,</v>

1081
00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but it helps you in other places because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1082
00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:59.200
<v Speaker 1>when you have relatives that didn't have</v>

<v Speaker 1>I hope it went well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1159
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that goes a long way bro,</v>

1160
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1161
00:51:05.511 --> 00:51:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get into like a Karma </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>

1162
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but I think whether it's a comic or wrap</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a metal band,</v>

1163
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.060
<v Speaker 1>if you treat people like shit for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1164
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:15.190
<v Speaker 1>that gets around Bro.</v>

1165
00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:20.660
<v Speaker 1>CORECON comic promoters know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music promoters know each other.</v>

1166
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 1>They'll fucking call and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1167
00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:24.800
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a fucking dick face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get those stories.</v>

1168
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:25.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was talking to a promoter the </v>

1169
00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.310
<v Speaker 1>other day and he was telling me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy who was an asshole.</v>

1170
00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:30.183
<v Speaker 1>It's like yelling at the sound guy at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sound check and yelling at the </v>

1171
00:51:33.471 --> 00:51:34.304
<v Speaker 1>promoter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made them fly to New York to for some </v>

1172
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:37.274
<v Speaker 1>thing because the sound wasn't right or </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't happy with something and you </v>

1173
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:42.290
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to accommodate this guy,</v>

1174
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.133
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're shaking their head and then </v>

1175
00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:46.280
<v Speaker 1>every chance they get they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell everybody else.</v>

1176
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course when Madonna he is and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1177
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and if he's popular right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he starts to wane,</v>

1178
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:55.790
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers will remember that </v>
<v Speaker 1>now when dudes like me and you,</v>

1179
00:51:55.850 --> 00:52:00.830
<v Speaker 1>if we start to wane will still get love </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the way we treated people and</v>

1180
00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:01.850
<v Speaker 1>that's reciprocated.</v>

1181
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Like Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he did 5,000</v>

1182
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:06.344
<v Speaker 1>people last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time it was just talking 20 years </v>

1183
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:10.940
<v Speaker 1>down the line or something and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>only do half.</v>

1184
00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:13.670
<v Speaker 1>That's still going to have you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way you behave,</v>

1185
00:52:13.671 --> 00:52:14.990
<v Speaker 1>the way you were raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1186
00:52:14.991 --> 00:52:18.410
<v Speaker 1>it's also you got an opportunity when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with people,</v>

1187
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:21.260
<v Speaker 1>like if you're working with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are doing something together,</v>

1188
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you've got an opportunity to just put </v>
<v Speaker 1>smiles on faces and they.</v>

1189
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.710
<v Speaker 1>They put smiles on other people's faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

1190
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:28.544
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got a nice trickle down </v>

1191
00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:32.700
<v Speaker 1>effect once community what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1192
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.793
<v Speaker 1>It takes more energy to be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does for me because I can be an </v>

1193
00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 1>asshole and when I am I feel drained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It drains the shit out of me.</v>

1194
00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a Tampon,</v>

1195
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:47.270
<v Speaker 1>but wop temper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try to curb it and I realized when</v>

1196
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I treat people the way that they deserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be treated,</v>

1197
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.880
<v Speaker 1>everything changes.</v>

1198
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:56.060
<v Speaker 1>The energy in the room changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might bring you.</v>

1199
00:52:56.061 --> 00:52:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you drink or smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you perform both.</v>

1200
00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.913
<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1201
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.823
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if on your rider is two bottles of grey </v>

1202
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:04.550
<v Speaker 1>goose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might look over.</v>

1203
00:53:04.551 --> 00:53:06.980
<v Speaker 1>There might be four just because you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sweetheart.</v>

1204
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Not because you asked for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

1205
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:10.483
<v Speaker 1>it's just little shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even saying it's a big deal and </v>

1206
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.013
<v Speaker 1>it's life changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just little shit that people </v>

1209
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:20.383
<v Speaker 1>it makes their day just by us being </v>
<v Speaker 1>polite instead of the guy that they had </v>

1210
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 1>the last night there was a ball breaker </v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying the sound man.</v>

1211

<v Speaker 1>is that mother fucker will get you that.</v>

1213

<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker's got a ponytail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucking listening.</v>

1214

<v Speaker 1>He smokes weed to the allman brothers.</v>

1215
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.560
<v Speaker 1>He's been around the block and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't realize that shit.</v>

1216
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker is 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucking listen to the MC five.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You and I probably worship.</v>

1218
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.880
<v Speaker 1>He is not impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably pressed by you.</v>

1219
00:53:54.881 --> 00:53:57.750
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not impressed by me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rapper from philly.</v>

1220
00:53:57.751 --> 00:53:58.584
<v Speaker 1>He don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be doing mike sound </v>

1221
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:00.913
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the last thing I need to do is be </v>

1222
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:03.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo Schmo Hawk,</v>

1223
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.400
<v Speaker 1>turn this shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1224
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:10.450
<v Speaker 1>it's mentality with a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopt that when they become successful,</v>

1225
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.390
<v Speaker 1>they want to be a prick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>

1226
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:16.283
<v Speaker 1>they want to let everybody know they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be that guy who yells and rex </v>

1227
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:21.500
<v Speaker 1>hotel rooms and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>

1228
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1229
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.860
<v Speaker 1>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

1230
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.073
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that due to weakness and </v>

1231
00:54:29.611 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just they waited for so long to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>

1232
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Now they finally make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want everybody to suck their Dick.</v>

1233
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.330
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that things like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be controlled by upbringing?</v>

1234
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be,</v>

1235
00:54:40.561 --> 00:54:41.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1236
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1237
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 1>so I'm ready to smash something in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel.</v>

1238
00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:45.444
<v Speaker 1>I hear my mom to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To those that made is going to have to </v>

1239
00:54:50.521 --> 00:54:51.990
<v Speaker 1>spend all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1240
00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.113
<v Speaker 1>She tells me when I'm cranky about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and I'm leaving for tour and </v>

1241
00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 1>there's no sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you talked to everyone of those kids.</v>

1242
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 1>You sign every autograph and you take </v>
<v Speaker 1>every picture.</v>

1243
00:55:01.981 --> 00:55:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going upside your head with a wooden</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoon.</v>

1244
00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.473
<v Speaker 1>Spoon still has the crack from my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>from back then and it's still the one </v>

1245
00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 1>she starts the gravy with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so cracked.</v>

1246
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:12.600
<v Speaker 1>But she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

1247
00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:13.434
<v Speaker 1>you are here for a reason and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people look up to you and these people </v>

1248
00:55:16.531 --> 00:55:21.531
<v Speaker 1>respect you and you do your best to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just continue that,</v>

1249
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:26.063
<v Speaker 1>but to have them think you're a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>person than they already do because </v>

1250
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:32.130
<v Speaker 1>that's going to trickle down and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll treat people better.</v>

1251
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:34.920
<v Speaker 1>You said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this,</v>

1252
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.780
<v Speaker 1>all this energy travels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1254
00:55:37.951 --> 00:55:38.784
<v Speaker 1>if someone was in here right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for all three of us will get </v>

1255
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:43.200
<v Speaker 1>miserable real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone was in here,</v>

1256
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:45.180
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's out to get me.</v>

1257
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.820
<v Speaker 1>You know everyone that's in the s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's fault,</v>

1258
00:55:47.821 --> 00:55:50.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except that type of motherfucker.</v>

1259
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.520
<v Speaker 1>It's never there for every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision they made a self inflicted,</v>

1260
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 1>but they can't self examine and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's me.</v>

1261
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.440
<v Speaker 1>How about just give me a maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

1262
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Some of these people I know that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even in their head.</v>

1263
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:06.510
<v Speaker 1>It's all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you,</v>

1264
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.310
<v Speaker 1>it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't give him a break.</v>

1265
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:10.530
<v Speaker 1>You didn't let them on this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker.</v>

1266
00:56:10.531 --> 00:56:11.364
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your energy is also our </v>

1267
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:16.230
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to castle's people aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreed.</v>

1268
00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.810
<v Speaker 1>There's a lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreed and that's what tribes would do,</v>

1269
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 1>but when you're talking about a lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're too deep into it,</v>

1270
00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>you're not learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you hit a certain</v>

1271
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 3>age and you're still like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're done.</v>

1272
00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think you're done.</v>

1273
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 3>I know that's a negative way and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about not being negative,</v>

1274
00:56:30.761 --> 00:56:31.594
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes just reality's reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>being pragmatic and you want to talk </v>

1275
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.970
<v Speaker 3>about like good use of your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:41.430
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to fix a 45 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy complains every day and that's about</v>

1277
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 3>a 25 year old kid might be going through</v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit.</v>

1278
00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.920
<v Speaker 3>It could be a breakup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a loss of a parent,</v>

1279
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:47.763
<v Speaker 3>that pattern that they're in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern and you have to break patterns </v>

1280
00:56:50.921 --> 00:56:54.200
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't break them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up being that 45 year old.</v>

1281
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I was a shitty friend to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1282
00:56:56.591 --> 00:56:57.424
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been loved and like in my </v>

1283
00:56:59.021 --> 00:57:00.910
<v Speaker 3>twenties and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just selfish,</v>

1284
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.133
<v Speaker 3>like nothing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never did anything like horrible to </v>

1285
00:57:03.701 --> 00:57:04.534
<v Speaker 3>someone but just I thought about myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>first and I was probably like not maybe </v>

1286
00:57:08.861 --> 00:57:09.694
<v Speaker 3>the best friend is some of these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're still in my life and I had </v>

1287
00:57:13.751 --> 00:57:16.240
<v Speaker 3>to make a conscious effort to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1288
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 3>to evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to evolve and break patterns,</v>

1289
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:20.200
<v Speaker 3>man and breaking patterns.</v>

1290
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.210
<v Speaker 3>It's hard as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard as fuck.</v>

1291
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 3>But that's part of growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1292
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:25.324
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons why it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>important to be around people that are </v>

1293
00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:30.250
<v Speaker 3>also doing the same kind of thing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feed off of.</v>

1294
00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1295
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.430
<v Speaker 3>And when you're around people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just real negative,</v>

1296
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:36.550
<v Speaker 3>that feeds off of it to be negative as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1297
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1298
00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:37.883
<v Speaker 3>and you don't feel the need to break </v>
<v Speaker 3>that cycle because you're around </v>

1299
00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:43.120
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers that are thinking like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>

1300
00:57:43.121 --> 00:57:46.020
<v Speaker 3>So it becomes this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this pity party where you're all,</v>

1301
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 3>it's a circle jerk of misery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1302
00:57:49.031 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the circle jerk of misery.</v>

1303
00:57:51.341 --> 00:57:53.420
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never ending there.</v>

1304
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.393
<v Speaker 3>So anything that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that really expands </v>

1305
00:57:55.901 --> 00:57:56.734
<v Speaker 3>your understanding of people and life is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just being in a bunch of different </v>

1306
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:02.680
<v Speaker 3>places and understanding that where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up,</v>

1307
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:04.600
<v Speaker 3>it's just one part of the world.</v>

1308
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world is this massive play.</v>

1309
00:58:06.821 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 3>Like I just got back from Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Thailand the summer.</v>

1310
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 3>I'd never been around so many friendly </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1311
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:13.863
<v Speaker 3>Friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice smiling people that I think they </v>

1312
00:58:15.641 --> 00:58:18.750
<v Speaker 3>call it the land of the smile or land of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand smiles or some shit.</v>

1313
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:19.743
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what it's like when you're </v>

1314
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:21.664
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are just so friendly and I was </v>

1315
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:23.711
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1316
00:58:23.711 --> 00:58:25.240
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you grew up here,</v>

1317
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:30.130
<v Speaker 3>something about whatever momentum these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have developed in their culture.</v>

1318
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 3>Their culture is like smiling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly to each other.</v>

1319
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.390
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just the,</v>

1320
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 3>the vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they do it,</v>

1321
00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:40.150
<v Speaker 3>but if you around some real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grow super shitty,</v>

1322
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 3>insulting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive culture,</v>

1323
00:58:42.551 --> 00:58:45.070
<v Speaker 3>then that would be what you had to adapt</v>
<v Speaker 3>to grow.</v>

1324
00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Philly was voted the most hostile city </v>
<v Speaker 3>in America by Time magazine.</v>

1325
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's up there.</v>

1326
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:54.990
<v Speaker 3>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always though recently what I said,</v>

1327
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:56.283
<v Speaker 3>this is how I described it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said the very smart people who will </v>

1328
00:59:00.521 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 3>punch you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1329
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a good description of Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a very smart,</v>

1330
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 3>very smart media of average intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will punch you.</v>

1331
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.060
<v Speaker 3>But it's Philly's a sophisticated city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real city,</v>

1332
00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:15.980
<v Speaker 3>but they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hard people owns man.</v>

1333
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 3>They're hard people that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>cheered.</v>

<v Speaker 3>cutting some of these people off the you</v>

1359

<v Speaker 3>loyalty's a big thing too when you're </v>

1362
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Then you got to tell them again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they don't listen.</v>

1363
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Then you got to cut them off and he </v>

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:25.400
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you that's what's happening now.</v>

1365
01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:27.200
<v Speaker 3>But I still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it eats at me.</v>

1366
01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I should be like a savior complex.</v>

1367
01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1368
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I know that I don't want anyone to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up man.</v>

1369
01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:41.090
<v Speaker 3>And I have a hard time being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

1370
01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:43.640
<v Speaker 3>this person is detrimental.</v>

1372
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.300
<v Speaker 3>in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it's time to cut them off,</v>

<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want me to do it for you?</v>

1384
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:09.743
<v Speaker 3>At least make an attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just ask everybody to carry </v>

1385
01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 3>your bags like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

1386
01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 3>They want you to carry their emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>bags all the time.</v>

1387
01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:17.990
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1388
01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:19.670
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's no,</v>

1389
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.340
<v Speaker 3>there's no introspection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no,</v>

1390
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.240
<v Speaker 3>well maybe this many years and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this should happen to me.</v>

1391
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's me and I'm a dead when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't see that.</v>

1392
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.150
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

1393
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I call them people lost causes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems very dark and grim,</v>

1394
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:38.120
<v Speaker 3>but I think they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1395
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:38.954
<v Speaker 3>I think you probably have this attitude </v>
<v Speaker 3>because your dad died when you were </v>

1396
01:01:41.151 --> 01:01:42.770
<v Speaker 3>young and you were left alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1397
01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:43.623
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have a lot of that because my </v>

1398
01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:45.284
<v Speaker 3>father and my mother split up and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>real young and I haven't seen my dad </v>

1399
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:49.574
<v Speaker 3>since I was seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's sort of thing you'd be feeling </v>

1400
01:01:51.731 --> 01:01:54.410
<v Speaker 3>abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to leave anybody behind.</v>

1401
01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:55.244
<v Speaker 3>So I always rescued stray dogs and feral</v>
<v Speaker 3>cats and took his crazy friends and </v>

1402
01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1403
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:01.423
<v Speaker 3>My whole life has been like that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>making in the misfits and your father </v>

1404
01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:07.070
<v Speaker 3>made that decision and that weighs on </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1405
01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:09.660
<v Speaker 3>And my father made the decision to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had three.</v>

1406
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 3>He had bypass surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They told them to stop smoking,</v>

1407
01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.920
<v Speaker 3>stop doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop doing that.</v>

1408
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.000
<v Speaker 3>He had my older brother cigarettes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hospital.</v>

1409
01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:24.560
<v Speaker 3>He drug the ivy down to the bathroom and</v>
<v Speaker 3>was smoking out of the window.</v>

1410
01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a young son and made a choice not</v>

1411
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:28.764
<v Speaker 3>to live for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My other brothers are 11 and 12 years </v>

1412
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 3>older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they got them for 21 and 22.</v>

1413
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.051
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it bro.</v>

1414
01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember his voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1415
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:40.530
<v Speaker 3>And that shit was heavy because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1416
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:42.870
<v Speaker 3>did he not love me enough to live for </v>
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>

1417
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:44.063
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those things manifest themselves in </v>

1418
01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:46.350
<v Speaker 3>different ways.</v>

1419
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.300
<v Speaker 3>As you get older you don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1420
01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:49.183
<v Speaker 3>You know what's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a gift in some ways and the gift </v>

1421
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:54.570
<v Speaker 3>and the curse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gift is that you,</v>

1422
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:55.643
<v Speaker 3>you have this energy that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this lack of this lack of something in </v>

1423
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:00.750
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're young.</v>

1424
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1425
01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:02.664
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something I struggled with with </v>

1426
01:03:03.721 --> 01:03:05.550
<v Speaker 3>my kids because I try to keep my kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1427
01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Always give them love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always your hug,</v>

1428
01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:08.934
<v Speaker 3>kiss all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure they know we were talking </v>

1429
01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:13.080
<v Speaker 3>about this answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All my friends that are interesting came</v>

1430
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:13.914
<v Speaker 3>from fucked up childhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All my favorite friends are my favorite </v>

1431
01:03:17.191 --> 01:03:18.024
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their life was chaos when they were </v>

1432
01:03:18.811 --> 01:03:21.540
<v Speaker 3>growing up and they became these really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting people.</v>

1433
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that.</v>

1434
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:27.390
<v Speaker 3>That's what created us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you couldn't be more right.</v>

1435
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.253
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about your favorite </v>

<v Speaker 3>metal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

1442
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.613
<v Speaker 3>all of them were fucked in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know any well balanced people </v>

1443
01:03:39.811 --> 01:03:41.250
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I feel like,</v>

1444
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.810
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's a brilliant mind.</v>

1445
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.840
<v Speaker 3>He came from a two parent home in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>suburbs of Connecticut.</v>

1446
01:03:45.841 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anyone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pressure creates diamonds.</v>

1447
01:03:48.301 --> 01:03:49.134
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1448
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Bust pipes too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

1449
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:51.683
<v Speaker 3>Bus.</v>

1450
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1451
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:55.610
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1452
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.520
<v Speaker 3>I wonder like how much of that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>haunts me and create,</v>

1453
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:00.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1454
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:03.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your parents splitting and being seven,</v>

1455
01:04:03.281 --> 01:04:04.114
<v Speaker 3>like how many of the fucked up things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that go on in your head now relate back </v>

1456
01:04:07.591 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 3>to that and you're not even aware </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the mind is so complicated.</v>

1457
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1458
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:14.190
<v Speaker 3>when I started realizing that when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking weed,</v>

1459
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really start smoking weed </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously until I was 30.</v>

1460
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:19.183
<v Speaker 3>And then when I started doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I started thinking about all sorts </v>

1461
01:04:21.151 --> 01:04:24.270
<v Speaker 3>of different patterns and while I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>angry all the time,</v>

1462
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 3>and I think a lot of it came from this </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentment of being abandoned when I was</v>

1463
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:28.674
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of your early stuff was fucking </v>

1464
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.570
<v Speaker 3>super dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1465
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:34.440
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a brilliant comic,</v>

1466
01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:37.470
<v Speaker 3>so I love all these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of that earlier stuff,</v>

1467
01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:38.304
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty fucking and angry dark </v>

1468
01:04:40.111 --> 01:04:40.440
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1469
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 3>It was also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1470
01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:42.384
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was also just a few years after I </v>

1471
01:04:45.211 --> 01:04:47.400
<v Speaker 3>was done fighting like I was a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1472
01:04:47.401 --> 01:04:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I just had a different mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Yah,</v>

1473
01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:55.610
<v Speaker 3>that's a very strange transition between</v>
<v Speaker 3>competition and then stand up comedy.</v>

1474
01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.213
<v Speaker 3>It's just a very different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset of I carried a little bit too </v>

1475
01:05:00.781 --> 01:05:03.550
<v Speaker 3>much combat with when you were still </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting it.</v>

1476
01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:04.384
<v Speaker 3>We're still fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes when you don't know what </v>

1477
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.060
<v Speaker 3>you're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worse.</v>

1478
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:11.760
<v Speaker 3>It's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start internalizing it and you don't</v>

1479
01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:12.594
<v Speaker 3>know what the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's war with itself and the war would </v>

1480
01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:19.440
<v Speaker 3>self because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wanted this needs this,</v>

1481
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.333
<v Speaker 3>this energy needs to be channeled and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how can it be and you and you went back </v>

1482
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:27.280
<v Speaker 3>shit on the knife and went really dark </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it and I've done that too.</v>

1483
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 3>But for us to be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His.</v>

1484
01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 3>The other question though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we were to get healthy,</v>

1485
01:05:31.901 --> 01:05:32.040
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1486
01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 3>We just suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1487
01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Well I used to worry about that when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was young.</v>

1488
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I used to worry about being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My idea was that if I became somehow,</v>

1489
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>air quote enlightened,</v>

1490
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I wouldn't be funny anymore.</v>

1491
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:44.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because all the funny people I knew were</v>

1492
01:05:44.771 --> 01:05:46.490
<v Speaker 3>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I don't want that.</v>

1493
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 3>I needed to be a drug addict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1494
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:48.603
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy was a drug addict prior with a </v>

1495
01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:52.870
<v Speaker 3>drug addict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I need to look at these people.</v>

1496
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean historically you look at Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at,</v>

1497
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.100
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at look at Bacara.</v>

1498
01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Janis Joplin.</v>

01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:44.010
<v Speaker 3>fatty acids and different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1615
01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:45.590
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:10:45.591 --> 01:10:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for him it was a,</v>

1617
01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:48.043
<v Speaker 3>in his mind it was an ethical choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a lot of other ones that </v>

1618
01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:53.540
<v Speaker 3>are vegetarians and do really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like jake shields.</v>

1619
01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:58.541
<v Speaker 3>He's a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he eats eggs and milk and cheese and</v>

1620
01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.920
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you want your own stuff.</v>

1621
01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you enjoy that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

1623
01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how did you,</v>

1625
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:06.953
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you learn that process of what </v>

1626
01:11:09.681 --> 01:11:11.320
<v Speaker 3>you do after the animal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1627
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.313
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got lucky that I learned from people </v>

1628
01:11:14.161 --> 01:11:16.440
<v Speaker 3>that know what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Steve Rinella,</v>

1629
01:11:16.441 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 3>who's a good friend of mine took me for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time on a television show.</v>

1630
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.110
<v Speaker 3>So the first time I ever wanted was on </v>
<v Speaker 3>tv,</v>

1631
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.200
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of nerve wracking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1632
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:27.270
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to fuck up and wound an </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal and television.</v>

1633
01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1634
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:34.250
<v Speaker 3>but what it is to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I saw so many videos,</v>

1635
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:35.603
<v Speaker 3>I saw so many of those factory farming </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos and I don't want to be a part of </v>

1636
01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:39.324
<v Speaker 3>this too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was either going to be a </v>

1637
01:11:40.231 --> 01:11:42.660
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I tried to be when I was fighting.</v>

1638
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to stay at a lower weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>class and I was a vegetarian for awhile.</v>

1639
01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 3>I felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I probably was doing it wrong.</v>

1640
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:51.990
<v Speaker 3>If you're ready to scream at your </v>
<v Speaker 3>keyboard right now,</v>

1641
01:11:51.991 --> 01:11:54.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're doing right now.</v>

1642
01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.080
<v Speaker 3>You can plant power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plant based path.</v>

1643
01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get bombarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1644
01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:00.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started eating meat again,</v>

1645
01:12:00.811 --> 01:12:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I went up a weight class and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I became much better and I just,</v>

1646
01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.650
<v Speaker 3>my body just reacts better with me too.</v>

1647
01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1648
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.131
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1649
01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:09.690
<v Speaker 3>I tried it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1650
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just found that,</v>

1651
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm making smart decisions.</v>

1652
01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Forget Vegan and vegetarian or a meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

1653
01:12:19.831 --> 01:12:22.430
<v Speaker 3>just making smart decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dietary,</v>

1654
01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.450
<v Speaker 3>these dietary decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1655
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.430
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1656
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:28.380
<v Speaker 3>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the difference in the world for me.</v>

1657
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:30.640
<v Speaker 3>And as someone who works out as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>

1658
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:32.190
<v Speaker 3>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just do.</v>

1659
01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a lie.</v>

1660
01:12:33.451 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's lying to you about it.</v>

1661
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.750
<v Speaker 3>You just feel better when you work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1662
01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.420
<v Speaker 3>the thing about fighters and people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in competition though,</v>

1663
01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:40.254
<v Speaker 3>it's like if there's more at stake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not just about feeling </v>

1664
01:12:42.781 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you have,</v>

1665
01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.053
<v Speaker 3>you have an obligation to your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your body and to your future to </v>

1666
01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:52.260
<v Speaker 3>perform at your best and your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's not a game.</v>

1667
01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:54.930
<v Speaker 3>You don't play mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't play box.</v>

1668
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:55.823
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true that you can die and people </v>

1669
01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:01.920
<v Speaker 3>have people that if you're cutting </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight the wrong way,</v>

1670
01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.120
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>

1671
01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:05.760
<v Speaker 3>because there's tons of wrong ways to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1672
01:13:05.761 --> 01:13:07.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that diuretics,</v>

1673
01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:08.950
<v Speaker 3>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come in,</v>

1674
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>malnourished and someone hits like a </v>

1675
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:13.500
<v Speaker 3>fucking mule man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1676
01:13:13.501 --> 01:13:15.120
<v Speaker 3>that's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No joke.</v>

1677
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:17.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anybody thinks he play boxing,</v>

1678
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:20.730
<v Speaker 3>watch Canelo Alvarez versus uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:21.983
<v Speaker 3>anybody where he like watch a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any like real vicious knockout of </v>

1680
01:13:27.901 --> 01:13:29.620
<v Speaker 3>someone's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he took off,</v>

1681
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.210
<v Speaker 3>he took James Kirkland soul out of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1682
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.500
<v Speaker 3>How about Amir Khan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1683
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:36.280
<v Speaker 3>when we cracked Amir Khan with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1684
01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1685
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.213
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go back to the eighties and Julian </v>

1686
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:41.840
<v Speaker 3>Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just separate people from the,</v>

1687
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.390
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Jude.</v>

1688
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson was a murderer.</v>

1689
01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.660
<v Speaker 3>He's the hardest puncher I ever saw my </v>
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>

1690
01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Here's Khan right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Canelo Alvarez right hand.</v>

1691
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.660
<v Speaker 3>See this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh good Lord.</v>

1692
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.510
<v Speaker 3>That was one of those fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were they short circuited,</v>

1693
01:13:57.511 --> 01:13:57.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know where he's at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a game right there.</v>

1695
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.373
<v Speaker 3>You're not playing that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Canelo is so much bigger than him </v>

1696
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:04.890
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much bigger.</v>

1697
01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he made 1:54,</v>

1698
01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:11.430
<v Speaker 3>but he's a middle way and Amir Khan is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>blown up welter.</v>

1699
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:12.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just separated his soul from his </v>

1700
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 3>body right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking hammertime that.</v>

1701
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.220
<v Speaker 3>He's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the interesting things in.</v>

1702
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:21.490
<v Speaker 3>You put this on your instagram about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first triple g fight.</v>

1703
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:24.810
<v Speaker 3>He landed in a triple g and triple g </v>
<v Speaker 3>shook it off and kept locking tourism.</v>

1704
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see it in his eyes like,</v>

1705
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 3>oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caught them clean.</v>

1706
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fighter man.</v>

1707
01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 3>You hit someone with your best shit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't budge.</v>

1708
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1709
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you used to take people </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1710
01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:37.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everything shifts.</v>

1711
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.033
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where a guy like Paulie </v>

1712
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Malignaggi has a slight advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

1713
01:14:42.491 --> 01:14:43.324
<v Speaker 3>He's very rarely knocked anybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So used to hitting people and keep them </v>

1714
01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:47.130
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1715
01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got once he had bad hands,</v>

1716
01:14:49.901 --> 01:14:52.030
<v Speaker 3>so we had to change his style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1717
01:14:52.031 --> 01:14:54.790
<v Speaker 3>it's a box and just poke the jab over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and over and over.</v>

1718
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:58.960
<v Speaker 3>Throw a right hand every now and then to</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep them honest with bad hands,</v>

1719
01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 3>but the beautiful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Canelo did he,</v>

1720
01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:05.610
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just paused but the jab just to draw,</v>

1721
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:07.650
<v Speaker 3>just to draw him down and he came over </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time,</v>

1722
01:15:07.651 --> 01:15:08.500
<v Speaker 3>at the right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

1723
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:09.400
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1724
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fight.</v>

1725
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:15.280
<v Speaker 3>I watched it again after a teddy atlas </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had a podcast.</v>

1726
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.450
<v Speaker 3>I watched a triple g canelo fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1727
01:15:17.451 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 3>you score it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1728
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.863
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't because what the kids were </v>

1729
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:22.480
<v Speaker 3>running around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the eye test.</v>

1730
01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:24.400
<v Speaker 3>What is your eye tests?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking close.</v>

1731
01:15:24.401 --> 01:15:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking close fight.</v>

1732
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Triple g came on real strong towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>secondhand makes you want 15 round fight</v>

1733
01:15:31.711 --> 01:15:32.950
<v Speaker 3>is what it means is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>

1734
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.300
<v Speaker 3>yes it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

1735
01:15:34.301 --> 01:15:36.130
<v Speaker 3>dumb motherfuckers would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggling.</v>

1736
01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what those 15,</v>

1737
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.280
<v Speaker 3>like the duke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Duke who?</v>

1738
01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Kim stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Ray.</v>

1739
01:15:40.691 --> 01:15:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I think like a lot of that shit was </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the 15 rounds,</v>

1740
01:15:43.991 --> 01:15:45.640
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of weight cutting back.</v>

1741
01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:50.641
<v Speaker 3>Then of course these same day way in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a real danger,</v>

1742
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.810
<v Speaker 3>but a 15 round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1743
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:57.243
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we watched fighters in any professional </v>

1744
01:15:59.771 --> 01:16:00.604
<v Speaker 3>fight in combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see them gassing and like the </v>

1745
01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:03.430
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1746
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Larry Holmes had tits and was going big </v>
<v Speaker 3>tits and he was going 15 easy.</v>

1747
01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:08.680
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1748
01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:09.260
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1749
01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.350
<v Speaker 3>it's just the human body is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1750
01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:14.940
<v Speaker 3>on understanding how to manage your </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy to,</v>

1751
01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:16.630
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1752
01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:17.351
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1753
01:16:17.351 --> 01:16:21.370
<v Speaker 3>when you come out in the first couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just letting shots fly,</v>

1754
01:16:21.371 --> 01:16:23.770
<v Speaker 3>then you danced in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a shock.</v>

1755
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1756
01:16:24.761 --> 01:16:26.380
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1757
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.200
<v Speaker 3>it can work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it doesn't work,</v>

1758
01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:30.940
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1759
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you ice them in the second you look</v>

1760
01:16:33.071 --> 01:16:35.110
<v Speaker 3>like you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had a brilliant game plan.</v>

1761
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:36.820
<v Speaker 3>When you're Gaston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventh.</v>

1762
01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:38.720
<v Speaker 3>People are questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1763
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.850
<v Speaker 3>your ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ring,</v>

1764
01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:43.050
<v Speaker 3>I kill your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your corner to risk it.</v>

1765
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:46.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a heavy risk to throw all your </v>
<v Speaker 3>artillery at someone in the first round.</v>

1766
01:16:46.691 --> 01:16:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1767
01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 3>It's just such a fascinating sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love all combat sports,</v>

1768
01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:57.871
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things about boxing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a combat sport that has the longest</v>

1769
01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:01.530
<v Speaker 3>richest history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go back and you can walk,</v>

1770
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:02.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Teddy was here,</v>

1771
01:17:02.681 --> 01:17:04.900
<v Speaker 3>we were watching Max schmeling versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Lewis,</v>

1772
01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.793
<v Speaker 3>second fight and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could go back and watch some of the </v>

1773
01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 3>sugar ray Robinson's greatest</v>

1774
01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Henry Armstrong man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1775
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you get to see the rich history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

1776
01:17:15.241 --> 01:17:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Then you look at Jack Johnson fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with those black and white films.</v>

1777
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Jack Dempsey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gene.</v>

1778
01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:23.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1779
01:17:23.051 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful that we have that.</v>

1780
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Has the audience with hats on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that about?</v>

1781
01:17:28.291 --> 01:17:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the old days dudes all wore.</v>

1782
01:17:30.450 --> 01:17:34.370
<v Speaker 1>How strange?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>

1783
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1784
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:36.783
<v Speaker 1>there's a history to box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He meant no other sport could really </v>

1785
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.700
<v Speaker 1>come close to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreed.</v>

1786
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:41.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1787
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:42.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>

1788
01:17:42.251 --> 01:17:43.084

<v Speaker 1>always have been a giant fan of boxing </v>

1789
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.060
<v Speaker 1>before mma came around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1790
01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:47.894
<v Speaker 1>that was really all you had to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could watch a little bit of </v>

1791
01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:53.150
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rarely,</v>

1792
01:17:53.151 --> 01:17:54.590
<v Speaker 1>but it was always bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1793
01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:58.220
<v Speaker 1>the other thing was those guys were </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstars.</v>

1794
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight champ of the world when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were younger was,</v>

1795
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:02.103
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if we walked out on the street </v>

1796
01:18:03.621 --> 01:18:05.800
<v Speaker 1>right now and as someone who the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champions,</v>

1797
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>no one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knows,</v>

1798
01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.580
<v Speaker 1>some of them might say Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the longest time the crazy thing</v>

1799
01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:11.414
<v Speaker 1>was it was a white guy and no one never </v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody when we're kids wanted a </v>

1800
01:18:15.141 --> 01:18:16.520
<v Speaker 1>white heavyweight champion.</v>

1801
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why they pumped a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1802
01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Gerry Cooney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were trying.</v>

1803
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Morrison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1804
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.450
<v Speaker 1>They wanted it so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1805
01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:27.230
<v Speaker 1>But know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like those got like,</v>

1806
01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar ray Leonard was a hero.</v>

1807
01:18:30.411 --> 01:18:33.110
<v Speaker 1>He's on woman's Donald's commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those that,</v>

1808
01:18:33.111 --> 01:18:34.530
<v Speaker 1>those days are gone though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1809
01:18:34.531 --> 01:18:37.610
<v Speaker 1>it's become a niche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's now a niche sport again.</v>

1810
01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:39.020
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that is?</v>

1811
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1812
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.083
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because people got tired of </v>

1813
01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:44.390
<v Speaker 1>corruption?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1814
01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to teddy and fights,</v>

1815
01:18:47.171 --> 01:18:48.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at length like you did,</v>

1816
01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.620
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1817
01:18:50.621 --> 01:18:52.280
<v Speaker 1>when I go to fights and he's calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1818
01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:53.114
<v Speaker 1>I always pay my respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sure how or why or when it </v>

1819
01:18:57.651 --> 01:19:02.651
<v Speaker 1>shifted that shift from the eighties or </v>
<v Speaker 1>early nineties and then that's it,</v>

1820
01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:04.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1821
01:19:04.191 --> 01:19:05.330
<v Speaker 1>it might go into jail.</v>

1822
01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it,</v>

1823
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>de la de la Hoya was huge,</v>

1824
01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:14.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

1825
01:19:14.241 --> 01:19:16.650
<v Speaker 1>why these dudes were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1826
01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.050
<v Speaker 1>the Ali was the most well known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well known athlete ever.</v>

1827
01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably close to it,</v>

1828
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:23.703
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who else would beat him if </v>

1829
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Jordan by name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1830
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.790
<v Speaker 1>What was really interesting was when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes was a champ,</v>

1831
01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:29.624
<v Speaker 1>nobody gave a shit because he had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill the void of between Ali and he was </v>

1832
01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:36.730
<v Speaker 1>between Ali and Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1833
01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tool to basically transcended.</v>

1834
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile the Ali that beat the fuck out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Gerry Cooney,</v>

1835
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I would've loved to see him against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson.</v>

1836
01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:49.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a different house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1837
01:19:49.971 --> 01:19:50.960
<v Speaker 1>not Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1838
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes,</v>

1839
01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:53.354
<v Speaker 1>and beat the fuck out of Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came out of retirement for that payday </v>

1840
01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:59.810
<v Speaker 1>against it looks out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still look good in the second round.</v>

1841
01:19:59.811 --> 01:20:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Up until he got what he was dancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime.</v>

1842
01:20:02.571 --> 01:20:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Larry gives Mike problems all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1843
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>a prime larry was a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a special</v>

1844
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.830
<v Speaker 3>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a tremendous job.</v>

1845
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>May the best heavyweight jab I ever saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>

1846
01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:17.800
<v Speaker 3>the the Ali that fought Larry Holmes was</v>
<v Speaker 3>an old broken down.</v>

1847
01:20:18.130 --> 01:20:20.130
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't ever let that fight take </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1848
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 3>A shell of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible to watch.</v>

1849
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:26.520
<v Speaker 3>But that Larry Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry Holmes would have given Mike Tyson</v>

1850
01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 3>fits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a different Larry.</v>

1851
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1861
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.500
<v Speaker 3>some brilliant comedian slipped through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cracks,</v>

1862
01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:55.440
<v Speaker 3>through the what was happening at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time in comedy.</v>

1863
01:20:55.441 --> 01:20:56.274
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with,</v>

1864
01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:57.960
<v Speaker 3>and with Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Yo,</v>

1865
01:20:57.961 --> 01:21:00.960
<v Speaker 3>you came after the most popular fighter </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all time ever.</v>

1866
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 3>And before Mike who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1867
01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:03.684
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two dudes who transcended the sport and </v>

1868
01:21:05.311 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 3>he beat up the most popular fighter of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all time and everybody knew it was long,</v>

1869
01:21:09.961 --> 01:21:10.794
<v Speaker 3>long over.</v>

1870
01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he can't,</v>

1871
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:14.213
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he talks shit about Marsianno </v>

1872
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:19.260
<v Speaker 3>which didn't endear them to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a mistake.</v>

1873
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:21.360
<v Speaker 3>He said Marciano couldn't carry his </v>
<v Speaker 3>jockstrap.</v>

1874
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:25.800
<v Speaker 3>That's my son's name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My son's name Graziano.</v>

1875
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.870

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1876
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:32.280
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1877
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Larry just just had poor timing </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately for him.</v>

1878
01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:36.683
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>because I still see him at the fights </v>

<v Speaker 3>lot of people.</v>

1897
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:26.760
<v Speaker 3>He slipped through the cracks.</v>

1900
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1901
01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Trevor Berbick fight Ali too,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1903
01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.970
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or second to last,</v>

1904
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:39.804
<v Speaker 3>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Parkinson's was already starting </v>

1905

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1906
01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.023
<v Speaker 3>because you think of him a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years later at Tyson when Tyson be </v>

1907
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Berbick and he was trembling then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1908
01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's.</v>

1909
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:53.290
<v Speaker 3>We talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't play boxing,</v>

1910
01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.193
<v Speaker 3>you don't play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't play him in May if you know your </v>

1911
01:22:56.311 --> 01:22:56.970
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1912
01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:58.590
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ali,</v>

1913
01:22:58.620 --> 01:22:59.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always liked to watch that fight with </v>

1914
01:23:01.741 --> 01:23:02.574
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jerry quarry because it was after three </v>

1915
01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:05.700
<v Speaker 3>years off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:23:05.701 --> 01:23:08.020
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see his body looks different.</v>

1917
01:23:08.021 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just looks softer.</v>

1918
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:14.290
<v Speaker 3>You if you see Ali versus like Cleveland</v>
<v Speaker 3>Williams and then he see Ali three years</v>

1919
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:15.910
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after all that time off,</v>

1920
01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:17.860
<v Speaker 3>he just doesn't look the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was never really the same.</v>

1921
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:20.560
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think about why he did it,</v>

1922
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:21.394
<v Speaker 3>imagine having the constitution to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>away the prime of your fighting career </v>

1923
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:29.950
<v Speaker 3>to not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very special because they want them</v>

1924
01:23:29.951 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 3>to fight in the Vietnam war is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a bullshit bullshit.</v>

1925
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.240
<v Speaker 3>None of them ever called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1926
01:23:34.241 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 3>none of them have called me the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1927
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going over there to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took three prime yet,</v>

1928
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got that window as a fighter man.</v>

1929
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:46.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like four to six years and he and </v>
<v Speaker 3>half of it was taken.</v>

1930
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:50.860
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of amazing too that they did </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and then they gave it back to him.</v>

1931
01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:52.630
<v Speaker 3>They let him fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1932
01:23:52.631 --> 01:23:55.600
<v Speaker 3>What was the circumstances like how did </v>
<v Speaker 3>they reinstate his boxing?</v>

1933
01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.850
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know either,</v>

1934
01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:59.920
<v Speaker 3>but I remember when he fought frazier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1935
01:23:59.921 --> 01:24:00.754
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have loved to see this fight </v>

1936
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:04.330
<v Speaker 3>three years ago because he just was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different guy,</v>

1937
01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.480
<v Speaker 3>but who's way too flat footed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just was a different guy.</v>

1938
01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

1939
01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.713
<v Speaker 3>The Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Joe and Joe in the Ali hated </v>

1940
01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:13.990
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For Real.</v>

1941
01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:14.950
<v Speaker 3>For Real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1942
01:24:14.951 --> 01:24:16.350
<v Speaker 3>because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1943
01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.670
<v Speaker 3>I lead with saying horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible shit.</v>

1944
01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:21.400
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to fuck with his head and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I do it.</v>

1945
01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.650
<v Speaker 3>He was the original shit talker.</v>

1946
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Do you think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you,</v>

1947
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:27.340
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see conor and you're like,</v>

1948
01:24:27.341 --> 01:24:28.720
<v Speaker 3>that's highly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1949

1951
01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a little bit of both of them.</v>

1952
01:24:35.711 --> 01:24:36.521
<v Speaker 3>They're too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1953
01:24:36.521 --> 01:24:38.810
<v Speaker 3>you remember when Henry Cooper knocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>down Ali?</v>

1954
01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:40.990
<v Speaker 3>That was like the biggest thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UK.</v>

1955
01:24:40.991 --> 01:24:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I heard him bad and then Angelo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dundee cut the gloves.</v>

1956
01:24:45.211 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it wasn't for that move,</v>

1957
01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.970
<v Speaker 3>Ali could have lost by stoppage very </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>

1958
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.863
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got fucking craft craft flight right on </v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1967
01:25:12.271 --> 01:25:13.104
<v Speaker 3>looking at him right on the button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is staggering back to his corner and </v>

1968
01:25:16.001 --> 01:25:16.990
<v Speaker 3>it happened.</v>

1969
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Luckily for him at the very end of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll back then.</v>

1970
01:25:21.521 --> 01:25:22.630

1971
01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is before he fought.</v>

1972
01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Was it before he fought Sonny Liston and</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say it was.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They cheated him.</v>

1977
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.080
<v Speaker 3>It's different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1978
01:25:38.081 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 3>we got to change gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give him a long ass time.</v>

1979
01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gotta undo these laces.</v>

1980
01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Cut this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut this tape.</v>

1981
01:25:42.941 --> 01:25:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1983
01:25:45.161 --> 01:25:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Dundee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a newcomer.</v>

1984
01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not.</v>

1985
01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:50.020
<v Speaker 3>He knew what the fuck he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was great.</v>

1986
01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My favorite stoppage of all Ali's fights</v>

1987
01:25:53.351 --> 01:25:56.320
<v Speaker 3>is Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Cat Williams because he hit him with</v>

1988
01:25:56.321 --> 01:26:01.321
<v Speaker 3>these just welterweight combinations </v>
<v Speaker 3>being he did it pop up.</v>

1989
01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.193
<v Speaker 3>Pop Up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1990
01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:07.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was throwing it really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw anyone throw combinations,</v>

1991
01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 3>a heavyweight like that before.</v>

1992
01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Combinations like Ray Robinson and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluidity of this was.</v>

1993
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:18.110
<v Speaker 3>It was one of my all time favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] Williams was a scary fucking</v>

1994
01:26:18.111 --> 01:26:18.944
<v Speaker 3>dude too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a big puncher and Ali was just </v>

1995
01:26:21.471 --> 01:26:25.460
<v Speaker 3>lying on their body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one does that anymore.</v>

1996
01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Williams just kept pressing for </v>

1997
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:29.570
<v Speaker 3>pressing forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll leave.</v>

1998
01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Williams is a big puncher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1999
01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.490
<v Speaker 3>He could crack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just couldn't find Ali and Ali was so</v>

2000
01:26:34.491 --> 01:26:39.310
<v Speaker 3>loose in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look at that beautiful.</v>

2001
01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 3>He's a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

2002
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:43.340
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left hook,</v>

2003
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 3>move around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then once,</v>

2004
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:50.260
<v Speaker 3>once he started tuning them up the body </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then back up top is beautiful man.</v>

2005
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2006
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:52.940
<v Speaker 3>this is art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is art,</v>

2007
01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:53.774
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because there was never a heavy </v>

2008
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:56.114
<v Speaker 3>weight that moved like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have to realize this didn't </v>

2009
01:26:58.371 --> 01:27:01.280
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man and rarely does exist.</v>

2010
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:06.430
<v Speaker 3>The only guy who moves even remotely </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this today is Tyson fury.</v>

2011
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Tyson fury can move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can bro.</v>

2012
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker can dance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can.</v>

2013
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:14.150
<v Speaker 3>He dances and he's six foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2014
01:27:14.151 --> 01:27:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Nine or eight or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's huge.</v>

2015
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.370
<v Speaker 3>He gets clipped a little too much for </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2016
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:21.230
<v Speaker 3>He definitely gets tagged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:22.093
<v Speaker 3>He got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got tagged by Steve Cunningham from </v>

2018
01:27:23.961 --> 01:27:27.530
<v Speaker 3>Philly and dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the cruiserweight was even crate.</v>

2019
01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm like always Chin might not be all </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2020
01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.291
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2021
01:27:30.291 --> 01:27:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Cunningham's a shorter guy and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those really tall fighters it's very</v>

2022
01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:36.920
<v Speaker 3>difficult to punch down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how Mike was getting over because</v>

2023
01:27:36.921 --> 01:27:41.921
<v Speaker 3>he was in the chest and he was real head</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement and the and the Pika bull that,</v>

2024
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the custom model developed pulled up,</v>

2025
01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:46.454
<v Speaker 3>put the end of that fight up so I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the combinations that led to the </v>

2026
01:27:50.571 --> 01:27:51.404
<v Speaker 3>stoppage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See once once he had williamson trouble </v>

2030
01:27:59.311 --> 01:28:02.900
<v Speaker 3>his face had been jabbed off and joe the</v>
<v Speaker 3>craziest thing,</v>

2031
01:28:02.901 --> 01:28:05.540
<v Speaker 3>a beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The craziest thing about him is everyone</v>

2032
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:08.780
<v Speaker 3>historically has to sit down on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>punches to get leverage on him.</v>

2033
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.450
<v Speaker 3>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dancing and yeah,</v>

2035
01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Well he wasn't trying to knock you out </v>
<v Speaker 3>with every punch.</v>

2036
01:28:15.621 --> 01:28:18.340
<v Speaker 3>He was just cracking you papa,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Rough to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's frustrating because you're in your </v>

<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've never seen someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in a position to not throw a punch </v>

2076
01:29:52.831 --> 01:29:55.270
<v Speaker 1>and throws a beautiful three punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

2077
01:29:55.271 --> 01:29:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2078
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:57.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call them the matrix or high tech </v>

2079
01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:00.720
<v Speaker 1>to perfect names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

2080
01:30:00.721 --> 01:30:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like,</v>

2081
01:30:02.281 --> 01:30:04.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe um,</v>

2082
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.393
<v Speaker 1>maybe a prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roy Choi was different too because it </v>

2083
01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:13.190
<v Speaker 1>was technically awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had such reflex when they went,</v>

2084
01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:16.650
<v Speaker 1>that's when he got melted because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he never.</v>

2085
01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:18.500
<v Speaker 1>He didn't Jab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2086
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:19.530
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2087
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Hook left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What rights from weird angles.</v>

2088
01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And it worked because his reflexes were </v>
<v Speaker 1>super human.</v>

2089
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:27.333
<v Speaker 1>He was superman and then as soon as they</v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate a little bit and in </v>

2090
01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:33.360
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can deteriorate a little bit.</v>

2091
01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:34.570
<v Speaker 1>In baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to tear it.</v>

2092
01:30:35.050 --> 01:30:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Got Roy would really got Roy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My opinion.</v>

2093
01:30:37.451 --> 01:30:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones Jr fan.</v>

2094
01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.200
<v Speaker 2>He's my maybe one of my all time </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite fighters.</v>

2095
01:30:41.230 --> 01:30:45.380
<v Speaker 2>What really got Roy's when we went up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight John Ruiz and then he went back to</v>

2096
01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:47.680
<v Speaker 2>tarver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was depleted,</v>

2097
01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:48.543
<v Speaker 2>depleted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think when he went up to fight </v>

2098
01:30:50.770 --> 01:30:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Ruiz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might've had some Mexican supplements</v>

2099
01:30:52.841 --> 01:30:54.040
<v Speaker 2>in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wink,</v>

2100
01:30:54.041 --> 01:30:54.431
<v Speaker 2>wink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nudge,</v>

2101
01:30:54.431 --> 01:30:55.090
<v Speaker 2>nudge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2102
01:30:55.090 --> 01:30:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was like 200 plus pounds</v>

2103
01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:58.031
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2104
01:30:58.031 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 1>eight or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look good.</v>

2105
01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I think he should've retired after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Win.</v>

2106
01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely should have consulted with</v>

2107
01:31:04.301 --> 01:31:05.134
<v Speaker 2>an endocrinologist and tried to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out what system was and then the weight </v>

2108
01:31:08.891 --> 01:31:12.490
<v Speaker 2>cut down to one 75 must have been brutal</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was smooth.</v>

2109
01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.430
<v Speaker 2>He looked like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost all his muscle tone.</v>

2110
01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:16.773
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked like a shredded in the </v>

2111
01:31:18.311 --> 01:31:19.480
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2112
01:31:19.481 --> 01:31:20.314
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked like a guy who's system had </v>

2113
01:31:22.241 --> 01:31:26.530
<v Speaker 2>been shut down with the thing that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys don't maybe don't recognize if they</v>

2114
01:31:26.531 --> 01:31:28.530
<v Speaker 2>take some shit or if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2115
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:33.070
<v Speaker 2>even if you just cut too much weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body stops producing hormones.</v>

2116
01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's all fucked up.</v>

2117
01:31:35.130 --> 01:31:36.680
<v Speaker 2>You're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on your way to die.</v>

2118
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Body's telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing now?</v>

2119
01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:39.800
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

2120
01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.800
<v Speaker 2>was 200 plus pounds when he fought Ruiz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he has to cut down to one $75.</v>

2121
01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty.</v>

2122
01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who knows how sophisticated his </v>

2123
01:31:48.591 --> 01:31:49.424
<v Speaker 2>methods were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2124
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:52.310
<v Speaker 2>some fighters today are amazing at doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2125
01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:54.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know how to do it correctly.</v>

2126
01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:58.910
<v Speaker 2>They know how to rehydrate correctly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing at least has the,</v>

2127
01:31:58.990 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefit</v>

2128
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 3>of not having Usada in place like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC does.</v>

2129
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:04.833
<v Speaker 3>The UFC has a real problem with a lack </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Ivs and these guys can't rehydrate </v>

2130
01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 3>correctly or the way that they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>is dangerous.</v>

2131
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:14.283
<v Speaker 3>It is dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in their defense it's also a way </v>

2132
01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:20.350
<v Speaker 3>that they can detect a whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's cheating.</v>

2133
01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:21.243
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when they're using [inaudible] </v>

2134
01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.030
<v Speaker 3>you can mask a lot of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2135
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think about that.</v>

2136
01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why they do it.</v>

2137
01:32:26.381 --> 01:32:26.951
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:32:26.951 --> 01:32:30.010
<v Speaker 3>They just won't let you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>

2139
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:32.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened with Roy when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did put it in,</v>

2140
01:32:32.531 --> 01:32:33.364
<v Speaker 3>you can't take anything away from tarver</v>
<v Speaker 3>either because Tarver almost beat Roy </v>

2141
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:39.580
<v Speaker 3>the first time they fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then fucked him up.</v>

2142
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Fucking flew his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2143
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.440
<v Speaker 3>And the famous words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any excuses Roy,</v>

2144
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:46.970
<v Speaker 3>right before they fired or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2145
01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 3>He was so confident.</v>

2146
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.430
<v Speaker 3>I think he gets his due either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2147
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't.</v>

2148
01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.680
<v Speaker 3>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had some great wins.</v>

2149
01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.860
<v Speaker 3>He had some great wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2150
01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:59.710
<v Speaker 3>he's still at it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heavyweight or something like 46,</v>

2151
01:32:59.711 --> 01:33:02.680
<v Speaker 3>47.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said he got popped for steroids.</v>

2152
01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.240
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2153
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:05.183
<v Speaker 3>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're 45 and you're still looking </v>

2154
01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:08.890
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on.</v>

2155
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:11.690
<v Speaker 3>The only the only person I truly believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

2156
01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I realize you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll think I'm biased because of where</v>

2157
01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:15.004
<v Speaker 3>I'm from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think Barnard ever did </v>

2158
01:33:15.791 --> 01:33:17.200
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he did anything either,</v>

2159
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:19.870
<v Speaker 3>but narges just lives clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him,</v>

2160
01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:21.323
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>order grilled chicken and get chicken </v>

2161
01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:26.960
<v Speaker 3>that was fried by accident and peel the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fry off of it rather than just go,</v>

2162
01:33:26.970 --> 01:33:27.970
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just this.</v>

2163
01:33:27.971 --> 01:33:31.630
<v Speaker 3>Once I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched him take it off to just,</v>

2164
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:32.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it means to not eat that is just </v>

2165
01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:35.253
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

2166
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Dietary in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2167
01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:39.753
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the Joe Smith fight was sad to </v>

2168
01:33:41.531 --> 01:33:43.150
<v Speaker 3>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course that was,</v>

2169
01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.013
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2170
01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.700
<v Speaker 3>the Cova left fight was sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was ringside but,</v>

2171
01:33:47.701 --> 01:33:49.460
<v Speaker 3>and I love Kovalev.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:51.160
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2173
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:52.420
<v Speaker 3>officially legend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2174
01:33:52.421 --> 01:33:53.920
<v Speaker 3>ah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is rough.</v>

2175
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:54.813
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy to see how deep into his </v>

2176
01:33:56.981 --> 01:33:57.814
<v Speaker 3>career he was still successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I wrote a blog article about Kelly </v>

2177
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:03.143
<v Speaker 3>Pavlik fight because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember how old he was at the </v>

2178
01:34:04.781 --> 01:34:05.614
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody had already written them </v>

2179
01:34:06.161 --> 01:34:07.900
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother and I were there,</v>

2180
01:34:07.901 --> 01:34:08.734
<v Speaker 3>like Pavlics gonna beat the dog shit off</v>
<v Speaker 3>and on and gave him a fucking lasting </v>

2181
01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:13.633
<v Speaker 3>lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put on a clinic where people have to </v>

2182
01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:17.200
<v Speaker 3>realize he was technically passed is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

2183
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:19.070
<v Speaker 3>is primarily fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tito treasures.</v>

2184
01:34:19.130 --> 01:34:19.963
<v Speaker 3>Thirty 6:30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 36 and 2001 that was two weeks </v>

2185
01:34:24.311 --> 01:34:26.530
<v Speaker 3>after nine slash 11 that fight and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was 36.</v>

2186
01:34:26.531 --> 01:34:27.740
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How crazy is that?</v>

2187
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:32.500
<v Speaker 3>What was he when he fought Joe Smith?</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 slash 50 maybe.</v>

2188
01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 51.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely 50.</v>

2189
01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was he.</v>

2190
01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I'd say he lasted 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Longer than.</v>

2191
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Than the average guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2192
01:34:42.661 --> 01:34:44.880
<v Speaker 3>How about when he came back and boxed </v>
<v Speaker 3>Roy Junior?</v>

2193
01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Roy,</v>

2194
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:47.223
<v Speaker 3>when Roy beat him the first time was </v>
<v Speaker 3>beaten him with all those reflex reflex </v>

2195
01:34:50.261 --> 01:34:51.094
<v Speaker 3>is slid off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly outbox the second slide with </v>

2196
01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.230
<v Speaker 3>just fundamentals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

2197
01:34:56.231 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Mechanical Roya didn't them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have</v>

2198
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.700
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2199
01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.850
<v Speaker 1>just relying on what was once there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>

2200
01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:04.160
<v Speaker 1>He was a shell of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his form itself.</v>

2201
01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was also the Glen Johnson fight was a</v>

2202
01:35:06.231 --> 01:35:08.630
<v Speaker 1>scary knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on Queer Street.</v>

2203
01:35:08.631 --> 01:35:09.464
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he was just flatlined and astral </v>

2204
01:35:10.941 --> 01:35:13.910
<v Speaker 1>traveling after the got knocked out by </v>
<v Speaker 1>tarver.</v>

2205
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Then there was not that much time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between those two funds.</v>

2206
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:19.250
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the next fight.</v>

2207
01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2208
01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:23.630
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those knockouts where your.</v>

2209
01:35:23.710 --> 01:35:24.543
<v Speaker 1>You're out on your feet before you hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground and your head hits the </v>

2210
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:29.990
<v Speaker 1>canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is two shots and he stiffened up.</v>

2211
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It was sad to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

2212
01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:34.160
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was going to be the end.</v>

2213
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.053
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he started fighting like in </v>

2214
01:35:36.381 --> 01:35:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctioned over there.</v>

2215
01:35:38.421 --> 01:35:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And he's a Russian citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes ma'am.</v>

2216
01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Bizarro world pussy involved.</v>

2217
01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:45.853
<v Speaker 1>He's got to have some toto over them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that when you're talking about </v>

2218
01:35:48.411 --> 01:35:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes and looked up his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia,</v>

2219
01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:51.830
<v Speaker 1>his last fight was in 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2220
01:35:52.090 --> 01:35:55.850
<v Speaker 1>butter bean is 51 or so and he put it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>butter bean.</v>

2221
01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:59.450
<v Speaker 1>10 round fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2222
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Butter bean can crack that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big motherfucker hit hard.</v>

2223
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:05.683
<v Speaker 1>But Larry just snake that snake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting through that pop every time he </v>

2224
01:36:10.311 --> 01:36:11.840
<v Speaker 1>tries to come in and bunk by member </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2225
01:36:11.841 --> 01:36:12.674
<v Speaker 1>But due to where those golden palace was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first person he did it under Tito </v>

2226
01:36:16.461 --> 01:36:16.881
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2227
01:36:16.881 --> 01:36:17.750
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the first.</v>

2228
01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so weird.</v>

2229
01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Someone did it in the UFC to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wore that shit on their back.</v>

2230
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>It's odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Put it on your trunks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to do it?</v>

2232
01:36:26.121 --> 01:36:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I guess you don't get as much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2233
01:36:28.810 --> 01:36:32.180
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Know Bernard got 50 k to put it on his</v>

2234
01:36:32.181 --> 01:36:34.730
<v Speaker 1>back and he bet it on himself against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tito.</v>

2235
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a huge underdog.</v>

2237
01:36:37.311 --> 01:36:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone thought Tito was going to whoop</v>

2238
01:36:40.321 --> 01:36:41.690
<v Speaker 1>his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

2239
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2240
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I was jumping off my brother's couch </v>
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>

2241
01:36:47.730 --> 01:36:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucked them up.</v>

2242
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:36:49.701 --> 01:36:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Bernard was a special athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really was absolutely special.</v>

2244
01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Fight all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2245
01:36:54.170 --> 01:36:55.003
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2246
01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.060
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2247
01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.273
<v Speaker 1>and it was interesting because I used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch him when he was in his thirties </v>

2248
01:37:00.171 --> 01:37:01.004
<v Speaker 1>and he would complain about crooked </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoters and all these things and my </v>

2249
01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:04.041
<v Speaker 1>thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2250
01:37:04.041 --> 01:37:04.874
<v Speaker 1>it's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy missed his prime and then he </v>

2251
01:37:07.041 --> 01:37:09.200
<v Speaker 1>did what he did and then he did what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did after the.</v>

2252
01:37:09.201 --> 01:37:10.160
<v Speaker 1>After.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2253
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.130
<v Speaker 1>because he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2254
01:37:11.130 --> 01:37:11.963
<v Speaker 1>he was in jail for like strong arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>robbery and got out and kind of like </v>

2255
01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:18.950
<v Speaker 1>wallowed in obscurity and then his shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>was at Roy fight,</v>

2256
01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I.</v>

2257
01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.140
<v Speaker 1>and so we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2258
01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you got your shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's it just got better,</v>

2259
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:25.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better with age,</v>

2260
01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 1>just show man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the rarest thing in anything.</v>

2261
01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discipline that he had,</v>

2262
01:37:30.610 --> 01:37:34.640
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline in his mindset.</v>

2263
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:37.730
<v Speaker 1>It should be a lesson to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:38.623
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the discipline and dedication to </v>

2265
01:37:41.511 --> 01:37:44.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to do can be achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that.</v>

2266
01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And he's still in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing shuts.</v>

2267
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:48.920
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't say no,</v>

2268
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:50.060
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

2269
01:37:50.061 --> 01:37:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I see him at the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's still the same.</v>

2270
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chubby now,</v>

2271
01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't blame those.</v>

2272
01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Like when the ran got really big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude was cutting when he was trying</v>

2273
01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:01.974
<v Speaker 1>to make 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that and he just kept going off </v>

2274
01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:05.600
<v Speaker 1>because he'd like to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2275
01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Only for Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barkley at one 68.</v>

2276
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:10.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a doodle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turned 35.</v>

2277
01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he fucked up David </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morris,</v>

2278
01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:15.690
<v Speaker 1>that was unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

2279
01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thought David Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this young lions,</v>

2280
01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:23.060
<v Speaker 1>lions destroyed this old legend and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roberta thumbed marines in my top five.</v>

2281
01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.380
<v Speaker 1>All time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any weight class.</v>

2282
01:38:25.381 --> 01:38:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Top Five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2283
01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people,</v>

2284
01:38:27.061 --> 01:38:29.970
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to watch Roberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta wash the lightweight Roberta.</v>

2285
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he even went to fight Leonard the</v>

2286
01:38:32.191 --> 01:38:36.330
<v Speaker 1>black and white fights because if can </v>
<v Speaker 1>and most right most can be.</v>

2287
01:38:36.370 --> 01:38:37.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beautiful.</v>

2288
01:38:37.171 --> 01:38:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Most people in America think of Doran </v>
<v Speaker 1>from like sugar ray on.</v>

2289
01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:42.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to see art and and just subtle </v>

2290
01:38:46.261 --> 01:38:49.440
<v Speaker 1>shit on the inside than he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing before Chavez.</v>

2291
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:50.453
<v Speaker 1>That little subtle shit on the inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>and picking off shots that people don't </v>

2292
01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:54.600
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His defense.</v>

2293
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.770
<v Speaker 1>He was eating none of those shots from </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside and then bang the body and all of</v>

2294
01:38:58.771 --> 01:38:58.950
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2295
01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:00.360
<v Speaker 1>That those fights were all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2296
01:39:00.361 --> 01:39:02.460
<v Speaker 1>he was great at 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>47,</v>

2297
01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:05.470
<v Speaker 1>54 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did amazing things and again,</v>

2298
01:39:05.471 --> 01:39:07.620
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's in my top five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>

2299
01:39:07.621 --> 01:39:10.920
<v Speaker 1>If people want to see and watch those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights at lightweight.</v>

2300
01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came up and wait just to get paid.</v>

2301
01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Of course he could have stayed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight for a long time,</v>

2302
01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:17.010
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just dominated.</v>

2303
01:39:17.011 --> 01:39:17.844
<v Speaker 1>And I think I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even now I think he's the best </v>

2304
01:39:19.711 --> 01:39:20.860
<v Speaker 1>lightweight ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a year for the world.</v>

2456
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like one of those dudes with the air</v>

2457
01:45:21.321 --> 01:45:24.890
<v Speaker 1>conditioners on 24 hours and it's 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mega clean to super clear.</v>

2459
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.520
<v Speaker 1>It looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a,</v>

2460
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:34.490
<v Speaker 1>like a movie set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2461
01:45:34.491 --> 01:45:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the crowds are crazy.</v>

2462
01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm from Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so of course I love that.</v>

2463
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.863
<v Speaker 1>Australia was incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I almost had a nervous breakdown on </v>

2464
01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:44.440
<v Speaker 1>the flight because it's too long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

2465
01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Flight Nav,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2466
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's five hours.</v>

2467
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Five or six hours from philly and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fly out of lax and was another 17.</v>

2468
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:58.370
<v Speaker 1>This is a 17 that's really heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you leave from Philly it's 22.</v>

2469
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:59.263
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2470
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

2471
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:03.530
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much does is if you go the other way</v>

2472
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:05.083
<v Speaker 1>on the way home and on the way home we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were the farthest point in Australia so </v>

2473
01:46:11.751 --> 01:46:14.840
<v Speaker 1>the flight in Australia was like six </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

2474
01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.140
<v Speaker 1>So from the time the time I texted my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

2475
01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:19.003
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving to come home to </v>

2476
01:46:19.761 --> 01:46:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got home 36 hours later.</v>

2477
01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:25.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

2478
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.903
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they offer me constantly to come back </v>

2479
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:32.000
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what we do for a living?</v>

2480
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:37.030
<v Speaker 1>We would go places and I'm like Yo man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that flight nervous breakdown.</v>

2481
01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:42.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide what's more important</v>
<v Speaker 1>money or your mental stability.</v>

2482
01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm already Nadia Than Squirrel </v>

2483
01:46:45.630 --> 01:46:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't need,</v>

2484
01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't need anything to push me any </v>
<v Speaker 1>further than</v>

2485
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.860
<v Speaker 2>it's already what's going on in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>my ears.</v>

2486
01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Thailand is a similar thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 14 and then another five.</v>

2487
01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 11 to go to Europe </v>
<v Speaker 2>or where did we go?</v>

2488
01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:07.941
<v Speaker 2>I think we went to Taiwan first and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was another like five or something or</v>

2489
01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:13.380
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time you're back,</v>

2490
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.290
<v Speaker 2>you're so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me two solid weeks for.</v>

2491
01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:18.660
<v Speaker 2>I started sleeping at night again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it took me three.</v>

2492
01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I'd wake up like two hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to bed tired as fuck.</v>

2493
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Wake up two hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide awake.</v>

2494
01:47:25.141 --> 01:47:26.400
<v Speaker 2>It was two in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2495
01:47:26.401 --> 01:47:31.320
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your whole Circadian Rhythms Jot fucked.</v>

2496
01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:32.940
<v Speaker 2>It takes forever to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2497
01:47:32.941 --> 01:47:34.320
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me two or three weeks.</v>

2498
01:47:34.321 --> 01:47:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Two and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fucked up my family.</v>

2499
01:47:36.571 --> 01:47:39.870
<v Speaker 2>We did two trips in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to Thailand and then we took two</v>

2500
01:47:39.871 --> 01:47:40.330
<v Speaker 2>weeks off.</v>

2501
01:47:40.330 --> 01:47:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Then we went to Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was just a,</v>

2502
01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.750
<v Speaker 2>a double bunker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was it enough for you to be like,</v>

2503
01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2504
01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:48.613
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

2505
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I've learned how to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blog.</v>

2506
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.133
<v Speaker 2>I really like taking my kids places too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the fact that I like to </v>

2507
01:47:55.651 --> 01:48:00.651
<v Speaker 2>expose them to places like Thailand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Italy and take them to different places.</v>

2508
01:48:01.531 --> 01:48:02.364
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like exposing them to Costa Rica and </v>

2509
01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:06.960
<v Speaker 2>we didn't get to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2510
01:48:06.961 --> 01:48:09.960
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that you have the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>

2511
01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's a lot.</v>

2512
01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:15.000
<v Speaker 2>That's cool shit to say that they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2513
01:48:15.170 --> 01:48:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying it more than I ever thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be an apparent to me is it's not</v>

2514
01:48:20.311 --> 01:48:21.144
<v Speaker 2>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a beautiful thing to watch these little </v>

2515
01:48:23.221 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 2>people that I love so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow and have fun and be happy,</v>

2516
01:48:26.130 --> 01:48:26.963
<v Speaker 2>but it's also um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting to experience the world </v>

2517
01:48:28.741 --> 01:48:29.520
<v Speaker 2>through their eyes.</v>

2518
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ride an elephant.</v>

2519
01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched them,</v>

2520
01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:33.613
<v Speaker 2>watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a zip line with me and Costa Rica were </v>

2521
01:48:35.731 --> 01:48:38.610
<v Speaker 2>laughing together on the heavy chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's intense,</v>

2522
01:48:38.611 --> 01:48:40.290
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

2523
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:41.340
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tends to,</v>

2524
01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:42.253
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's made me shift my values and shift </v>

2525
01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:47.820
<v Speaker 2>how I think about just experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2526
01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a heavy thing,</v>

2527
01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:50.130
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They change.</v>

2528
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:53.520
<v Speaker 2>They change you in ways you didn't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>were possible.</v>

2529
01:48:53.521 --> 01:48:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2530
01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:57.690
<v Speaker 2>empathy and not just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like you said,</v>

2531
01:48:57.691 --> 01:49:00.750
<v Speaker 2>seeing things through their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the coolest thing,</v>

2532
01:49:00.751 --> 01:49:02.190
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we didn't have that.</v>

2533
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

2534
01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:07.080
<v Speaker 2>It's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it makes me feel super vulnerable to,</v>

2535
01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were talking about your mom,</v>

2536
01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:12.120
<v Speaker 2>like worrying about your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about people that you care,</v>

2537
01:49:12.121 --> 01:49:14.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a catch 22.</v>

2538
01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:17.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry about nobody.</v>

2539
01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:20.130
<v Speaker 2>You don't give a fuck about nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also don't have anything.</v>

2540
01:49:20.190 --> 01:49:21.023
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you have all these people that </v>

2541
01:49:22.201 --> 01:49:24.750
<v Speaker 2>you love and you care about so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you worry about losing them.</v>

2542
01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a double edged sword.</v>

2543
01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was alone,</v>

2544
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:31.074
<v Speaker 2>just wilding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I was behaving that way </v>

2545
01:49:33.241 --> 01:49:34.074
<v Speaker 2>because I had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're looking for something then </v>

2546
01:49:36.151 --> 01:49:36.984
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find it and all you do is worry about </v>

2547
01:49:38.311 --> 01:49:39.144
<v Speaker 2>losing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to what we were talking </v>

2548
01:49:41.371 --> 01:49:44.280
<v Speaker 2>about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're not scared a little,</v>

2549
01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 2>if you're not nervous a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not,</v>

2550
01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 2>if you don't get a little</v>

2551
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.410
<v Speaker 3>bit of anxiety when you're not paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>

2552
01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:53.860
<v Speaker 3>but you're not living your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not seeing anything,</v>

2553
01:49:53.861 --> 01:49:56.980
<v Speaker 3>you're getting yourself out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're putting yourself out there,</v>

2554
01:49:56.981 --> 01:49:59.380
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have some anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have some fear.</v>

2555
01:49:59.381 --> 01:50:02.080
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have some worries with </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people that don't have,</v>

2556
01:50:02.081 --> 01:50:02.914
<v Speaker 3>that don't put themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that I live in a bubble and they're </v>

2557
01:50:04.721 --> 01:50:07.990
<v Speaker 3>comfortable and a gray and dry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2558
01:50:07.991 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 3>It's that niche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Nietzsche question.</v>

2559
01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:11.254
<v Speaker 3>Would you rather live your life in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>series of tremendous highs and </v>

2560
01:50:13.511 --> 01:50:16.870
<v Speaker 3>tremendous lows or just flat line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat line,</v>

2561
01:50:16.871 --> 01:50:20.050
<v Speaker 3>and these people think flatlining that </v>
<v Speaker 3>square life is like,</v>

2562
01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.340
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2563
01:50:21.341 --> 01:50:23.560
<v Speaker 3>two point five kids and a house like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2564
01:50:23.561 --> 01:50:24.311
<v Speaker 3>Is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2565
01:50:24.311 --> 01:50:25.144
<v Speaker 3>that's not it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2566
01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:26.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2567
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.180
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with having two </v>
<v Speaker 3>point five kids in the house,</v>

2568
01:50:28.181 --> 01:50:30.320
<v Speaker 3>but go do some shit and no kids.</v>

2569
01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:32.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to the woods.</v>

2570
01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Go rafting short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2572
01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.490
<v Speaker 3>We went whitewater rafting last year in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana.</v>

2573
01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:42.810
<v Speaker 3>That was shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they got to see Bison,</v>

2580
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:02.263
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild bison up close to their minds are </v>

<v Speaker 3>I just want them to see as much shit as </v>

<v Speaker 3>I want them to see.</v>

2583
01:51:09.071 --> 01:51:09.904

<v Speaker 3>wife and I sit down and talk like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do this summer?</v>

2585
01:51:14.650 --> 01:51:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Like where are we going to take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this year was Thailand,</v>

2586
01:51:16.871 --> 01:51:18.850
<v Speaker 3>where are we going to go next year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take them somewhere else.</v>

2587
01:51:18.850 --> 01:51:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God bless.</v>

2588
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun man.</v>

2589
01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.950
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

2590
01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:26.740
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2591
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 3>education that I didn't anticipate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you build it,</v>

2592
01:51:31.391 --> 01:51:32.224
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You deserve it because you did it your </v>

2593
01:51:35.531 --> 01:51:36.364
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's punk rock and punk rock as </v>

2594
01:51:38.561 --> 01:51:39.700
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

2595
01:51:40.450 --> 01:51:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're traveling,</v>

2596
01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:46.660
<v Speaker 3>how many guys you bring them with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's usually,</v>

2597
01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:49.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's three of us on stage.</v>

2598
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:50.553
<v Speaker 3>Like me rhyming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hype man and a Dj and then a tour </v>

2599
01:51:52.691 --> 01:51:57.340
<v Speaker 3>manager and emerge guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So usually five.</v>

2600
01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:01.210
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing because comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times travel by themselves.</v>

2601
01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:03.980
<v Speaker 3>They get the press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2602
01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:06.730
<v Speaker 3>I know like already we'll talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

2603
01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Just being alone in a hotel room and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Schenectady.</v>

2604
01:52:12.670 --> 01:52:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I figured that shit out a long time ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2605
01:52:15.190 --> 01:52:16.023
<v Speaker 3>I started bringing my friends with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in promoters or clubs they </v>

2606
01:52:19.571 --> 01:52:21.460
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't pay for the friend you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay,</v>

2607
01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:23.080
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't pay for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would just say,</v>

2608
01:52:23.081 --> 01:52:24.970
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me a flat rate.</v>

2609
01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:27.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay my opening act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay their airfare,</v>

2610
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:29.410
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay their hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather lose money.</v>

2611
01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Well my earlier tours I was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>promoters didn't care about opening acts</v>

2612
01:52:35.051 --> 01:52:37.840
<v Speaker 3>and I was paying my homeboys to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opening acts.</v>

2613
01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Just like kind of my what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting paid.</v>

2614
01:52:40.811 --> 01:52:43.510
<v Speaker 3>I was handing it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing.</v>

2615
01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 3>User experience because you're keeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself safe</v>

2616
01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:48.470
<v Speaker 1>and you have family in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I go on the road,</v>

2617
01:52:48.471 --> 01:52:51.620
<v Speaker 1>if I go on the road with Joey or Aria </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those guys were family.</v>

2618
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:52.783
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're having a good time wherever we </v>

2619
01:52:54.681 --> 01:52:56.000
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what time you guys want to eat?</v>

2620
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's eat lunch at noon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2621
01:52:57.741 --> 01:52:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll meet you guys down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you guys want to go to the gym?</v>

2622
01:52:59.991 --> 01:53:00.824
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go hit the gym.</v>

2623
01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.370
<v Speaker 1>So we're laughing and having a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2624
01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:06.380
<v Speaker 1>But in the early days I did a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those solo trips.</v>

2625
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:09.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird empty feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have your urban.</v>

2626
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:10.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a very dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2627
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:16.750
<v Speaker 1>did you see that Louis episode that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did about traveling and he's alone?</v>

2628
01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:20.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole episode dedicated to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just said.</v>

2629
01:53:20.410 --> 01:53:23.180
<v Speaker 1>And it was very dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not humorous.</v>

2630
01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:26.720
<v Speaker 1>You got to take friends with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends to this day that don't do</v>

2631
01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:27.230
<v Speaker 1>it that way.</v>

2632
01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:29.540
<v Speaker 1>They go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use local acts and I'm like,</v>

2633
01:53:29.541 --> 01:53:30.610
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it with A.</v>

2634
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:31.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I'd have to pay for his air </v>

2635
01:53:32.591 --> 01:53:34.900
<v Speaker 1>fare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like paid them money or man,</v>

2636
01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I know you're going to make less money </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

2637
01:53:37.431 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but you'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

2638
01:53:39.710 --> 01:53:44.710
<v Speaker 1>there comes a time where those decisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're doing things monetarily,</v>

2639
01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:47.203
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were making this decision based on </v>

2640
01:53:49.731 --> 01:53:53.510
<v Speaker 1>financial and you have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mental stability more.</v>

2641
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the opener with Gat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's $500 grand,</v>

2642
01:53:56.871 --> 01:53:57.990
<v Speaker 1>three grand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$5,</v>

2643
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.580
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that's worth having </v>
<v Speaker 1>family with you,</v>

2644
01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:04.280
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like your performance is going to</v>

2645
01:54:04.281 --> 01:54:05.114
<v Speaker 1>be better or worse because you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be with friends or going to have a </v>

2646
01:54:06.831 --> 01:54:08.900
<v Speaker 1>good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not worried about the show.</v>

2647
01:54:08.901 --> 01:54:10.700
<v Speaker 1>You bring a funny guy to open up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2648
01:54:10.701 --> 01:54:11.534

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2650
01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.050
<v Speaker 1>and then so then more people will come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your next show.</v>

2651
01:54:15.051 --> 01:54:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better for you financially.</v>

2652
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:20.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a short term investment or for </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm gain.</v>

2653
01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2654
01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:24.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what these people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're penny wise and pound foolish.</v>

2655
01:54:24.650 --> 01:54:25.483
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand that when what </v>

2656
01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:27.943
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's going to kill and then it's </v>

2657
01:54:30.621 --> 01:54:31.454
<v Speaker 1>going to be double the people next door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least everybody's gonna have a good </v>

2658
01:54:34.551 --> 01:54:36.830
<v Speaker 1>time and you're not gonna get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there crazy.</v>

2659
01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:39.680
<v Speaker 1>When I come back Sunday morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be tired,</v>

2660
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but at least I had a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2661
01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:42.613
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I'm going to fucking </v>

2662
01:54:43.671 --> 01:54:44.890
<v Speaker 1>shoot myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2663
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem with travel.</v>

2664
01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2665
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I read about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2666
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:53.323
<v Speaker 1>an interview with bordain after he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started reading a bunch of shit that </v>

2667
01:54:56.751 --> 01:54:58.540
<v Speaker 1>he had decided.</v>

2668
01:54:58.550 --> 01:55:00.710
<v Speaker 1>It blindsided me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it coming.</v>

2669
01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:04.940
<v Speaker 1>And then after he died I read a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his stuff where he was talking about how</v>

2670
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:06.103
<v Speaker 1>intensely lonely it was when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling and I knew he'd traveled with </v>

2671
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:11.120
<v Speaker 1>people that he cared about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2672
01:55:11.121 --> 01:55:11.954
<v Speaker 1>he traveled with people that he liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think just traveling 250 days a </v>

2673
01:55:15.410 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 1>year period will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2674
01:55:18.081 --> 01:55:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2675
01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that bit at people being </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

2676
01:55:22.131 --> 01:55:24.620
<v Speaker 1>I still don't feel lonely because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>

2677
01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:28.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a connection to home that once I</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate from that,</v>

2678
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:31.010
<v Speaker 1>from home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Philly for my mom,</v>

2679
01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:32.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

2680
01:55:32.391 --> 01:55:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I'm separated from that reality,</v>

2681
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.843
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love having my friends around me and </v>

2682
01:55:39.381 --> 01:55:41.150
<v Speaker 1>it makes it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't fix it.</v>

2683
01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still the sense,</v>

2684
01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:44.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out here alone.</v>

2685
01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:46.730
<v Speaker 1>There's still um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2686
01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:48.300
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2687
01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I can't make any sense out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm technically not alone.</v>

2688
01:55:52.890 --> 01:55:54.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2689
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:55.950
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not home though.</v>

2690
01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:56.813
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read something where you were saying </v>

2691
01:55:58.321 --> 01:56:01.210
<v Speaker 1>that this might be your last tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>forget the physical training.</v>

2697
01:56:13.930 --> 01:56:18.270
<v Speaker 1>My spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the anxiety before I'm leaving.</v>

2698
01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a say you get nervous like three days</v>

<v Speaker 1>explain to someone who doesn't do it </v>

2729
01:57:26.641 --> 01:57:28.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

<v Speaker 3>gross ladies.</v>

2878
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they just need a little,</v>

2879
02:03:32.050 --> 02:03:36.730
<v Speaker 3>a little motivation look like charlene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2880
02:03:37.450 --> 02:03:40.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a tough craft that acting,</v>

2881
02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:41.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>

2882
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:44.890
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those jobs where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2883
02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:47.180
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but very few people can.</v>

2884
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:48.283
<v Speaker 3>And when you do do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such an unbelievably grueling </v>

2885
02:03:53.271 --> 02:03:55.850
<v Speaker 3>grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can only do it for so long.</v>

2886
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:57.680
<v Speaker 3>And if you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2887
02:03:57.681 --> 02:04:01.230
<v Speaker 3>you gotta just a few years in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>window is very short,</v>

2888
02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.030
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're a hot woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2889
02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.033
<v Speaker 3>There's a gang of those 22 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>cupcakes coming up trying to take your </v>

2890

<v Speaker 3>They can cry on cue and they will always</v>

2892
02:04:10.881 --> 02:04:12.200
<v Speaker 3>be coming up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>actors.</v>

2895
02:04:15.321 --> 02:04:16.154
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely making bad parental decisions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sending their kids to Hollywood </v>

2896
02:04:20.690 --> 02:04:22.970
<v Speaker 3>being that's what it is here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a flood of.</v>

2897
02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how often do you spend time out here?</v>

2898
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Pretty often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple times a year.</v>

02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:28.490
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of like close friends out </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2900
02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.650
<v Speaker 3>It's just a strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bizarro world.</v>

2901
02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:35.240
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like Philly is not a show Biz hub?</v>

2902
02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:37.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of great showbiz.</v>

2903
02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:38.063
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart,</v>

2904
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.100
<v Speaker 1>great bands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music,</v>

2905
02:04:40.150 --> 02:04:42.150
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great stuff comes from philly.</v>

2906
02:04:42.151 --> 02:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a showbiz has not.</v>

2907
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're 90 miles from New York,</v>

2908
02:04:46.351 --> 02:04:47.490
<v Speaker 1>so that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2909
02:04:47.530 --> 02:04:50.120
<v Speaker 1>but not close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is a show.</v>

2910
02:04:50.121 --> 02:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Biz Hub of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracts all the weird everywhere.</v>

2911
02:04:53.071 --> 02:04:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every weight is an aspiring actor,</v>

2912
02:04:55.630 --> 02:04:56.463
<v Speaker 1>bartender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bartenders that I still through all the </v>

2913
02:04:59.401 --> 02:05:01.620
<v Speaker 1>times I've been coming here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't wrap my head around that.</v>

2914
02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's in inspiring somebody.</v>

2915
02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>One one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2916
02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:06.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw place.</v>

2917
02:05:07.050 --> 02:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is you get to know,</v>

2918
02:05:08.281 --> 02:05:10.920
<v Speaker 1>like I get to know people when they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

2919
02:05:11.370 --> 02:05:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Your kids become friends with their kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you meet the pain.</v>

2920
02:05:14.631 --> 02:05:17.310
<v Speaker 1>You think the parents are normal and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out now,</v>

2921
02:05:17.630 --> 02:05:18.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were actors that gave it up and </v>

2922
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:24.870
<v Speaker 1>sells fucking computers or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone had this dream.</v>

2923
02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely come out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2924
02:05:26.490 --> 02:05:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I think if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2925
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:29.783
<v Speaker 1>if you just took into account all </v>
<v Speaker 1>showbiz aspirations in southern </v>

2926
02:05:32.881 --> 02:05:34.290
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw it on a map,</v>

2927
02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:35.453
<v Speaker 1>like a little red light would go off </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the show biz aspirations where </v>

2928
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:41.130
<v Speaker 1>it'd be overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

2929
02:05:41.710 --> 02:05:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in places like Philly or Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'm from,</v>

2930
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:46.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't see much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2931
02:05:47.130 --> 02:05:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not anyone with anyone with aspirations.</v>

2932
02:05:50.581 --> 02:05:52.350
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of self contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2933
02:05:52.351 --> 02:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

2934
02:05:53.050 --> 02:05:56.160
<v Speaker 1>they do what's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2935
02:05:57.020 --> 02:05:58.710
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2936
02:05:58.830 --> 02:05:59.663
<v Speaker 1>I've always been intrigued because La </v>
<v Speaker 1>and New York are those places where </v>

2937
02:06:03.991 --> 02:06:07.080
<v Speaker 1>everyone you ask is from there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2938
02:06:07.081 --> 02:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2939
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:08.663
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl walking down the street and </v>

2940
02:06:09.661 --> 02:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan is from Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2941
02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:14.490
<v Speaker 1>She wants to be a model or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2942
02:06:14.610 --> 02:06:15.780
<v Speaker 1>same thing out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2943
02:06:15.781 --> 02:06:16.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from,</v>

2944
02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from where,</v>

2945
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:18.340
<v Speaker 1>like nobody's from here.</v>

2946
02:06:19.110 --> 02:06:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Well not nobody but very few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few.</v>

2947
02:06:22.410 --> 02:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a total transient city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2948
02:06:24.690 --> 02:06:27.870
<v Speaker 1>in New York is a weird one too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I'm in New York I go,</v>

2949
02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I look at all these people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2950
02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:29.933
<v Speaker 1>how do you afford this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just see a small walking down the </v>

2951
02:06:33.841 --> 02:06:34.661
<v Speaker 1>street and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

2952
02:06:34.661 --> 02:06:37.500
<v Speaker 1>a closet here is like five grand a month</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just look.</v>

2953
02:06:38.130 --> 02:06:41.070
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you just walked out of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoe or like a chug.</v>

2954
02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>

2955
02:06:43.530 --> 02:06:44.363
<v Speaker 1>And I've talked to people that lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the nineties and it's still </v>

2956
02:06:46.771 --> 02:06:47.604
<v Speaker 1>live there today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like New York City used to be a </v>

2957
02:06:49.351 --> 02:06:52.500
<v Speaker 1>lot of artists and a lot of like weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2958
02:06:52.501 --> 02:06:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Especially downtown now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all finance people.</v>

2959
02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.233
<v Speaker 1>It's just so gentrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like the New York that </v>

2960
02:06:59.461 --> 02:06:59.941
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2961
02:06:59.941 --> 02:07:02.040
<v Speaker 1>we used to centrify to fund name for </v>
<v Speaker 1>white people.</v>

2962
02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

2963
02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:03.490
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2964
02:07:03.490 --> 02:07:05.740
<v Speaker 1>It's sure it's happening in philly too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

2965
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:06.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why these bum Russia and places that I </v>

<v Speaker 1>people walking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>walking little like it's fucking hard to</v>

2969

2974
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:40.743

<v Speaker 1>It's just people go there for like some </v>

2975
02:07:43.841 --> 02:07:46.750
<v Speaker 1>sort of a professional gig and they run </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of real estate,</v>

2976
02:07:46.751 --> 02:07:48.130
<v Speaker 1>so they just start redoing houses.</v>

02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

2981
02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:55.533
<v Speaker 1>you can't displace poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they just disappear like </v>

2982
02:07:58.331 --> 02:08:00.310
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got to go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2983
02:08:00.311 --> 02:08:02.620
<v Speaker 1>So you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically paying,</v>

2984
02:08:02.650 --> 02:08:06.010
<v Speaker 1>playing tetris with humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like moving.</v>

2991
02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:29.410
<v Speaker 1>You're talking bench die do or die and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now there's like a white guys named chip</v>

2992
02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:30.420
<v Speaker 1>walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2993
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So strange.</v>

2994
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentrification.</v>

2995
02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Just bizarre in general because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2996
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:37.444
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you putting the people that </v>

2997
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:40.480
<v Speaker 1>are leaving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are they going?</v>

2998
02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's responsibilities if you like,</v>

2999
02:08:43.001 --> 02:08:43.834
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to buy a building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you supposed to think about the </v>

3000
02:08:45.521 --> 02:08:46.354
<v Speaker 1>people that are poor that are there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's supposed to think about your money </v>

3001
02:08:48.041 --> 02:08:51.580
<v Speaker 1>that you're buying the building for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that want to do it have to be cut</v>

3002
02:08:51.581 --> 02:08:54.250
<v Speaker 1>from a different cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut from.</v>

3003
02:08:54.251 --> 02:08:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that.</v>

3004
02:08:56.231 --> 02:09:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Just displaced people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you have to.</v>

3005
02:09:01.190 --> 02:09:05.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a cutthroat mentality that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed and edits needed in the um,</v>

3006
02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:10.570
<v Speaker 1>the music and entertainment industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't have and it's probably held</v>

3007
02:09:10.571 --> 02:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>me back by being just like a good guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3008
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't.</v>

3009
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in what way,</v>

3010
02:09:16.041 --> 02:09:18.580
<v Speaker 1>what should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you have done that would have</v>

3011
02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:21.230
<v Speaker 1>propelled you further?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3012
02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:24.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as far as like,</v>

3013
02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:26.950
<v Speaker 1>as far as being more popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3014
02:09:26.951 --> 02:09:28.690
<v Speaker 1>but decisions I've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>

3015
02:09:29.110 --> 02:09:30.370
<v Speaker 1>when you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3016
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:32.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would pay for your buddies to come,</v>

3017
02:09:33.190 --> 02:09:34.023
<v Speaker 1>and I do too.</v>

3018
02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Now if we had like a financial advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

3019
02:09:38.681 --> 02:09:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you two are morons for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would tell them these wrong.</v>

3020
02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll be performing better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it'd be better.</v>

3021
02:09:45.041 --> 02:09:50.041
<v Speaker 1>Shows like my lawyer is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the worst client ever.</v>

3022
02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:55.330
<v Speaker 1>You pay everyone you'll pay them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you pay them to handsomely.</v>

3023
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Fuck everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3024
02:09:57.611 --> 02:09:58.444
<v Speaker 1>Yo man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know if that helps you get </v>

3025
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:03.160
<v Speaker 1>by the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that really advances you.</v>

3026
02:10:03.190 --> 02:10:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have that mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that really advances you.</v>

3027
02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I think what advances you is great work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what is fair?</v>

3028
02:10:09.730 --> 02:10:10.563
<v Speaker 1>What does it take to make great work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's got to be a certain </v>

3029
02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:13.504
<v Speaker 1>amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a certain amount of </v>

3030
02:10:14.681 --> 02:10:16.780
<v Speaker 1>chaos but also a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace.</v>

3031
02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:17.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3032
02:10:17.531 --> 02:10:18.364
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get those from the decisions that </v>

3033
02:10:20.861 --> 02:10:21.694
<v Speaker 1>you've made that I've made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately get made them because that's </v>

3034
02:10:25.001 --> 02:10:25.834
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>

3035
02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:27.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think in order for me to have </v>

3036
02:10:31.061 --> 02:10:31.894
<v Speaker 1>altered who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would have had to live with that </v>

3037
02:10:34.161 --> 02:10:35.330
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3038
02:10:35.670 --> 02:10:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to not be who I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if I,</v>

3039
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:39.163
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to do the success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it mean anything to me if I got </v>

3040
02:10:43.491 --> 02:10:44.324
<v Speaker 1>there by not being me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta live with that and that's </v>

3041
02:10:47.661 --> 02:10:51.350
<v Speaker 1>worse than not succeeding to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about other people.</v>

3042
02:10:51.351 --> 02:10:52.184
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just fake it and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not who they are and they're okay with </v>

3043
02:10:55.311 --> 02:10:58.550
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it comes with success in order for me</v>

3044
02:10:58.551 --> 02:11:03.080
<v Speaker 1>to shift who I am inherently my fiber of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my being,</v>

3045
02:11:03.081 --> 02:11:05.180
<v Speaker 1>the way that I was raised to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3046
02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:10.660
<v Speaker 1>if I had to shift that and have success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the success wouldn't be success to me.</v>

3047
02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>It won't be on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not business is just so strange.</v>

3048
02:11:15.650 --> 02:11:16.483
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how you feel about </v>

3049
02:11:18.411 --> 02:11:19.244
<v Speaker 1>mumble rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mumble rap is one of the weirdest </v>

3050
02:11:21.201 --> 02:11:21.710
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>

3051
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused.</v>

3052
02:11:23.241 --> 02:11:25.970
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre what is happening.</v>

3053
02:11:26.090 --> 02:11:26.923
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I feel like I don't want to </v>

3054
02:11:29.391 --> 02:11:33.680
<v Speaker 1>be that dude who doesn't get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3055
02:11:33.681 --> 02:11:34.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3056
02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3057
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:37.183
<v Speaker 1>But when you start dealing with youth </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and when I was the age of these </v>

3058
02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:44.140
<v Speaker 1>mumble rap kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were older heads saying,</v>

3059
02:11:44.141 --> 02:11:45.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3060
02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:45.690
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3061
02:11:45.690 --> 02:11:50.180
<v Speaker 1>the generation before roster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cold crush brothers to the big daddy</v>

3062
02:11:50.181 --> 02:11:51.014
<v Speaker 1>kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they probably thought what we were </v>

3063
02:11:51.561 --> 02:11:53.870
<v Speaker 1>doing was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that what's happening?</v>

3064
02:11:53.871 --> 02:11:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe everyone's like,</v>

3065
02:11:55.251 --> 02:11:56.880
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>

3066
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to the point where me,</v>

3067
02:11:59.121 --> 02:11:59.871
<v Speaker 1>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

3068
02:11:59.871 --> 02:12:01.400
<v Speaker 1>is that even a genre of rap?</v>

3069
02:12:02.150 --> 02:12:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Like I almost look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't.</v>

3070
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't have a problem with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't process it.</v>

3071
02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Is anything close to what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like if you said,</v>

3072
02:12:11.481 --> 02:12:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about Edm?</v>

3073
02:12:12.831 --> 02:12:13.281
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3074
02:12:13.281 --> 02:12:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's all right.</v>

3075
02:12:14.561 --> 02:12:15.490
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3076
02:12:15.550 --> 02:12:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't even look at it like I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to that.</v>

3077
02:12:18.261 --> 02:12:19.094
<v Speaker 1>And then let him hear big daddy Kane and</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's the same thing when we were </v>

3078
02:12:21.351 --> 02:12:22.880
<v Speaker 1>kids listening to music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3079
02:12:22.881 --> 02:12:26.600
<v Speaker 1>If you were listening to something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you enjoyed,</v>

3080
02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:30.290
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you loved was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>good lyrics of course,</v>

3081
02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.300
<v Speaker 1>and when you can't understand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying.</v>

3082
02:12:32.301 --> 02:12:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

3083
02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:36.920
<v Speaker 1>it's just so driven by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's like phrase driven,</v>

3084
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:40.040
<v Speaker 1>they just say whatever the learning over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again.</v>

3085
02:12:40.041 --> 02:12:40.874
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's just because these </v>

3086
02:12:41.901 --> 02:12:42.734
<v Speaker 1>kids are doing my alley or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just in the zone is a drug </v>

3087
02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:47.110
<v Speaker 1>culture because that's happened before </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday.</v>

3088
02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:49.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing creates the other.</v>

3089
02:12:49.341 --> 02:12:50.174
<v Speaker 1>It's like chicken or the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are these kids doing molly and make </v>

3090
02:12:51.981 --> 02:12:55.880
<v Speaker 1>mumble rap or they don't mumble rap and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat molly and it's all,</v>

3091
02:12:55.881 --> 02:12:56.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3092
02:12:56.630 --> 02:12:57.463
<v Speaker 1>the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you going back to the fifties and </v>

3093
02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:04.430
<v Speaker 1>beatniks in that scene and jazz and </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin and w w what created it,</v>

3094
02:13:04.431 --> 02:13:05.264
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That miles and Coltrane make some of </v>

3095
02:13:06.771 --> 02:13:10.160
<v Speaker 1>those records because they were on </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin or vice versa.</v>

3096
02:13:10.161 --> 02:13:13.850
<v Speaker 1>And it's happened historically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this just a drug driven culture?</v>

3097
02:13:13.851 --> 02:13:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3098
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm detached.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3099
02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm detaching and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3100
02:13:20.031 --> 02:13:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a kid who grew up,</v>

3101
02:13:21.610 --> 02:13:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to metal and stuff like that.</v>

3102
02:13:23.841 --> 02:13:24.740
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3103
02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not at a shortage for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen to slayer,</v>

3104
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll just listen to slayer before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to that.</v>

3105
02:13:30.021 --> 02:13:32.640
<v Speaker 1>If that's my only option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll listen to slayer.</v>

3106
02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listen to black flag,</v>

3107
02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen to minor threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'll do it.</v>

3108
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether I,</v>

3109
02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:43.193
<v Speaker 1>however I feel about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes irrelevant when you realize </v>

3110
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:48.780
<v Speaker 1>that you have so much good shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3111
02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:51.780
<v Speaker 1>So I don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like with film,</v>

3112
02:13:51.781 --> 02:13:54.650
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not worried about a bad movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just watched the dope movie.</v>

3113
02:13:55.090 --> 02:13:57.330
<v Speaker 1>There's so many movies and just throwing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them away.</v>

3114
02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

3115
02:13:59.671 --> 02:14:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just listen to thin lizzy if I,</v>

3116
02:14:01.951 --> 02:14:05.520
<v Speaker 1>if I don't feel like adjusting to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3117
02:14:05.521 --> 02:14:06.354
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's other things that we might </v>

3118
02:14:07.711 --> 02:14:09.630
<v Speaker 1>not get because we're not doing what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to do.</v>

3119
02:14:09.631 --> 02:14:10.464
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it really were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a bar of the clubs five nights a </v>

3120
02:14:12.211 --> 02:14:15.350
<v Speaker 1>week and you weren't married with kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were hired.</v>

3121
02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it sounds different right at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and place.</v>

3122
02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:19.253
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you hear certain songs and </v>

3123
02:14:20.581 --> 02:14:22.230
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not listening to my car.</v>

3124
02:14:22.231 --> 02:14:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm rolling the windows up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone sees this,</v>

3125
02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:25.463
<v Speaker 1>but maybe hit it affects them </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently in a live environment and </v>

3126
02:14:27.481 --> 02:14:28.021
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3127
02:14:28.021 --> 02:14:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing devil's advocate just just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3128
02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just a strange trend where it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of mumbling.</v>

3129
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is.</v>

3130
02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're on about cough</v>
<v Speaker 1>syrup.</v>

3131
02:14:36.690 --> 02:14:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just lean and I.</v>

3132
02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:43.550
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drug culture created that I think a</v>

3133
02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:44.910
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine who's a real estate </v>
<v Speaker 1>agent,</v>

3134
02:14:45.250 --> 02:14:48.240
<v Speaker 1>a mumble rapper was working in the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's like,</v>

3135
02:14:48.241 --> 02:14:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I literally had no idea what the fuck he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying.</v>

3136
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking to him and him talking as a</v>

3137
02:14:53.281 --> 02:14:57.940
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As my momma just momma see.</v>

3138
02:14:58.070 --> 02:15:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like that style on when</v>

3139
02:15:01.711 --> 02:15:03.960
<v Speaker 1>they arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe was just this one,</v>

3140
02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.290
<v Speaker 1>which she was showing them this dope </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and he's mumbling up a storm.</v>

3141
02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:08.453
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like asking her for Jacuzzi and </v>

3142
02:15:10.771 --> 02:15:13.210
<v Speaker 1>she thinks she's ordering a pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I mean.</v>

3143
02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3144
02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:15.203
<v Speaker 1>I love listening to Nas and I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to public enemy and clean </v>

3145
02:15:19.831 --> 02:15:23.070
<v Speaker 1>lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then had had a hit to them.</v>

3146
02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Karen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One big daddy can.</v>

3147
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:27.163
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3148
02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:29.560
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the police.</v>

3149
02:15:30.130 --> 02:15:32.220
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something to it though,</v>

3150
02:15:32.221 --> 02:15:33.054
<v Speaker 1>that you knew that they were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a message across along with the </v>

3151
02:15:36.661 --> 02:15:38.760
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something cool about it.</v>

3152
02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3153
02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe these kids think you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do both in our era was different.</v>

3154
02:15:45.031 --> 02:15:48.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like if people could dance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>public enemy and they were talking about</v>

3155
02:15:48.151 --> 02:15:52.150
<v Speaker 1>what was going on and urban community </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3156
02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:53.450
<v Speaker 1>that Arab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could.</v>

3157
02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:55.860
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were boogie down production,</v>

3158
02:15:55.861 --> 02:15:56.694
<v Speaker 1>krs records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could dance the sounds of the </v>

3159
02:15:58.051 --> 02:15:59.970
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You out of here,</v>

3160
02:15:59.971 --> 02:16:00.804
<v Speaker 1>you could dance.</v>

3161
02:16:01.230 --> 02:16:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a disconnect with these kids.</v>

3162
02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:08.790
<v Speaker 1>They don't think you can say something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have people dance or whatever.</v>

3163
02:16:08.971 --> 02:16:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what these fucking Momma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker just slobber on the corner.</v>

3164
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:13.711
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3165
02:16:13.711 --> 02:16:15.360
<v Speaker 1>they all have to have tattoos on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

3166
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:20.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like another mockery that tattoo </v>
<v Speaker 1>settled down.</v>

3167
02:16:20.791 --> 02:16:21.361
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3168
02:16:21.361 --> 02:16:22.194
<v Speaker 1>they don't come off right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think these kids think they can </v>

3169
02:16:25.501 --> 02:16:27.480
<v Speaker 1>come off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they care.</v>

3170
02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think they care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're thinking.</v>

3171
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck culture.</v>

3172
02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:34.073
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're not trying to get cool shit </v>

3173
02:16:35.831 --> 02:16:37.930
<v Speaker 1>on their face that trying to get like </v>
<v Speaker 1>scribbles.</v>

3174
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the drawing,</v>

3175
02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:44.500
<v Speaker 1>the face of the drunk aided the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they all look like,</v>

3176
02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:46.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all look like that with pink </v>

3177
02:16:47.801 --> 02:16:48.634
<v Speaker 1>dreads.</v>

3178
02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:51.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of rap music that slip </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the cracks too.</v>

3179
02:16:51.821 --> 02:16:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people forget about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gangstarr.</v>

3180
02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the greatest groups ever.</v>

3181
02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:56.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3182
02:16:56.861 --> 02:16:58.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3183
02:16:58.810 --> 02:17:02.380
<v Speaker 1>it becomes the responsibility of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture to uphold that.</v>

3184
02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone like Mitch Hedberg who</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed away young,</v>

3185
02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:07.310
<v Speaker 1>someone like Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>

3186
02:17:07.710 --> 02:17:08.543
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3187
02:17:08.710 --> 02:17:12.370
<v Speaker 1>the comedic community is their </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that those guys don't get</v>

3188
02:17:12.371 --> 02:17:14.530
<v Speaker 1>forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with hip hop.</v>

3189
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:19.240
<v Speaker 1>It's my responsibility to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gangstarr interviews.</v>

3190
02:17:19.241 --> 02:17:20.930
<v Speaker 1>So the 16 year old kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3191
02:17:20.931 --> 02:17:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my responsibility to say,</v>

3192
02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:29.010
<v Speaker 1>talk about Big Daddy Kane and Kool g rap</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these dudes so people can call g rap</v>

3193
02:17:29.021 --> 02:17:32.050
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people forget about is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest of all time.</v>

3194
02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the greatest for sure I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to so much of his shit.</v>

3195
02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:36.913
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the best ever cock blocking just </v>

3196
02:17:40.330 --> 02:17:43.860
<v Speaker 1>ignorance at its finest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott says,</v>

3197
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:45.163
<v Speaker 1>guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3198
02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:50.640
<v Speaker 1>stand up and wipe his dick on your curt </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be the best rap lyrical wall time,</v>

3199
02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:55.630
<v Speaker 1>but people forgot about Kool g rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you thinking about like Hex,</v>

3200
02:17:55.631 --> 02:17:58.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was 33 and that was like 93.</v>

3201
02:17:58.510 --> 02:18:00.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's young kids that love comedy that</v>

3202
02:18:00.731 --> 02:18:01.564
<v Speaker 1>don't know about billing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he influenced my life because </v>

3203
02:18:04.210 --> 02:18:07.480
<v Speaker 1>towards the end he was doing more social</v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary than anything.</v>

3204
02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:10.390
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even that funny.</v>

3205
02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:11.353
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just like he was expanding his </v>

3206
02:18:13.841 --> 02:18:16.040
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He felt like talking about it and,</v>

3207
02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:17.730
<v Speaker 1>and Hedberg was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3208
02:18:18.410 --> 02:18:19.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3209
02:18:19.130 --> 02:18:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it's our responsibility to carry the </v>
<v Speaker 1>torch of,</v>

3210
02:18:21.741 --> 02:18:24.470
<v Speaker 1>of all these people that were great </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds that left too soon.</v>

3211
02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:27.220
<v Speaker 1>What Bourdain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to forget about that</v>

3212
02:18:27.221 --> 02:18:27.670
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

3213
02:18:27.670 --> 02:18:29.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You special.</v>

3214
02:18:29.530 --> 02:18:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily we have a lot of shows to watch.</v>

3215
02:18:31.781 --> 02:18:32.614
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His show was so unique too because of </v>

3216
02:18:34.241 --> 02:18:36.230
<v Speaker 1>his narration was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

3217
02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3218
02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:42.580
<v Speaker 1>the newest one with a w Kamau bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't watched that yet,</v>

3219
02:18:42.581 --> 02:18:46.150
<v Speaker 1>but it apparently is the last one where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he does narration.</v>

3220
02:18:46.210 --> 02:18:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3221
02:18:46.690 --> 02:18:50.290
<v Speaker 1>And then all the other ones for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>season was after he died.</v>

3222
02:18:50.470 --> 02:18:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Someone else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3223
02:18:51.311 --> 02:18:51.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3224
02:18:51.971 --> 02:18:53.800
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to do any narration.</v>

3225
02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:57.460
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the show play itself out.</v>

3226
02:18:57.500 --> 02:18:58.333
<v Speaker 1>Just be what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do it I guess somehow </v>

3227
02:18:59.771 --> 02:19:01.600
<v Speaker 1>with editing and they're going to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

3228
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:04.030
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough man.</v>

3229
02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Another punk rock guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3230
02:19:06.341 --> 02:19:08.260
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy went in the hall,</v>

3231
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went hold Jay.</v>

3232
02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:11.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at him from 2014 and then </v>

3233
02:19:14.741 --> 02:19:15.574
<v Speaker 1>look at him for 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he lived several decades inside of </v>

3234
02:19:19.271 --> 02:19:22.690
<v Speaker 1>a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went hard.</v>

3235
02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I recommend it,</v>

3236
02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:28.120
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

3237
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:30.050
<v Speaker 2>he said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3238
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:31.093
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should treat life like treat your </v>

3239
02:19:32.631 --> 02:19:35.540
<v Speaker 2>body like it's an amusement park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

3240
02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

3241
02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's something that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all we all have in common with all these</v>

3242
02:19:41.721 --> 02:19:44.540
<v Speaker 2>artists is that there's an understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have,</v>

3243
02:19:44.541 --> 02:19:45.374
<v Speaker 2>that they're all living this w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w we nonstandard way of getting through </v>

3244
02:19:51.621 --> 02:19:56.621
<v Speaker 2>this life that they're all living this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this strange,</v>

3245
02:19:56.721 --> 02:20:01.280
<v Speaker 2>chaotic way and creating these amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things through these strange,</v>

3246
02:20:01.281 --> 02:20:05.350
<v Speaker 2>chaotic existence and we all cling to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and celebrate it and,</v>

3247
02:20:05.351 --> 02:20:06.320
<v Speaker 2>and look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3248
02:20:06.321 --> 02:20:09.530
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Henry Rollins who travels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hit,</v>

3249
02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:10.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his crazy thing.</v>

3250
02:20:10.581 --> 02:20:11.414
<v Speaker 2>He said as a pick a spot on the map and </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel and stay there for a couple of </v>

3251
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:14.563
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't even know anybody that goes </v>

3252
02:20:15.921 --> 02:20:16.754
<v Speaker 2>there or whether it's Bordain who would </v>
<v Speaker 2>make these shows about it or whether </v>

3253
02:20:19.641 --> 02:20:22.790
<v Speaker 2>it's musicians or comedians or anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>who does these things.</v>

3254
02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:23.923
<v Speaker 2>It's like we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I take comfort in the fact that </v>

3255
02:20:26.181 --> 02:20:27.014
<v Speaker 2>there's guys like you out there and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's not trying to be some </v>

3256
02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:32.513
<v Speaker 2>cardigan wearing button down fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive who's just trying to not </v>

3257
02:20:37.641 --> 02:20:41.570
<v Speaker 2>have people mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was trying to say the things that you</v>

3258
02:20:41.571 --> 02:20:42.404
<v Speaker 2>think you're supposed to say so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody likes you and then before you </v>

3259
02:20:44.571 --> 02:20:45.404
<v Speaker 2>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>

3260
02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:47.570
<v Speaker 2>There's no rebellion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3261
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:52.020
<v Speaker 2>no personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real objective opinions on things and</v>

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:10.313
<v Speaker 1>If I don't know what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I have to explore everything I can </v>

3271
02:21:13.921 --> 02:21:16.410
<v Speaker 1>to try to figure out what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3272
02:21:16.770 --> 02:21:20.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way to learn is to,</v>

3273
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:21.583
<v Speaker 1>to live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say I don't know what I'm doing and </v>

3274
02:21:23.101 --> 02:21:23.934
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then live in a bubble is the </v>

3275
02:21:25.621 --> 02:21:27.030
<v Speaker 1>antithesis of how to fix that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>living in these different alternative </v>

3279
02:21:38.461 --> 02:21:39.294
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing they do is they send a </v>

3280
02:21:40.351 --> 02:21:43.590
<v Speaker 2>signal to that kid who's sitting in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>room right now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

3288
02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:06.153
<v Speaker 2>The system that they have set up for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go through this bullshit </v>

3289
02:22:08.831 --> 02:22:10.600
<v Speaker 2>education process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then next thing you know,</v>

02:22:10.601 --> 02:22:15.250
<v Speaker 2>you're in some fucking factory job or </v>
<v Speaker 2>some nonsense cubicle that is not good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>think what we learned in high school and</v>

3296
02:22:27.031 --> 02:22:29.400
<v Speaker 1>how it applies to our life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost nothing,</v>

3297
02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:30.540
<v Speaker 1>nothing was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3298

<v Speaker 1>with not giving you driving and,</v>

3299
02:22:34.700 --> 02:22:38.070

<v Speaker 1>terrible for you or this is filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals or this is information that </v>

3351
02:24:39.811 --> 02:24:44.811
<v Speaker 1>of the straight and narrow structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that most people follow that's available</v>

3352
02:24:45.331 --> 02:24:46.470
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have to.</v>

3353
02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:48.900
<v Speaker 1>They have to have more examples of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3354
02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:49.813
<v Speaker 1>it's example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people like us are examples and they </v>

3355

<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3358
02:24:57.870 --> 02:25:00.120
<v Speaker 1>to do it and you have to be able to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at things,</v>

3359
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:02.700
<v Speaker 1>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that aren't of course,</v>

3360

3363
02:25:10.051 --> 02:25:10.884
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you start doing that and </v>

3364
02:25:12.601 --> 02:25:15.480
<v Speaker 1>saying maybe this is me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is me,</v>

3365
02:25:15.481 --> 02:25:18.630
<v Speaker 1>and if I change this and you see instant</v>

<v Speaker 1>I wrote my first rhyme at nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like the worst thing ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3445
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:59.623
<v Speaker 1>I have to answer it because it is what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and I made a lot of money and I'm </v>

3446
02:29:02.961 --> 02:29:03.360
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

3447
02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:05.090
<v Speaker 1>My mom's good because of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3448
02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:09.500
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like the day that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that,</v>

3449
02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:10.640
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3450
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:13.190
<v Speaker 1>that may be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3451
02:29:13.191 --> 02:29:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the philosophy when a,</v>

3452
02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:17.800
<v Speaker 1>when a fight is thinking of retirement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means there were two,</v>

3453
02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:21.290
<v Speaker 1>they're already retired and I am sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>applying that logic.</v>

3454
02:29:21.291 --> 02:29:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the second I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

3455
02:29:23.181 --> 02:29:23.961
<v Speaker 1>this is my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3456
02:29:23.961 --> 02:29:27.500
<v Speaker 1>I could play for 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids in a festival in Switzerland.</v>

3457
02:29:27.501 --> 02:29:28.334
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still standing on a piece of </v>

3458
02:29:29.631 --> 02:29:30.464
<v Speaker 1>garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3459
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:33.800
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of like withdrawing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a driving thing with me,</v>

3460
02:29:33.801 --> 02:29:35.180
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>

3461
02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:36.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically rapids just been so ego </v>

3462
02:29:38.351 --> 02:29:39.640
<v Speaker 1>driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the bad stuff.</v>

3463
02:29:39.930 --> 02:29:41.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the cornerstone of it when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan.</v>

3464
02:29:41.641 --> 02:29:44.570
<v Speaker 1>But some people carry themselves like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in real life,</v>

3465
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:47.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to be that man.</v>

3466
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:50.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm so,</v>

3467
02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:52.273
<v Speaker 1>I'm so scared of someone ever thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that humility isn't the most important </v>

3468
02:29:57.141 --> 02:29:57.974
<v Speaker 1>thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And being polite is the most important </v>

3469
02:29:59.991 --> 02:30:00.860
<v Speaker 1>thing to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3470
02:30:00.861 --> 02:30:01.694
<v Speaker 1>And it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not really how people are in </v>

3471
02:30:03.561 --> 02:30:05.060
<v Speaker 1>this game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3472
02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:05.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3473
02:30:05.470 --> 02:30:07.950
<v Speaker 1>and not just a wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the entertainment business and they</v>

3474
02:30:07.951 --> 02:30:10.130
<v Speaker 1>don't meet an actor who's addicted like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

3475
02:30:10.131 --> 02:30:11.420
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get paid to act.</v>

3476
02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:13.280

<v Speaker 1>that's a blessing.</v>

3477
02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.590
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of that?</v>

3481
02:30:22.461 --> 02:30:24.280
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is what I do.</v>

02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:48.073
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3561
02:33:49.170 --> 02:33:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I just sit there with a beat blasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sit there.</v>

3562
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it come.</v>

3563
02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:56.550
<v Speaker 6>One Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one bar,</v>

3564
02:33:56.640 --> 02:33:57.420
<v Speaker 6>one bar</v>

3565
02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:58.253
<v Speaker 1>until it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you have like a raw beet with no </v>

3566
02:34:00.091 --> 02:34:01.550
<v Speaker 1>lyrics and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3567
02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:04.690
<v Speaker 1>So who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who makes a beat for your first um,</v>

3568
02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:06.113
<v Speaker 1>that I worked with a lot of producers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when those send them and when I love </v>

3569
02:34:08.971 --> 02:34:10.050
<v Speaker 1>something I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3570
02:34:10.051 --> 02:34:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to work on this tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3571
02:34:11.310 --> 02:34:12.143
<v Speaker 1>so you get the beat and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you sit and listen to it and </v>

3572
02:34:14.611 --> 02:34:17.150
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3573
02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:18.273
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the hardest thing for me as the </v>

3574
02:34:20.891 --> 02:34:22.900
<v Speaker 1>first line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the hardest thing,</v>

3575
02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the authors say this exactly,</v>

3576
02:34:26.180 --> 02:34:27.290
<v Speaker 1>he hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

3577
02:34:27.291 --> 02:34:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first joke probably hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything goes off of that,</v>

3578
02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's that,</v>

3579
02:34:32.970 --> 02:34:35.840
<v Speaker 1>that line is super hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3580
02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:38.120
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3581
02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I love being in the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

3582
02:34:41.350 --> 02:34:43.600
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I would be,</v>

3583
02:34:43.650 --> 02:34:44.483
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately because when we were kids </v>

3584
02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:48.460
<v Speaker 1>records sold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3585
02:34:48.850 --> 02:34:50.440
<v Speaker 1>So you could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a tour,</v>

3586
02:34:50.441 --> 02:34:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the,</v>

3587
02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:53.950
<v Speaker 1>were the Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sold fucking $100,000,000</v>

3588
02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:56.500
<v Speaker 1>because we don't have to tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just decided they didn't want a toy</v>

3589
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:59.680
<v Speaker 1>at 67 and they never did again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3590
02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:00.910
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3591
02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:01.773
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is generated monetarily </v>

3592
02:35:04.631 --> 02:35:06.190
<v Speaker 1>through touring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>merge,</v>

3593
02:35:06.490 --> 02:35:07.323
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the grind is there and I </v>

3594
02:35:09.610 --> 02:35:12.990
<v Speaker 1>don't like to feel like my hand is </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced ever because that,</v>

3595
02:35:13.090 --> 02:35:15.520
<v Speaker 1>that's when it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that square world.</v>

3596
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.903
<v Speaker 1>And I never want to feel like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligated to do something and that can </v>

3597
02:35:19.931 --> 02:35:23.410
<v Speaker 1>be some of my animosity towards Tori.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3598
02:35:23.411 --> 02:35:23.801
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3599
02:35:23.801 --> 02:35:26.110
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you have to do,</v>

3600
02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out this many days.</v>

3601
02:35:28.361 --> 02:35:29.250
<v Speaker 1>That's just this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3602
02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:30.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just uh,</v>

3603
02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:32.800
<v Speaker 1>it just fries my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3604
02:35:32.801 --> 02:35:33.634
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know obviously all this shit takes a </v>

3605
02:35:36.041 --> 02:35:36.874
<v Speaker 1>physical toll on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it fries my brain where I'm like </v>

3606
02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:42.130
<v Speaker 1>just completely zonked.</v>

3607
02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a walking through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never know.</v>

3622
02:36:20.081 --> 02:36:21.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3623
02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:26.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a perception that it isn't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not the work that they do.</v>

3624
02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:32.030

<v Speaker 1>spiral Ryan Book for you for all my </v>

3632
02:36:54.941 --> 02:36:55.774
<v Speaker 1>adult life.</v>

3633
02:36:56.921 --> 02:36:57.754
<v Speaker 1>read my hand writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write like a graffiti writer and I'd </v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a note thing on the computer.</v>

3648
02:37:39.111 --> 02:37:42.320
<v Speaker 1>week and go into the recording every </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thursday.</v>

3649
02:37:42.350 --> 02:37:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Only started when I stopped the heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>

3650
02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Like everything changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything changed because you,</v>

3651
02:37:49.941 --> 02:37:50.774
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be creative when </v>

3652
02:37:51.741 --> 02:37:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you're hungover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to,</v>

3661
02:38:16.491 --> 02:38:20.360
<v Speaker 1>opening up or you can make money from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual music itself because it,</v>

3662
02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:21.273
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the last couple of decades </v>

3663
02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:26.870

<v Speaker 1>get the streaming companies because </v>

3668
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:41.990
<v Speaker 1>they're giving you a pittance.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you distribute other people's art.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't really have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pay them.</v>

3675
02:38:55.340 --> 02:38:57.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't pay them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make all the money.</v>

3676
02:38:57.220 --> 02:38:59.570
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to save pennies on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar.</v>

3677
02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exaggerating.</v>

3678
02:39:01.290 --> 02:39:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3679
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if either one of you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the tweet from um,</v>

3680
02:39:10.010 --> 02:39:13.370
<v Speaker 1>a crosby from crosby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stills and Nash.</v>

3681
02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:14.533
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a break down of what he got </v>

3682
02:39:18.141 --> 02:39:19.000
<v Speaker 1>paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3683
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:24.070
<v Speaker 1>how huge those records were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like $55 or something for,</v>

3684
02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:29.260
<v Speaker 1>for like $200 million streams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Peter Frampton responded to him</v>

3685
02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:31.970
<v Speaker 1>with another screenshot and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's mine.</v>

3686
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And I have one of the biggest records </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

3687
02:39:33.831 --> 02:39:34.664
<v Speaker 1>Peter Frampton comes alive and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back and forth and like people in </v>

3688
02:39:37.821 --> 02:39:41.570
<v Speaker 1>the industry will re tweeting it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are guys sure,</v>

3689
02:39:41.930 --> 02:39:42.763
<v Speaker 1>a older and be richer than we can ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine and it's important for people </v>

3690
02:39:46.851 --> 02:39:47.920
<v Speaker 1>like them to speak up.</v>

3691
02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Like was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I repeat the streamers,</v>

3692
02:39:51.531 --> 02:39:56.480
<v Speaker 1>don't pay us for the damned music that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we made in all caps.</v>

3693
02:39:56.630 --> 02:40:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Don't pay us this David Crosby and a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweets that are similar.</v>

3694
02:40:01.710 --> 02:40:02.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one with the actual numbers and </v>

3695
02:40:03.961 --> 02:40:04.461
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3696
02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's stunning and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how they're getting away with</v>

3697
02:40:08.811 --> 02:40:09.644
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>

3698
02:40:09.650 --> 02:40:12.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't either and I'm not powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to do that.</v>

3699
02:40:12.411 --> 02:40:13.244
<v Speaker 1>That's why I do like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at one point Taylor swift pulled </v>

3700
02:40:15.961 --> 02:40:19.140
<v Speaker 1>all our shit and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great because she's huge.</v>

3701
02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:21.540
<v Speaker 1>That's an important statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3702
02:40:21.541 --> 02:40:22.374
<v Speaker 1>It's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you guys weren't getting paid </v>

3703
02:40:25.230 --> 02:40:26.063
<v Speaker 1>correctly from a streaming service for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you stand up and someone like Eddie </v>

3704
02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Murphy spoke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's important.</v>

3705
02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:34.273
<v Speaker 1>A fucking a hack and Schenectady </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting about it won't let them put my </v>

3706
02:40:38.971 --> 02:40:42.390
<v Speaker 1>podcast on the and they've been trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it for years and I'm saying,</v>

3707
02:40:42.391 --> 02:40:42.780
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3708
02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

3709
02:40:43.470 --> 02:40:45.280
<v Speaker 1>what do I get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3710
02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:46.630
<v Speaker 1>it's just another way for people to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3711
02:40:46.631 --> 02:40:47.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are </v>

3712
02:40:47.881 --> 02:40:48.714
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are already listening to that </v>

3713
02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:53.910
<v Speaker 1>shit happens to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you do this?</v>

3714
02:40:53.911 --> 02:40:55.740
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're blown away that you say no.</v>

3715
02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think your punk rock,</v>

3716
02:40:57.990 --> 02:41:00.210
<v Speaker 1>whether you do it not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just say fuck you.</v>

3717
02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Well I just understand what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

3718
02:41:02.431 --> 02:41:03.264
<v Speaker 1>They're thieves and they want to put ads</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it and they in the most recent thing </v>

3719
02:41:06.601 --> 02:41:07.434
<v Speaker 1>is that they'll give you some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like now compared to what you're </v>

3720
02:41:09.991 --> 02:41:11.820
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

3721
02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:14.750
<v Speaker 1>All you have is other people's work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3722
02:41:14.940 --> 02:41:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have a,</v>

3723
02:41:16.530 --> 02:41:18.480
<v Speaker 1>a bus station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3724
02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for p.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've built your own everything,</v>

3725
02:41:22.850 --> 02:41:24.240
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own entity.</v>

3726
02:41:24.990 --> 02:41:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I've done the same thing on a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>level where we're,</v>

3727
02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:29.370
<v Speaker 1>we're outliers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

3728
02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Like some people really need that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

3729
02:41:32.190 --> 02:41:33.023
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they get stuck in the system </v>

3730
02:41:34.681 --> 02:41:35.514
<v Speaker 1>and then even worse they become a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of some sort of a network where they </v>

3731
02:41:37.771 --> 02:41:38.604
<v Speaker 1>have a bunch of executives telling them </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do is sign those major label </v>

3732
02:41:42.151 --> 02:41:45.270
<v Speaker 1>deals that are in the videos with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jewelry and shit.</v>

3733
02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:48.480
<v Speaker 1>None of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either fake,</v>

3734
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:50.300
<v Speaker 1>it's rented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those cars are rented.</v>

3735
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:53.640
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still living in the projects and</v>

3736
02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:56.580
<v Speaker 1>then they're in those videos with land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3737
02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:57.663
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like perceptions become reality </v>

3738
02:42:00.151 --> 02:42:02.400
<v Speaker 1>through social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people think like,</v>

3739
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:03.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a rented car and ran the </v>

3740
02:42:05.971 --> 02:42:07.980
<v Speaker 1>jewelry on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're worth this.</v>

3741
02:42:07.981 --> 02:42:08.521
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

3742
02:42:08.521 --> 02:42:10.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't know the fuckery that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that label over them.</v>

3743
02:42:11.220 --> 02:42:13.580
<v Speaker 1>He's got a three 60 deal they've taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>is merge.</v>

3744
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:15.420
<v Speaker 1>They're taking this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's crazy.</v>

3745
02:42:15.421 --> 02:42:20.421
<v Speaker 1>Did it take your merge and your ticket </v>
<v Speaker 1>sales company that doesn't have anything</v>

3746
02:42:21.661 --> 02:42:25.600
<v Speaker 1>to do with you performing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take a piece of you performed this?</v>

3747
02:42:25.890 --> 02:42:26.723
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these things that like things are </v>

3748
02:42:28.711 --> 02:42:30.120
<v Speaker 1>offered to me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo man,</v>

3749
02:42:30.121 --> 02:42:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I spent my entire life building this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3750
02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:39.020
<v Speaker 1>you want a piece of the pie that I baked</v>
<v Speaker 1>for no reason I'll share with anybody,</v>

3751
02:42:39.841 --> 02:42:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but what's the reason for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to be offering something,</v>

3752
02:42:43.310 --> 02:42:44.650
<v Speaker 1>bring something to the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

3753
02:42:45.570 --> 02:42:47.190
<v Speaker 1>they're not bringing anything to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

3754
02:42:47.191 --> 02:42:48.870
<v Speaker 1>What are they saying that we can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you bigger?</v>

3755
02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:51.220
<v Speaker 1>We'll get you on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which nobody listens to anymore.</v>

3756
02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they saying right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the radio,</v>

3757
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:55.350
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any.</v>

3758
02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:56.393
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a big radio station these days </v>

3759
02:42:59.251 --> 02:43:00.200
<v Speaker 1>that anybody listens to?</v>

3760
02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Not that I'm aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3761
02:43:02.101 --> 02:43:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I know they still exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that hot 97 still in New York,</v>

3762
02:43:05.851 --> 02:43:06.684
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have anyone listens to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where the kids find out about music </v>

3763
02:43:09.121 --> 02:43:10.860
<v Speaker 1>now it's got to be through the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

3764
02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:12.740
<v Speaker 1>The interwebs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3765
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I asked the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young barber was cutting me and he was</v>

3766
02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:19.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

3767
02:43:19.950 --> 02:43:24.950
<v Speaker 1>You musicians like casually got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just making conversation,</v>

3768
02:43:25.541 --> 02:43:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you listen to music?</v>

3769
02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:30.820
<v Speaker 1>He was like spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple music and soundcloud.</v>

3770
02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3771
02:43:31.871 --> 02:43:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't use any of the three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

3772
02:43:34.450 --> 02:43:36.100
<v Speaker 1>But it's good to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3773
02:43:36.101 --> 02:43:36.934
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

3774
02:43:37.330 --> 02:43:38.400
<v Speaker 2>it's who,</v>

3775
02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:40.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I listened.</v>

3776
02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I have your podcast on like in a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>app on my phone,</v>

3777
02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:46.080
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm assuming that's what people do.</v>

3778
02:43:46.830 --> 02:43:48.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit easier to track I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose.</v>

3779
02:43:48.991 --> 02:43:49.824
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Peter Frampton and David </v>

3780
02:43:54.811 --> 02:43:55.940
<v Speaker 1>crosby thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

3781
02:43:56.230 --> 02:44:01.230
<v Speaker 1>it was some number that's outlandish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 200 million streams or something.</v>

3782
02:44:02.050 --> 02:44:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Any 50 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>

3783
02:44:04.290 --> 02:44:07.140
<v Speaker 1>how is that criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it legal?</v>

3784
02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3785
02:44:08.561 --> 02:44:09.394
<v Speaker 1>they rigged the system they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have to figure out a way to </v>

3786
02:44:11.371 --> 02:44:12.204
<v Speaker 1>quantify it the same way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Record sales would have been like when </v>

3787

<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3800
02:44:51.051 --> 02:44:52.250
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

3801
02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:58.450
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred 60 $900,000.</v>

3802
02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:01.100
<v Speaker 2>100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard word to say.</v>

3803
02:45:01.101 --> 02:45:03.140
<v Speaker 2>100 thousandths of a dollar.</v>

3804
02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Can you even quantify that as money at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point?</v>

3805
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:10.650
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does anyone do when they.</v>

3806
02:45:11.130 --> 02:45:11.963
<v Speaker 2>They're faced with this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information like is anything going to </v>

3807
02:45:15.991 --> 02:45:18.660
<v Speaker 2>change and if it does change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they going to double it?</v>

3808
02:45:19.530 --> 02:45:21.890
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 10 bucks.</v>

3809
02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:22.753
<v Speaker 1>That's my worry that it's being brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people's attention and it might go </v>

3810
02:45:25.491 --> 02:45:26.324
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3811
02:45:26.330 --> 02:45:30.620
<v Speaker 1>the big government might get involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much is that going to shift?</v>

3812
02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the artists can't pull the music.</v>

3813
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:37.890
<v Speaker 2>The music is owned by the record </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

3814
02:45:38.250 --> 02:45:40.800
<v Speaker 2>The record companies are going to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they're not going to pay them the</v>

3815
02:45:40.801 --> 02:45:43.440
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would pay someone who is buying it.</v>

3816
02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:44.313
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Taylor swift pulled her shit for </v>

3817
02:45:45.921 --> 02:45:49.430
<v Speaker 1>a minute on some making a stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but however it was rectified,</v>

3818
02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:50.563
<v Speaker 1>she put it back.</v>

3819
02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I gave her money probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they gave her money.</v>

3820
02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give people money.</v>

3821
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:56.730
<v Speaker 2>They're giving people money for podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3822
02:45:56.731 --> 02:46:00.610
<v Speaker 2>They give you money for like exclusive </v>
<v Speaker 2>use of it for a couple days like that,</v>

3823
02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:01.453
<v Speaker 2>but like for two days or something along</v>
<v Speaker 2>those lines or they want to put their </v>

3824
02:46:04.891 --> 02:46:06.570
<v Speaker 2>own ads on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those lines.</v>

3825
02:46:06.571 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 2>But people can get your podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need</v>

3826
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:10.940
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

3827
02:46:10.941 --> 02:46:14.480
<v Speaker 1>You just letting someone make some money</v>
<v Speaker 1>off you for no reason.</v>

3828
02:46:14.481 --> 02:46:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>

3829
02:46:15.981 --> 02:46:19.040
<v Speaker 1>and will end what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we control our shit.</v>

3830
02:46:19.041 --> 02:46:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Why would we give that up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3831
02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Tell me why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they needed to tell me.</v>

3832
02:46:23.241 --> 02:46:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Why I would give up control of my shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3833
02:46:24.900 --> 02:46:27.100
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

3834
02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:27.973
<v Speaker 1>There's no logical explanation unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking fucking money and y'all </v>

3835
02:46:30.411 --> 02:46:32.480
<v Speaker 1>ain't turn on your music.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

3837
02:46:34.341 --> 02:46:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's not a lot of people that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that.</v>

3838
02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:37.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you sign with a major they own your</v>

3840
02:46:40.281 --> 02:46:42.440
<v Speaker 1>masters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you can't do it,</v>

02:46:42.441 --> 02:46:43.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3848
02:47:05.090 --> 02:47:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I try to do that as much as possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm,</v>

3851
02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:18.170
<v Speaker 1>we grew up with people and that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed untouchable,</v>

3852
02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:22.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rockstar Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3854
02:47:24.860 --> 02:47:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I would like to sort of bridge that gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like,</v>

3855
02:47:27.921 --> 02:47:29.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3856
02:47:29.530 --> 02:47:31.160
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk.</v>

3857
02:47:31.161 --> 02:47:32.260
<v Speaker 1>How are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3860
02:47:38.571 --> 02:47:41.090
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a niche audience man,</v>

3861
02:47:41.091 --> 02:47:43.990
<v Speaker 1>that like how many people buy them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3862
02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:46.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3863
02:47:46.101 --> 02:47:47.390
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I press vinyl.</v>

3864
02:47:47.450 --> 02:47:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I press tapes before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just to be,</v>

3865
02:47:50.740 --> 02:47:53.720
<v Speaker 1>just to be cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be cute.</v>

3866
02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Joseph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3867
02:47:55.420 --> 02:47:56.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tapes,</v>

3868
02:47:56.811 --> 02:48:01.580
<v Speaker 1>vinyl CDs and Vinyl sells the most love </v>
<v Speaker 1>vinyl.</v>

3869
02:48:01.581 --> 02:48:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3870
02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>

3871
02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:08.450
<v Speaker 1>big comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cds still that they're the most honestly</v>

3872
02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:11.400
<v Speaker 1>right now today tapes are more popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>than CDS.</v>

3873
02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Like a nostalgia thing and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably go away,</v>

3874
02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:18.020
<v Speaker 1>but like we discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even pressing them.</v>

3875
02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3876
02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how much I did because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>old school,</v>

3877
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:26.630
<v Speaker 1>but we discussed like not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but vinyl still coming in strong.</v>

3878
02:48:27.550 --> 02:48:30.110
<v Speaker 1>You buy into the sound difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

3879
02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:30.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3880
02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I buy into it with first you have to</v>

3881
02:48:34.791 --> 02:48:38.960
<v Speaker 1>start at the source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if it's recorded amazingly,</v>

3882
02:48:38.961 --> 02:48:41.300
<v Speaker 1>then if it sounds Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna Sound Shitty.</v>

3883
02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:44.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather listen to the Beatles on </v>
<v Speaker 1>vinyl.</v>

3884
02:48:44.350 --> 02:48:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to.</v>

3885
02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I listen to thin lizzy on vinyl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal,</v>

3886
02:48:48.081 --> 02:48:49.350
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of,</v>

3887
02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:50.870
<v Speaker 1>a lot of hip hop shit.</v>

3888
02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:51.733
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids have a mic and a laptop in the </v>

3889
02:48:55.311 --> 02:48:58.250
<v Speaker 1>bedroom and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the recording studio.</v>

3890
02:48:58.890 --> 02:49:01.340
<v Speaker 1>That's not gonna make any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference is going to be what it is,</v>

3891
02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:03.590
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But bands through care.</v>

3892
02:49:03.591 --> 02:49:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3893
02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:05.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's warmer.</v>

3894
02:49:05.481 --> 02:49:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Like if I listen to stevie wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>records said warmer.</v>

3895
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Warmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3896
02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that expression before.</v>

3897
02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know really how to articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3898
02:49:13.081 --> 02:49:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but in my head I know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the baselines and drums.</v>

3899
02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Everything sounds warm to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can they replicate that?</v>

3900
02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:23.100
<v Speaker 1>It was impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people can.</v>

3901
02:49:23.650 --> 02:49:27.890
<v Speaker 1>With electronics to a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still need to.</v>

3902
02:49:28.350 --> 02:49:30.630
<v Speaker 1>You still need to get analog to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

3903
02:49:30.631 --> 02:49:31.464
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still a few studios in the </v>

3904
02:49:32.581 --> 02:49:36.450
<v Speaker 1>country that do shit on reel to reel </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that sound,</v>

3905
02:49:36.451 --> 02:49:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have a fully replicated.</v>

3906
02:49:39.060 --> 02:49:39.893
<v Speaker 1>You can get close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to go to a reel to real to </v>

3907
02:49:42.001 --> 02:49:43.730
<v Speaker 1>really get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3908
02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:46.290
<v Speaker 1>we loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3909
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Now what about like apple music and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people buying things on itunes?</v>

3910
02:49:51.090 --> 02:49:53.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People still do that,</v>

3911
02:49:53.011 --> 02:49:53.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3912
02:49:53.821 --> 02:49:55.370
<v Speaker 1>But that's dropping too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3913
02:49:55.410 --> 02:49:56.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3914
02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:59.040
<v Speaker 1>it's streaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's soul stream dominated,</v>

3915
02:49:59.070 --> 02:49:59.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even when people were doing </v>

3916
02:50:00.451 --> 02:50:02.340
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like buying albums on itunes,</v>

3917
02:50:02.341 --> 02:50:06.120
<v Speaker 1>buying albums digitally on Amazon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3918
02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:09.150
<v Speaker 1>someone's preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sweet.</v>

3919
02:50:09.270 --> 02:50:10.560
<v Speaker 1>It was good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good money,</v>

3920
02:50:10.561 --> 02:50:12.570
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the streaming shit like.</v>

3921
02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:13.753
<v Speaker 1>Because logically if you're a casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>music fan and you pay $10 a month for </v>

3922
02:50:17.101 --> 02:50:19.590
<v Speaker 1>spotify for every album that's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>recorded,</v>

3923
02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:22.590
<v Speaker 1>can you really blame the van?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3924
02:50:22.591 --> 02:50:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And their ways of the ways of ingesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>music is so different.</v>

3925
02:50:25.891 --> 02:50:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I love the opening the vinyl.</v>

3926
02:50:28.110 --> 02:50:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I love reading the thank yous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the smell of the fucking cassette</v>

3927
02:50:31.981 --> 02:50:32.814
<v Speaker 1>tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it was an experience going to </v>

3928
02:50:34.501 --> 02:50:35.334
<v Speaker 1>the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being on the bus with the headphones on </v>

3929
02:50:37.530 --> 02:50:40.770
<v Speaker 1>the first time you hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know I can tell you where I was when I,</v>

3930
02:50:41.070 --> 02:50:44.230
<v Speaker 1>when I bought nozzle nomadic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I can tell you all that.</v>

3931
02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:48.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the experience that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3932
02:50:48.121 --> 02:50:49.980
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bhangra and now I have the album.</v>

3933
02:50:50.010 --> 02:50:52.110
<v Speaker 1>You didn't comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the new Joe Rogan album,</v>

3934
02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:55.710
<v Speaker 1>two seconds with a click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing to me.</v>

3935
02:50:56.360 --> 02:50:56.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3936
02:50:56.970 --> 02:50:57.803
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's not weird to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the little stores you would go to </v>

3937
02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:00.863
<v Speaker 1>where there was little stations where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could press a button and listen </v>

3938
02:51:03.530 --> 02:51:05.910
<v Speaker 1>preview of all these different and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just stand there all day,</v>

3939
02:51:05.911 --> 02:51:09.210
<v Speaker 1>all day listening to music all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>

3940
02:51:09.300 --> 02:51:10.133
<v Speaker 1>and if they didn't have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were buying shit and guessing many </v>

3941
02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:16.590
<v Speaker 1>bad bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at cool album.</v>

3942
02:51:18.690 --> 02:51:19.523
<v Speaker 1>I bought out album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like metal albums with a bad ass </v>

3943
02:51:22.170 --> 02:51:24.850
<v Speaker 1>covering the band was just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3944
02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:26.940
<v Speaker 1>You see sugar man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3945
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:31.410
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that mother fucking crate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's crazier at the story</v>

3946
02:51:31.710 --> 02:51:35.640
<v Speaker 1>or that he got big in Africa batshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That movie made me cry.</v>

3947
02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I've been me too bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>

3948
02:51:37.350 --> 02:51:38.183
<v Speaker 1>but just how insane that this guy went </v>
<v Speaker 1>on to become like a laborer for a </v>

3949
02:51:42.541 --> 02:51:43.374
<v Speaker 1>construction company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had no idea that he was a superstar in </v>

3950
02:51:45.481 --> 02:51:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

3951
02:51:46.860 --> 02:51:47.693
<v Speaker 1>And then goes there as an older man to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold out stadium and they all know the </v>

3952
02:51:51.691 --> 02:51:53.340
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful man.</v>

3953
02:51:53.940 --> 02:51:54.773
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the craziest </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries our time searching for </v>

3954
02:51:57.751 --> 02:51:58.201
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3955
02:51:58.201 --> 02:51:59.700
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't seen it folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3956
02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:01.050
<v Speaker 1>He got to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>

3957
02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Well done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a different era too.</v>

3958
02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:06.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy gave all his money when I</v>

3959
02:52:06.210 --> 02:52:10.840
<v Speaker 3>do this is the real fucking deal or no </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking joke,</v>

3960
02:52:10.841 --> 02:52:14.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he still lives like he lived when</v>

3961
02:52:14.471 --> 02:52:18.220
<v Speaker 3>he was a poor construction worker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3962
02:52:18.250 --> 02:52:20.750
<v Speaker 3>It's elevated Lao elevated way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>

3963
02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:21.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he just got so used to being in </v>

3964
02:52:23.511 --> 02:52:27.280
<v Speaker 3>that space for so long and his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>music is good.</v>

3965
02:52:27.281 --> 02:52:29.240
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

3966
02:52:29.540 --> 02:52:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when that's brought on you,</v>

3967
02:52:33.470 --> 02:52:35.420
<v Speaker 3>you're still more comfortable in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>other way,</v>

3968
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:37.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people don't want to.</v>

3969
02:52:39.950 --> 02:52:42.450
<v Speaker 3>They're not comfortable embracing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3970
02:52:42.470 --> 02:52:46.070
<v Speaker 3>whether it's wealth or fame or a mixture</v>
<v Speaker 3>of both.</v>

3971
02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:50.090
<v Speaker 3>I just think he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good content.</v>

3972
02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:53.030
<v Speaker 3>And there's people with billions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't content,</v>

3973
02:52:53.210 --> 02:52:54.043
<v Speaker 3>which there's nothing more important </v>
<v Speaker 3>than being good with yourself and he </v>

3974
02:52:56.571 --> 02:52:58.370
<v Speaker 3>seems good with himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3975
02:52:58.371 --> 02:52:59.204
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the scarier things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As someone who insanely successful but </v>

3976
02:53:02.661 --> 02:53:05.330
<v Speaker 3>never satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people are like.</v>

3977
02:53:05.331 --> 02:53:07.250
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about trump,</v>

3978
02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:11.450
<v Speaker 3>like if you are 70 years old and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have billions of dollars,</v>

3979
02:53:11.690 --> 02:53:14.650
<v Speaker 3>why are you still working?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3980
02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:15.583
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think something's going to change </v>

3981
02:53:16.911 --> 02:53:18.320
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3982
02:53:18.430 --> 02:53:19.263
<v Speaker 3>Do you have no perception that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally on the last finger full of </v>

3983
02:53:24.051 --> 02:53:24.884
<v Speaker 3>Greens in your hourglass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all you got left and you're not </v>
