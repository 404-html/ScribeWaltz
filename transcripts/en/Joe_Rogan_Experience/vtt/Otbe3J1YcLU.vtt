<v Speaker 2>comes from Ethiopia.</v>

32
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>All of it came out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

34
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the root originated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

35
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they started growing it and</v>

36
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Latin American countries and all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other place.</v>

37
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombian.</v>

38
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're always as a kid,</v>

39
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Colombian coffee was the course saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Juan Valdez.</v>

40
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still at,</v>

41
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Columbia over the summer and</v>

42
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still see pictures and drawings of</v>

43
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 2>him everywhere cause they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

44
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 2>because he brought kind of fame to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia and differentiated it from out</v>

45
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 2>the other South American countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Well this guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really fun.</v>

47
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 2>This is actually a very good cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

48
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very tasty.</v>

49
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

50
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a different flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean it get cold brew coffee.</v>

52
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 2>You take at least 70% of the bitterness</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and it makes it smoother and it just</v>

53
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 2>no acidic and you don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the stomach sourness you get when</v>

54
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you drink a big pot of hot coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually don't get that.</v>

55
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do like the flavor of this.</v>

56
00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 2>This is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

57
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 2>This is Ethiopian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no expert.</v>

59
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 2>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the best one to make cold brew?</v>

60
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 2>And they pointed a bag and I buy it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all,</v>

61
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

62
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Just defer to experts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the key to life I think.</v>

63
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 2>But he was Giuliani Juliano Juliano</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry Peter.</v>

64
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 2>He was explaining to us that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they all have these</v>

65
00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 2>different complex flavors and how they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they would take care of the beans</v>

66
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:27.070
<v Speaker 2>because Ethiopia is a very dry climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>where South America is very hot.</v>

67
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.890
<v Speaker 2>So they developed all these problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a coffee,</v>

68
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 2>rust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of coffee rust?</v>

69
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

70
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 2>They develop like weird molds and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they had to figure out</v>

71
00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 2>different ways of processing and wet</v>
<v Speaker 2>processing is verse to just leaving them</v>

72
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 2>out and drying them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

73
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he talk about the illegality of</v>

74
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 2>coffee and it's kind of earlier stages</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it would go out into different</v>

75
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 2>regions and cultures and religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas?</v>

76
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bordain actually was the first person to</v>

77
00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 2>tell me that they were outlawing coffee</v>
<v Speaker 2>shops and coffee houses back in the day.</v>

78
00:02:56.261 --> 00:03:01.261
<v Speaker 2>See there's a clip somewhere online of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bordain explaining to us how coffee</v>

79
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:06.991
<v Speaker 2>shops were being outlawed because at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time everyone basically was drunk all</v>

80
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

81
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Because people just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

82
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 2>all they did was drink booze because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

83
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times if you had water sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>around that water would probably have</v>

84
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>some funky shit and it was still water</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'd get sick drinking it.</v>

85
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 2>But you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 2>if water or the alcohol in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't get sick.</v>

87
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a preservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monks would only drink beer and like</v>

88
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

89
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine if you've ever had like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgian Ale.</v>

90
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like I have three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

91
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

92
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd think those guys just pacing</v>

93
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:39.360
<v Speaker 2>themselves all day to stay somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrated.</v>

94
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 2>And I think they just got used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it must have been terrible for their</v>

95
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

96
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was thinking.</v>

97
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.461
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

98
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:48.000
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking about like life</v>
<v Speaker 2>expectancy and how like,</v>

99
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I feel like we're going to see</v>

100
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 2>people living well into their hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff and like our generation and</v>

101
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 2>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

102
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 2>but back then you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 30.</v>

103
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should make a whale man,</v>

104
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

105
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 2>it's just if anything went wrong you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were done.</v>

106
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like I have a lot of friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have had their appendix taken out</v>

107
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 2>or they broke a leg hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They managed to get okay.</v>

108
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the back end that was the wolves</v>

109
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>ate you lays leave you so the wolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't come after the rest of us and just</v>

110
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>take one for the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your appendix,</v>

111
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 2>when you were just possessed by demons</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

112
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>You just struck dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just fall down and just rotted out</v>

114
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 2>from the inside and no one knew why it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the amount of,</v>

115
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 2>the amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard this statistic that like</v>

116
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.240
<v Speaker 2>something like 80% of medieval land land</v>
<v Speaker 2>battles were fought drunk or something,</v>

117
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some insane ratio.</v>

118
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it wouldn't have to be.</v>

119
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

120
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I would have to shotgun a bottle of Jack</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pick up like a battle ax and just run</v>

121
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>into a crowd of guys and just start</v>
<v Speaker 2>swinging away.</v>

122
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vikings were famous for waging war</v>

123
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 2>while they were on mushrooms though</v>
<v Speaker 2>would eat siliciden mushrooms and just</v>

124
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 2>fucking go banana may Emma Nita Mascara</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

125
00:04:56.441 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I think was the other mushroom that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>ate and they would just go fucking crazy</v>

126
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 2>with axes while they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what they were saying.</v>

127
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 2>He would say that the legend of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Berserker.</v>

128
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are we at the term Berzerk from?</v>

129
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.600
<v Speaker 2>You're obviously familiar and you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a warrior,</v>

130
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 2>a philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know that is,</v>

131
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

132
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>that's probably what you just go into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trance and you're just killing</v>

133
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>everything in sight and you're basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

134
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>an insect on cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just chopping everything down</v>

135
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:20.111
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

136
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 2>You remember when we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that new Viking show that's on Netflix?</v>

137
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 2>We missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the comedy one.</v>

138
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 2>There's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another one that's like a</v>

139
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:33.451
<v Speaker 2>serious viking show on Netflix that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be like the show vikings,</v>

140
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 2>but way better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I kinda liked the show vikings.</v>

141
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>

142
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 2>You're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>

143
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny though,</v>

144
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:40.054
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 2>you don't image the last kingdom that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking the last I heard.</v>

146
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where I'm so,</v>

147
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

148
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

149
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.590
<v Speaker 2>we focus on one thing and where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'd look,</v>

150
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>you're the vikings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

151
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 2>where are the hats?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where they wear the helmets with horns,</v>

152
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 2>with all these braids everyone has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a normal pizza.</v>

153
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.331
<v Speaker 2>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

154
00:05:58.331 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 2>they should all be monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like vikings were all sizes,</v>

155
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.451
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

156
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.380
<v Speaker 2>they were all big like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is like,</v>

157
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 2>there's not that many giant actors</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you want to recruit football</v>

158
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:10.440
<v Speaker 2>players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so true,</v>

159
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

160
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 2>But if you go to Holland or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and one of the things you walk</v>

161
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:14.460
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

162
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's big.</v>

163
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

164
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

165
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Norway,</v>

166
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Norwegian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very tall.</v>

167
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>The median height is like six feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is insane.</v>

168
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iceland has a disproportionate number of</v>

169
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 2>strong men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>competition winners.</v>

170
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Those guys who were the strongest man in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

171
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do this.</v>

172
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Thrill barrels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars hop.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

175
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those guys come from Iceland.</v>

176
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Well the guy who plays the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he who took strong commander in the</v>

177
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 2>world title,</v>

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 2>He for sure is he is fucking you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you saw that guy coming over a</v>

179
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.060
<v Speaker 2>hill on a horse with a sword,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is the day we stop existing it.</v>

182
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 2>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is day my clan gets wiped out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>our champion fights your champion.</v>

185
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 2>And then that person wins and then that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy comes out and you're like,</v>

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know how someone could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands that strong.</v>

233
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I was to a friend of mine and she was</v>

234
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.120

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.620
<v Speaker 2>he was in like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

236
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 2>like a care home for older people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a guy who has schizophrenia,</v>

237
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>will freaked out and tried to eat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

238
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 2>While he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

239
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he said,</v>

240
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get me out of here.</v>

241
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And he wound up dying at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want of dying at home rather than die</v>

242
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.090
<v Speaker 2>in the hospital because a guy tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat him.</v>

243
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Imagine like your last couple days of</v>
<v Speaker 2>life or escaping a schizophrenia guy who</v>

244
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>got out of his room and tried to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I worked so hard all my life</v>

245
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 2>and raised a family and now I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

246
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:37.490
<v Speaker 2>that's already your worst fears to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sidai away from your loved ones just</v>

247
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 2>around strangers to be back at the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>day of high school basically.</v>

248
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 2>But you're old and everyone's old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then someone's trying to kill you</v>

249
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 2>and eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

250
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 2>we don't get rid of people like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick enough.</v>

251
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.291
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 2>you get rid of bad dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs bite people.</v>

253

<v Speaker 2>You put them dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I should.</v>

255
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell my mother that because she</v>
<v Speaker 2>works with this group called the</v>

256
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 2>village,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which creates a network in any given</v>

257
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood where if you're young or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're old,</v>

258
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you registered on Kourtney thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

259
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person can live out their final</v>

260
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 2>years in their home because they have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>network of neighbors who check on them</v>

261
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 2>every couple of hours or call me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my cell.</v>

262
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a chest pain.</v>

263
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:16.981
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

264
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get you to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like,</v>

265
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I think people deserve to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.000
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're not eating people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing them,</v>

267
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.530
<v Speaker 2>they can die in their homes.</v>

268
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

269
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a concern that you really don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever want to address until it's too</v>

270
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:31.180
<v Speaker 2>late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

271
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.840
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

272
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 2>the concern of when and how do I go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

273
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to accept that you're</v>

274
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 2>going to go and some people just have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard time with that.</v>

275
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even deep into their old age when</v>

276
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:44.820
<v Speaker 2>they're just decrepit and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it any more,</v>

277
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 2>they just can't handle the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all going to end.</v>

278
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

279
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 2>That's why you have to live your life to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fullest and not bite your tongue and</v>

280
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:57.831
<v Speaker 2>just be yourself because I guess or just</v>
<v Speaker 2>chill the fuck out and wait for the end.</v>

281
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the two,</v>

282
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the life to the fullest,</v>

283
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's all temporary.</v>

284
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

285
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is that point where it's just</v>

286
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:10.741
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

287
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 2>is there any point to life?</v>

288
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone back and forth with trussell</v>

289

<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole with that man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he'll make some sense out of it.</v>

293
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 2>He will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the cosmic trickster without a</v>

294
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:29.760
<v Speaker 2>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I were bordain speaking of Dane,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it with a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

300
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was friends with them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I that would fuck me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck me up.</v>

302
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.140

<v Speaker 2>and I was a fan of his since the first</v>

303
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Speaker 2>article came out in the New Yorker that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote,</v>

304
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 2>it fucks you up because you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish she called me.</v>

305
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish.</v>

306
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Or I mean I would have to France,</v>

307
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.803
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't of,</v>

308
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.861
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

311
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.450

<v Speaker 3>she would have checked in.</v>

312
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I mean,</v>

313
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 3>I know it's all about perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are times where we've all come</v>

314
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 3>close to not necessarily putting a gun</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

315
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Our mouths were rope around her neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where you just feel like there's no</v>

316
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:11.100
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

317
00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:12.460
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone can just come in.</v>

318
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 3>I say it like coming up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the crew that I came up with in</v>

319
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Chicago,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and people like,</v>

322
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never let each other get away with</v>

323
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 3>shit where it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like you need those people in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget.</v>

326
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 3>I went through a horrible breakup and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>

327
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Speaker 3>I was in my apartment for like a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only leaving to wait tables and</v>

328
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 3>bartender.</v>

329
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.570
<v Speaker 3>And then I finally came to a show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinane is like,</v>

330
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:39.420

<v Speaker 3>Welcome back you fucking pussy.</v>

332
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.130
<v Speaker 3>And I remember laughing so hard and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all went away.</v>

333
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 3>It all went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just cause you take yourself so</v>

334
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:50.210
<v Speaker 3>seriously and it was never going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

335
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

336
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 3>I just think about despair as this demon</v>
<v Speaker 3>that latches onto your back and it's</v>

337
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 3>your job to fuck it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it off you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your thing?</v>

339
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed the fight.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The bitch in you conquer your inner</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitlocker year you're going to pitch is,</v>

341
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 3>I usually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm referring your inner pitch,</v>

342
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:11.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean the inner bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't want you to work out well.</v>

343
00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

344
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.600
<v Speaker 3>that's the one I relate to the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's at.</v>

345
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 3>I feel that every time I'm in a class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I'm in something like that,</v>

346
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 3>it's just like something and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You mentioned like hospice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living and stuff.</v>

366
00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:59.290
<v Speaker 3>My Dad used to do hospice and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>do I have to talk?</v>

368
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 3>And the guy's like,</v>

00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:03.200
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but he never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he never talk about it.</v>

374
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Where I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>

375
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

376
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go hang out with bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Dad,</v>

377
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:14.680

<v Speaker 3>I was this guy,</v>

378
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:15.830
<v Speaker 3>he's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

379
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to tell me more than this.</v>

380
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 3>So now we're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's opening up more,</v>

381
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 3>but long story long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

382
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're waking up in the middle of</v>

383
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 3>the night and there's that voice in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>head that is telling you you,</v>

384
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.531
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

385
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:27.780
<v Speaker 3>you're useless and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

386
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.830
<v Speaker 3>you haven't done enough with your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>

387
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.690
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there is a devil,</v>

388
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.160
<v Speaker 3>but if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's him.</v>

389
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

390
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 3>And it just blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

391
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>

392
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:39.190
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That voice that tells you to give up</v>

393
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:41.930
<v Speaker 3>that voice that tells you like not to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not and not to,</v>

394
00:14:41.931 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hate yourself and you know,</v>

395
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 3>don't think you're worthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then it's such a weird pattern.</v>

396
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it doesn't have any real</v>

397
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the benefit</v>

398
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 2>of self loathing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just sitting around feeling pity.</v>

399
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

400
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're plenty people in situations that</v>

401
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 2>are going to kick the shit out of you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life anyway.</v>

402
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do it to yourself,</v>

403
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something good about feeling</v>

404
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 2>very disappointed in yourself because</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it makes you work harder and like</v>

405
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.320
<v Speaker 2>you recognize or at least try to realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>your potential better.</v>

406
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 2>You get more done and you feel better</v>
<v Speaker 2>about yourself.</v>

407
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

408
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely something there is,</v>

409
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're,</v>

410
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 2>you're in competitive sports or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that where you just,</v>

411
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing you hate more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing get because otherwise you won't</v>

412
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:29.541
<v Speaker 2>work as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

416
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Coby said he learned it from Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like what he passed on to stay on</v>

417
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 2>coby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pass it on to Lebron.</v>

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 2>To be and just to be the richest man in</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the world's not real.</v>

482
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 2>He's not really the richest man in all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

483
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 2>He's the richest man who has a publicly</v>
<v Speaker 2>declared income.</v>

484
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>full on with wealth.</v>

526
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:04.620
<v Speaker 2>There's always a displacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's rich because other people are</v>

527
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 2>poor on some level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was the most direct</v>

528
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:09.100
<v Speaker 2>correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always the case like this.</v>

529
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like beyonce,</v>

530
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 2>is beyonce rich because someone's poor</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is it beyonce?</v>

531
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Rich cause she talented and she worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

532
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

533
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's,</v>

534
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:19.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's across the board like that,</v>

535
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:21.090
<v Speaker 2>but I just think in turn a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of ways.</v>

536
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not ever.</v>

537
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.980
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not every time.</v>

538
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people love to say that.</v>

539
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

540

544
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No disparity of wealth is because</v>

545
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:37.140
<v Speaker 2>someone's out there being evil or is she</v>
<v Speaker 2>just really good?</v>

546
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that gets me is that they</v>

547
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:41.390
<v Speaker 2>always dump on those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the public figure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

558
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.010

<v Speaker 2>you'd have to get in by enough people</v>

559
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:07.820
<v Speaker 2>that want to pay to see you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>see you lose your life.</v>

562
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.360
<v Speaker 2>uncle.</v>

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

568
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:22.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anyone would paid 300 bucks a seat</v>

569
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:25.030
<v Speaker 2>at Madison Square Garden to see an old</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish guy get punched once in the face</v>

570
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:28.930
<v Speaker 2>and cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laugh because it was so specific,</v>

571
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:31.810
<v Speaker 2>like be crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be drooling.</v>

572
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.530
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be able to lose half your</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence see straight anymore.</v>

573
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking skull would be broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd have to bolt it back together</v>

574
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:40.900
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to have everyone.</v>

575
00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I love hostage in like a warehouse to</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him punch me once.</v>

576
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:46.540

<v Speaker 2>took picture with them,</v>

579
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:52.330
<v Speaker 2>but every time you meet him you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

585
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.600
<v Speaker 2>oak tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like funk.</v>

586
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Aha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just this beast of a man.</v>

587
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching those first fights.</v>

588
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.880
<v Speaker 2>It was like watching you put a dog in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ring with a wolf every time.</v>

589
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.280
<v Speaker 2>It was just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would just run right through</v>

590
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 2>everybody to the point where you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

591
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.490
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not from here.</v>

592
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like those,</v>

593
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

594
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.530
<v Speaker 2>those comic books were aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're on a planet that has</v>

595
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:23.470
<v Speaker 2>way more gravity or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say just punched fish right through your</v>

596
00:22:23.471 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 2>chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

597
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a superman,</v>

598
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 2>superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if that happened,</v>

599
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:31.180
<v Speaker 2>what's fucked up about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like scientists must get crazy about</v>

600
00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 2>that because if that happened you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really sick.</v>

601
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when people go to space and they're</v>

602
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:39.940
<v Speaker 2>in space for six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their body breaks down.</v>

603
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

604
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 2>You lose like years from your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucked up.</v>

605
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Commander Chris Hadfield on the podcast</v>

606
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.673
<v Speaker 2>Belk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

607
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.500
<v Speaker 2>And he said that when he came back he</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally couldn't stand,</v>

608
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 2>his equilibrium was so fucked up cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had been in space for six months.</v>

609
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Then when he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was a horribly throwing up.</v>

610
00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>

611
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.170
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't see straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you'd stand,</v>

612
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.890
<v Speaker 2>the world was all wobbly and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his equilibrium was completely</v>

613
00:23:05.891 --> 00:23:07.210
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

614
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

615
00:23:08.411 --> 00:23:11.410
<v Speaker 2>superhero movies are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally ridiculous and silly.</v>

616
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I love comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up on them and stuff,</v>

617
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 2>but they never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never take physics into account.</v>

618
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 2>And really it's always like you hit with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gamma ray,</v>

619
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:19.900
<v Speaker 2>you get powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

620
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 2>why would it choose to give you powers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would just melt you.</v>

621
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not how forces in the universe</v>

622
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

623
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.560
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

624
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.290
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking mystically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never gets enhanced in real life by like</v>

626
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:32.560
<v Speaker 2>nuclear radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

627
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever happened.</v>

628
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best theory would probably be like</v>

629
00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Godzilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some monster was born of it that</v>

630
00:23:40.061 --> 00:23:44.020
<v Speaker 2>came out of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a time where vice went to</v>

631
00:23:44.021 --> 00:23:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Chernobyl and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was back when vice was really vice,</v>

632
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 2>when Shane Smith was going on all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>journey and shit.</v>

633
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 2>That was what was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

634
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Before vices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of vice,</v>

635
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice still does some great stuff,</v>

636
00:23:55.101 --> 00:24:00.101
<v Speaker 2>but vices just as huge multimedia</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation now and back then,</v>

637
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane went to Chernobyl and,</v>

638
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were hunting like these radioactive</v>

639
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:07.420
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

640
00:24:07.421 --> 00:24:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Mike is radioactive wolves and Chernobyl</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

641
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're mutating.</v>

642
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.220
<v Speaker 2>There's fish in the water that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous and they're fucking weird and</v>

643
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 2>you can never eat them.</v>

644
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 2>They're like the fifth fishing near the</v>
<v Speaker 2>plant in a simpsons like with three</v>

645
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:20.601
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

646
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

647
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's real.</v>

648
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Like they really do have these animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>that live in this highly radiated area</v>

649
00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:31.781
<v Speaker 2>and they've managed to survive by just</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy mean that the level,</v>

650
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.900
<v Speaker 2>the levels that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have taken to get energy and</v>

651
00:24:36.901 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 2>affected our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

652
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:42.170
<v Speaker 2>you ever dropped San Diego?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that ride when you drive down</v>

653
00:24:42.171 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Speaker 2>and you look to the right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look.</v>

654
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Nuclear power plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could throw a rock and hit it from the</v>

655
00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:48.950
<v Speaker 2>highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what in the fuck is that doing</v>

656
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:49.760
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

657
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.540
<v Speaker 2>So close to the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think it needs to be close to the</v>

658
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 2>water for cooling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

659
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.140
<v Speaker 2>That's how they cool the reactor core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

660
00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>notice I say that like I know what I'm</v>

661
00:24:59.391 --> 00:24:59.750
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

662
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.291
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

663
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:02.240
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a nuclear physicist right now.</v>

664
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

665
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.890
<v Speaker 2>that was the Fukushima thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening over there.</v>

666
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.990
<v Speaker 2>They still don't have that thing under</v>
<v Speaker 2>wraps.</v>

667
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Well and debt that volunteer army of of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese people older than 70 that were</v>

668
00:25:13.761 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have long.</v>

669
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll go work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go clean it up.</v>

670
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 2>They're all going back in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all 39 you go there.</v>

671
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Stephen King movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

672
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I do twice a 30 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to tell anybody.</v>

673
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.141
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>

674
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that the way to San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

675
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.270
<v Speaker 2>probably broke everybody around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dead.</v>

676
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause everyone was throwing rocks.</v>

677
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like Joe Washes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

678
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe they woke up and like 1980 and</v>

679
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:35.630
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

680
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe this isn't a good place for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking nuclear power plants.</v>

681
00:25:38.691 --> 00:25:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Steam generators failed in 2013 Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 2>steam generators.</v>

682
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.080
<v Speaker 2>There it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

683
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.570
<v Speaker 2>The fuck out of here with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>

684
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile that's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the core is still there.</v>

685
00:25:49.941 --> 00:25:52.820
<v Speaker 2>They can't move it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's currently in preparation to be</v>

686
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:54.120
<v Speaker 2>decommissioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeez.</v>

687
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.130
<v Speaker 2>However long that takes g's ever that</v>
<v Speaker 2>even that means man,</v>

688
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 2>go fishing around that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>

689
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 2>You'll catch a big fish though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

690
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll have human hands,</v>

691
00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 2>he'll talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't eat what?</v>

692
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.850
<v Speaker 2>But they talk with thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

693
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:15.350
<v Speaker 2>They just stare at you and to your mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fukishima they were doing something</v>

694
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.310
<v Speaker 2>where they dug this giant swimming pool</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all around this giant swimming pool</v>

695
00:26:20.311 --> 00:26:23.450
<v Speaker 2>that they dug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put like ice cores,</v>

696
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:28.610
<v Speaker 2>they put like some sort of cooling</v>
<v Speaker 2>element so they could freeze all the</v>

697
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.930
<v Speaker 2>nuclear waste to it and insanely cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature didn't work.</v>

698
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 2>This is like a strategy that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing,</v>

699
00:26:35.871 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 2>but apparently it fell apart.</v>

700
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you just don't,</v>

701
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 2>you can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like they gotta do something.</v>

702
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 2>You got to keep trying to shoot it in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

703
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the aliens are going to get mad at</v>

704
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

705
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Well there already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know,</v>

706
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who I used to live with</v>

707
00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 2>who was kind of new agey but also</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theory ish and he would,</v>

708
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.880
<v Speaker 2>he was convinced that our planet was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mo,</v>

709
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 2>the off limits zone for the entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe where every other plan it was</v>

710
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 2>much more advanced and they were just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

711
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 2>don't go down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All they do is fight and blow things up</v>

712
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't share with each other and</v>

713
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:12.120
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just don't,</v>

714
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 2>that's why no aliens come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all that,</v>

715
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.650
<v Speaker 2>when people do stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always feel like they're</v>

716
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:20.310
<v Speaker 2>anthropomorphizing like the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life would be anything like our</v>

717
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:23.270
<v Speaker 2>life is a bunch of characteristic.</v>

718
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Agree with you more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

719
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a bunch of care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a bunch of things that have to</v>

720
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:31.320
<v Speaker 2>be in place for us to get to the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we're going to war with each other</v>

721
00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:32.890
<v Speaker 2>that are people that are over there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

722
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.280
<v Speaker 2>There is no war in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever noticed that?</v>

723
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:35.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

724
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an ocean wars.</v>

725
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:38.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have and there,</v>

726
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just eat each other.</v>

727
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's normal,</v>

728
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 2>there's parts of the ocean we can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach and there's,</v>

729
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.210
<v Speaker 2>who knows if there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

730
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole other civilization down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

731
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we like really bond with</v>

732
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 2>mammals only because fish don't do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn thing for their kids yet.</v>

733
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Those dirty fuck cause they don't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>have them like it's a trick.</v>

734
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like nature's trick them into not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being attached by the kids.</v>

735
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 2>They blast some eggs down on the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the floor and then the males come</v>

736
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:08.610
<v Speaker 2>along and just on the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure I'm done here.</v>

737
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll get out of there and they jet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

738
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.970
<v Speaker 2>And I leave like millions of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

739
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 2>The only ones that take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a few female fish that keep</v>

740
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 2>the babies in their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen those?</v>

741
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they let him go like,</v>

742
00:28:20.091 --> 00:28:22.160
<v Speaker 2>and when the babies are in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hold them in their mouth and then</v>

743
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.020
<v Speaker 2>like everybody gone good and they opened</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and the babies get to swim around.</v>

744
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:26.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

745
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Once test fit in mom's mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking,</v>

746
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.660
<v Speaker 2>which there's a bumper sticker for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

747
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 2>but things that live in the ocean that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do love,</v>

748
00:28:34.891 --> 00:28:36.840
<v Speaker 2>like dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of their young.</v>

749
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Killer whales take care of the young.</v>

750
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

751
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.930
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't take care of your young,</v>

752
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you can fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a mammalian trait.</v>

753
00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

754
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

755
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.670
<v Speaker 2>but like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

756
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.740
<v Speaker 2>we always try to create a like on other</v>
<v Speaker 2>planets is how does this,</v>

757
00:28:53.741 --> 00:28:55.540
<v Speaker 2>it does this smell like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

758
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've found that right away.</v>

759
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.460
<v Speaker 2>That is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is on the outside.</v>

760
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

761
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last door.</v>

762
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

763
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:05.880
<v Speaker 2>What kind of fish is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't say.</v>

764
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

765
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:08.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's smoking fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

766
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a hookah.</v>

767
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I get soup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawson blowing out Swedish too.</v>

768
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a group or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like something in the Bass</v>

769
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

770
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.140
<v Speaker 2>it's gorgeous fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned the thing with feet and</v>

771
00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd watch the Blue Planet to the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and there is not a fish apparently</v>

772
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:26.880
<v Speaker 2>it's called like a toad of some kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hangs out on the bottom and it</v>

773
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:27.581
<v Speaker 2>has feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

774
00:29:27.581 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a fish that grew feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It walks around.</v>

775
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a fish.</v>

776
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a some sort of toad I</v>

777
00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:36.230
<v Speaker 2>think technically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

778
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.320
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they look like human feet almost</v>

779
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 2>like how his toes and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

780
00:29:41.441 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>One of the weirdest</v>

781
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 5>things that I ever saw about the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 5>was there was a theory that was going</v>

782
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 5>around a few years ago that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if this is legit or not,</v>

783
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 5>go google,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they think that it's entirely</v>

784
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:56.671
<v Speaker 5>possible that octopus Octopi may have</v>
<v Speaker 5>come from eggs that were frozen and</v>

785
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:01.720
<v Speaker 5>landed here from an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was speculation that there was</v>

786
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:03.430
<v Speaker 5>something about the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

787
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:05.260
<v Speaker 5>The way that they pro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

788
00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:10.261
<v Speaker 5>the DNA and rna of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of octopus are so different than every</v>

789
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:14.810
<v Speaker 5>other animal in the fossil record that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost that there,</v>

790
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.440
<v Speaker 5>there was a consideration that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>might have actually been an alien</v>

791
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:21.070
<v Speaker 5>species because you know the term,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what Panspermia means.</v>

792
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.230
<v Speaker 5>Panspermia is a theory that is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>widely accepted in the scientific</v>

793
00:30:26.231 --> 00:30:31.120
<v Speaker 5>community that some life is transferred</v>
<v Speaker 5>through asteroidal collisions.</v>

794
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.360
<v Speaker 5>So like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say if a,</v>

795
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 5>a chunk of rock slams into our planet</v>
<v Speaker 5>and knocks a chunk of rock loose in that</v>

796
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:43.171
<v Speaker 5>chunk has dna on it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the amino acids and all the building</v>

797
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:45.790
<v Speaker 5>blocks for life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that bacteria,</v>

798
00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:46.680
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that,</v>

799
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.800
<v Speaker 5>some things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

800
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.560
<v Speaker 5>little things can survive in space like</v>
<v Speaker 5>tardigrades little life forms can to</v>

801
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.540
<v Speaker 5>survive in space that they slam into a</v>
<v Speaker 5>planet eventually.</v>

802
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 5>And then when they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that life is transferred onto that new</v>

803
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:01.000
<v Speaker 5>planet science news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

804
00:31:01.001 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 5>The buses came to earth from space as</v>
<v Speaker 5>frozen eggs millions of years ago.</v>

805
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.870
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this is like the,</v>

806
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.410
<v Speaker 5>the express,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying,</v>

807
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.750
<v Speaker 5>I read it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

808
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.730
<v Speaker 5>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the most feasible version of</v>

809
00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:14.130
<v Speaker 5>aliens coming here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

810
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.260
<v Speaker 5>We tend to think of it as it lands and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like a space man who looks like</v>

811
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:19.840
<v Speaker 5>George Clooney steps out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he has like [inaudible] or</v>

812
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:20.561
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

813
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:21.031
<v Speaker 5>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

814
00:31:21.031 --> 00:31:23.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm here to share with our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our planet all,</v>

815
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.530
<v Speaker 5>all tuna or whatever and he speaks</v>
<v Speaker 5>English and all this shit.</v>

816
00:31:26.531 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's on a,</v>

817
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.080
<v Speaker 5>on a biological level that we almost</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't comprehend.</v>

818
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 5>You could go back to that James please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really good.</v>

819
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 5>It says that the extraordinary claims</v>
<v Speaker 5>made in a report entitled the case of</v>

820
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:39.940
<v Speaker 5>Cambrian Explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrestrial or cosmic,</v>

821
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.720
<v Speaker 5>which costed by a group of 33 scientists</v>
<v Speaker 5>and published in the Pr,</v>

822
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>progress in biophysics and molecular</v>

823
00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:47.290
<v Speaker 5>biology journal.</v>

824
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 5>And the paper suggest that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>explanation for the sudden flourishing</v>

825
00:31:50.321 --> 00:31:53.410
<v Speaker 5>of life during the Cambrian era,</v>
<v Speaker 5>often referred to as the Cambrian</v>

826
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:58.411
<v Speaker 5>explosion lies in the stars as a result</v>
<v Speaker 5>of earth being bombarded by clouds of</v>

827
00:31:59.171 --> 00:32:00.880
<v Speaker 5>organic molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

828
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:04.090
<v Speaker 5>I think that's also the theory of how</v>
<v Speaker 5>water got on earth.</v>

829
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.780
<v Speaker 5>They came from thinking came from</v>
<v Speaker 5>comments cause when you see comments,</v>

830
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.130
<v Speaker 5>comments are all water and I think like</v>
<v Speaker 5>millions of years of us can hammered by</v>

831
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:13.130
<v Speaker 5>comments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

832
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Speaker 5>Like you know when you see the trails of</v>
<v Speaker 5>comments,</v>

833
00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 5>that's literally ice D and debris coming</v>
<v Speaker 5>off of that comment.</v>

834
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.110
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

835
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.760
<v Speaker 5>Literally the more you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you know,</v>

836
00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:28.450
<v Speaker 5>been in a comment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they think that about mushrooms as</v>

837
00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:31.630
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think that spores can survive in a</v>

838
00:32:31.631 --> 00:32:34.540
<v Speaker 5>vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if something like,</v>

839
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.600
<v Speaker 5>say if some spores were attached to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>rover and we shot off to move to</v>

840
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 2>the moon or something like that and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>got there somehow or another,</v>

841
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 2>if there was the right conditions for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing to grow,</v>

842
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:50.771
<v Speaker 2>that they could actually survive the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip and then grow on the moon or on</v>

843
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Mars or anywhere where it be water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sunlight and atmosphere,</v>

844
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.650
<v Speaker 2>like invasion of the body snatchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll spores or even weirder,</v>

845
00:32:57.651 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because spores create mushrooms and</v>

846
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms actually breathed oxygen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you breathe out carbon dioxide.</v>

847
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.150
<v Speaker 2>They say they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're closer to an animal than the art</v>

848
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:07.280
<v Speaker 2>of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

849
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.620
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

850
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about that when I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I've eaten magic mushrooms a lot.</v>

851
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I basically just ate an</v>

852
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:15.111
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

853
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:20.111
<v Speaker 2>you also feel like it's taking like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive inside of you communicating with</v>

854
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:22.190
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

855
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't you feel like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not as simple as I'm getting</v>

856
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:25.570
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

857
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 2>I smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm getting high when I eat</v>

858
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

859
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.880
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm entering into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought process of an alien creature.</v>

860
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

861
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.880
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put on like a space suit on the</v>

862
00:33:34.881 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 2>inside in a way and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're evolving a certain way if only</v>

863
00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 2>for like seven or eight hours or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

864
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever micro dose now?</v>

865
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that do that and Ron</v>
<v Speaker 2>White's big into that.</v>

866
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Izzy,</v>

867
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.590
<v Speaker 2>every day</v>
<v Speaker 2>you laugh.</v>

868
00:33:50.591 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Found my sale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But good kind of medicine.</v>

869
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

871
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.670

<v Speaker 2>you could have,</v>

872
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:00.710
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes perfect sense.</v>

873
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 2>He's beautiful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always drunk.</v>

878
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.280
<v Speaker 2>He's always a peach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always the nicest,</v>

879
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.400
<v Speaker 2>nicest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never had any attitude with any</v>

880
00:34:19.401 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 2>comedian ever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there are certain,</v>

<v Speaker 2>terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like we only think about that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Flawless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acme in Minneapolis.</v>

934
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 2>He's got a few pillars that are a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>annoying.</v>

935
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.690
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

936
00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ceiling height is just right.</v>

937
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wide Ass pillars.</v>

938
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:17.790
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I'm sitting right here?</v>

939
00:36:17.791 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 2>I got to do this to watch the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to lean left.</v>

940
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.370
<v Speaker 2>You worry about who's behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like doing comedy in the round.</v>

941
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I have to keep spinning.</v>

942
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only done that a couple times and</v>

943
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:29.970
<v Speaker 2>it always feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>

944
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I need people in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

945
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:33.860
<v Speaker 2>it's awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>

946
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The Hollywood theater,</v>

948
00:36:37.021 --> 00:36:40.830

<v Speaker 2>Louie did one of his specials there.</v>

949
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:42.420
<v Speaker 2>One of his hps.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really think it's 2,900 okay.</v>

955
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might not even be 2,900 maybe 2,700</v>

956
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 2>find out young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I know Sebastian,</v>

958
00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:07.110

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

964
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 2>three years ago or so.</v>

965
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:24.030
<v Speaker 2>around and watch him at the store cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so fun.</v>

966
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.300
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's another guy like no one begrudges.</v>

967
00:37:27.301 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 2>If you've a grudge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grat,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 2>You know I have such a blast watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>him cause it's just,</v>

971
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:38.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's like a silly ballet</v>
<v Speaker 2>dancer.</v>

972
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making up all these,</v>

973
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.680
<v Speaker 2>all these stories and his facial</v>
<v Speaker 2>expressions and how he,</v>

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:46.501
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

975
00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 2>his physical comedy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Exsalonce I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

977
00:37:50.071 --> 00:37:54.450

<v Speaker 2>Everything is annoying to him.</v>

978
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Like that's this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:37:56.061 --> 00:37:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everything around.</v>

980
00:37:57.361 --> 00:37:59.010
<v Speaker 2>It just pisses him off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

981
00:37:59.011 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 2>If you ever achieved peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like peace of mind would be terrible.</v>

982
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Awful for is what would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

983
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to legit think about that when I</v>

984
00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:09.750
<v Speaker 2>was starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was starting to do comedy,</v>

985
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to meditate and to try to do</v>

986
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 2>these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought that's gotta be bad for</v>

987
00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:15.564
<v Speaker 2>your act.</v>

988
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I should probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

989
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

990
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.470
<v Speaker 2>I remember guys saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

991
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:20.640
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be healthy.</v>

992
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.190
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for your act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to feel like shit.</v>

993
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time you feel good is when</v>

994
00:38:24.901 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 2>you're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

995
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.890
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want it to be depressed or be angry</v>

996
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:32.220
<v Speaker 2>and lonely to smoke cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 2>desperately need their attention on</v>

997
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:33.054
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

998
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.440
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only place you live,</v>

999
00:38:34.441 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 2>we're all fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

1000
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of my favorite acts were like</v>

1001
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 2>really depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Richard Jennings,</v>

1002
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:42.580
<v Speaker 2>one of my all time favorite acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was super depressed when I'm killing</v>

1003
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:43.740
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1004
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 2>and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

1005
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.780
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was maddening when I,</v>

1006
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.620
<v Speaker 2>when I heard the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's one of those cues,</v>

1007
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.040
<v Speaker 2>one of those go tos that I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1008
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I get fed up with comedians that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>fans anymore,</v>

1009
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.470
<v Speaker 2>or a guy in Chicago who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1010
00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.820
<v Speaker 2>you ever have those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1011
00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:01.630
<v Speaker 2>you start out around and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just look at them and you never stay</v>

1012
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:03.220
<v Speaker 2>up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never want to be you man.</v>

1013
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would be the back and just go,</v>

1014
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 2>we'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>HAH,</v>

1015
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.050
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1016
00:39:08.051 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 2>is it because you didn't laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You made a noise like laughter.</v>

1017
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.130
<v Speaker 2>But you see everything is a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love,</v>

1018
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I love watching good comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever they are.</v>

1019
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:19.880
<v Speaker 2>And like Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jenny was one of those guys were just</v>

1020
00:39:19.881 --> 00:39:21.310
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's an ace.</v>

1021
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 2>You're like Brian Regan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it's like,</v>

1022
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm never not going to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a sweetheart too.</v>

1023
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.010
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about this in the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think what that came from was</v>

1024
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 2>there was a famine mentality that</v>
<v Speaker 2>existed in like the eighties and the</v>

1025
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.030
<v Speaker 2>nineties because the only way you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>become successful is if you got on the</v>

1026
00:39:37.031 --> 00:39:41.080
<v Speaker 2>tonight show and there was only one slot</v>
<v Speaker 2>at night and there's only five nights a</v>

1027
00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:42.970
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if they don't know,</v>

1028
00:39:42.971 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 2>always have comics on either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the only other way you would</v>

1029
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:48.040
<v Speaker 2>get successful is if you've got to sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>

1030
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you got an HBO special,</v>

1031
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 2>which only famous people got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1032
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

1033
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.420
<v Speaker 2>that was the highest would be Seinfeld</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Kennison or someone big to get an hbo</v>

1034
00:39:58.421 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for a regular small,</v>

1035
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:03.280
<v Speaker 2>like you were I back then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

1036
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:05.920
<v Speaker 2>How do you make it so everybody was dog</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat dog.</v>

1037
00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all,</v>

1038
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:12.570
<v Speaker 2>and I think somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early to mid two thousands that</v>

1039
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:15.250
<v Speaker 2>shifted and it shifted because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

1040
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:16.980
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1041
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.250
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is an internet.</v>

1042
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I kind of thought of it as an organic</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing from,</v>

1043
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because uh,</v>

1044
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.210
<v Speaker 2>the comedy boom happened because disco</v>
<v Speaker 2>died and you could basically fill a,</v>

1045
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.100
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge room with just a spotlight and a</v>

1046
00:40:28.101 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Mike and one dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1047
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these guys still have that space and</v>

1048
00:40:31.781 --> 00:40:34.030
<v Speaker 2>they were just raking in hand over fist</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people just,</v>

1049
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.980
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to disco dance anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it did,</v>

1050
00:40:35.981 --> 00:40:37.420
<v Speaker 2>it just died a horrible death.</v>

1051
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 2>There was too much a cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>

1052
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:43.930
<v Speaker 2>cocaine and everyone did disco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Kenny Rogers did a disco song.</v>

1053
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:46.550
<v Speaker 2>It was just like everybody kissed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disco song.</v>

1054
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought it was because that</v>

1055
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:54.940
<v Speaker 2>kind of faded out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kind of just came to our senses as</v>

1056
00:40:54.941 --> 00:40:56.410
<v Speaker 2>audience members and Comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're right,</v>

1057
00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:58.150
<v Speaker 2>it is the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what changed it.</v>

1058
00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet came along and comics</v>

1059
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 2>started promoting themselves and someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who really deserves a lot of credit is</v>

1060
00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Dane Cook for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dane Cook was the first guy to really</v>

1061
00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 2>become famous through the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then everyone,</v>

1062
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.340
<v Speaker 2>including me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started paying attention going,</v>

1063
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is another way.</v>

1064
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Even though there is the regular way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>television shows and movies and all that</v>

1065
00:41:19.901 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this way to in this way,</v>

1066
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:25.990
<v Speaker 2>just made at the time he was the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>selling comedian of all time.</v>

1067
00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He spent like 20 grand on a website,</v>

1068
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.050
<v Speaker 2>which to me at the time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has that kind of money that's and</v>

1069
00:41:31.051 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 2>why buy a car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was the smart</v>

1070
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.380
<v Speaker 3>one and he also spent all day day</v>

1071
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 5>responding to people online and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1072
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:44.261
<v Speaker 5>built up this reputation for doing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then promoted the shit out of</v>

1073
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:48.560
<v Speaker 5>himself through my space and all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>different ways that he promoted,</v>

1074
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shows instead and then became</v>

1075
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 5>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 5>And then everyone else around 2003 or</v>
<v Speaker 5>four that's when we all started to jump</v>

1077
00:41:55.821 --> 00:42:00.620
<v Speaker 5>in and comics had my space accounts and</v>
<v Speaker 5>comics had facebook pages and,</v>

1078
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.611
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1079
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 5>I had a website in the 90s I had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>website way back in the night,</v>

1080
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 5>but I basically just wrote blogs on it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and had a message board and fucked</v>

1081
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 5>around in the message board.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what he did was use it as a business</v>

1082
00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 5>vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1083
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.480
<v Speaker 5>Like in a way to actively promote</v>
<v Speaker 5>himself.</v>

1084
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.310
<v Speaker 5>So then somewhere in the mid two</v>
<v Speaker 5>thousands comics started doing internet</v>

1085
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 5>things like little internet shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like crackle was a thing and they were</v>

1086
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:26.570
<v Speaker 5>doing little online things and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>people were working with each other</v>

1087
00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So instead of comics being like</v>

1088
00:42:28.821 --> 00:42:29.920
<v Speaker 5>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were,</v>

1089
00:42:29.921 --> 00:42:32.600
<v Speaker 5>there was camaraderie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were doing each other's stuff.</v>

1090
00:42:32.601 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 5>And then podcasting took it over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>top.</v>

1091
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once that happened then everybody</v>

1092
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:37.371
<v Speaker 5>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1093
00:42:37.371 --> 00:42:38.810
<v Speaker 5>you could really help each other.</v>

1094
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't have to use,</v>

1095
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I feel like in between there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1096
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.990
<v Speaker 3>one thing you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing you left out was the amount of</v>

1097
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:46.940
<v Speaker 3>the rise of what you call the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian,</v>

1098
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.510
<v Speaker 3>which where they just kind of would make</v>
<v Speaker 3>blogs and they had people that would</v>

1099
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.780
<v Speaker 3>edit them so that they would be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Like you and I have come up over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1101
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:59.150
<v Speaker 3>20 odd years doing standup where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn timing,</v>

1102
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 3>you learn how to read an audience to ebb</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the flow,</v>

1103
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:04.010
<v Speaker 3>your brain waves and how to pick when to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say something.</v>

1104
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 3>And how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1105
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:07.640
<v Speaker 3>because timing is everything with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with uh,</v>

1106
00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 3>an Internet video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have an editor just go,</v>

1107
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.370
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1108
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.851

1109
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:12.260

<v Speaker 3>He should have said that faster.</v>

1110
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.350
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this thing that kind of vaunted</v>

1111
00:43:15.351 --> 00:43:16.910
<v Speaker 3>these kids into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1112
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:22.060
<v Speaker 3>youtube millionaires if they were lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes they'd go on the road and</v>

1113
00:43:22.281 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 3>people were like something that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on and every single time they'd eat</v>

1114
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 3>plates of Shit.</v>

1115
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like learning karate in your</v>

1116
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:32.300
<v Speaker 3>basement.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that you put up online of those,</v>

<v Speaker 3>primary way these people were doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>these blogs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1136

<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

1142

1145
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:34.200
<v Speaker 3>me in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched a couple people recently</v>

1146
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 3>tried to transfer that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing stuff in front of a microphone in</v>

1147
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:41.880
<v Speaker 3>front of a video camera to going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage for the first time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1151
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.430
<v Speaker 3>it kind of breaks the covenant of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>audience because anytime,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

1153

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you still get nervous?</v>

1157
00:44:56.191 --> 00:44:56.581
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1159
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 3>I'd be a sociopath if I didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous almost every time.</v>

1160
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

1161
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.550
<v Speaker 3>you fight through it and it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I always tell him,</v>

1162

<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1393
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:57.000
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this guy was like,</v>

1394
00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it like 12 years or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1395
00:53:59.041 --> 00:54:01.160
<v Speaker 3>And Andrew was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the message to be finished.</v>

1396
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:01.951
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would give up,</v>

1397
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:03.540
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would honestly give up because this</v>

1398
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 3>business will eat you alive.</v>

1399
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.600
<v Speaker 3>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is something,</v>

1400
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a sensitive guy.</v>

1401
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the heart to say that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone to just say back it up and move</v>

1402
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:13.660
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1403
00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 3>it ain't for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1404
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 3>But Andrea was saying that and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like,</v>

1405
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1406
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.720
<v Speaker 3>I appreciated his honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1407
00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

1408
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:25.650
<v Speaker 3>I just think that it requires an</v>
<v Speaker 3>obsession.</v>

1409
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give,</v>

1410
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:31.260
<v Speaker 3>you're not like fully obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're probably not going to put the</v>

1411
00:54:31.261 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 3>thought process and the effort and do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're not going to survive.</v>

1412
00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:37.680
<v Speaker 3>The bombings know the bombings like</v>
<v Speaker 3>their test your soul.</v>

1413
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just nothing worse than feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>that amount of hate.</v>

1414
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:42.301
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1415
00:54:42.301 --> 00:54:46.750
<v Speaker 3>where I ever been in New York and a dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>silence and hearing a guy in the back,</v>

1416
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.820
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1417
00:54:47.821 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 3>you fucking kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we fucking go home now?</v>

1418
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.470
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ,</v>

1419
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.500
<v Speaker 6>like audibly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>audibly,</v>

1420
00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:53.980
<v Speaker 6>and the</v>

1421
00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:55.330
<v Speaker 3>silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1422
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.390
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hear that guy in my dreams.</v>

1423
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.910
<v Speaker 3>It is bombing on stage once and this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was nothing I could say.</v>

1426
00:55:06.341 --> 00:55:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I didn't never respond like not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can say,</v>

1476
00:57:07.811 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 3>bid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she throws her head back and then she's</v>

<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

1481
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:19.360
<v Speaker 3>that's a fun soda to cry when she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all of a sudden white best feeling</v>

1482
00:57:19.361 --> 00:57:20.860
<v Speaker 3>gave in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was the booze,</v>

1483
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.770
<v Speaker 3>the booze kicked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many without booze?</v>

1484
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a struggle.</v>

1485
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:27.370
<v Speaker 3>That would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean our whole job is entertaining</v>

1486
00:57:27.371 --> 00:57:29.740
<v Speaker 3>drinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what it would be like if we had</v>

1487
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:32.110
<v Speaker 3>liquor free comedy nights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you played?</v>

1488
00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.940
<v Speaker 3>You have to have played like those we'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>rooms.</v>

1489
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are too crazy or insane.</v>

1490
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 3>We did the Toronto one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the underground room.</v>

1491
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.550
<v Speaker 3>There was no air for the candles on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>

1492
00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 3>The candles were running on a promissory</v>
<v Speaker 3>note.</v>

1493
00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 3>There was no oxygen in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all just weed smoke.</v>

1494
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:52.720
<v Speaker 3>I was on stage midway through jokes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>having second thoughts about it.</v>

1495
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Like every linear thought was a tree</v>
<v Speaker 3>branch that was growing where I'm like,</v>

1496
00:57:56.111 --> 00:57:57.550
<v Speaker 3>which one would follow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1497
00:57:57.551 --> 00:57:59.200
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I already talk about?</v>

1498
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.063
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1500
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Am I covered?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1501
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 3>I have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys know what I was doing?</v>

1502
00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 3>It was doing it with Tripoli and Tripoli</v>
<v Speaker 3>was sober at the time,</v>

1503
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:13.300
<v Speaker 3>but we walk in this room and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>secondhand smoke is a fucking real</v>

1504
00:58:13.301 --> 00:58:14.170
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>

1505
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't hit a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to wait till after my set.</v>

1506
00:58:16.991 --> 00:58:21.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't like doing comedy high and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt I felt high on stage and it's that</v>

1507
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:23.020
<v Speaker 3>thing where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you just got to run with it.</v>

1508
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.730
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't fight the tide.</v>

1509
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Don't swim upstream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting any better.</v>

1510
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 3>You just got to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

1511
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a show that a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andy Haynes had called midnight run</v>

1512
00:58:33.311 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 3>where you'd smoke right before he got on</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage and you just hit this big joint</v>

1513
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:42.270
<v Speaker 3>and I was doing great and then I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge setup and then my brain just</v>

1514
00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:46.120
<v Speaker 3>the bottom fell out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything fell out,</v>

1515
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:47.710
<v Speaker 3>all ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all thoughts,</v>

1516
00:58:47.711 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 3>my name and I just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1517
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:51.910
<v Speaker 3>and then the girl turns to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to go.</v>

1518
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:55.750
<v Speaker 3>And I walked in the middle of a setup</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it was a crushed any cause</v>

1519
00:58:55.751 --> 00:58:59.180
<v Speaker 3>people were laughing so hard because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just pulled the rip cord.</v>

1520
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I literally was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a parachute that came out my</v>

1521
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:07.420
<v Speaker 3>backpack that pulled me out of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes marijuana is your friend and</v>

1522
00:59:07.421 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it will fuck up your whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>set.</v>

1523
00:59:09.101 --> 00:59:10.660
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes it'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1524
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then people go,</v>

1525
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:13.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>

1526
00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 3>And then you're off on this tangent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you probably would have never been</v>

1527
00:59:16.301 --> 00:59:18.820
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that tangent might be the best part</v>

1528
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:19.810
<v Speaker 3>of that set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1529
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think about people that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1530
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from very regimented backgrounds and</v>

1531
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:25.850
<v Speaker 3>went into the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1532
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:27.770
<v Speaker 3>in the 60s and then hit their first</v>
<v Speaker 3>joint and went,</v>

1533
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:29.520
<v Speaker 3>this is dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1534
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I hate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they,</v>

1535
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:34.010
<v Speaker 3>cause that's the thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found it about marijuana is it</v>

1536
00:59:34.011 --> 00:59:37.520
<v Speaker 3>introduced truths about myself that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>found hard to face.</v>

1537
00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were maneuver my new truth.</v>

1538
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:43.280
<v Speaker 3>They weren't anything big that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was afraid of or something.</v>

1539
00:59:43.281 --> 00:59:45.080
<v Speaker 3>You know that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want to kill someone or</v>

1540
00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:48.390
<v Speaker 3>something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was just little things that we'd</v>

1541
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:50.940
<v Speaker 3>like bubble up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's,</v>

1542
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.090
<v Speaker 3>that's the craziest thing about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>plant to me.</v>

1543
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that it makes you paranoid,</v>

1544
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1545
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:58.810
<v Speaker 3>It's the paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1546
00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like pot.</v>

1547
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:02.990
<v Speaker 3>It makes me paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think it makes you hyper aware</v>

1548
01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:04.850
<v Speaker 3>of all sorts of things you've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>suppressing.</v>

1549
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.710
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when I'm feeling good,</v>

1550
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.290
<v Speaker 3>when I'm happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've been a good person.</v>

1551
01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 3>I've been nice to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done the things I'm supposed to do.</v>

1552
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:14.150
<v Speaker 3>I can get high and I enjoy the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

1553
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 3>But when I got loose ends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1554
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 3>I got things that are fucking with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1555
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:21.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe like something that went wrong in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life or whatever.</v>

1556
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:23.930
<v Speaker 3>And then I smoked pot and then it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets weird.</v>

1557
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I tend to not,</v>

1558
01:00:27.141 --> 01:00:30.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't smoke anymore and get and think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about myself and get worried about me.</v>

1559
01:00:30.111 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 3>I think about the world and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about way too big of issues.</v>

1560
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:36.110
<v Speaker 3>And I work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about maybe we're all fucked and</v>

1561
01:00:36.111 --> 01:00:37.640
<v Speaker 3>you know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you have children?</v>

1562
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.080
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you have children,</v>

1563
01:00:39.081 --> 01:00:40.940
<v Speaker 3>then you start thinking about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1564
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it going to be like for my</v>

1565
01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:45.690
<v Speaker 3>children's children or their children?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're like,</v>

1566
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of toxic world are we going to</v>

1567
01:00:47.661 --> 01:00:48.494
<v Speaker 3>be living in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This progress that we're exhibiting</v>

1569
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:54.230
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it keeps going in the same direction,</v>

1570
01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I think we're living at a level in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>level of anxiety as a human race that</v>

1571
01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:00.950
<v Speaker 3>probably four or five years ago I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been like,</v>

1572
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.470
<v Speaker 3>we can't handle that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're somehow handling it,</v>

1573
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:04.650
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1574
01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were adaptable.</v>

1575
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1576
01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.360
<v Speaker 3>I've definitely learned that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the,</v>

1577
01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:11.030
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of times I,</v>

1578
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:14.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy for comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so thankful that I'm a comedian and</v>

1579
01:01:14.991 --> 01:01:16.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm around comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can kind of just,</v>

1580
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:19.820
<v Speaker 3>she just let the air out of me anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you do before you did comedy?</v>

1581
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.080
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1582
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:21.950
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was,</v>

1583
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:24.080
<v Speaker 3>I was an actor as I was when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

1584
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.590
<v Speaker 3>And then I went to school for acting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I went to Chicago and I got an</v>

1585
01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Improv and stand up and that was it</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I was like,</v>

1586
01:01:29.781 --> 01:01:31.670
<v Speaker 3>I'll still do acting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like this is,</v>

1587
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.820
<v Speaker 3>this is where my heart is with so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more fun.</v>

1588
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:38.240
<v Speaker 3>It's so much more you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so honest and it's so in the</v>

1589
01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:39.074
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1590
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've said this a lot,</v>

1591
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on here and there,</v>

1592
01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:44.050
<v Speaker 3>but there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1593
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 3>when you're on stage and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a bit,</v>

1594
01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:47.600
<v Speaker 3>you've done 50 times and you just drop</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and go,</v>

1595
01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:49.370
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking I had the worst diarrhea</v>

1596
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:50.420
<v Speaker 3>together today or whatever.</v>

1597
01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something that you just share it</v>

1598
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 3>and the crowd goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh cause a defense attorney wrote this</v>

1599
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:57.830
<v Speaker 3>book and one line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>

1600
01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.870
<v Speaker 3>the truth just sounds different in</v>
<v Speaker 3>court.</v>

1601
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 3>It just sounds different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same thing for a comedian</v>

1602
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.400
<v Speaker 3>when a person just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think my wife loves me and</v>

1603
01:02:07.401 --> 01:02:09.770
<v Speaker 3>you'll get a laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like fuck,</v>

1604
01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:11.450
<v Speaker 3>he really believes that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now the crowds like,</v>

1605
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:11.901
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1606
01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:12.591
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1607
01:02:12.591 --> 01:02:13.970
<v Speaker 3>this is the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1608
01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:14.650
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you took the,</v>

1609
01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:17.840
<v Speaker 3>you took the cheetos off the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you've put the roasts down now good.</v>

1610
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Now we have something to chew on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the immediacy of that can't</v>

1611
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:25.560
<v Speaker 3>really be matched Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe life theater shore.</v>

1612
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.820
<v Speaker 3>But standup comedy is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the moment like Buddhism,</v>

1613
01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 3>like steep sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment and in comedy if you're out,</v>

1614
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 3>if you stay out of the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're no longer in the pole position.</v>

1615
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Your car's going to drive off the off</v>
<v Speaker 3>the off the road because the ultimate</v>

1616
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 3>bullshit detector is a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they know far more than they know.</v>

1617
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 3>They know.</v>

1618
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.600
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been reading these articles written</v>

1619
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:49.110
<v Speaker 5>by these angry women about Louis C.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Case comeback and some of them have been</v>

1620
01:02:49.111 --> 01:02:52.830
<v Speaker 5>going to his shows and writing about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

1621
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 5>And one of them that I read today was</v>
<v Speaker 5>from this woman in Pittsburgh.</v>

1622
01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:57.600
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was fascinating.</v>

1623
01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:02.610
<v Speaker 5>She said that he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't allow people to bring cell</v>

1624
01:03:03.031 --> 01:03:03.751
<v Speaker 5>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1625
01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:08.240
<v Speaker 5>they have those yonder pouches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We put you and the woman's her,</v>

1626
01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:13.241
<v Speaker 5>her rationalization of this was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she included me and Dave Chappelle</v>

1627
01:03:13.591 --> 01:03:16.620
<v Speaker 5>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we use those because we know that</v>

1628
01:03:16.621 --> 01:03:19.560
<v Speaker 5>words offend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we don't want the consequences,</v>

1629
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.310
<v Speaker 5>which is not what it is at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1630
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.470
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want people sharing your,</v>

1631
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.810
<v Speaker 5>if your material online because you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>developing it and you're touring with</v>

1632
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like we and jokes are a surprise</v>

1633
01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:32.580
<v Speaker 5>musician doesn't want you recording</v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1634
01:03:32.581 --> 01:03:35.520
<v Speaker 5>just noodling around before they finish</v>
<v Speaker 5>this song.</v>

1635
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:37.500
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it musician's song,</v>

1636
01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 5>the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can hear it over and over and over</v>

1637
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 5>again and it doesn't lose any of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1638
01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:44.100
<v Speaker 5>You want to deploy it more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more to the point.</v>

1639
01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:46.470
<v Speaker 5>But if you have a bit about diapers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1640
01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:50.040
<v Speaker 5>And there's just like a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 5>punchline about a diaper and then they</v>

1641
01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:52.260
<v Speaker 5>already know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know that punchline and you're</v>

1642
01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:55.470
<v Speaker 5>working out how to get to that punchline</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how to set up the bit.</v>

1643
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.440
<v Speaker 5>But someone leaked the audio already</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

1644
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:02.190
<v Speaker 5>Like Louise touring right now with that</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaked set.</v>

1645
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is weird,</v>

1646
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.213
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

1647
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:08.640
<v Speaker 5>All that stuff about the Parkland kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know if he's still doing</v>

1648
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 5>those bits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was doing some of those bits.</v>

1649
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has a bit about losing all the money</v>

1650
01:04:13.561 --> 01:04:14.394
<v Speaker 5>and about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1651
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.440
<v Speaker 5>how he bought a gold watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like those bits,</v>

1652
01:04:16.441 --> 01:04:18.930
<v Speaker 5>like this woman referenced those bits in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the article,</v>

1653
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 5>which means that she went to the show</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's doing the material from the</v>

1654
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:25.110
<v Speaker 5>leak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which he kind of has to do because he's</v>

1655
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:28.680
<v Speaker 5>only if you wrote an hour over the last</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 months,</v>

1656
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.390
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been hiatus.</v>

1657
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.950
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does he do?</v>

1658
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.040
<v Speaker 5>Like what you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's touring shows you're going to tour</v>

1659
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.280
<v Speaker 5>with a whole new hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

1660
01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:38.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1661
01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:38.490
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1662
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he's,</v>

1663
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:43.830
<v Speaker 3>he's quite obviously a special case</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of his behavior,</v>

1664
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:46.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like,</v>

1665
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:49.020
<v Speaker 3>I will say that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1666
01:04:49.021 --> 01:04:50.340
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1667
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I have my problems with Louie and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's done and everything.</v>

1668
01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:56.550
<v Speaker 3>But overall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the side of free speech.</v>

1669
01:04:56.551 --> 01:05:01.551
<v Speaker 3>And in terms of being comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't allow you to come in and film</v>

1670
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:04.350
<v Speaker 3>our shit or recorded no matter who it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1671
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

1672
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.510
<v Speaker 3>the larger thing is like everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing with comedy is everyone,</v>

1673
01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:11.190
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone thinks they're an expert.</v>

1674
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.050
<v Speaker 3>There's no other art form or someone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1675
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.950
<v Speaker 3>I know what the best shit is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I got a friend funnier than you.</v>

1676
01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in all fairness,</v>

1677
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:19.900
<v Speaker 3>if I go to see a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a movie maker,</v>

1678
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:21.940
<v Speaker 3>but if I go to see a movie and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks,</v>

1679
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:22.960
<v Speaker 3>I should be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1680
01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:23.794
<v Speaker 3>that movie blue.</v>

1681
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:26.380
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not allowed to go on set and</v>

1682
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:30.910
<v Speaker 3>filming yourself while they're filming</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're also not allowed to bootleg</v>

1683
01:05:30.911 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 3>it and then put it online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't go to jail.</v>

1684
01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.340
<v Speaker 3>And it really will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.300
<v Speaker 3>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1687
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:37.960
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that record our stuff like,</v>

1688
01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:40.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stan hopeless was tweeting about that.</v>

1689
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is this legal right after a louis</v>

1690
01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1691
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:43.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1692
01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:46.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chappelle has that thing that like the</v>

1693
01:05:46.091 --> 01:05:48.340
<v Speaker 3>comedy works has where you come in with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your cell phone,</v>

1694
01:05:48.341 --> 01:05:49.660
<v Speaker 3>they put it in a locked pouch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1695
01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 3>You get the Combo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get it when you leave.</v>

1696
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:56.860
<v Speaker 3>I was doing that before I did my netflix</v>
<v Speaker 3>special bar was only doing it to really,</v>

1697
01:05:56.861 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 3>because I was tightening up my set and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want any of it getting leaked</v>

1698
01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:04.210
<v Speaker 3>right before the Netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once I filmed it,</v>

1699
01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:05.920
<v Speaker 3>then I stopped doing it because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1700
01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:09.430
<v Speaker 3>it's too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too complicated and it's just like the</v>

1701
01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Internet is going to be the internet.</v>

1702
01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did make the show better though.</v>

1703
01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it did make it better.</v>

1704
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll realize in Miami,</v>

1705
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:23.400
<v Speaker 3>people are there such chimps that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kept getting up and walking out and</v>

1706
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:27.310
<v Speaker 3>to check their phone so they'd get up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd go out to get their phone,</v>

1707
01:06:27.311 --> 01:06:30.190
<v Speaker 3>they come back and so they were all just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like popping up and down.</v>

1708
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:32.800
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's just trying to fuck and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>coke in Miami.</v>

1709
01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:37.390
<v Speaker 3>Miami will always be more insane than</v>
<v Speaker 3>any given American city.</v>

1710
01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:41.360
<v Speaker 3>It's just on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's forever young forever.</v>

1711
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:43.960
<v Speaker 3>It's forever 21 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is like that.</v>

1712
01:06:43.961 --> 01:06:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Like the name of that city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a cocaine city.</v>

1713
01:06:47.911 --> 01:06:50.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's created by cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more banks per capita in Miami</v>

1714
01:06:50.951 --> 01:06:53.320
<v Speaker 3>who I know in anywhere else because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>will cocaine laundering.</v>

<v Speaker 3>talking about bordain before and I will</v>

1730
01:07:17.861 --> 01:07:21.370
<v Speaker 3>not say what the joke is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that guy is such an alchemist.</v>

1731
01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Like he can just make gold out of lead</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of,</v>

1732
01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:26.790
<v Speaker 3>in terms of material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a board,</v>

1733
01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:31.791
<v Speaker 3>Dane joke that made me double over</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing about the suicide and wasn't</v>

1734
01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:37.140
<v Speaker 3>talking about bordain per se.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But about his own family member.</v>

1735
01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:38.741
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1736
01:07:38.741 --> 01:07:40.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to blow the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

1737
01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:43.450
<v Speaker 3>it was that thing where a apologies to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are listening to this.</v>

1738
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I know you want me to say what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1739
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:46.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably gonna do,</v>

1740
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:47.440
<v Speaker 3>doing a special show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do that,</v>

1741
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.040
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's testament to how with comedy</v>

1742
01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:52.650
<v Speaker 3>there's always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always a,</v>

1743
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:54.880
<v Speaker 3>a mission impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always a topic,</v>

1744
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:57.250
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot make fun of this.</v>

1745
01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 3>And someone found a way and it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful and I was just like,</v>

1746
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:02.770
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:05.050
<v Speaker 3>he'll just say these setups that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1748
01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:07.030
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you going with this one?</v>

1749
01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you can't make fun of</v>

1750
01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:11.980
<v Speaker 3>something is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just you just,</v>

1751
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 3>you might do it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone can do it,</v>

1752
01:08:14.801 --> 01:08:15.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1753
01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1754
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>it might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might not be your style,</v>

1755
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.420
<v Speaker 2>but someone can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1756
01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:21.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got,</v>

1757
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.040
<v Speaker 2>there's so many weird styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the beautiful things about comedy</v>

1758
01:08:25.041 --> 01:08:27.370
<v Speaker 2>is the fact that styles are so personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1759
01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like David Tail might be able to do a</v>

1760
01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:30.380
<v Speaker 2>bit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sebastian could not do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not in his wheelhouse.</v>

1762
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:36.110
<v Speaker 2>David tell is prob probably the funniest</v>
<v Speaker 2>man on earth.</v>

<v Speaker 2>magician.</v>

1765
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.970

<v Speaker 2>he's so prolific.</v>

1766
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just always writing,</v>

1767
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.530
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always tone tuning things.</v>

1768
01:08:47.531 --> 01:08:48.920
<v Speaker 2>He'll call you up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1769
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:50.090
<v Speaker 2>you ever heard something like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>before?</v>

1770
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1771
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.510
<v Speaker 2>it'll come to oils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to make sure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

1774
01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Comedy is so beautiful in that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is an art form that you cannot</v>

1775
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:01.850
<v Speaker 2>learn anywhere.</v>

1776
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to learn it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can learn how to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clarinet.</v>

1778
01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:09.230
<v Speaker 2>You go and take classes and practice</v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

1779
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I've ever created anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could play beautiful clarinet</v>

1780
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:13.844
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1781
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't have to ever have</v>
<v Speaker 2>invented a single song and you could</v>

1782
01:09:17.391 --> 01:09:20.240
<v Speaker 2>just go out there and make a living</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the clarinet.</v>

1783
01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Well and you don't learn to play a</v>
<v Speaker 2>clarinet in front of an audience.</v>

1784
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't bring it to the clarinet open</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1785
01:09:26.010 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to learn in front of people.</v>

1786
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.820
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1787
01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:32.390

<v Speaker 2>play flight of the Bumblebee right away.</v>

1788
01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else we have to learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of people like that?</v>

1789
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even basketball,</v>

1790
01:09:37.701 --> 01:09:40.700
<v Speaker 2>you practice in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There might be a couple of friends</v>

1791
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:41.650
<v Speaker 2>hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>only our from,</v>

1794
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I can think of that you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only get better in front of a</v>

1795
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:47.450
<v Speaker 2>crowd.</v>

1796
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:49.250
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy.</v>

1797
01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:52.820
<v Speaker 2>And there's no classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All classes that you take are useless.</v>

1798
01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all taught by fools.</v>

1799
01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're almost sorry folks teaching</v>

1800
01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.460
<v Speaker 2>comedy class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends who have,</v>

1801
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:00.510
<v Speaker 2>who have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1802
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.410
<v Speaker 2>John Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right stuff online that I think is</v>

1803
01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:06.710
<v Speaker 2>really illuminating to teach you what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the business is really like and,</v>

1804
01:10:06.711 --> 01:10:09.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what the best comedy is from a</v>

1805
01:10:09.261 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 2>comedian's perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's not,</v>

1806
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:13.850
<v Speaker 2>he just puts them up there for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not sitting in a room,</v>

1807
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 2>someone can give you a coat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a good comic and coach you.</v>

1808
01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can say,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1810
01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:19.910

<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1811
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe that would be an easier way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Neal Brennan is that genius that</v>

1812
01:10:23.451 --> 01:10:25.460
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did that for,</v>

1813
01:10:25.461 --> 01:10:28.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a show where a guy who was,</v>

1814
01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.710
<v Speaker 2>he was more of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's entertaining,</v>

1815
01:10:30.711 --> 01:10:32.800
<v Speaker 2>but he's his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his delivery and stuff was kind of like</v>

1816
01:10:32.801 --> 01:10:33.410
<v Speaker 2>a Ted talk.</v>

1817
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:34.370
<v Speaker 2>And he was doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1818
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.830
<v Speaker 2>he's going to do a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did a pilot where it was just him</v>

1819
01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:38.510
<v Speaker 2>kind of talking about the news and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1820
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:42.510
<v Speaker 2>and basically I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brought me in to kind of just</v>

1821
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.480
<v Speaker 2>loosen them up to make it,</v>

1823
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:48.960
<v Speaker 2>party or a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was dancing at the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

1967
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.640
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not doing anything now.</v>

1968
01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just telegraphing every punch.</v>

1969
01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's letting him punch him.</v>

1970
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 2>He's just because they're all drunk as</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit to,</v>

1971
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:15.790
<v Speaker 2>they're bumping into him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

1972
01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's guiding nudge in the morning or</v>

1973
01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:19.540
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a Dick.</v>

1974
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:20.374
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1975
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.910
<v Speaker 2>that's what could have happened in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

1976
01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:26.590
<v Speaker 2>You have to send this to me because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like my friend Vince Averil,</v>

1977
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.940
<v Speaker 2>who's a comedian from the Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got that same kind of balding,</v>

1978
01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.990
<v Speaker 2>same size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like punching little kits.</v>

1979
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1980
01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.380
<v Speaker 2>a giant punching little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite videos of a bar is a</v>

1981
01:16:38.381 --> 01:16:42.400
<v Speaker 2>girl and a guy and the guy had gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl's face and she grabs his,</v>

1982
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.740
<v Speaker 2>his collar and headbutts some</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>

1983
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.100
<v Speaker 2>She grabs and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1984
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drops.</v>

1985
01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:50.860
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that bitch must've grown up in a</v>

1986
01:16:50.861 --> 01:16:53.140
<v Speaker 2>hard family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This too.</v>

1987
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Cause this guy is way bigger than her</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a dangerous thing to try and</v>

1988
01:16:57.041 --> 01:17:01.780
<v Speaker 2>she just grabs his collar and fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 2>slams her forehead right into his nose.</v>

1989
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with that if you're a</v>

1990
01:17:03.671 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 2>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1991

<v Speaker 2>well not that it's excused but don't do</v>

1992
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like you're giving bad advice.</v>

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:54.820
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was child support.</v>

2191
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Is that what got him in the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>because no,</v>

2192
01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it got him cause he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>avoiding it.</v>

2193
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:05.410
<v Speaker 2>He never should have wrapped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a baby by me baby be a millionaire.</v>

2194
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll write the check for the baby comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck cares.</v>

2195
01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So like he said that since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're setting yourself up there.</v>

2196
01:25:10.481 --> 01:25:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I guess he cares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2197
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing is after a while when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a hit record out in like a</v>

2198
01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:18.220
<v Speaker 2>decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2199
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:21.220
<v Speaker 2>You're like hey this shit could dry up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe I need to go bankrupt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop paying these ladies and he's,</v>

2201
01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:29.620
<v Speaker 2>it's a cash only business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably has it all hidden.</v>

2202
01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he bought the vitamin water thing</v>

2203
01:25:32.741 --> 01:25:34.210
<v Speaker 2>isn't cash only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how,</v>

2204
01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that guy is a dollar</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent.</v>

2205
01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:39.520
<v Speaker 2>So you're bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really is I think,</v>

2206
01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I think your theory is probably sound of</v>
<v Speaker 2>him just being like,</v>

2207
01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:46.360
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was literally because of</v>

2208
01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2209
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Like someone was trying to hit him up</v>
<v Speaker 2>either for alimony or child support and</v>

2210
01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:51.160
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an idea,</v>

2211
01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to hire some financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>wizards.</v>

2212
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorcery.</v>

2213
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dig a hole buried in the ground.</v>

2214
01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:01.960
<v Speaker 2>It is weird that people give people</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2215
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you break up and go,</v>

2216
01:26:04.371 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now you got to give them money.</v>

2217
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I get it if you have a child to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

2218
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2219
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:14.210
<v Speaker 2>But like if you dated someone for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of years and then you married him</v>

2220
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:16.910
<v Speaker 2>and then why you're married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you made $1 million that didn't make</v>

2221
01:26:16.911 --> 01:26:18.110
<v Speaker 2>anything and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2222
01:26:18.111 --> 01:26:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I want to have that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2223
01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Three strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not together anymore.</v>

2224
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:22.281
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2225
01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:22.880
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2226
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I want money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want money from you.</v>

2227
01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to do half of my set on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road for now on?</v>

2228
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.651
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2229
01:26:28.651 --> 01:26:28.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2230
01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.100
<v Speaker 2>But I want you to support my lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2231
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:33.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to a certain lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that gets me,</v>

2232
01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.990
<v Speaker 2>that people used to a certain lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

2233
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:37.370
<v Speaker 2>the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>certain lifestyle and that was all over</v>

2238
01:26:46.671 --> 01:26:48.440
<v Speaker 2>the news and it was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you cannot change.</v>

2241
01:26:52.611 --> 01:26:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you could live a middle</v>

2242
01:26:55.491 --> 01:26:58.130
<v Speaker 2>class life anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that those days are done.</v>

2262
01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.600
<v Speaker 2>shutdown and yelling at yelling at it,</v>

01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:42.830
<v Speaker 2>whoever's filming them on Tmz and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think about the person that's in</v>

2265
01:27:42.831 --> 01:27:47.180
<v Speaker 2>like group D for that plane where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>call you and it's just like you and like</v>

2266
01:27:47.181 --> 01:27:50.630
<v Speaker 2>a stray dog that gets left on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was he saying he wasn't flying private</v>

2267
01:27:50.631 --> 01:27:53.600
<v Speaker 2>because the money wasn't flowing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy was low?</v>

2268
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was his point.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to see about a job offer and Tulsa.</v>

2272

<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys.</v>

2273
01:28:04.311 --> 01:28:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Like he had some fucking billboard on</v>
<v Speaker 2>sunset.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He keeps the line.</v>

2278
01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:16.640

<v Speaker 2>He didn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he do?</v>

2286
01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.560
<v Speaker 2>It was 2008 because the gas prices were</v>
<v Speaker 2>too high so he stopped flying private.</v>

2294
01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.680

01:32:39.551 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what always Fripp freaks me out.</v>

2389
01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.840
<v Speaker 3>But like it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my handle would bounce off the wall and</v>

2390
01:32:43.841 --> 01:32:45.910
<v Speaker 3>it would just fly somewhere weird in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

2391
01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:50.940
<v Speaker 3>The guy grabs the knife by the blade</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this and it always lands with the</v>

2392
01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:54.130
<v Speaker 3>blade in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine someone threw a knife at you and</v>

2393
01:32:54.131 --> 01:32:55.570
<v Speaker 3>the handle hit like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2394
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.580
<v Speaker 3>oh bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just gave him a knife.</v>

2395
01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.650
<v Speaker 3>This knife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to hold off after your</v>

2396
01:33:00.710 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 3>death grip and slide in your rib cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you mentioned this yesterday,</v>

2397
01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:06.280
<v Speaker 3>but did someone duals that were in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of duals?</v>

2398
01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.080
<v Speaker 3>I heard a stat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

2399
01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I never knew about it that Andrew</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson was in something like a hundred</v>

2400
01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:13.870
<v Speaker 3>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he only killed one person.</v>

2401
01:33:13.871 --> 01:33:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I thought he killed a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually get shot in the arm or like,</v>

2402
01:33:17.371 --> 01:33:20.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a musket ball would go your leg,</v>

2403
01:33:20.541 --> 01:33:22.510
<v Speaker 3>or the one where he killed the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually,</v>

2404
01:33:22.511 --> 01:33:24.520
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the guy's name,</v>

2405
01:33:24.521 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 3>but he was known as being a really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>doula.</v>

2406
01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:29.230
<v Speaker 3>He killed a lots of p like 26 people or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2407
01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:34.090
<v Speaker 3>So he challenged this guy and he thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way to win would be to let him</v>

2408
01:33:34.091 --> 01:33:36.880
<v Speaker 3>take the first shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he let him take the first shot,</v>

2409
01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.160
<v Speaker 3>got hit in the chest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was bleeding,</v>

2410
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:43.540
<v Speaker 3>covered the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then shot the guy and he died.</v>

2411
01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shot him in the head of the city,</v>

2412
01:33:45.461 --> 01:33:48.580
<v Speaker 3>fell immediately and then died like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple hours later I think.</v>

2413
01:33:48.581 --> 01:33:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he was the president at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

2414
01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:55.540
<v Speaker 3>but the doctor said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you stood and took that</v>

2415
01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:59.230
<v Speaker 3>shot and he said if he shot me in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain I wasn't going to stand and take</v>

2416
01:33:59.231 --> 01:34:00.820
<v Speaker 3>that shot to kill this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you said like</v>

2417
01:34:00.821 --> 01:34:03.470
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like Andrew Jackson was crazy guy.</v>

2418
01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.110
<v Speaker 3>He's a crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where his,</v>

2419
01:34:05.111 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 3>where he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the statue of him is and I'm in</v>

2420
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Jackson Square in New Orleans.</v>

2421
01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.260
<v Speaker 3>There's that church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this behind it and that,</v>

2422
01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:15.340
<v Speaker 3>this is why New Orleans is supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most haunted city is because they'd</v>

2423
01:34:15.341 --> 01:34:20.230
<v Speaker 3>had the most duals because once Andrew</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson contacted John Laffite and was</v>

2424
01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:21.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need an army.</v>

2425
01:34:21.191 --> 01:34:22.660
<v Speaker 3>And John the feet was basically a</v>
<v Speaker 3>gangster,</v>

2426
01:34:22.661 --> 01:34:24.610
<v Speaker 3>which is basically someone that can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>you anything.</v>

2427
01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what a connected guy does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he got him freed slaves,</v>

2428
01:34:28.421 --> 01:34:30.820
<v Speaker 3>native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creoles cajuns and just,</v>

2429
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:33.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry men and they repelled the British.</v>

2430
01:34:33.431 --> 01:34:37.360
<v Speaker 3>But then they stayed and they just lived</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the bars and they were dual happy</v>

2431
01:34:37.361 --> 01:34:40.900
<v Speaker 3>because their egos were so big and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked for these and I can't find him.</v>

2432
01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:44.650
<v Speaker 3>What they had was dueling cards where if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had one it would say Joe Rogan have</v>

2433
01:34:44.651 --> 01:34:47.500
<v Speaker 3>your face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know probably that image and it</v>

2434
01:34:47.501 --> 01:34:50.500
<v Speaker 3>would say you know dueling card and</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone bumped into you and you were</v>

2435
01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just give them your card and be</v>

2436
01:34:51.821 --> 01:34:53.470
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see you in the morning and mother fucker</v>

2437
01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.390
<v Speaker 3>and that means we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're shooting it out.</v>

2438
01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would do over.</v>

2439
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2440
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.710
<v Speaker 5>the guy I went in this go this ghost</v>
<v Speaker 5>tour and the guy taught me,</v>

2441
01:35:00.711 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 5>they told me this story and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine the amount of guys who are hung</v>

2442
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:06.080
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I woke up like,</v>

2443
01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:07.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did I do?</v>

2444
01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:11.210
<v Speaker 5>I've got a dual now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you'd go behind that cemetery.</v>

2445
01:35:11.211 --> 01:35:14.810
<v Speaker 5>That's where they'd have their dual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And imagine laying there with a bullet</v>

2446
01:35:14.811 --> 01:35:17.150
<v Speaker 5>or a piece of round led and your liver</v>
<v Speaker 5>and calling like,</v>

2447
01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm dead over this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stepped on my foot.</v>

2448
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:22.560
<v Speaker 5>They'd keep cards like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2449
01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just like a picture of one.</v>

2450
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:26.900
<v Speaker 5>They also said that lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times the uh,</v>

2451
01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:30.020
<v Speaker 5>the dual wouldn't actually happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they might not actually shoot.</v>

2452
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.510
<v Speaker 5>It was more of a test of will of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2453
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:34.610
<v Speaker 5>will you just go through with it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2454
01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:37.400
<v Speaker 5>it was all honor and they'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>bring a second guy to make to like</v>

2455
01:35:37.401 --> 01:35:40.670
<v Speaker 5>verify that the dual actually went down</v>
<v Speaker 5>and said one was a pussy or whatever.</v>

2456
01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:42.350
<v Speaker 5>You serious?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like the judge,</v>

2457
01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.700
<v Speaker 5>he's laying odds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2458
01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.520
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2459
01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 5>there's certain states were duals or</v>
<v Speaker 5>legal.</v>

2460
01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:53.570
<v Speaker 5>I think there's still legal in Arizona</v>
<v Speaker 5>or they used to be because there was a</v>

2461
01:35:53.571 --> 01:35:57.530
<v Speaker 5>cop who shot someone in a dual like</v>
<v Speaker 5>years back.</v>

2462
01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.590
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:59.960
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a weird thing.</v>

2464
01:35:59.961 --> 01:36:04.250
<v Speaker 5>Like a cop was off duty and he shot</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone in a dual,</v>

2465
01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.520
<v Speaker 5>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say this is more than 10 years</v>

2466
01:36:07.521 --> 01:36:08.840
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So maybe they changed the law,</v>

2467
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:12.730
<v Speaker 5>but I remember reading that going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you can you do all that shit.</v>

2472
01:36:24.291 --> 01:36:26.560

<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

2473
01:36:26.650 --> 01:36:31.280
<v Speaker 5>cause I know I watched a video of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude who was a mma fighter.</v>

2474

01:39:04.611 --> 01:39:05.690
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that guy had to be a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat me so bad.</v>

2533
01:39:08.001 --> 01:39:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I shit myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that always gets me because it's</v>

2534
01:39:11.241 --> 01:39:13.400
<v Speaker 2>that thing where it's like when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight someone who's whatever,</v>

2535
01:39:13.401 --> 01:39:13.881
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2536
01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:15.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a fight but like when you fight a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro,</v>

2537
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:18.290
<v Speaker 2>it's just done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like playing basketball if you</v>

2538
01:39:18.291 --> 01:39:19.900
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to play basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2539
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:24.230
<v Speaker 2>What a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y'all place one on one and you don't</v>

2540
01:39:24.231 --> 01:39:26.590
<v Speaker 2>even know how to dribble this guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>dunking on him.</v>

2541
01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Like Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why did I agree to this?</v>

2542
01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Is there a state where it's legal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dual but there's no firearm?</v>

2543
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:35.931
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2544
01:39:35.931 --> 01:39:40.310
<v Speaker 2>how long ago was it still legal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The late 18 hundreds I believe so.</v>

2545
01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.680
<v Speaker 2>So maybe this guy did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a cop.</v>

2546
01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:45.680
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a dual with a guy who was fucking</v>

2547
01:39:45.681 --> 01:39:46.820
<v Speaker 2>his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2548
01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's up.</v>

2549
01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:49.973
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2550
01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.760
<v Speaker 2>And he just killed the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2551
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the story entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he definitely killed somebody.</v>

2552
01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when was he was a cop.</v>

2553
01:39:58.791 --> 01:40:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I remember the whole story being that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was very controversial,</v>

2554
01:40:01.281 --> 01:40:02.660
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was legal.</v>

2555
01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm remembering it all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2556
01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:08.960
<v Speaker 2>It might've been more than 10 years ago.</v>

2557
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Five places where it's okay to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone states.</v>

2558
01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2559
01:40:15.311 --> 01:40:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like international waters.</v>

2560
01:40:17.650 --> 01:40:19.780
<v Speaker 2>You get to a duel and unlike a cruise</v>
<v Speaker 2>ship.</v>

2561
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:22.120
<v Speaker 2>So how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're on one of them,</v>

2562
01:40:22.121 --> 01:40:25.150
<v Speaker 2>carnival cruises and some guy in salts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your name and throws Jello at you.</v>

2563
01:40:25.190 --> 01:40:26.950
<v Speaker 2>The laws of the ship or whichever</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2564
01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I know about the international waters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a cruise ship would be out and</v>

2565
01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:33.190
<v Speaker 2>that's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

2566
01:40:33.191 --> 01:40:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about cruise ships that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be on the deck when some guy</v>

2567
01:40:35.861 --> 01:40:40.270
<v Speaker 2>throws his wife off off the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat and you got to do something like</v>

2568
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:42.460
<v Speaker 2>that does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2569
01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Husband and wife went on a cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wife can went missing.</v>

2570
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to bed early.</v>

2571
01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean Trisha kept partying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2572
01:40:48.551 --> 01:40:50.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had an argument but we are a deeply</v>

2573
01:40:50.471 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 2>in love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2574
01:40:51.970 --> 01:40:54.060
<v Speaker 2>we had a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people saw us</v>

2575
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.060
<v Speaker 5>screaming and a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a,</v>

2576
01:40:55.061 --> 01:40:57.040
<v Speaker 5>and I might have slapped her a couple</v>
<v Speaker 5>times,</v>

2577
01:40:57.041 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy I love her and her disappearing and</v>

2578
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:01.114
<v Speaker 5>what's fucked up.</v>

2579
01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I learned from a buddy of mine who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2580
01:41:03.231 --> 01:41:06.590
<v Speaker 3>he was with did second city Tour Cup</v>
<v Speaker 3>touring company or Turco and they were</v>

2581
01:41:06.591 --> 01:41:10.370
<v Speaker 3>on a cruise ship and he was telling me</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they found out that like all the</v>

2582
01:41:10.371 --> 01:41:13.340
<v Speaker 3>foods you don't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grind it all up and just shoot it</v>

2583
01:41:13.341 --> 01:41:15.530
<v Speaker 3>out in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that attracts game fish and the</v>

2584
01:41:15.531 --> 01:41:18.110
<v Speaker 3>game fish attract sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anytime there's a,</v>

2585
01:41:18.170 --> 01:41:20.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a cruise ship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just sharks all the time.</v>

2586
01:41:21.930 --> 01:41:22.740
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2587
01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.610
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you went overboard,</v>

2588
01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:25.950
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Debts not,</v>

2589
01:41:25.951 --> 01:41:27.540
<v Speaker 5>there's not a lot of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2590
01:41:27.541 --> 01:41:28.620
<v Speaker 5>good Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2591

<v Speaker 5>Hawaii swimming around with the largest</v>

2592
01:41:33.181 --> 01:41:35.310
<v Speaker 5>known great white shark?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's a more than 20 foot long,</v>

2594
01:41:39.331 --> 01:41:41.550
<v Speaker 5>great white shark.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's not like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>women with it.</v>

2596

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the water swimming with it.</v>

2597
01:41:46.290 --> 01:41:47.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got a,</v>

2598
01:41:47.670 --> 01:41:52.670
<v Speaker 5>an instagram page is filled with photos</v>
<v Speaker 5>of her and this shark fuck off.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And she's just swimming alongside this</v>

2601

<v Speaker 5>20 feet long at least.</v>

<v Speaker 5>an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to get rid of two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to find out where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>currently are.</v>

<v Speaker 3>officials.</v>

2617
01:42:34.601 --> 01:42:38.260
<v Speaker 5>arcane logs are still upheld,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's where I'm from.</v>

2618
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.290
<v Speaker 5>I never knew I could have been dueling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All this public official.</v>

2619
01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:42.311
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2620

<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

2621
01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.870
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to scrap the band so</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to reinstate bands to let</v>

2622
01:42:46.871 --> 01:42:49.120
<v Speaker 5>people know how stupid these old laws</v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

2623
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.700
<v Speaker 5>They're still on the books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's a state decided it would not be</v>

2624
01:42:51.701 --> 01:42:54.220
<v Speaker 5>very civil of two members of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>legislature.</v>

2625
01:42:54.730 --> 01:42:58.720
<v Speaker 5>Legislature disagreed and then shot each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other on the front steps of the</v>

2626
01:42:58.721 --> 01:43:00.650
<v Speaker 5>provisional combat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a bad look.</v>

2627
01:43:01.090 --> 01:43:02.560
<v Speaker 5>It's a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2628
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:07.830
<v Speaker 5>It gotta be cool though to see like Ted</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cruz and Paul Ryan standing on back to</v>

2629
01:43:08.351 --> 01:43:11.280
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to use the muskets.</v>

2630
01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:14.800
<v Speaker 5>One coq one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2631
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:20.170
<v Speaker 5>I like in the upper right hand corner</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amaga hat board refuses to apologize and</v>

2632
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:24.070
<v Speaker 5>infuriating interview.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That kid looked drugged and coached,</v>

2633
01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.540
<v Speaker 5>like he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we both,</v>

2634
01:43:25.570 --> 01:43:27.260
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it probably put them on some PROZAC.</v>

2635
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:28.450
<v Speaker 5>Get out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little fellow.</v>

2636
01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:31.180
<v Speaker 5>Apparently that native American guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

2637
01:43:31.210 --> 01:43:33.970
<v Speaker 5>they did an interview with him and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a disaster because he said a bunch</v>

2638
01:43:33.971 --> 01:43:36.130
<v Speaker 5>of things that just absolutely weren't</v>
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>

2639
01:43:36.131 --> 01:43:39.520
<v Speaker 5>And they're questioning whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 5>he actually was in Vietnam.</v>

2640
01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 5>He definitely didn't serve in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he wasn't in combat.</v>

2641
01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:44.720
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2642
01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:49.740
<v Speaker 5>he had some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some conflicting stories and none of</v>

2643
01:43:50.171 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 5>these people were prepared for this kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of attention.</v>

2644
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2691
01:45:55.730 --> 01:45:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do feel they need better supervision,</v>

2692
01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:02.120
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing they do for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there shouldn't be judged publicly</v>

2693
01:46:02.121 --> 01:46:04.730
<v Speaker 3>on a global scale like this shop fair.</v>

2694
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I disagree with uh,</v>

2695
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:10.490
<v Speaker 3>pretty much everything them and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents stand for and stuff,</v>

2696
01:46:10.491 --> 01:46:13.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's their right to demonstrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2697
01:46:13.191 --> 01:46:15.110
<v Speaker 3>So not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they look,</v>

2698
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:20.140
<v Speaker 3>they are too young to know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're even demonstrating about to</v>

2699
01:46:20.481 --> 01:46:24.380
<v Speaker 3>really have a good argument about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like to bring kids to a pro life</v>

2700
01:46:24.381 --> 01:46:28.250
<v Speaker 3>demonstration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have them chant and yelder schools songs</v>

2701
01:46:28.251 --> 01:46:30.050
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put on magna hats.</v>

2702
01:46:30.051 --> 01:46:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole thing is so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

2703
01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.350
<v Speaker 3>well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2704
01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:36.590
<v Speaker 3>back to what I said about anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just we're at each other's fucking</v>

2705
01:46:36.610 --> 01:46:37.670
<v Speaker 3>throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2707
01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:43.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the Internet was built for</v>

2708
01:46:43.101 --> 01:46:45.980
<v Speaker 3>us to tear each other apart because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just throwing darts and running</v>

2709
01:46:45.981 --> 01:46:49.230
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you put us in a room together and</v>

01:46:49.231 --> 01:46:50.400
<v Speaker 3>talk it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2711
01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 3>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we would mano a mano.</v>

2712
01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.330
<v Speaker 3>You'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all want the same thing.</v>

2714
01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deep down inside we all want to take</v>

2715
01:46:57.841 --> 01:46:59.100
<v Speaker 3>care of our kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all want to have fun.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We all want a bountiful life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2717
01:47:01.171 --> 01:47:03.120
<v Speaker 3>But I also say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm also like,</v>

2718
01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:06.570
<v Speaker 3>I love people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I fucking hate people.</v>

2719
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2720
01:47:08.641 --> 01:47:11.340
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you go through a whole day</v>
<v Speaker 3>without speaking to another human being,</v>

2721
01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:12.870
<v Speaker 3>you ever had one of those days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isolation.</v>

2723
01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.890
<v Speaker 3>That was delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only if you have too much though,</v>

2724
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get,</v>

2725
01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.160
<v Speaker 3>get around people too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then those game days where you just,</v>

2726
01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:23.660
<v Speaker 3>you could just recharge and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate people when you see him.</v>

2727
01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

2728
01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:26.310
<v Speaker 3>do you ever get that where you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you go to,</v>

2729
01:47:26.311 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 3>you're on the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store and you're like,</v>

2730
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:28.830
<v Speaker 3>I want to fucking go.</v>

2731
01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go up right now.</v>

2732
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's masked with me.</v>

2733
01:47:31.771 --> 01:47:35.580
<v Speaker 3>But it's like that with therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy sometimes.</v>

2734
01:47:35.581 --> 01:47:38.370
<v Speaker 3>And the gym sometimes where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fucking go,</v>

2735
01:47:38.371 --> 01:47:40.500
<v Speaker 3>but every time I'm glad I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2736
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have a set where I'd eat shit</v>

2737
01:47:43.531 --> 01:47:45.360
<v Speaker 3>and I'll drive home laughing and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2738
01:47:45.361 --> 01:47:48.120
<v Speaker 3>well that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that bothers me most about</v>

2739
01:47:48.121 --> 01:47:51.960
<v Speaker 3>this is that they wanted the docs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kids and po address out there</v>

2740
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:54.570
<v Speaker 3>favor of that ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so foolish ever.</v>

2741
01:47:54.690 --> 01:47:57.780
<v Speaker 3>And they're treating them like they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>rational adults that are,</v>

2742
01:47:57.781 --> 01:48:00.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking 50 years old.</v>

2743
01:48:00.441 --> 01:48:01.640
<v Speaker 3>It really know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2744
01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:03.270
<v Speaker 3>and it's not going to solve anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's new.</v>

2745
01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:06.330
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to convert these kids'</v>
<v Speaker 3>hearts and minds by ruining their lives.</v>

2746
01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.380
<v Speaker 3>I do understand the double standard we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have had with like black youth though,</v>

2747
01:48:10.381 --> 01:48:11.680
<v Speaker 3>where it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2748
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:14.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kid gets strangled to death for</v>

2749
01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:15.240
<v Speaker 3>selling cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

2750
01:48:15.241 --> 01:48:15.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a criminal.</v>

2751
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:17.430
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

2752
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:19.770
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas these kids honestly,</v>

2753
01:48:19.771 --> 01:48:21.780
<v Speaker 3>cause they're wider getting chance after</v>
<v Speaker 3>chance after chance,</v>

2754
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:23.850
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think their last should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>ruined.</v>

2755
01:48:23.970 --> 01:48:24.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we've,</v>

2756
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:26.820
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked enough about it.</v>

2757
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.950
<v Speaker 3>These kids did what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's move on.</v>

2758
01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you know,</v>

2759
01:48:30.330 --> 01:48:31.950
<v Speaker 3>who knows what they're getting chance</v>
<v Speaker 3>after chance.</v>

2760
01:48:31.951 --> 01:48:36.690
<v Speaker 3>But during this situation like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the consequences of social</v>

2761
01:48:36.691 --> 01:48:38.430
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you could take a video of</v>

2762
01:48:38.431 --> 01:48:41.310
<v Speaker 3>someone doing something incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid when they're 16 years old.</v>

2763
01:48:41.311 --> 01:48:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they did was not even that</v>

2764
01:48:42.901 --> 01:48:45.060
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All he did to stand there and smirk and</v>

2765
01:48:45.061 --> 01:48:45.894
<v Speaker 3>people wanted him.</v>

2766
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:49.460
<v Speaker 3>He was being a shithead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like I keep a yc,</v>

2767
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:52.110
<v Speaker 3>if he's just standing there and someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes up to him beating a drum,</v>

2768
01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:53.720
<v Speaker 3>how are you supposed to react?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the,</v>

2769
01:48:53.721 --> 01:48:55.920
<v Speaker 3>how do you think you would react?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the kid walked up to the</v>

2770
01:48:55.921 --> 01:48:58.440
<v Speaker 3>native Americans didn't correct</v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrect.</v>

2771
01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.560
<v Speaker 3>The kid was standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the native American walked up to him and</v>

2772
01:49:01.570 --> 01:49:02.403
<v Speaker 3>the drama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2773
01:49:02.410 --> 01:49:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Walked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got rid of the video with sound.</v>

2774
01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:05.280
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

2775
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:07.510
<v Speaker 3>The guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kid wasn't in the video where the</v>

2776
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:10.680
<v Speaker 3>native American gentlemen was standing</v>
<v Speaker 3>there playing his drum and there are</v>

2777
01:49:10.681 --> 01:49:13.620
<v Speaker 3>kids around him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that kid that the main kid wasn't</v>

2778
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:14.490
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he walked,</v>

2779
01:49:14.491 --> 01:49:16.110
<v Speaker 3>he ended up walking up to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2780
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with the video that I saw,</v>

2781
01:49:18.450 --> 01:49:21.360
<v Speaker 3>the kid was standing there and that guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>walked up to him.</v>

2782
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is two hours.</v>

2783
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:26.670
<v Speaker 3>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's video of these people that's two</v>

2784
01:49:26.671 --> 01:49:29.850
<v Speaker 3>hours long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the video that I saw,</v>

2785
01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.350
<v Speaker 3>those kids were standing there chanting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that guy walked to those kids and</v>

2786
01:49:34.351 --> 01:49:39.240
<v Speaker 3>was beating his drum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that one specific kid walked down,</v>

2787
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:43.620
<v Speaker 3>but still that guy instigated it by</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking to them beating the drum.</v>

2788
01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy got in that kid's face and beat</v>

2789
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:50.920
<v Speaker 3>drum inches away from his face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought this is also talking about</v>

2790
01:49:50.921 --> 01:49:52.990
<v Speaker 3>that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that kid walked up to the,</v>

2791
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.520
<v Speaker 3>to the native American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

2792
01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:56.600
<v Speaker 3>The native American guy walked up to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole group.</v>

2793
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen all that.</v>

2794
01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:02.650
<v Speaker 3>All of that video I saw American guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that there were saying build that</v>

2795
01:50:02.651 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 3>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>build that wall.</v>

2796
01:50:03.641 --> 01:50:05.440
<v Speaker 3>But there's no evidence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2797
01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:08.800
<v Speaker 3>The Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is the guy's a human in</v>

2798
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 3>native American guys in human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2799
01:50:10.410 --> 01:50:14.320
<v Speaker 3>And he's probably not prepared at all</v>
<v Speaker 3>for this kind of scrutiny.</v>

2800
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:16.440
<v Speaker 3>And no one is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot there.</v>

2801
01:50:16.450 --> 01:50:19.270
<v Speaker 3>There was an interview that he did with</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN that is just full of holes.</v>

2802
01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2803
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.530
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't match up to the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't match up to what happened and</v>

2804
01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:26.190
<v Speaker 3>his like theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pull it,</v>

2805
01:50:26.191 --> 01:50:27.580
<v Speaker 3>pull it video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pull that article.</v>

2806
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:31.690
<v Speaker 3>But you've tried to find that article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the CNN article.</v>

2807
01:50:32.490 --> 01:50:35.500
<v Speaker 3>There was an article about the article</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I read.</v>

2808
01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Either way I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2809
01:50:37.151 --> 01:50:39.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just inundated at this point with</v>

2810
01:50:39.461 --> 01:50:40.840
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will say like,</v>

2811
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:42.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2812
01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:45.070
<v Speaker 3>I've said for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably 15,</v>

2813
01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:47.680
<v Speaker 3>20 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad youtube did not exist when I</v>

2814
01:50:47.681 --> 01:50:48.880
<v Speaker 3>was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>snapchat or any of those things.</v>

2817
01:50:56.770 --> 01:50:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

2818
01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:01.180
<v Speaker 3>I did not grow up like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2819
01:51:01.181 --> 01:51:05.830
<v Speaker 3>my parents generation being mildly</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist if you're white,</v>

2820
01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:07.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up,</v>

2821
01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty woke as the kids say in Portland,</v>

2822
01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in Chicago,</v>

2823
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Chicago is pretty left wing will</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicago.</v>

2824
01:51:13.541 --> 01:51:15.310
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there until I was born in</v>

2825
01:51:15.311 --> 01:51:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I grew up in Portland.</v>

2826
01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was more,</v>

2827
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:19.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was also,</v>

2828
01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:21.430
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>

2829
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:22.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>

2830
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:27.220
<v Speaker 3>we had right wing a Nazi groups moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>in when I was in high school,</v>

2831
01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gangs from La and then from central</v>

2832
01:51:29.891 --> 01:51:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Oregon and further toward Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had,</v>

2833
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:33.430
<v Speaker 3>you had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2834
01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:35.920
<v Speaker 3>the skinny metzger who had like a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>little camp,</v>

2835
01:51:35.950 --> 01:51:39.010
<v Speaker 3>you could go on partying if you've seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>in American history x.</v>

2836
01:51:39.011 --> 01:51:41.890
<v Speaker 3>It was just like that drink free beer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd play punk rock music.</v>

2837
01:51:41.890 --> 01:51:45.340
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that everyone misses when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at those groups,</v>

2838
01:51:45.341 --> 01:51:49.540
<v Speaker 3>be it a gang or a white supremacist</v>
<v Speaker 3>skinhead group or whatever.</v>

2839
01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:50.610
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2840
01:51:50.610 --> 01:51:52.600
<v Speaker 3>it's a community for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people.</v>

2841
01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:54.650
<v Speaker 3>And that's where they look at it first</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they,</v>

2842
01:51:54.651 --> 01:51:55.890
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they foreign communities,</v>

2843
01:51:55.891 --> 01:51:59.200
<v Speaker 3>sadly over focusing hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just feel like,</v>

01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:00.250
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's back here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>banging the drums.</v>

2848
01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:10.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the kid there and he's standing</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but he's just standing there.</v>

2852
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:17.830
<v Speaker 3>The guy walked right up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're showing me in the video,</v>

2853
01:52:17.831 --> 01:52:20.980
<v Speaker 3>the guy walking up to the kid and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is exactly what I said,</v>

2854
01:52:20.981 --> 01:52:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He walked right up to the kid.</v>

2855
01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.250
<v Speaker 3>My point here was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the video,</v>

2856
01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean are these kids all mocking the</v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional native American music and</v>

2857
01:52:28.781 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 3>rhythm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Jamie,</v>

2858
01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:34.240
<v Speaker 3>that native American guy just walked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that kid and got in his face.</v>

2859
01:52:34.241 --> 01:52:37.070
<v Speaker 3>It's as clear as day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just bringing up this like there's</v>

2860
01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.800
<v Speaker 3>this angle here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's standing here.</v>

2861
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:42.040

2865
01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:51.890

<v Speaker 5>There was a certain amount of separation</v>

2866
01:52:51.891 --> 01:52:54.400
<v Speaker 5>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He walked to the kid and got in his face</v>

01:53:04.221 --> 01:53:05.180
<v Speaker 5>up to the kid.</v>

2872
01:53:06.930 --> 01:53:09.180
<v Speaker 5>So when they're doing the Tomahawk Chop</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chop,</v>

2873
01:53:09.181 --> 01:53:12.360
<v Speaker 5>they think it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like did they understand that people are</v>

2874
01:53:12.361 --> 01:53:14.560
<v Speaker 5>filming?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>

2875
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:19.830
<v Speaker 5>So here he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is so strange.</v>

2876
01:53:19.831 --> 01:53:22.950
<v Speaker 5>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because what are you supposed to do when</v>

2877
01:53:22.951 --> 01:53:25.350
<v Speaker 5>someone walks up to you beating a drum?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's the kid,</v>

2878
01:53:25.351 --> 01:53:29.880
<v Speaker 5>the kid standing there and the native</v>
<v Speaker 5>American guy now walks up to him</v>

2879
01:53:29.881 --> 01:53:34.740
<v Speaker 5>completely violating a space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now imagine if this is a man doing this</v>

2880
01:53:34.741 --> 01:53:36.000
<v Speaker 5>to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd say,</v>

2881
01:53:36.001 --> 01:53:39.000
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's violating her space 100% this is</v>

2882
01:53:39.001 --> 01:53:41.640
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what this guy's doing.</v>

2883
01:53:41.641 --> 01:53:44.250
<v Speaker 5>He's singing in this kid's face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little kid.</v>

2884
01:53:45.570 --> 01:53:47.360
<v Speaker 5>And what is the kid supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2885
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:49.060
<v Speaker 5>Should he walk away?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shitty.</v>

2886
01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:54.080
<v Speaker 5>Say I'm sorry that someone in the past</v>
<v Speaker 5>stole your ancestors land.</v>

2887
01:53:54.210 --> 01:53:55.470
<v Speaker 5>What is he supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2888
01:53:55.530 --> 01:53:57.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying yes,</v>

2889
01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:58.030
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>

2890
01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying what is the,</v>

2891
01:53:59.090 --> 01:54:00.720
<v Speaker 5>like the question is what does your kid</v>
<v Speaker 5>do?</v>

2892
01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:02.880
<v Speaker 5>But I mean these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just he's,</v>

2893
01:54:03.630 --> 01:54:06.060
<v Speaker 5>I get why this guy is approaching</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's just a,</v>

2894
01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:09.150
<v Speaker 5>it's a river of people mocking him and</v>
<v Speaker 5>his culture.</v>

2895
01:54:09.210 --> 01:54:11.430
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But why this one kid and why?</v>

2896
01:54:11.431 --> 01:54:14.850
<v Speaker 5>Why get right in this guy's face or</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're beating a drum inches from this</v>

2897
01:54:14.851 --> 01:54:15.684
<v Speaker 5>kid's face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2898
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:17.580
<v Speaker 5>that is the question and what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

2899
01:54:17.610 --> 01:54:20.550
<v Speaker 5>it's the fucking hat man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That God damn polarizing,</v>

2900
01:54:20.551 --> 01:54:22.500
<v Speaker 5>stupid hate that had so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at these,</v>

2901
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.380
<v Speaker 5>even closer to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's put the drum off to the side so we</v>

2902
01:54:25.381 --> 01:54:30.030
<v Speaker 5>can get closer to this kid's face music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Expecting the kid to walk away.</v>

2903
01:54:30.031 --> 01:54:32.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the kid doesn't do anything but</v>

2904
01:54:32.911 --> 01:54:36.600
<v Speaker 5>silly is blinking because the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the beating of the drum is so close to</v>

2905
01:54:36.601 --> 01:54:39.430
<v Speaker 5>his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

2906
01:54:39.490 --> 01:54:40.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2907
01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:41.900
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2908
01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:45.710
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So weird staring that kid down.</v>

2909
01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:48.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why wouldn't you walk away just to</v>

2910
01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:50.960
<v Speaker 5>define why we don't know everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 5>walked away.</v>

2911
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:53.360
<v Speaker 5>But what does he have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have to be standing there and</v>

2912
01:54:53.361 --> 01:54:56.360
<v Speaker 5>the guy decides to get in his face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you would walk away.</v>

2913
01:54:56.420 --> 01:55:00.800
<v Speaker 5>Probably the killer that on me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

2914
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I would definitely move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I would probably move to,</v>

2915
01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:05.390
<v Speaker 5>because I'd be scared if that guy got in</v>
<v Speaker 5>my face.</v>

2916
01:55:05.391 --> 01:55:06.860
<v Speaker 5>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that guy's going to hit me.</v>

2917
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:08.960
<v Speaker 5>I would think something's gonna go</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

2918
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is good.</v>

2919
01:55:09.730 --> 01:55:13.130
<v Speaker 5>This is just too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not the kids.</v>

2920
01:55:13.131 --> 01:55:17.090
<v Speaker 5>He's 16 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I the grownups fall for getting an a 16</v>

2921
01:55:17.091 --> 01:55:18.860
<v Speaker 5>year old kid's face beating a drum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2922
01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:23.030
<v Speaker 5>I look at it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's that fucking hat man.</v>

2923
01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:23.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's also the,</v>

2924
01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:26.720
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the native American man rightly felt</v>

2925
01:55:26.721 --> 01:55:28.090
<v Speaker 5>like he was being mocked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2926
01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:33.020
<v Speaker 5>And then his traditions and his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his heritage is being mocked and these</v>

2927
01:55:33.021 --> 01:55:33.801
<v Speaker 5>little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2928
01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:35.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he had the right to walk</v>

2929
01:55:35.571 --> 01:55:37.000
<v Speaker 5>up on the kid like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like where,</v>

2930
01:55:37.001 --> 01:55:38.390
<v Speaker 5>where is your breaking point?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2931
01:55:38.391 --> 01:55:39.140
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

2932
01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:43.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he doesn't have the right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is where confrontation from,</v>

2933
01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:45.090
<v Speaker 5>do you have the right to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>confrontation?</v>

2934
01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:45.660
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>

2935
01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:46.680
<v Speaker 5>perhaps may,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps,</v>

2936
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:49.500
<v Speaker 5>but that's not really the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate.</v>

2937
01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:51.840
<v Speaker 5>You're singing a song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a native American song,</v>

2938
01:55:51.841 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 5>and he doesn't know what the fuck you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>singing and you're doing it inches from</v>

2939
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:55.600
<v Speaker 5>his face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2940
01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:58.800
<v Speaker 5>And everyone's feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a really a sign of the Times that</v>

2941
01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:01.110
<v Speaker 5>people took clips of that and they made</v>
<v Speaker 5>it out.</v>

2942
01:56:01.111 --> 01:56:04.590
<v Speaker 5>Like this little kids that can't and</v>
<v Speaker 5>even raise a offline had on is if you</v>

2943
01:56:04.591 --> 01:56:06.570
<v Speaker 5>ever seen a more punchable face like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2944
01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:09.210
<v Speaker 5>it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're calling for violence on a kid.</v>

2945
01:56:09.211 --> 01:56:10.044
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're doing?</v>

2946
01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:10.830
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2947
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:12.180
<v Speaker 3>it's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2948
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:13.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>level of,</v>

2949
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:15.300
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2950
01:56:15.450 --> 01:56:17.340
<v Speaker 3>as kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even when you were pulling that</v>

2951
01:56:17.341 --> 01:56:19.650
<v Speaker 3>clip up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could feel my stomach make a fist and</v>

2952
01:56:19.651 --> 01:56:20.101
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2953
01:56:20.101 --> 01:56:21.330
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see this.</v>

2954
01:56:21.331 --> 01:56:23.730
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2955
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:27.340
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that dude that,</v>

2956
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:28.830
<v Speaker 3>that his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2957
01:56:28.831 --> 01:56:31.050
<v Speaker 3>that kid at the cub game who had the</v>
<v Speaker 3>game in his,</v>

2958
01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:34.740
<v Speaker 3>in his earphones and he caught the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which the outfielder was definitely not</v>

2959
01:56:34.741 --> 01:56:37.790
<v Speaker 3>going to catch anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they blamed him for the cubs loss of</v>

2960
01:56:37.791 --> 01:56:39.480
<v Speaker 3>the series and they had to squirt that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid out.</v>

2961
01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:42.000
<v Speaker 3>And I thought the kid reached forward</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2962
01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:43.110
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2963
01:56:43.111 --> 01:56:46.110
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the tape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the outfield or had</v>

2964
01:56:46.111 --> 01:56:48.510
<v Speaker 3>it now fit her was pointing like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up kid.</v>

2965
01:56:48.511 --> 01:56:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Like you ruined it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was kind of this,</v>

2966
01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.560
<v Speaker 3>why understand when you're playing major</v>
<v Speaker 3>league ball,</v>

2967
01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:54.430
<v Speaker 3>one mistake could mean the end of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>

2968
01:56:54.431 --> 01:56:54.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2969
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:55.800
<v Speaker 5>Your family's I man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I saw,</v>

2970
01:56:55.801 --> 01:56:57.150
<v Speaker 5>I think that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I saw that,</v>

2971
01:56:57.151 --> 01:56:58.800
<v Speaker 5>I thought that kid fucked up the game</v>

2972
01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:01.410
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be argued.</v>

2973
01:57:01.411 --> 01:57:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking about this a</v>

2974
01:57:02.461 --> 01:57:02.821
<v Speaker 3>little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2975
01:57:02.821 --> 01:57:05.940
<v Speaker 3>but that's like you're staying there</v>
<v Speaker 3>with blaming one tiny play on the entire</v>

2976
01:57:05.941 --> 01:57:08.400
<v Speaker 3>game and you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact,</v>

2977
01:57:08.401 --> 01:57:11.130
<v Speaker 3>the fact that back to what your point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>punched the kid in the face,</v>

2978
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:14.790
<v Speaker 3>that kid had to be escorted out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wrigley field because people were going</v>

2979
01:57:14.791 --> 01:57:16.830
<v Speaker 3>to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were drunk people that we're going</v>

2980
01:57:16.831 --> 01:57:17.820
<v Speaker 3>to throw hit that kid in</v>

2981
01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:20.240
<v Speaker 5>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we see that video of the guy</v>

2982
01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:23.630
<v Speaker 5>catching the ball?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that kid actually did fuck up</v>

2983
01:57:23.631 --> 01:57:25.580
<v Speaker 5>that game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the difference is that kid</v>

2984
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:30.770
<v Speaker 3>reached into the playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he did was definitely wrong and</v>

<v Speaker 2>playing field.</v>

3011
01:58:36.401 --> 01:58:38.770
<v Speaker 5>not going to catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you have the chance to catch</v>

3012
01:58:38.771 --> 01:58:40.270
<v Speaker 5>the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's right there.</v>

3013
01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:41.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3014
01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:43.660

3015
01:58:43.690 --> 01:58:46.900
<v Speaker 3>from a letterman like from like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3016
01:58:46.901 --> 01:58:49.180
<v Speaker 3>30 years ago or something and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

3017
01:58:49.181 --> 01:58:51.580
<v Speaker 3>it was like the lineup was this famous</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this famous person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then just Aramco,</v>

3019
01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:54.011
<v Speaker 3>like a name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3020
01:58:54.011 --> 01:58:56.320
<v Speaker 3>who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he brought this guy out and it was</v>

3021
01:58:56.321 --> 01:58:58.720
<v Speaker 3>like a middle aged guy and a ball cap</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

3022
01:58:59.050 --> 01:58:59.501
<v Speaker 3>let him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3023
01:58:59.501 --> 01:59:00.334
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3024
01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:02.230
<v Speaker 3>I think you're the greatest living</v>
<v Speaker 3>American.</v>

3025
01:59:02.290 --> 01:59:03.220
<v Speaker 3>And the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3026
01:59:03.221 --> 01:59:04.180
<v Speaker 3>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

3027
01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:08.320
<v Speaker 3>roll the tape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they show just like that home run</v>

3028
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:09.460
<v Speaker 3>and it's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going,</v>

3029
01:59:09.461 --> 01:59:12.760
<v Speaker 3>it's going and this guy has just has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>beer and he's not looking and that</v>

3030
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:13.690
<v Speaker 3>you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The announcer go,</v>

3031
01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:15.580
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ball hits the beer.</v>

3032
01:59:15.581 --> 01:59:16.340
<v Speaker 3>And the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

3033
01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:17.140
<v Speaker 3>He gets hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3034
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:17.973
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buff.</v>

3035
01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:20.470
<v Speaker 3>And everyone's kind of laughing at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like a home run,</v>

3036
01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.810
<v Speaker 3>there goes my beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then endings later,</v>

3037
01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:26.200
<v Speaker 3>same line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same run,</v>

3038
01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:29.710
<v Speaker 3>same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the announcer goes,</v>

3039
01:59:29.711 --> 01:59:33.480
<v Speaker 3>you have got to be kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ball just hits the same guy like</v>

3040
01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:33.920
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3041
01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:34.910
<v Speaker 5>like twice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same game,</v>

3042
01:59:36.030 --> 01:59:38.690
<v Speaker 5>but it let them and had him on and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

3043
01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:39.710
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3044
01:59:39.711 --> 01:59:41.820
<v Speaker 5>minor league or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you'd never would,</v>

3045
01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:44.510
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't be unlike the nightly news,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was just like,</v>

3046
01:59:44.690 --> 01:59:47.660
<v Speaker 5>what are the fucking Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people have ever been hit in</v>

3047
01:59:47.661 --> 01:59:51.230
<v Speaker 5>the head by a line drive that would fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>you up?</v>

3048
01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:54.500
<v Speaker 5>That would hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you'd be solely never be the same</v>

3049
01:59:54.501 --> 01:59:54.870
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

3050
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:55.703
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>

3051
01:59:56.740 --> 02:00:00.730
<v Speaker 5>Because when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tony Conigliaro in Boston during the,</v>

3052
02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:01.830
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Red Sox,</v>

3053
02:00:01.831 --> 02:00:03.930
<v Speaker 5>he was actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was very young at the time.</v>

3054
02:00:03.931 --> 02:00:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Might actually have happened before I</v>
<v Speaker 5>lived there.</v>

3055
02:00:07.021 --> 02:00:08.880
<v Speaker 5>But it was like the store that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>always told,</v>

3056
02:00:09.090 --> 02:00:12.570
<v Speaker 5>he got hit in the head with a pitch and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was never the same again.</v>

3057
02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:15.460
<v Speaker 5>And it was one of the reasons why they</v>
<v Speaker 5>started wearing padding helmets.</v>

3058
02:00:15.610 --> 02:00:17.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a kid who got hit in the chest</v>

3059
02:00:17.701 --> 02:00:20.400
<v Speaker 5>and his heart stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3060
02:00:20.401 --> 02:00:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Cause that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't happen that often,</v>

3061
02:00:22.170 --> 02:00:24.840
<v Speaker 5>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just makes your heart just go whoop.</v>

3062
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:26.820
<v Speaker 5>It just knocks it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>

3063
02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:29.790
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a rock covered with leather,</v>

3064
02:00:30.610 --> 02:00:32.190
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3065
02:00:32.191 --> 02:00:35.040
<v Speaker 5>you feel a hardball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That fucking thing is dense.</v>

3066
02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:36.140
<v Speaker 5>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3067
02:00:36.210 --> 02:00:38.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean soccer was originally kicking a</v>
<v Speaker 5>head around,</v>

3068
02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.520
<v Speaker 5>but that's what an Aztec culture.</v>

3069
02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:43.800
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't like,</v>

3070
02:00:43.801 --> 02:00:46.200
<v Speaker 5>it was after like a battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just take ahead and kick it around.</v>

3071
02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:48.990
<v Speaker 5>And that was like where the game is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how we're soccer came from what,</v>

3072
02:00:48.991 --> 02:00:49.980
<v Speaker 5>from what I've read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3073
02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:53.580
<v Speaker 5>I knew they had some weird mind game</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they,</v>

3074
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:56.010
<v Speaker 5>they played football and Mayan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's I'm thinking.</v>

3075
02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:56.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3076
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:58.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that they decided,</v>

3077
02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:04.100
<v Speaker 5>they used to think that they played and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the winner sacrificed the losing</v>

3078
02:01:04.291 --> 02:01:09.240
<v Speaker 5>team and now there was also some</v>
<v Speaker 5>speculation that it could have been the</v>

3079
02:01:09.241 --> 02:01:14.040
<v Speaker 5>opposite that the winning team was</v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrificed was just like,</v>

3080
02:01:14.041 --> 02:01:16.080
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to be in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>slowest game ever.</v>

3081
02:01:17.710 --> 02:01:19.740
<v Speaker 5>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All got by me.</v>

3082
02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:21.900
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you scored again,</v>

3083
02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.960
<v Speaker 5>but the idea was that you would play</v>
<v Speaker 5>with such courage knowing that you were</v>

3084
02:01:27.001 --> 02:01:29.280
<v Speaker 5>going to win and then you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get killed,</v>

3085
02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.710
<v Speaker 5>but you still want it to when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3086
02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:36.950
<v Speaker 3>the level of honor that it was had to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like so high and they are like,</v>

3087
02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:39.470
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family will never want for anything</v>

3088
02:01:39.471 --> 02:01:40.700
<v Speaker 3>ever again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just going to,</v>

3089
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:42.730
<v Speaker 3>or the level of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3090
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:45.710
<v Speaker 3>You were taking to pull the belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3091
02:01:45.711 --> 02:01:48.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assassin comes from [inaudible],</v>

3092
02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:50.660
<v Speaker 3>you know where this guy would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3093
02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Is this guy in in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we call the Middle East basically.</v>

3094
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:56.240
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you kill a King?</v>

3095
02:01:56.330 --> 02:02:00.260
<v Speaker 3>You got to get an assassin who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>care if he dies and so high on hash,</v>

3096
02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:04.850
<v Speaker 3>he built a of a family garden of</v>
<v Speaker 3>delights where he had naked women just</v>

3097
02:02:04.851 --> 02:02:08.020
<v Speaker 3>hanging around like prostitutes and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>flowing waterfalls.</v>

3098
02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:11.060
<v Speaker 3>And he would just get a peasant and</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke them up so much.</v>

3099
02:02:11.061 --> 02:02:12.530
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to see heaven?</v>

3100
02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.490
<v Speaker 3>And you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3101
02:02:13.491 --> 02:02:14.720
<v Speaker 3>And he'd take them in the room and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3102
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.370
<v Speaker 3>check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3103
02:02:16.371 --> 02:02:20.780
<v Speaker 3>I have the door to heaven and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill the Saltin and the town's Square</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're here.</v>

3105
02:02:22.610 --> 02:02:26.030
<v Speaker 3>And so a guy would just run up and stab</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy to death and the guard would</v>

3106
02:02:26.031 --> 02:02:28.400
<v Speaker 3>murder him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was how you get a guy,</v>

3107
02:02:28.401 --> 02:02:31.700
<v Speaker 3>you trick a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of like a,</v>

3108
02:02:31.701 --> 02:02:33.590
<v Speaker 3>it's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the same thing where that level</v>

3109

3117

3128
02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:20.050

<v Speaker 5>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would kill like the older people,</v>

02:03:26.591 --> 02:03:30.040
<v Speaker 5>aunts and all the old women were</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrified of him cause he would sneak up</v>

3133
02:03:30.041 --> 02:03:33.280
<v Speaker 5>behind them when they got too old</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they were,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are gaps in Aladdin people and he</v>

02:03:36.101 --> 02:03:39.910
<v Speaker 5>would hit him with an ax and they are</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to these people and I'm like,</v>

3136
02:03:39.911 --> 02:03:42.250
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine you got to kill your aunt with</v>

3137
02:03:42.251 --> 02:03:43.200
<v Speaker 5>an ax.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like your birthday party and blow out</v>

02:03:46.031 --> 02:03:47.770
<v Speaker 5>the candles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was just spin around it.</v>

3140
02:03:47.771 --> 02:03:49.030
<v Speaker 5>Fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get away from me.</v>

3141
02:03:51.150 --> 02:03:53.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the craziest stories that I ever</v>

3142
02:03:53.471 --> 02:03:56.380
<v Speaker 5>heard was during the temple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you say it too,</v>

3143
02:03:56.381 --> 02:03:57.890
<v Speaker 5>to con the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3144
02:03:57.930 --> 02:04:01.840
<v Speaker 5>one of the large Aztec temples when they</v>
<v Speaker 5>completed the temple,</v>

3145
02:04:01.841 --> 02:04:06.841
<v Speaker 5>they sacrificed something like 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people over the course of two days.</v>

3146
02:04:08.770 --> 02:04:10.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But pull,</v>

3147
02:04:10.061 --> 02:04:12.280
<v Speaker 5>pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Temple of to ICAN.</v>

3148
02:04:12.490 --> 02:04:13.510
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3149
02:04:13.810 --> 02:04:18.100
<v Speaker 5>outside of Mexico City.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when the aztecs constructed this,</v>

3150
02:04:18.130 --> 02:04:22.540
<v Speaker 5>when it was finally completed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they essentially sacrificed all the</v>

3151
02:04:22.541 --> 02:04:25.660
<v Speaker 5>slaves that were used to build.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3152
02:04:25.810 --> 02:04:28.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they just covered this fucking</v>

3153
02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:34.380
<v Speaker 5>gigantic temple with blood of 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that they butchered on the spot.</v>

3154
02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

3155
02:04:36.730 --> 02:04:39.570
<v Speaker 5>Over today's days to kill everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot.</v>

3156
02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:41.880
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of butchering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of murder.</v>

3157
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.193
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3158
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.360
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's exhausting levels of,</v>

3159
02:04:46.110 --> 02:04:48.500
<v Speaker 5>it's so much to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had told a friend this story and he</v>

3160
02:04:48.501 --> 02:04:49.410
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not true.</v>

3161
02:04:49.570 --> 02:04:50.311
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

3162
02:04:50.311 --> 02:04:51.270
<v Speaker 5>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would I lie?</v>

3163
02:04:51.330 --> 02:04:53.080
<v Speaker 5>He's one of those guys doing the math.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to,</v>

3164
02:04:53.081 --> 02:04:54.770
<v Speaker 5>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had to get to a place where their</v>

3165
02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:56.580
<v Speaker 5>service and Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3166
02:04:56.890 --> 02:04:58.620
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just daunting.</v>

3167
02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:02.910
<v Speaker 5>80,000 people and these are the very</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that built the thing,</v>

3168
02:05:03.220 --> 02:05:06.180
<v Speaker 5>which I mean that was the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they do.</v>

3169
02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:07.093
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're done.</v>

3170
02:05:07.330 --> 02:05:08.450
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kill Them.</v>

3171
02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:11.400
<v Speaker 5>Well that was one of the weirder things</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

3172
02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to cheech an Eatsa was there was</v>

3173
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 5>this one platform that was just designed</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sacrifice.</v>

3174
02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.840
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would kill people on this platform.</v>

3175
02:05:18.841 --> 02:05:20.970
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was set up like a bench.</v>

3176
02:05:20.971 --> 02:05:24.540
<v Speaker 5>Like there's legs and the head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like someone was holding this bench and</v>

3177
02:05:24.541 --> 02:05:27.540
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would just chop a head off and it</v>

3178
02:05:27.541 --> 02:05:30.690
<v Speaker 5>rolled down the fucking stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably like a little,</v>

3179
02:05:31.070 --> 02:05:32.880
<v Speaker 5>a little hedge slide kind of thing.</v>

3180
02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:35.580
<v Speaker 5>What do you think the fascination with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is?</v>

3181
02:05:35.581 --> 02:05:39.120
<v Speaker 5>Like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this idea of killing someone to appease</v>

3182
02:05:39.121 --> 02:05:41.310
<v Speaker 5>the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was it because everyone was</v>

3183
02:05:41.311 --> 02:05:43.620
<v Speaker 5>afraid to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that when you could force someone to</v>

3184
02:05:43.621 --> 02:05:46.110
<v Speaker 5>do it in front of everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just for someone to die in front of</v>

3185
02:05:46.111 --> 02:05:48.120
<v Speaker 5>everyone and sacrifice them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would just,</v>

3186
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:51.930
<v Speaker 5>it would long as it was like there was</v>
<v Speaker 5>enough distance between you and them,</v>

3187
02:05:51.931 --> 02:05:55.800
<v Speaker 5>they'll would be this charge of</v>
<v Speaker 5>excitement and very machiavellian for</v>

3188
02:05:55.801 --> 02:05:56.520
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3189
02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:57.480
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3190
02:05:57.620 --> 02:05:59.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>power perceived as power achieved.</v>

3191
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.120
<v Speaker 5>If you see anyone can die and fall in</v>
<v Speaker 5>line real fast.</v>

3192
02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:08.310
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the incorrect unpredictability of life</v>

3193
02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:09.440
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

3194
02:06:09.450 --> 02:06:12.360
<v Speaker 5>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to kill 80 people but we're</v>

3195
02:06:12.361 --> 02:06:15.060
<v Speaker 5>going to have no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no storms for the next couple of months.</v>

3196
02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:17.190
<v Speaker 5>Like it's no one I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3197
02:06:17.191 --> 02:06:17.910
<v Speaker 5>Fuck them.</v>

3198
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:22.080
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you have some like elder</v>
<v Speaker 5>who like some Shaman who tells you that</v>

3199
02:06:22.081 --> 02:06:23.880
<v Speaker 5>this is the only way we're going to stop</v>
<v Speaker 5>the storms.</v>

3200
02:06:23.881 --> 02:06:24.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3201
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:26.520
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People believe the fucking anything.</v>

3202
02:06:26.521 --> 02:06:28.230
<v Speaker 5>Did you get to template to have finally</v>
<v Speaker 5>found it?</v>

3203
02:06:28.231 --> 02:06:29.820
<v Speaker 5>It says somewhere between,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3204
02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:32.970
<v Speaker 5>there's a recorded article in 2011 post</v>
<v Speaker 5>story today,</v>

3205
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:36.360
<v Speaker 5>84,000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it says this is a disputed number.</v>

3206
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:39.480
<v Speaker 5>It could be a down the 4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe the numbers disputed.</v>

3207
02:06:39.481 --> 02:06:41.130
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some say as few as 4,000 were</v>

3208
02:06:41.131 --> 02:06:45.270
<v Speaker 5>sacrificed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what was actually a re consecration</v>

3209
02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:49.230
<v Speaker 5>of the Templo Mayor Corp in 1487,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nevertheless,</v>

3210
02:06:49.231 --> 02:06:51.930
<v Speaker 5>scores were killed cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um hmm.</v>

3211
02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:56.960
<v Speaker 5>So the one thought is 1487 the aztecs</v>
<v Speaker 5>recorded that 84,000 people were</v>

3212
02:06:57.871 --> 02:07:00.930
<v Speaker 5>slaughtered in four days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Self sacrifice was common in</v>

3213
02:07:00.931 --> 02:07:02.760
<v Speaker 5>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would pierce the owners,</v>

3214

<v Speaker 5>already suffering from a demographic</v>
<v Speaker 5>crisis before the Spanish arrived.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3349
02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:55.330
<v Speaker 3>I think you to have a trial.</v>

<v Speaker 3>In what way?</v>

3357
02:13:12.610 --> 02:13:16.150
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder when it's going to get out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our control because it's,</v>

3358
02:13:16.210 --> 02:13:20.080
<v Speaker 3>the technology is escalating beyond our</v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehension comprehension,</v>

3359
02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:22.180
<v Speaker 3>but yet you drive a tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3360
02:13:22.570 --> 02:13:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Contributing to it a little bit.</v>

3361
02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:25.480
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3362
02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:27.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>

3363
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:31.000

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3366
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot and a lot of ways and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

3367
02:13:34.651 --> 02:13:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I know you can hack a tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you can.</v>

3368
02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3369
02:13:38.461 --> 02:13:39.600
<v Speaker 2>But they're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3370
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:40.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3371
02:13:40.081 --> 02:13:42.050
<v Speaker 2>if you guys drive a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it there.</v>

3372
02:13:42.051 --> 02:13:45.140
<v Speaker 2>They're apparently not doing so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was some article that a,</v>

3373
02:13:45.141 --> 02:13:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I read today where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3374
02:13:47.370 --> 02:13:49.200
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were talking about the letter that</v>

3375
02:13:49.201 --> 02:13:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Elon Musk's sent to all the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>work for him saying that you're,</v>

3376
02:13:52.051 --> 02:13:54.780
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to work harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our goal is to try to save the</v>

3377
02:13:54.781 --> 02:13:55.810
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3378
02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

3379
02:13:56.350 --> 02:13:58.410
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to hear that shit and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>work for a company.</v>

3380
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:59.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3381
02:13:59.111 --> 02:13:59.671
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3382
02:13:59.671 --> 02:14:01.590
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really that's not what you're going</v>

3383
02:14:01.591 --> 02:14:02.730
<v Speaker 2>for before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3384
02:14:02.731 --> 02:14:07.731
<v Speaker 2>I think his goal is ultimately to reduce</v>
<v Speaker 2>our attachment to fossil fuels,</v>

3385
02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:11.880
<v Speaker 2>which can help save our environment.</v>

3386
02:14:12.630 --> 02:14:14.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3387
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:15.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3388
02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:17.940
<v Speaker 2>cut way down on factory farming with</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>

3389
02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:19.440
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3390
02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:21.071
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3391
02:14:21.071 --> 02:14:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3392
02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:25.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm all in favor with all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff and making way more</v>

3393
02:14:25.411 --> 02:14:26.221
<v Speaker 2>things electric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3394
02:14:26.221 --> 02:14:28.290
<v Speaker 2>why don't we have solar panels on</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally everything.</v>

3395
02:14:28.370 --> 02:14:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Especially in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3396
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have sun everywhere,</v>

3397
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:34.530
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and we have an amazing source</v>
<v Speaker 2>of light,</v>

3398
02:14:34.890 --> 02:14:36.600
<v Speaker 2>but apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3399
02:14:36.630 --> 02:14:39.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of money involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this sounds crazy because a lot</v>

3400
02:14:39.811 --> 02:14:42.570
<v Speaker 2>of money involved in staying with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grid as it is.</v>

3401
02:14:43.190 --> 02:14:45.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got to keep those nuclear power</v>

3402
02:14:45.691 --> 02:14:48.420
<v Speaker 2>plants running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We love him so much.</v>

3403
02:14:48.421 --> 02:14:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Driving to San Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sightseeing.</v>

3404
02:14:50.190 --> 02:14:50.971
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old ones,</v>

3405
02:14:50.971 --> 02:14:54.990
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even have a way to shut down</v>
<v Speaker 2>like old power plants when they would</v>

3406
02:14:54.991 --> 02:14:55.810
<v Speaker 2>make them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3407
02:14:55.810 --> 02:14:58.080
<v Speaker 2>They can't stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably figured we'll figure it</v>

3408
02:14:58.081 --> 02:14:58.170
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3409
02:14:58.170 --> 02:14:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's late.</v>

3410
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Let's put it off one day yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll figure someone smarter than us</v>

3411
02:15:04.591 --> 02:15:06.180
<v Speaker 2>will come along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll fix it.</v>

3412
02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You when you,</v>

3413
02:15:08.051 --> 02:15:13.051
<v Speaker 2>you really hear about natural disasters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and solar flares and asteroid impacts.</v>

3414
02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:19.650
<v Speaker 2>He just realized how fucking fragile</v>
<v Speaker 2>this weird system that we have of a</v>

3415
02:15:19.651 --> 02:15:24.651
<v Speaker 2>power grid and satellites to distribute</v>
<v Speaker 2>information and the Internet is actually</v>

3416
02:15:24.841 --> 02:15:28.590
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of wires on the ocean floor that</v>
<v Speaker 2>connect us to Europe.</v>

3417
02:15:28.591 --> 02:15:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Like what is wires that are 4,000 miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>long?</v>

3418
02:15:31.771 --> 02:15:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3419
02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:33.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3420
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:34.590
<v Speaker 2>That it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3421
02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:38.820
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like the human body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's remarkably resilient but it's</v>

3422
02:15:38.821 --> 02:15:40.770
<v Speaker 2>so fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Fragile.</v>

3423
02:15:41.130 --> 02:15:43.290
<v Speaker 2>One infection and that's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3424
02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:44.513
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3425
02:15:44.830 --> 02:15:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's drunk enough they can fall</v>

3426
02:15:46.801 --> 02:15:49.200
<v Speaker 2>off a building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had everything going down and land like</v>

3427
02:15:49.201 --> 02:15:51.990
<v Speaker 2>something made a nerf and get up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

3428
02:15:51.991 --> 02:15:54.180
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched a video of a guy who was in</v>

3429
02:15:54.181 --> 02:15:58.020
<v Speaker 2>a high speed chase with the cops and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a corvette and he flipped a corvette</v>

3430
02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:01.050
<v Speaker 2>and literally they went flying out of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was a doll.</v>

3431
02:16:01.090 --> 02:16:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I saw that head over heels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Head over heels was fine.</v>

3432
02:16:04.110 --> 02:16:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Landed on his back on the desert floor.</v>

3433
02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:10.110
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got some volume playing in the</v>

3434
02:16:10.111 --> 02:16:10.950
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

3435
02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:14.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get to hear that too.</v>

3436
02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just pop up every now and then.</v>

3437
02:16:17.850 --> 02:16:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Interference I've been hearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

3438
02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:20.400
<v Speaker 2>and I can't tell if you guys are hearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3439
02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:21.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3440
02:16:21.121 --> 02:16:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you ever heard of songs in your</v>

3441
02:16:24.781 --> 02:16:29.781
<v Speaker 2>fillings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people have recorded that.</v>

3442
02:16:29.831 --> 02:16:30.340
<v Speaker 2>They</v>

3443
02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:33.750
<v Speaker 3>hear radio sounds in their feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3444
02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:36.760
<v Speaker 3>they pick up wavelengths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3445
02:16:36.761 --> 02:16:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Like you're filling will somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 3>another catch some radio sound.</v>
