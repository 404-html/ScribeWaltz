1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Herbs and they moved shit around and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in weird places and when you read</v>

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>the translation like what the fuck does </v>
<v Speaker 1>this mean?</v>

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Well they're figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate it.</v>

4
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:12.651
<v Speaker 1>Not just both word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but figuring out how you would say that </v>

5
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>same sentence in English structure as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's clear what you know,</v>

7
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>what you're translating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking fascinating shit man.</v>

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also</v>

9
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 2>wonder after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 2>50 or so years of everybody using </v>
<v Speaker 2>English on the Internet,</v>

11
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:28.840
<v Speaker 2>how many kids are gonna grow up just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>English as their,</v>

12
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their new language and the original </v>

13
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.661
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the old fashioned thing their </v>

14
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:36.661
<v Speaker 2>parents did.</v>

15
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:36.661
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if there was only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

16
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine how much shit would </v>
<v Speaker 1>get done?</v>

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's interesting though,</v>

18
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:44.571
<v Speaker 1>when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like imagine languages are going to go </v>

19
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:44.571
<v Speaker 1>away by technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

20
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:44.571
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>

21
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Old Languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>so what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like translate on motto,</v>

23
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>like you have to sit there and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something translated to you in pr in </v>

24
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.001
<v Speaker 1>real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's going to be voice </v>

25
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>detection and everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's going to make language.</v>

26
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Languages though people are still gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>want a traditionalist,</v>

27
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>so we'll still be there playing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole thing.</v>

28
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>But what if a few generations go by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I think things are going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>you're a proponent of the isolation </v>
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>

31
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:11.811
<v Speaker 1>You actually have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Lilly's tank don't do actually is </v>

32
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:11.811
<v Speaker 1>pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met John.</v>

33
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:11.811
<v Speaker 1>He gave me his tanks.</v>

34
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>You and my only other friend that ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>had one that's having Willie mays is </v>

35
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking baseball bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to shower shoes to go with it.</v>

37
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually get out and walk and issues.</v>

38
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Every time I go from my high heels are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty boring.</v>

39
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:36.111
<v Speaker 1>Brown shower shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But imagine when they figure out how to </v>

40
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:39.591
<v Speaker 1>stimulate the mind to create certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>states and they do it in conjunction </v>

41
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>with the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really the way to do it because</v>

42
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>it eliminates all the sensory input from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world.</v>

43
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>If they could figure out how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put some electrodes on your head and set</v>

44
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>you and that fucking tank and light you </v>
<v Speaker 1>up like a Christmas tree and you just go</v>

45
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>into some other world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe people will stop.</v>

46
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I think Dr Lilly did that to me with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>CC ketamine injected,</v>

47
00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>You told me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a rush.</v>

49
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>What did he do exactly?</v>

50
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got there,</v>

51
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:11.061
<v Speaker 2>actually they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go into the tank just </v>

52
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>straight and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got to rinse off and everything </v>

53
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>before you go in the tank and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>was prepping me and he says,</v>

54
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually when we do it,</v>

55
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 2>we go in with one CC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>injected in a muscularly,</v>

56
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketamine,</v>

57
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you like some?</v>

58
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 2>And I hear part of my brain go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

59
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>no drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

60
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 2>And then I hear my mouth go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

61
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love some.</v>

62
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.600
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like a complete third person in </v>

63
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>my own reality because he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem,</v>

64
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's injected into muscularly.</v>

65
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Is that a problem in my side of my brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>went needles?</v>

66
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mouth,</v>

67
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 2>however went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

68
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 2>That'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to friend them and,</v>

69
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

70
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 2>and he walked away to go get me this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

71
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 2>And I stood there for a minute and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain was saying no way.</v>

72
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 2>And my other side of my brain went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

73
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 2>you're a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lily's house,</v>

74
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've come all this way.</v>

75
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you're saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

76
00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:02.961
<v Speaker 2>he walked back in and I felt a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol swab and my muscle and I heard </v>

77
00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 2>my brand go no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I heard my mouth go.</v>

78
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

79
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

80
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I made the most naive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

81
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take to kick in?</v>

82
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 2>And I will never forget his face when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

83
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't done it before.</v>

84
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should lay down about 45 seconds a,</v>

85
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.170
<v Speaker 2>any like put me in the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

86
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 2>when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you do something like that?</v>

87
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.270
<v Speaker 2>You have sleep apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you run the risk of like choking and </v>

88
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.270
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

89
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.240
<v Speaker 2>And not breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have slept sleep apnea,</v>

91
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:40.321
<v Speaker 2>but the last thing I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>was sleeping when he slipped me into </v>

92
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:42.571
<v Speaker 2>that tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was there to watch the </v>

93
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:42.571
<v Speaker 2>entire world coming to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

94
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>I had a ringside seat was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

95
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.070
<v Speaker 2>So they shot you up with is ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lie down on the tank and into the </v>

96
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.091
<v Speaker 2>tank and you float.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me it was the first experience </v>

97
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:56.341
<v Speaker 2>ever float.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you first experienced </v>

98
00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:56.850
<v Speaker 2>floating was with ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 2>how do you say no to Dr Lilly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

100
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd watched the movie altered states </v>
<v Speaker 2>dozens of times.</v>

101
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 2>I'd own the laser disc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it happened.</v>

102
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>What happened after you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>After you,</v>

103
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 2>it kicks in 45 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was freaking out and I'm,</v>

104
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 2>the funnier side of this was my good </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend was in the,</v>

105
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 2>in the other room and I was background </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise while all this was going on.</v>

106
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't know about the ketamine </v>
<v Speaker 2>entering into the equation.</v>

107
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>And he was sitting there with Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lillian,</v>

108
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 2>his assistant at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Craig.</v>

109
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had no concern of me like sounding </v>

110
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 2>like I'm drowning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally he asked,</v>

111
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

112
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 2>is he on Ketamine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

113
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 2>and Craig said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

114
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 2>would you go get me some?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my friend was totally blown away.</v>

115
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that was going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to the,</v>

116
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.520
<v Speaker 2>to the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And John put some ketamine into his leg </v>

117
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.151
<v Speaker 2>and told my friend to have a nice night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went into his bedroom and my </v>

118
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 2>friend could see into the bedroom where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tank was next to a bed and he didn't</v>

119
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:55.291
<v Speaker 2>touch the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just went in and laid down next to </v>

120
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:55.291
<v Speaker 2>the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually stopped screaming at that</v>

121
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my friend was looking in,</v>

122
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>the bedroom was screaming.</v>

123
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I was freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

124
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm losing my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're in the tank,</v>

125
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you pan it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start screaming,</v>

126
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 2>John Lilly says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send me some of what he's having.</v>

127
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And honestly for me,</v>

128
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 2>I felt like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well when I stopped screaming,</v>

129
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I remembered it was conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

130
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt like somebody came into my trip </v>

131
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>and just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

132
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>take a deep breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm down,</v>

133
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

134
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

135
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just channeled the energy and it </v>

136
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 2>actually was a really positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

137
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 2>John Lilly joined you and your trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he joined you in the actual </v>

138
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.991
<v Speaker 2>isolated did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and my girlfriend later on tried to </v>

139
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:36.991
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that dentist,</v>

140
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 2>not a cool place for to have a friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sasha here.</v>

141
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Let's cuddle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work,</v>

142
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a sense,</v>

143
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he did.</v>

144
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:50.221
<v Speaker 2>I felt like there was a telepathic </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication as much as this is going </v>

145
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 2>to blow all of the credibility I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>had about talking about pot.</v>

146
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually felt like Dr.</v>

147
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Liliana communicated on a level that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>more telepathic during</v>

148
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>the time I was under the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think like the tank even horror </v>

149
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to believe it.</v>

150
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't even work though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he took the same amount of pills and </v>

151
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>just lay down or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tank that no,</v>

152
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>no pill or I wouldn't think that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>involvement with the tanks,</v>

153
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how Mckenna described ketamine.</v>

154
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 1>He said that it was like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed that when you did </v>

155
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.051
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you somehow or another connected to the </v>

156
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>experience that everybody had had doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>those psychedelics before you.</v>

157
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom experience so rich and diverse.</v>

158
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:35.741
<v Speaker 1>It says some thousands and millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people over the years have done </v>

159
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and you're connected to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one big gigantic growing experience.</v>

160
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing ketamine.</v>

161
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>He said Ketamine is so much more rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really it gave him the feeling like</v>

162
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>he was in an abandoned warehouse or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>office building with no furniture in it.</v>

163
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

164
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:52.631
<v Speaker 1>You said was very alone in my trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>initially and then when I felt like </v>

165
00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:54.180
<v Speaker 1>there was another energy around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

166
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did feel different and it was weird.</v>

167
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I had a long conversation with John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lilly after and he really,</v>

168
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the old guy who was </v>

169
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>really a nice guy and then afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I left,</v>

170
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day his assistant showed them,</v>

171
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made a real impression on John.</v>

172
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>He'd like you to have his tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just gave it to you.</v>

173
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

174
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:17.351
<v Speaker 1>You probably felt bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably didn't want you to sue them </v>

175
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:19.391
<v Speaker 1>for fucking whacking them with ketamine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and throwing them into a fucking </v>

176
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:19.391
<v Speaker 1>bathtub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

177
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 1>this dude might sue me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going to work this.</v>

178
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to work this on the stroke it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call them up until Yo,</v>

179
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

180
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you are the shit.</v>

181
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give you my take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

182
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Stone went the night before me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his tank and a 400 vps in the shit </v>

183
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 1>over stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big pooper.</v>

184
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Never really thought about that until </v>
<v Speaker 1>just this minute.</v>

185
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>I would have definitely ended up into </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

186
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both did it.</v>

187
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to talk about it.</v>

188
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:49.691
<v Speaker 1>Years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and I sit down and chat about a </v>

189
00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:49.691
<v Speaker 1>weekend at John's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

191
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.300
<v Speaker 1>and throw him into a fucking pink of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

193
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.751
<v Speaker 1>Dolphin was made about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that did all of the </v>

194
00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:01.751
<v Speaker 1>research books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

195
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was awesome.</v>

196
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great book where he actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows it's got the deep self,</v>

197
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 1>has directions on how to make a tank.</v>

198
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Shows you how to make that precursor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The son of Mario Tech.</v>

199
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it Santa Maria is somebody's son.</v>

200
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

201
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one of those as well.</v>

202
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Now I got a float lab one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new.</v>

203
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:23.970
<v Speaker 1>A crazy version of or showed you that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet in the basement.</v>

204
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.440
<v Speaker 1>The trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>

205
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're awesome.</v>

206
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:32.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of people have never </v>

207
00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:32.441
<v Speaker 1>really been able to meditate within </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

208
00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:35.891
<v Speaker 1>And when you get into this tank and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no resistance on your body and </v>

209
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:38.831
<v Speaker 1>you can actually get really here and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really see and you feel the same </v>

210
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>temperature as the surroundings around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

211
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>you really field so boundless and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's truly flying through space.</v>

212
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 1>You flying a spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

213
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 1>that is a portal to another world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

214
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>It really is how to relax.</v>

215
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Once you learn how to relax and it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few times.</v>

216
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it a bunch of times and </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on your personality,</v>

217
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 1>how good you are truly letting go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you really learn how to let go,</v>

218
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.980
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go on trips in that thing.</v>

219
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to set an alarm at like 4:00</v>

220
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I went to sleep before midnight and I</v>

221
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 1>just walk because I had mine in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>bedroom.</v>

222
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I've walked right into my tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in it and like go back to sleep and</v>

223
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>like four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>6:00,</v>

224
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I would always wake up before seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like,</v>

225
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:21.381
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had just slept for so long and I felt </v>

226
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And night dreams would be so lucid,</v>

227
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>so incredibly real and tangible in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

228
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to go write them down loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>

229
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.180
<v Speaker 1>So you only walk a couple steps.</v>

230
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Barely woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely up right back.</v>

231
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Right back out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

232
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome minds too far from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bird and the walking.</v>

233
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd wake up going,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get some breakfast,</v>

239
00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:56.460

240
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.270

<v Speaker 1>Did you see that shit that was on CNN?</v>

241
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>But are these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these uh,</v>

242
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 1>all these former US air force and </v>
<v Speaker 1>penalties are coming out about Ufo shows</v>

243
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 1>around nuclear on nuclear facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking trippy shit man.</v>

244
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if these guys are all just </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>

245
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if these guys are all kooks or </v>
<v Speaker 1>if feel like disinformation guys that </v>

246
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.570
<v Speaker 1>work for the government.</v>

247
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.090
<v Speaker 1>The government wants us to think there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking really ufos thing,</v>

248
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 1>just distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

249
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Obama's passing on his legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it any easier for people to wire,</v>

250
00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 1>tap your emails and get into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking twitter account,</v>

251
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:34.080
<v Speaker 1>your facebook pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're passing all this legislation</v>

252
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:36.570
<v Speaker 1>right under everybody's nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's what it is.</v>

253
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's still so distraction </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactic.</v>

254
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they appointed the UN,</v>

255
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:43.950
<v Speaker 1>appointed some chick to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambassador when the aliens come.</v>

256
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Listen Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't speak from.</v>

257
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

258
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The you can just at points.</v>

259
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Just sit around and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is a,</v>

260
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I believe she's an astrophysicist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>her job is to communicate with the </v>

261
00:10:59.060 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 1>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't talk for me.</v>

262
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I just say something?</v>

263
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I got a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have been on this planet evolving </v>

264
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 1>with dogs for thousands of years and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't speak Doberman.</v>

265
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.660
<v Speaker 1>We don't speak German shepherd and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>do we think that they're going to show </v>

266
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.090
<v Speaker 1>up and suddenly we're going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit good alien up,</v>

267
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 1>up your idea and they want a snack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that they're going to be so much more</v>

268
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:23.841
<v Speaker 1>intelligent than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be able to understand </v>

269
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:26.181
<v Speaker 1>what our language is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll be able to decipher our </v>

270
00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:26.181
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hope and the dream.</v>

271
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to show up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

272
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

273
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.710
<v Speaker 1>You look soft and juicy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

274
00:11:30.711 --> 00:11:35.630
<v Speaker 1>what we do is if you look these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at what you look at,</v>

275
00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>what do they appreciate us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like cows.</v>

276
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:42.771
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at what every single </v>

277
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 1>intelligent life form on this planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

278
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.620
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that they explored everything </v>

279
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 1>weaker than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the ethic of space.</v>

280
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:51.090
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's the ethic of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this earth,</v>

281
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 1>on this planet is survival of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fittest.</v>

282
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

283
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
<v Speaker 3>and when you're the fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to fuck the ones who are not as </v>

284
00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.000
<v Speaker 3>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way it is.</v>

285
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Why human beings do to dolphins and sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and what we do to killer whales.</v>

286
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 3>We know the killer whales rescue human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings that fall off boats.</v>

287
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 3>We know that there's never been a case </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the wild of a killer whale documented</v>

288
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killing a human,</v>

289
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 3>the only time they've ever done it then </v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

290
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:16.051
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only time I've ever done it </v>

291
00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:16.051
<v Speaker 3>is in capital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know what dolphins do.</v>

292
00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Dolphins killed baby dolphin so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can force the female dolphins.</v>

293
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Dolphins are ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that true as fuck as true,</v>

294
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 3>that they killed the baby hill?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The babies,</v>

295
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 3>how do they kill them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kill Them.</v>

296
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Their face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they kill them?</v>

297
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons.</v>

298
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dolphins raped the fuck out of each </v>

299
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 3>other too.</v>

300
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.980
<v Speaker 3>And one of the reasons why female </v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins are horace is female dolphins </v>

301
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.041
<v Speaker 3>are super slutty and the reason being is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have to fuck as many male </v>

302
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 3>dolphins as possible so that when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have babies,</v>

303
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 3>those male dolphins won't kill the </v>
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>

304
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.680
<v Speaker 3>So the male dolphin will go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be mindset,</v>

305
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 3>might be mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn the liker because they,</v>

306
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.380
<v Speaker 3>they get the Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this documentary.</v>

307
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.980
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

308
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:53.880
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

309
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 3>the idea being that the mother does not </v>
<v Speaker 3>breed while she's with the baby.</v>

310
00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:02.431
<v Speaker 3>So it takes like six years or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that before she's going to breed </v>

311
00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:02.431
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

312
00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:02.640
<v Speaker 3>before she breeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because before she breeds again,</v>

313
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 3>because she has to take care of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>

314
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Speaker 3>How old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long does it</v>

315
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>and lift?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

316
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

317
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:09.920
<v Speaker 1>but you need to know a lot about sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

318
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about fucking one of those for</v>

319
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it only had a sheep's pussy,</v>

320
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but it was a dolphin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put those two together.</v>

321
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 1>You get pocket and if you drag you </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the water at the same time,</v>

322
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.050
<v Speaker 1>take you on trips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you going 40 miles an hour,</v>

323
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.030
<v Speaker 1>it'd be able to hold your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn.</v>

324
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 1>There'll be going to need to design some</v>
<v Speaker 1>new dolphin.</v>

325
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:32.800
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

326
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:37.950
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you could just climb on the </v>

327
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>back of a dolphin and just get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight attached to the dolphin.</v>

328
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 1>That could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it already feels good.</v>

329
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 1>There's videos on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People fucking dolphins.</v>

330
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

331
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.150
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can't be right.</v>

332
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>That's totally real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's fucking dolphins do it.</v>

333
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

334
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>The penis comes out and the woman gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it.</v>

335
00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Or remember it was you making the shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not,</v>

336
00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.360

<v Speaker 1>kinds of videos that people fucking dog </v>

337
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.360
<v Speaker 1>therapy time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual sex.</v>

338
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need.</v>

339
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I need some clarification on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

340
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 1>We need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to go deep on this one story.</v>

341
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:12.090
<v Speaker 1>We can't just leave people out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that there's not many people </v>

342
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.090
<v Speaker 1>are right now going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>

343
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people.</v>

344
00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the beautiful thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

345
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:20.071
<v Speaker 1>Now instantly you could find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can google and at least get the </v>

346
00:14:20.071 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 1>general consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

347
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:25.801
<v Speaker 1>you can't find out who killed Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some shit that you can't find </v>

<v Speaker 1>there's no evolution.</v>

469
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:07.011
<v Speaker 1>There's just creationism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to talk about incestual </v>

00:19:07.011 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>relations between Adam and eve and all </v>

<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it?</v>

477
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 1>If you go with the Christians and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did all this in 6,000</v>

483
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.570
<v Speaker 1>prohibition of Thou shall not eat from </v>

<v Speaker 1>police and God,</v>

487
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.160
<v Speaker 1>according to Christian mythology </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't handle prohibition.</v>

488
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How alertness is a god would make some </v>

489
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>shit that he didn't want you to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't eat it.</v>

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you I will fuck your world </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

491
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ate the apple that I told you not to</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your whole species is fucked.</v>

495
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever wonder if that's.</v>

496
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you wonder if that snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one snake,</v>

497
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>the original snake ever made it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he made it on Noah's Ark,</v>

498
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.060
<v Speaker 1>do you ever think about that?</v>

499
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Like no one does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That snake was.</v>

500
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.330
<v Speaker 1>The devil wasn't really that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

501
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping that snake made it.</v>

502
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that snake is all around us all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

503
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>

504
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.280
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:27.060
<v Speaker 1>they'll make fun of fucking Muslims or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll make fun of scientologists.</v>

506
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:28.260
<v Speaker 1>They'll make fun of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they've got the wrong thing.</v>

508
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we to come to Jesus.</v>

509
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I argue that everybody's an atheist </v>

510
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.451
<v Speaker 1>because a Jew doesn't believe in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian God and the Christian God </v>

511
00:20:38.451 --> 00:20:41.151
<v Speaker 1>doesn't believe in Buddha and the Buddha</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't believe in the Jewish God and </v>

512
00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:41.151
<v Speaker 1>none of them believe in Mohammed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really,</v>

513
00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>they're all atheists because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in anything,</v>

514
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:48.321
<v Speaker 1>but they're little fantasy truthfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're all atheists to somebody </v>

515
00:20:48.321 --> 00:20:48.321
<v Speaker 1>else's shit to</v>

516
00:20:48.321 --> 00:20:50.760
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe in their other gods.</v>

517
00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:52.590
<v Speaker 2>So Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly we're in alignment.</v>

518
00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I just don't also believe with any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their gods.</v>

519
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.460
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that there are so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different religions.</v>

520
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.720
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally,</v>

521
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 3>we were new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were lost.</v>

522
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:05.251
<v Speaker 3>We needed direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need someone to walk up and go where </v>

523
00:21:05.251 --> 00:21:05.251
<v Speaker 3>the food is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know where you'll be warm.</v>

524
00:21:05.251 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 3>I know how to heal you sick when you die</v>
<v Speaker 3>and come with me.</v>

525
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different religions,</v>

526
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:13.480
<v Speaker 3>but even though we know that they all </v>
<v Speaker 3>say different shit,</v>

527
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:17.710
<v Speaker 3>everyone is willing to die believing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the one they believe is right.</v>

528
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Even though there's so many examples of </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradicting ideas for whatever fucking</v>

529
00:21:23.021 --> 00:21:25.140
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We compartmentalize that when we,</v>

530
00:21:25.141 --> 00:21:27.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go down the road of being a mormon or go</v>

531
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 3>down the road of being a Catholic or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>baptist,</v>

532
00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.570
<v Speaker 3>we just don't look at it.</v>

533
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Just don't just say this is my team and </v>
<v Speaker 2>screw your a team.</v>

534
00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:37.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very and 10 fl mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

535
00:21:37.521 --> 00:21:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Rah Rah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my team.</v>

536
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.410
<v Speaker 2>You're a team.</v>

537
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.330
<v Speaker 3>It's all the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is all the same shit.</v>

538
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.970
<v Speaker 3>When I was in Indiana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Indiana for UFC.</v>

539
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who fought somebody from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indiana,</v>

540
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.290
<v Speaker 3>even if they were American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would boo them.</v>

541
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Realize you're not from Indiana.</v>

542
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.040
<v Speaker 3>That's a local boy hoosiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But think about Indiana is great,</v>

543
00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:57.050
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the,</v>

544
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.310
<v Speaker 3>the mentality is so fucked up that your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're booing against other Americans </v>

545
00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:05.220
<v Speaker 3>because they're not from a similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

546
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.280
<v Speaker 3>They're not within a certain distance of</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you sleep.</v>

547
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.860
<v Speaker 3>So you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even like them right now,</v>

548
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.230
<v Speaker 3>who's going up against a guy like we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need?</v>

549
00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:18.231
<v Speaker 3>We don't just have Americans versus the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the world will go down to </v>

550
00:22:18.231 --> 00:22:18.231
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will break.</v>

551
00:22:18.231 --> 00:22:19.800
<v Speaker 3>We'll break it down to neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll break it down to the hatfields and</v>

552
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.310
<v Speaker 3>mccoys.</v>

553
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.810
<v Speaker 2>The problem with Indiana is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing else to fucking do there.</v>

554
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.240
<v Speaker 2>And they're not known for much in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indiana.</v>

555
00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.880
<v Speaker 2>And so that movie hoosiers came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was like,</v>

556
00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:33.881
<v Speaker 2>sports is now our big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it's like seriously came out </v>

557
00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 2>because sports is a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

558
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

559
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.360
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're so proud of that movie and </v>

560
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.131
<v Speaker 2>that because that's all they have kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of living in Indiana to have this thing </v>

561
00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:42.780
<v Speaker 2>called the Indianapolis 500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of rights.</v>

562
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Do they have a lot of shit dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

563
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:49.981
<v Speaker 2>So it's fair to bring farming back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the midwest is what we gotta do.</v>

564
00:22:50.211 --> 00:22:53.390
<v Speaker 2>We gotta really farming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You bring it back to him.</v>

565
00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.500
<v Speaker 2>We need him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

566
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Well I know farm aid right now is in its</v>
<v Speaker 2>25th year in.</v>

567
00:22:57.261 --> 00:23:02.261
<v Speaker 2>The problem with it is 25 years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gotten were because all these </v>

568
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:02.940
<v Speaker 2>people they're trying to convince,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've built their,</v>

569
00:23:02.941 --> 00:23:07.941
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their farms on corn and cotton are </v>

570
00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:10.301
<v Speaker 2>completely wrong and they're not gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>have any economic independence back </v>

571
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:10.301
<v Speaker 2>until they get there.</v>

572
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.330
<v Speaker 3>John Cougar Mellencamp came onto the </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen and they booed him really?</v>

573

578
00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ohio the farms are getting so bad </v>

579
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 2>that they're like closing farms left and</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

580
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.440
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of the farms are turning into</v>
<v Speaker 2>shopping centers where my mom lived just</v>

581
00:23:43.441 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 2>in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be farms everywhere and now it's</v>

582
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.090
<v Speaker 2>like commercial buildings and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

583
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:53.110
<v Speaker 2>they're losing all these farms because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no money in it or something's </v>

584
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.110
<v Speaker 2>not going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

585
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.110
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At,</v>

586
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 2>in the farming industry in Ohio,</v>

587
00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.360
<v Speaker 3>well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to run a farm and </v>

588
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:00.360
<v Speaker 3>make a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly difficult.</v>

589
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:00.430
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking</v>

590
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.300
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're up against unfair</v>

591
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:05.210
<v Speaker 2>trade practices in fucking fuels that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from 9,000</v>

592
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:06.640
<v Speaker 2>miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about c?</v>

593
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Do you know you don't even own your </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeds when you're a farmer,</v>

594
00:24:09.061 --> 00:24:09.210
<v Speaker 3>when you</v>

595
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:15.550
<v Speaker 2>big deal and you know what hemp is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that we need to really push </v>

596
00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.600
<v Speaker 2>that we don't have gml control of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to stand up and ask for a,</v>

597
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our civil rights back.</v>

598
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 2>We have to demand them and back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

599
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we.</v>

600
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.890
<v Speaker 3>When the seeds thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was saying is when you buy seeds,</v>

601
00:24:25.891 --> 00:24:30.891
<v Speaker 3>if you're a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you buy these seeds that have been made </v>

602
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:30.891
<v Speaker 3>by this company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monsanto.</v>

603
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't own those seeds.</v>

604
00:24:32.341 --> 00:24:37.341
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got those seeds and when you plant </v>

605
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:38.280
<v Speaker 3>your new plants and you grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like save you grow peppers,</v>

606
00:24:38.281 --> 00:24:41.400
<v Speaker 3>you can't take the seeds out of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>peppers and grow more peppers</v>

607
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 2>because you don't own that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't own that.</v>

608
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 2>They'll sue you in copywritten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is,</v>

609
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:53.010
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monsanto has actually people that go </v>

610
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.190
<v Speaker 2>around and test crops of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they suspect are using a generation away</v>

611
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:57.650
<v Speaker 2>from their last seat and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary.</v>

612
00:24:57.651 --> 00:25:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know crazy is that we take those</v>

613
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:03.440
<v Speaker 2>seeds and like make new new versions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that seed.</v>

614
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.640
<v Speaker 2>It can't trace of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

615
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Is that medically modified so they know</v>

616
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.090
<v Speaker 3>the genome of this particular plant that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've created is.</v>

617
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.650
<v Speaker 3>So if you have that shit in your field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to pay them every year.</v>

618
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Every year you have to pay for new </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeds.</v>

619
00:25:18.781 --> 00:25:21.000
<v Speaker 3>You can't do the way people always did </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

620
00:25:21.001 --> 00:25:26.001
<v Speaker 3>You grew tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you took the seeds from the tomatoes </v>

621
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:26.001
<v Speaker 3>mode tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't,</v>

622
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:26.001
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

623
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:29.430
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but data is the nuttiest shit ever,</v>

624
00:25:29.431 --> 00:25:34.431
<v Speaker 3>and that's the number one reason for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy genetically modifying food is to </v>

625
00:25:34.431 --> 00:25:35.760
<v Speaker 3>control the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the number one reason.</v>

626
00:25:35.761 --> 00:25:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Also why marijuana will always remain </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal to a lot of people there.</v>

627
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.300
<v Speaker 3>They'll want to keep it illegal rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because I can't control it.</v>

628
00:25:42.301 --> 00:25:42.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

629
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hemp is grown in every industrialized </v>

630
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:47.560
<v Speaker 2>country other than America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It amazing.</v>

631
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada right up north,</v>

632
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:49.560
<v Speaker 2>right above us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

633
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.610
<v Speaker 2>They're growing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grow all of the seed products that </v>

634
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:54.610
<v Speaker 2>are in whole foods and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nutrition.</v>

635
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:57.300
<v Speaker 2>So all this is money that farmers could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be making this shit.</v>

636
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 2>All this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're stealing from them.</v>

637
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 2>These cons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government is stealing from them.</v>

638
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Steve Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julie,</v>

639
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's dealing it by denying them </v>
<v Speaker 2>their culture.</v>

640
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Fucking best country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to Indiana,</v>

641
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 3>they're going to bomb California is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna.</v>

642
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.210
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition nine takes over 19,</v>

643
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.280
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition 19 thinking gay.</v>

644
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.050
<v Speaker 3>It's running when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

645
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.930
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that shit goes into effect,</v>

646
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.330
<v Speaker 3>if and when it's going to change the </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

647
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:35.510
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big change is going to be in </v>

648
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.610
<v Speaker 3>people's behavior because you can talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the paper you want,</v>

649
00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:40.611
<v Speaker 3>but what was the most fascinating thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me is what it does to people </v>

650
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:41.490
<v Speaker 3>socially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changes the fuck out of human beings,</v>

651
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:41.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

652
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

653
00:26:42.481 --> 00:26:44.850
<v Speaker 2>some of the things people are coming out</v>
<v Speaker 2>against prop.</v>

654
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 2>Nice 19 to saying is that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lend itself to corporations and it's not</v>

655
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:50.940
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Corporations are not saying that.</v>

656
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Who's saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

657
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:56.811
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of people that are in the </v>

658
00:26:56.811 --> 00:26:57.120
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana industry that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to see prop 19 past because they're</v>

659
00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 2>comfortable right now and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>profiteering and they don't want to see,</v>

660
00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a status quo change.</v>

661
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:06.591
<v Speaker 2>And it's really sad because these are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that would benefit the most </v>

662
00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.280
<v Speaker 2>when they're local communities allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to start selling to anybody over 21</v>

663
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:09.740
<v Speaker 2>without a doctor's note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

664
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.870
<v Speaker 2>But the doctors who've been making their</v>
<v Speaker 2>living for all these years,</v>

665
00:27:12.871 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 2>given away prescriptions and charged 150</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks a pop,</v>

666
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.540
<v Speaker 2>that's the source of income these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

667
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 2>That's where historically wealthy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do fine.</v>

668
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Actually practicing medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure maybe,</v>

669
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 2>but when you're set up for years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and years,</v>

670
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:31.671
<v Speaker 2>just given out medical marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions and you're comfortable </v>

671
00:27:31.671 --> 00:27:34.611
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all sudden something's going to </v>

672
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:34.611
<v Speaker 2>come along to make your business go </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

673
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:34.920
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some whole new business,</v>

674
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.530
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a selfish douche bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see where you'd be like,</v>

675
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:38.250
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want this.</v>

676
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that why the alcohol beverage </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry is giving to the campaign </v>

677
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 2>against us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that why all these interested self</v>

678
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:47.680
<v Speaker 2>interested companies are stepping up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some kids,</v>

679
00:27:47.681 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't expect it out of the medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana doc.</v>

680
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:54.830
<v Speaker 2>Another lie heard was that big tobacco </v>
<v Speaker 2>moneys behind this when it's such </v>

681
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:55.470
<v Speaker 2>bullshit proposition 19.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

682
00:27:55.471 --> 00:27:57.730
<v Speaker 2>When you can look up and see where all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the money came from,</v>

683
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.900
<v Speaker 2>it it realistically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prop 19 was passed by somebody that </v>

684
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.810
<v Speaker 2>has somebody I've known for over 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

685
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:07.200
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good person that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>just wanted to do the right thing.</v>

686
00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:09.870
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to put forward a more liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>PR initiative,</v>

687
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.080
<v Speaker 2>but he had cash and he pulled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>initiative and he found that more </v>

688
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.801
<v Speaker 2>liberal initiatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not polling well enough to </v>

689
00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:18.801
<v Speaker 2>actually pass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we actually pulled back,</v>

690
00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:23.721
<v Speaker 2>pull back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull back on the verbiage until the gun </v>

691
00:28:23.721 --> 00:28:26.270
<v Speaker 2>initiative that polled well enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass and what a lot of people don't </v>

692
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.360
<v Speaker 2>realize is that this is not the means to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>

693
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.910
<v Speaker 2>This is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or this is a means to the end.</v>

694
00:28:29.911 --> 00:28:34.911
<v Speaker 2>It's not the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just one small step in the </v>

695
00:28:34.911 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 2>evolution of getting our freedoms back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this prop 19 is going to be one step</v>

696
00:28:36.601 --> 00:28:41.601
<v Speaker 2>closer to having our rights back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of people aren't talking </v>

697
00:28:41.601 --> 00:28:41.601
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pissing me off,</v>

698
00:28:41.601 --> 00:28:46.311
<v Speaker 2>is that we got meg whitman buying her </v>
<v Speaker 2>way into the governorship and we have </v>

699
00:28:46.311 --> 00:28:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Steve Cooley who has been the guy down </v>
<v Speaker 2>here in la.</v>

700
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.740
<v Speaker 2>For those of you who don't live in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has been closing down all the Los </v>

701
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Angeles pot clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if this guy gets the top cop </v>

702
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.820
<v Speaker 2>position in the state of California and </v>
<v Speaker 2>prop 19 loses all of these idiots and </v>

703
00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll say you are idiots that are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>against prop 19 that are selling medical</v>

704
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:07.761
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to lose your businesses and </v>

705
00:29:07.761 --> 00:29:08.010
<v Speaker 2>lose your freedoms and the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to protect you right now is</v>

706
00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:13.011
<v Speaker 2>if everybody in the state gets the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights that you have been getting for </v>

707
00:29:13.011 --> 00:29:16.221
<v Speaker 2>the last 14 years since medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana concentrate on these dildos.</v>

708
00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's concentrate on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

709
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:19.050
<v Speaker 2>let's try and concentrate on that cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the.</v>

710
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

711
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Steve Cooley is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy that's running for </v>

712
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.740
<v Speaker 2>attorney general and he's basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>running it.</v>

713
00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:30.741
<v Speaker 2>Somebody that's against the death </v>
<v Speaker 2>penalty and in California you might as </v>

714
00:29:30.741 --> 00:29:33.861
<v Speaker 2>well be running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get somebody on a post running against </v>

715
00:29:33.861 --> 00:29:33.861
<v Speaker 2>someone who's against the death penalty.</v>

716
00:29:33.861 --> 00:29:33.861
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

717
00:29:33.861 --> 00:29:35.610
<v Speaker 2>so he's running unopposed in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>

718
00:29:35.611 --> 00:29:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he gets in,</v>

719
00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 2>his agenda is to do in the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has already done in La.</v>

720
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Well why's he want to shut down medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>pot stores ideologically and who knows </v>

721
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what he's invested in,</v>

722
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:49.770
<v Speaker 2>who knows what his reality is from those</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigns,</v>

723
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.430
<v Speaker 2>how to his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:52.400
<v Speaker 2>who knows who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

725
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.000
<v Speaker 2>who really he's loyal to in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

726
00:29:55.090 --> 00:30:00.090
<v Speaker 2>but there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some campaign contributions or </v>

727
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:00.090
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something going on.</v>

728
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I would love to be able to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the money forensically and see </v>

729
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.141
<v Speaker 2>exactly where it came to these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in some ways there's got to be </v>

730
00:30:07.141 --> 00:30:07.141
<v Speaker 2>strings pulling them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

731
00:30:07.141 --> 00:30:09.820
<v Speaker 2>and it's not cheap to run a campaign in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state of California.</v>

732
00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 2>You need to get on the side to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of money.</v>

733
00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:17.540
<v Speaker 2>That's where don't have a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>money that she is very,</v>

734
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:18.970
<v Speaker 2>very rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is she?</v>

735
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 2>What was her position in Ebay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had something to do with Ebay.</v>

736
00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:23.850
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

737
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 2>founded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not founded.</v>

738
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:30.391
<v Speaker 2>She was the one that was brought in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought them from being a very small </v>

739
00:30:30.391 --> 00:30:33.121
<v Speaker 2>company to a very large company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She helped organize them and she rode </v>

740
00:30:33.121 --> 00:30:33.121
<v Speaker 2>their growth curve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

741
00:30:33.121 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 2>so she made a ton of money off Ebay and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now she wants to be the governor and </v>

742
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 2>she's spending how much money to do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

743
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:42.121
<v Speaker 2>Spent over 100 million dollars of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>own money to become governor of </v>

744
00:30:42.121 --> 00:30:43.360
<v Speaker 2>$100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a job that pays 200,000</v>

745
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.950
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google it people much as pay.</v>

746
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.320
<v Speaker 2>It's pays nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

747
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.910
<v Speaker 2>and this is the scarier part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

748
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:53.911
<v Speaker 2>what do you think she's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish with this hundred million </v>

749
00:30:53.911 --> 00:30:53.911
<v Speaker 2>dollar influence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is she doing this for?</v>

750
00:30:53.911 --> 00:30:55.720
<v Speaker 2>A testament to their ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

751
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.150
<v Speaker 2>it's building a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

752
00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.710
<v Speaker 2>don't do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

753
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 2>this is just turned my volume down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

754
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.820
<v Speaker 2>this is the part that kind of bothers me</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that this is more of what we've had </v>

755
00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.881
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that now we're looking at it </v>

756
00:31:08.881 --> 00:31:10.711
<v Speaker 2>and were grossed out by it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't think before newspapers and </v>

757
00:31:10.711 --> 00:31:13.561
<v Speaker 2>Internet carried the word that robber </v>
<v Speaker 2>barons weren't running politics going </v>

758
00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 2>back to the thirties and forties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties.</v>

759
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say they,</v>

760
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to sound like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy nut.</v>

761
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean to sound like somebody that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic about the fact that alcohol </v>

762
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 2>got together after prohibition and went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

763
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:24.700
<v Speaker 2>who's our competition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

764
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:28.390
<v Speaker 2>these kids are smoking this local weed </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a psa and then they really should go</v>

765
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 2>after talking to this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

766
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.820
<v Speaker 2>This is Meg Whitman woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is obviously very wealthy.</v>

767
00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be very difficult to </v>

768
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:39.280
<v Speaker 2>buy a person who's very wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She very wealthy.</v>

769
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.200
<v Speaker 2>So why would this very wealthy person </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to stop medical marijuana in </v>

770
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 2>California?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that is what she wants to do.</v>

771
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 2>What would be her motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it would not be financial,</v>

772
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't need the money.</v>

773
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:51.700
<v Speaker 2>She's spending 100 million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I say governor?</v>

774
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:56.701
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that the alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies for sure and not giving her </v>

775
00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:56.701
<v Speaker 2>$100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million million,</v>

776
00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:56.701
<v Speaker 2>killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have that much money,</v>

777
00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't sitting in a locker at the edge</v>

778
00:31:58.251 --> 00:32:00.280
<v Speaker 2>of your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sitting in investments and I'd love</v>

779
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:05.281
<v Speaker 2>to know what her portfolio is invested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in because she has people that are </v>

780
00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:06.100
<v Speaker 2>actually standing there saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'll advise you to do,</v>

781
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:11.250
<v Speaker 2>and anybody that's advising somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has literally hundreds of millions </v>

782
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.010
<v Speaker 2>of dollars vested way is going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

783
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.530
<v Speaker 2>this initiative is bad for your liquor </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments.</v>

784
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.240
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for your pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments.</v>

785
00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:19.690
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for a financial decision on her</v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

786
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:24.730
<v Speaker 2>A lot of why we're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibition and why we're dealing with </v>

787
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.631
<v Speaker 2>people that are against it is because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the financial connections they have in </v>

788
00:32:27.631 --> 00:32:28.330
<v Speaker 2>the more wealthy they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more that people lean against them.</v>

789
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.590
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How few?</v>

790
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:34.650
<v Speaker 2>In a sense do we have a view?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because here you are a guy that made it </v>

791
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.330
<v Speaker 2>in TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five years of Newsradio,</v>

792
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.350
<v Speaker 2>five plus years on fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a career.</v>

793
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>You will have advisors around you </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

794
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.810
<v Speaker 2>listen Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do stupid stuff,</v>

795
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.900
<v Speaker 2>it's going to knock it you the big jobs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will pay a lot of money and then </v>

796
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where those Pearson's going to advise</v>

797
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 2>you to go be the activist that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>become?</v>

798
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>

799
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know that a lot of other </v>

800
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:55.990
<v Speaker 2>actors have to stop and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

801
00:32:55.990 --> 00:33:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I won't get hired if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I start getting all radical and </v>

802
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.160
<v Speaker 2>that's what they really believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they towed the line.</v>

803
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.710
<v Speaker 2>You are so rare because you haven't told</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line.</v>

804
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

805
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be happy and be myself than </v>
<v Speaker 2>be some slave to a corporate,</v>

806
00:33:07.841 --> 00:33:08.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictation.</v>

807
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you don't have to do it that way.</v>

808
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are.</v>

809
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 3>But when you're a nice person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how few woody Harrelson's and Joe </v>

810
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Rogan's do we have speaking up for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right reasons.</v>

811
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

812
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:26.381
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have families and they </v>

813
00:33:26.381 --> 00:33:28.331
<v Speaker 3>want to play it safe and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative and they get paranoid and </v>

814
00:33:28.331 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 3>they don't trust in the greater good of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity and the people's ability to see</v>

815
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

816
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:37.750
<v Speaker 3>They don't have faith in their ability </v>
<v Speaker 3>to express themselves so that people </v>

817
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:38.480
<v Speaker 3>understand the point of view that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have and where they're coming from.</v>

818
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I have confidence in my ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>express myself and you do it for us all </v>

819
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:44.630
<v Speaker 3>in the way that's important for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

820
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:46.580
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody should and would do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

821
00:33:46.581 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a rational thinking person,</v>

822
00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:51.530
<v Speaker 3>why would you live your life pretending </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be something other than who you are.</v>

823
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:56.770
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you not want people to know </v>

824
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:56.770
<v Speaker 3>about something that's radically changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you look at the world?</v>

825
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Why would you not want to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

826
00:33:57.951 --> 00:34:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Because fucking meg whitman says it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

827
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 3>We get that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck.</v>

828
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Did she quit or get fired from Ebay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because she's a woman who </v>

829
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.871
<v Speaker 3>wants to be in control of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always 75 percent of Ebay's </v>

830
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:14.030
<v Speaker 3>audience stone people in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>night buying shit.</v>

831
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:15.670
<v Speaker 3>She shouldn't have her audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

832
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.930
<v Speaker 3>She probably pulled this airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got fired.</v>

833
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.870
<v Speaker 3>You know she's a slapped away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Far more lucrative.</v>

834
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Creepy man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women don't want to run.</v>

835
00:34:22.821 --> 00:34:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Shit creeped me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

836
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.800
<v Speaker 3>I know it sounds gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's totally true.</v>

837
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Soundwise Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't.</v>

838
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.300
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't creep you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is a creep me the fuck out.</v>

839
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at least a rise of Condoleeza Rice </v>

840
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:37.350
<v Speaker 3>was running things.</v>

841
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.360
<v Speaker 3>When you think you'd freak the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creepy guys.</v>

842
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney came to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I want guys running shit,</v>

843
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.580
<v Speaker 3>but at least they've been doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

844
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.390
<v Speaker 3>My older chick wants to hop in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>compete with the men.</v>

845
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you crazy bitch?</v>

846
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:50.240
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not balanced.</v>

847
00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:55.241
<v Speaker 3>You ain't got no fucking Yogi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to see through the </v>

848
00:34:55.241 --> 00:34:55.241
<v Speaker 3>maze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

849
00:34:55.241 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking just as crazy as the men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not crazier,</v>

850
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:58.970
<v Speaker 3>because you have to because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman and because they're going to prove</v>

851
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:00.680
<v Speaker 3>that they're tougher than the men </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're replacing.</v>

852
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:05.710
<v Speaker 3>That scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I there was a moment where Hillary </v>

853
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Clinton was running for president when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was thinking,</v>

854
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.760
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to win at.</v>

855
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:12.761
<v Speaker 3>What if she wins and she gets a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>position where one of these crazy fucks </v>

856
00:35:12.761 --> 00:35:14.120
<v Speaker 3>from another country tests her because </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a woman.</v>

857
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:19.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean if that political power is real </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that the president really has any </v>

858
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:25.001
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then anybody in another country </v>

859
00:35:25.001 --> 00:35:25.001
<v Speaker 3>really does pay attention to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not all this big,</v>

860
00:35:25.001 --> 00:35:28.400
<v Speaker 3>gigantic build a burger meeting group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assuming that a president is real,</v>

861
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:33.670
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine what Putin would do if</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sat across from fucking Hillary </v>

862
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Clinton or salar Pailin at a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's some sort of a.</v>

863
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would crush them,</v>

864
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 3>isn't a mock them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would.</v>

865
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:45.950
<v Speaker 3>He would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most cultures put their most </v>

866
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:48.351
<v Speaker 3>intellectually capable people in power </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not their best idiots.</v>

867
00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that.</v>

868
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.910
<v Speaker 3>It's not that men should be running shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

869
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:57.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most capable bit of the alpha.</v>

870
00:35:57.031 --> 00:36:02.031
<v Speaker 3>The one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of having a leader is fucking </v>

871
00:36:02.031 --> 00:36:04.281
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an archaic shit that we </v>

872
00:36:04.281 --> 00:36:06.411
<v Speaker 3>have to figure a new way around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not saying that men should be </v>

873
00:36:06.411 --> 00:36:06.411
<v Speaker 3>running shit.</v>

874
00:36:06.411 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who was a woman that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>run shit,</v>

875
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.320
<v Speaker 3>like that's kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't even have a dick.</v>

876
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Why are you trying to control </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything?</v>

877
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.940
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you trying to fucking grab the </v>

878
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:16.940
<v Speaker 3>reins?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do it?</v>

879
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

880
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:18.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a leader.</v>

881
00:36:18.091 --> 00:36:23.091
<v Speaker 3>I'm don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that I am better than a </v>

882
00:36:23.091 --> 00:36:25.821
<v Speaker 3>woman who would be doing the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying when I see a woman who wants </v>

883
00:36:25.821 --> 00:36:28.551
<v Speaker 3>to be a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand the man wanting to be a </v>

884
00:36:28.551 --> 00:36:28.551
<v Speaker 3>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense to me.</v>

885
00:36:28.551 --> 00:36:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Even if I don't believe in it or agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

886
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I say a woman is wanting to do it,</v>

887
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that crazy bitch.</v>

888
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you want to be the king of the </v>

889
00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:38.360
<v Speaker 3>world and you're a chick.</v>

890
00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

891
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.760
<v Speaker 3>But yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iceland's not in wars and they had a </v>

892
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 3>female froze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking of all that female </v>

893
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 3>leaders around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

894
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.630
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally sexist.</v>

895
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 3>It's totally sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong.</v>

896
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:54.750
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think anybody should be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>leader.</v>

897
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:59.751
<v Speaker 3>I think the whole idea based on science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's based on some leftover fucking shit</v>

898
00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:05.241
<v Speaker 3>from back when we were a tribe of 200 </v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey people and we needed a leader to </v>

899
00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:10.101
<v Speaker 3>protect us from the other monkey people </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to rape our women and take our </v>

900
00:37:10.101 --> 00:37:10.101
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

901
00:37:10.101 --> 00:37:14.391
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that one person can represent </v>

902
00:37:14.391 --> 00:37:14.391
<v Speaker 3>the whole country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a president.</v>

903
00:37:14.391 --> 00:37:18.381
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck if he has a cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give up the idea that there's a </v>

904
00:37:18.381 --> 00:37:20.730
<v Speaker 3>one guy that stands there and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president of the United States,</v>

905
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the figurehead,</v>

906
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.570
<v Speaker 3>even if the descendant of royalty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's shirt and it's an Avatar,</v>

907
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.040
<v Speaker 3>that the whole idea is ridiculous.</v>

908
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.350
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

909
00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:34.351
<v Speaker 3>it's so really created our whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure in America to compete against </v>

910
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:34.351
<v Speaker 3>what they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were fighting.</v>

911
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 3>And then they became and they became </v>
<v Speaker 3>wayward,</v>

912
00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wayward.</v>

913
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.690
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

914
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to hear so much shit from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>female friends.</v>

915
00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't think women should be running </v>

916
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.650
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

917
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think men do it better.</v>

918
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe might have been doing it wrong for</v>

919
00:37:52.321 --> 00:37:57.321
<v Speaker 3>so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe be good for a woman to give it a </v>

920
00:37:57.321 --> 00:37:59.481
<v Speaker 3>try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're definitely comfortable in </v>

921
00:37:59.481 --> 00:37:59.481
<v Speaker 3>your relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a worldly thing to say.</v>

922
00:37:59.481 --> 00:38:01.080
<v Speaker 3>If she's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning like,</v>

923
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.570
<v Speaker 3>I know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be like,</v>

924
00:38:03.571 --> 00:38:05.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck women should be presidents now.</v>

925
00:38:05.901 --> 00:38:08.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was his name to be president?</v>

926
00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:13.491
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's saying he's afraid to get his dick </v>

927
00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:13.491
<v Speaker 3>cut off when it goes home.</v>

928
00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:16.700
<v Speaker 3>And he's obviously saying you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what he's saying is you misread he's </v>

929
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.310
<v Speaker 3>saying is he's trying to pretend to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone different.</v>

930
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.180
<v Speaker 3>So he's attractive female race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

931
00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a bashing that females rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

932
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.240
<v Speaker 3>most females,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the women that take that are constant </v>

933
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.400
<v Speaker 3>and not bashing the female racers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not bashing them male race.</v>

934
00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:34.650
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't want to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

935
00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:36.580
<v Speaker 3>most of the male race doesn't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

936
00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:38.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a male thing.</v>

937
00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:43.321
<v Speaker 3>It's a leader thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is I understand the </v>

938
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:44.380
<v Speaker 3>creepy fuck control freak men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that instinct,</v>

939
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.200
<v Speaker 3>but when I see a chick that wants a rock</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I go,</v>

940
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 3>what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Pailin.</v>

941
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.720
<v Speaker 3>I guess one way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Palin's just his dummy that got </v>

942
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:54.720
<v Speaker 3>stuck into a nice position that she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make some money.</v>

943
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what it is,</v>

944
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 3>but after awhile it's not that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After a while it's like,</v>

945
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:04.411
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the figurehead for the retard </v>

946
00:39:04.411 --> 00:39:05.971
<v Speaker 3>movement and you're just like them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a microphone on you and there's </v>

947
00:39:05.971 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 3>a spotlight on you and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're a fucking problem because you</v>

948
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 3>never were supposed to get to this point</v>
<v Speaker 3>and send out.</v>

949
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:13.771
<v Speaker 3>You've artificially been inserted into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the public consciousness with no merit </v>

950
00:39:13.771 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 3>and now all the retards go.</v>

951
00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.950
<v Speaker 3>They rise up and start these fucking tea</v>
<v Speaker 3>party rallies.</v>

952
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Have you watched any of that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy God damn thing Glenn Beck is just </v>

953
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:30.661
<v Speaker 3>making gold underwear and gold socks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>diamond covered fucking cars from that </v>

954
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:34.630
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Must be just scraping it in with raikes.</v>

955
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 3>She'll obviously fully shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like his game only works on the DM.</v>

956
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 3>It only put.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many dumb people.</v>

957
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:44.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a very effective tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him and her together.</v>

958
00:39:44.351 --> 00:39:49.351
<v Speaker 3>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they scare the fuck out of double dumb </v>

959
00:39:49.351 --> 00:39:49.351
<v Speaker 3>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glenn Beck and Sarah Pailin.</v>

960
00:39:49.351 --> 00:39:52.330
<v Speaker 3>They combined forces with the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they could.</v>

961
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 3>They could run for president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

962
00:39:53.711 --> 00:39:54.810
<v Speaker 3>That's real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that</v>

963
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:59.070
<v Speaker 2>presidents of black lady with a list and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's totally a lesbian.</v>

964
00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.370
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's like every single horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's wrong with,</v>

965
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like banning gay marriage,</v>

966
00:40:04.591 --> 00:40:05.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women presidents.</v>

967
00:40:05.581 --> 00:40:10.581
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's all combined into one like </v>
<v Speaker 2>super president that just pisses off </v>

968
00:40:10.581 --> 00:40:14.760
<v Speaker 2>everybody hope it's an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an alien</v>

969
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.330
<v Speaker 3>alien winds than disguise of a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being and then tells her buddy,</v>

970
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:24.230
<v Speaker 3>now that we have a deputy that we'd like</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know that I'm in place and I'm </v>

971
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.780
<v Speaker 3>running shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just need to sit the fuck down.</v>

972
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.730
<v Speaker 3>We've been thinking about exterminating </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

973
00:40:26.731 --> 00:40:31.731
<v Speaker 3>Fucks for about 50 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought your concept of us being cold </v>

974
00:40:31.731 --> 00:40:32.760
<v Speaker 3>was really accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

975
00:40:32.761 --> 00:40:37.761
<v Speaker 3>it is a giant life form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant life form on a super </v>

976
00:40:37.761 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 3>organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the human race is.</v>

977
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.490
<v Speaker 3>The human race is on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earth is a life form.</v>

978
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.970
<v Speaker 3>It is a super organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

979
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.660
<v Speaker 3>We don't think of planets that support </v>
<v Speaker 3>life as a life form,</v>

980
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.330
<v Speaker 3>but because it's an environment where </v>
<v Speaker 3>life grows,</v>

981
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.480
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not so sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at lava and the center and </v>

982
00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.601
<v Speaker 3>the magnetic core and you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnetosphere and the atmosphere and </v>

983
00:40:56.601 --> 00:40:59.130
<v Speaker 3>like this is not just a place where life</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

984
00:40:59.131 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's alive and well.</v>

985
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's conscious man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're guessing and we assume that </v>

986
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:09.770
<v Speaker 3>conscious means that it can talk like us</v>
<v Speaker 3>and move like Gospel.</v>

987
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:10.860
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>

988
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:15.890
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of evidence that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be something going on inside </v>

989
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.951
<v Speaker 3>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some sort of fucking a real reaction </v>

990
00:41:18.951 --> 00:41:19.350
<v Speaker 3>that trees and plants have to pee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People</v>

991
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:22.100
<v Speaker 2>will thank US cellular intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

992
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's really where we've always </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

993
00:41:23.521 --> 00:41:24.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in our brain,</v>

994
00:41:24.361 --> 00:41:26.640
<v Speaker 2>and then there's this myth that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even use our own brain,</v>

995
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.290
<v Speaker 2>all of our brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

996
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:33.291
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how many of us are you </v>

997
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:33.770
<v Speaker 2>stupid that you believe that your whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>body's not actually it all,</v>

998
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:39.070
<v Speaker 3>all marks right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that our capability of </v>

999
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:39.070
<v Speaker 3>intelligence is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really deep.</v>

1000
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.490
<v Speaker 3>That's a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for,</v>

1001
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:45.491
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasted potential if people have this </v>

1002
00:41:45.491 --> 00:41:45.491
<v Speaker 3>idea that we're only using 10 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our brains.</v>

1003
00:41:45.491 --> 00:41:48.500
<v Speaker 3>If we just really concentrate like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one even knows what that means.</v>

1004
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:53.501
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're only using 10 percent of your </v>

1005
00:41:53.501 --> 00:41:55.061
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on with the other 90 </v>

1006
00:41:55.061 --> 00:41:55.061
<v Speaker 3>percent of useful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1007
00:41:55.061 --> 00:41:59.020
<v Speaker 3>you know how we know how the brain works</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we blow holes and parts of the </v>

1008
00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.321
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we shoot people in parts of their head </v>

1009
00:42:02.321 --> 00:42:02.321
<v Speaker 3>and then gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1010
00:42:02.321 --> 00:42:04.571
<v Speaker 3>I can't see anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's the part where you see </v>

1011
00:42:04.571 --> 00:42:04.571
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1012
00:42:04.571 --> 00:42:06.660
<v Speaker 3>we drill the hole here on Sundays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Calm.</v>

1013
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is the part that makes them</v>

1014
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:09.590
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just drill a hole in that,</v>

1015
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:10.210
<v Speaker 3>but that's the law.</v>

1016
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Bottomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they did.</v>

1017
00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 3>When people get a little nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

1018
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:18.340
<v Speaker 3>what do you wanna do you to kill him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to drill a fucking hole in his </v>

1019
00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:18.440
<v Speaker 3>head and see if we can fix something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One flew over the cuckoo's nest.</v>

1020
00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would fix people by drilling holes </v>

1021
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:25.350
<v Speaker 3>in their head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollaback back.</v>

1022
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Do you know you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole group of humans that </v>

1023
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:33.431
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily put holes in their head and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe that it alleviates pressure</v>

1024
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:39.461
<v Speaker 3>and gives them euphoria and that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure of the growing brain trapped </v>

1025
00:42:39.461 --> 00:42:40.940
<v Speaker 3>inside the skull causes headaches and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of problems,</v>

1026
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.180
<v Speaker 3>and in Africa there's fucking cultures </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have done this where they </v>

1027
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.090
<v Speaker 3>literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They caught the entire skull.</v>

1028
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Speaker 3>I posted it on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if he can find it.</v>

1029
00:42:49.491 --> 00:42:50.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you would look under.</v>

1030
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a term for it.</v>

1031
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.240
<v Speaker 3>There's a term for it for holes in where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call shit.</v>

1032
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking up here because there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual term for it,</v>

1033
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.430
<v Speaker 3>but people do it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a.</v>

1034
00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:08.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you can find that,</v>

1035
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.080

<v Speaker 3>panning.</v>

1036
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Panning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>T R e p a n I n g itself,</v>

1037

1038
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.030
<v Speaker 3>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1039
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.501
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a video of these African dudes </v>

1040
00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:26.230
<v Speaker 3>where they do it with no anesthesia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do it with these fucking stone </v>

1041
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:31.510
<v Speaker 3>tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like strip away your fucking </v>

1042
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.440
<v Speaker 3>scalped and cut out your bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1043
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:37.450
<v Speaker 3>they don't just do it once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it as many as 20 times they </v>

1044
00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:37.450
<v Speaker 3>ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1045
00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.080
<v Speaker 3>and they fucked their brains up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dudes are not only that though,</v>

1046
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:44.160
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to wear hats from that I'm </v>

1047
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:44.160
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because their brain is exposed.</v>

1048
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.390
<v Speaker 3>There's a like a canoe shape cutout on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the top of their fucking skull.</v>

1049
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Dr John Clark with the first one to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in 16,</v>

1050
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:55.210
<v Speaker 3>64 and he taught the Africans tend to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and that's what they're saying to us.</v>

1051
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>us us American.</v>

1052
00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he might've.</v>

1053
00:43:59.151 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 3>It might've been just like religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We brought Christianity over to Africa.</v>

1054
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.810
<v Speaker 3>It just says first fits physician to </v>
<v Speaker 3>perform it in the US.</v>

1055
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 3>And he did it as a alleviating pressure </v>
<v Speaker 3>on someone.</v>

1056
00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1057
00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.880
<v Speaker 3>if you can think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's out there doing it,</v>

1058
00:44:13.881 --> 00:44:17.410
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen those women in Surrey.</v>

1059
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in Africa where they cut their </v>

1060
00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:22.760
<v Speaker 3>lip and stick a plate in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that shit?</v>

1061
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:25.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never seen the plates and the lips.</v>

1062
00:44:25.271 --> 00:44:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1063
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know the theory to the named.</v>

1064
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.590
<v Speaker 3>It's the most insane thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just weird.</v>

1065
00:44:30.591 --> 00:44:35.591
<v Speaker 3>The bigger the plate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more cows they're worth when they </v>

1066
00:44:35.591 --> 00:44:38.391
<v Speaker 3>get married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like saying if you want to marry my </v>

1067
00:44:38.391 --> 00:44:38.391
<v Speaker 3>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1068
00:44:38.391 --> 00:44:39.570
<v Speaker 3>And she's got a giant ass fucking plate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1069
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:41.220
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a 50 cal plate.</v>

1070
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.450
<v Speaker 3>You've got to come strong sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1071
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:48.470
<v Speaker 3>So dudes would have to give her her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to give up a herd because </v>

1072
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 3>she's willing to carry around this giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>plate in her lips.</v>

1073
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Issue in their teeth out to.</v>

1074
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:58.160
<v Speaker 3>They have to bang their lower teeth out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the plate sits there and you </v>

1075
00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.550
<v Speaker 3>can't get a full plate in there if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the lower teeth.</v>

1076
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 3>So when the plate starts getting big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to smash their teeth out.</v>

1077
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:08.340
<v Speaker 3>You might blow jobs filled like probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>does Africa suck.</v>

1078
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:13.910
<v Speaker 3>People willing to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're willing to put plates in your </v>

1079
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:14.870
<v Speaker 3>lips and cut holes in your heading where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stretch the neck out.</v>

1080
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.700
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They must be so freaked out.</v>

1081
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.080
<v Speaker 3>They got stuck in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1082
00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:20.610
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make this interesting.</v>

1083
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here we are stuck running from </v>

1084
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.730
<v Speaker 3>hyenas and getting eaten by crocodiles </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

1085
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:26.650
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to stretch our next </v>
<v Speaker 3>album,</v>

1086
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our next real big.</v>

1087
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows why they do these things well,</v>

1088
00:45:31.471 --> 00:45:36.471
<v Speaker 3>how about those heads of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They found in Peru where they stretch </v>

1089
00:45:36.471 --> 00:45:37.230
<v Speaker 3>their head out gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big alien head.</v>

1090
00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.620
<v Speaker 3>They did it to like a huge percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the population.</v>

1091
00:45:40.621 --> 00:45:45.621
<v Speaker 3>They put boards in their heads and tied </v>
<v Speaker 3>them down and literally extended their </v>

1092
00:45:45.621 --> 00:45:45.950
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1093
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.950
<v Speaker 3>and people were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1094
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:49.980
<v Speaker 3>is this to emulate something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to emulate the gods.</v>

1095
00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:54.981
<v Speaker 3>All the Annunaki people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see this is evidence they were doing </v>

1096
00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 3>this to try to emulate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>

1097
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 3>Because look at these Africans that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting the fucking holes in their lives</v>

1098
00:45:57.661 --> 00:46:02.661
<v Speaker 3>and stick and plates and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dudes cutting the holes in their </v>

1099
00:46:02.661 --> 00:46:02.661
<v Speaker 3>heads and letting the air out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1100
00:46:02.661 --> 00:46:05.550
<v Speaker 3>they're not emulating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just practicing medicine.</v>

1101
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.900
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1102
00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 3>People are nuts.</v>

1103
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still kind of.</v>

1104
00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Numbers are trolling everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows freaky.</v>

1105
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 2>The disease I had as a child I found out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mid eighties,</v>

1106
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 2>they stopped treating aggressively that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like more when I was in the seventies,</v>

1107
00:46:17.101 --> 00:46:22.101
<v Speaker 2>I was more a victim of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemotherapy and an elective surgeries </v>

1108
00:46:22.101 --> 00:46:26.081
<v Speaker 2>are not elective surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but surgeries that weren't needed and </v>

1109
00:46:26.081 --> 00:46:27.600
<v Speaker 2>radiation than I was of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease because they were practicing.</v>

1110
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1111
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up to is the accent.</v>

1112
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Histiocytosis x meant that the pathology</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the disease was unknown.</v>

1113
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 2>And when I first asked an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1114
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:37.870
<v Speaker 2>where did my disease come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they went,</v>

1115
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:39.240
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1116
00:46:39.241 --> 00:46:40.110
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's we,</v>

1117
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.820
<v Speaker 2>you and me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like,</v>

1118
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
<v Speaker 2>we like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what exactly is the disease history </v>

1119
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.840
<v Speaker 2>of an overactive immune system isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>

1120
00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.550
<v Speaker 2>It's history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1121
00:46:48.551 --> 00:46:52.980
<v Speaker 2>site history of cytosis x and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>overactive right,</v>

1122
00:46:52.981 --> 00:46:57.981
<v Speaker 2>like I would have too many white blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells and they would like in a sense </v>

1123
00:46:57.981 --> 00:46:57.981
<v Speaker 2>accumulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

1124
00:46:57.981 --> 00:47:02.391
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually it was in like bone marrow and </v>

1125
00:47:02.391 --> 00:47:02.391
<v Speaker 2>areas like that and it creates like blow</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1126
00:47:02.391 --> 00:47:02.391
<v Speaker 2>So like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my spine,</v>

1127
00:47:02.391 --> 00:47:04.240
<v Speaker 2>it blew out my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blew out my hip.</v>

1128
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:04.850
<v Speaker 2>It blew out.</v>

1129
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Would it get better if you got sick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

1130
00:47:07.601 --> 00:47:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Sick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got a cold?</v>

1131
00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1132
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1133
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.500
<v Speaker 2>think no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't sees it all the time.</v>

1134
00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's funny as I don't really ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>get sick either.</v>

1135
00:47:18.921 --> 00:47:22.760
<v Speaker 2>I either have problems where like </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it was overgrowing,</v>

1136
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:28.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in marrows and stuff or I'm always </v>

1137
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.030
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through prison five years.</v>

1138
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.430
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1139
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a crazy place.</v>

1140
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but start looking toilets.</v>

1141
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't like touching doors and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1142
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Germaphobe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I actually,</v>

1143
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are gross.</v>

1144
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1147
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.240
<v Speaker 1>the tissue from the bathroom when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened the door to any public restroom.</v>

1148
00:47:52.241 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Take mine open like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not if you've got to pull it with a man,</v>

1149
00:47:56.830 --> 00:48:01.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to twist it and pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually you do actually use a piece of </v>

1150
00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's ways you can protect yourself.</v>

1151
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And if we had hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be using hemp towel.</v>

1152
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to clean it man.</v>

1153
00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:13.810
<v Speaker 1>We'll get some hemp flashlights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we have to vote yes on 19 </v>

1154
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 1>the vote yes on 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important and if you're one of</v>

1155
00:48:16.271 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 1>those people out there that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1156
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking annoying.</v>

1157
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of potheads are annoying.</v>

1158
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:25.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most potheads lot of straight people.</v>

1159
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most people,</v>

1160
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.660
<v Speaker 1>a good percentage of people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>

1161
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And the reason being is because we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have a direction book on how to </v>

1162
00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.470
<v Speaker 1>properly live a healthy life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

1163
00:48:35.471 --> 00:48:37.150

<v Speaker 1>satisfying life.</v>

1164
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:37.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1165
00:48:37.741 --> 00:48:42.741
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live our lives based on myths and </v>

1166
00:48:42.741 --> 00:48:44.971
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit TV shows and movies and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this distorted perception of what this </v>

1167
00:48:44.971 --> 00:48:46.760
<v Speaker 1>fucking world is all about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>have now,</v>

1169
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:50.890

<v Speaker 1>it's so easy for a moron.</v>

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Just drift through and be taken care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every step of the way and yet have </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people will.</v>

00:50:06.301 --> 00:50:07.240
<v Speaker 1>You look at pot ads,</v>

<v Speaker 1>because I can't believe all these people</v>

1206
00:50:10.991 --> 00:50:15.991
<v Speaker 1>I was working around that we thought I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was working towards a common </v>

1207
00:50:15.991 --> 00:50:17.530
<v Speaker 1>goal and now working against it because </v>

<v Speaker 1>either financial reasons,</v>

1210
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:27.620
<v Speaker 1>financial reasons or inaccuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how muCh most hippies are though.</v>

1211
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Every time</v>

1212
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I ever was hanging out with hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to make money like </v>

1213
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:34.650
<v Speaker 2>making profits and still now there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the ideas,</v>

1214
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.340
<v Speaker 2>a lot of non hippies that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercially motivated.</v>

1215

1251
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:17.470
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really lend itself for </v>

1252
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 2>quality with quantity because when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have large amounts of it,</v>

1253
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:24.130
<v Speaker 2>you don't have in a sense is as good a </v>

<v Speaker 2>batches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's talk about one thing for the </v>

<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

1256
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:34.300
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that reallY </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated me the most when I first </v>

1257
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:34.640
<v Speaker 2>found out about marijuana.</v>

1258
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.260
<v Speaker 2>When I first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first,</v>

1259
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought marijuana was bad for you,</v>

1260
00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.280
<v Speaker 2>made you stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things.</v>

1261
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:45.460
<v Speaker 2>But when I first stArted smoking weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that fascinated me the most </v>

1262
00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.941
<v Speaker 2>was that there are two completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different strains that have very </v>

1263
00:52:48.941 --> 00:52:50.030
<v Speaker 2>different effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just different string.</v>

1264
00:52:50.031 --> 00:52:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me break this down.</v>

1265
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:53.630
<v Speaker 2>can I say this right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of confusion in this.</v>

1266
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Before I went to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine,</v>

1267
00:52:55.071 --> 00:53:00.071
<v Speaker 2>he wrote marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>botany and he later wrote the book has </v>

1268
00:53:00.071 --> 00:53:00.450
<v Speaker 2>been revised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HIs name's robert carnal clock.</v>

1269
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.370
<v Speaker 2>He's forgotten more about cannabis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had an opportunity to learn.</v>

1270
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.440
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I was in prison,</v>

1271
00:53:06.441 --> 00:53:11.441
<v Speaker 2>these scientists actually looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>specimens of sativa and indica and </v>

1272
00:53:11.441 --> 00:53:13.670
<v Speaker 2>sativa and indica where questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I walked up to you at seeds,</v>

1273
00:53:13.671 --> 00:53:15.260
<v Speaker 2>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would actually be.</v>

1274
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Does this make clothing and paper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff?</v>

1275
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Or is it like India?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's,</v>

1276
00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:24.110
<v Speaker 2>if you look up the word endeca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>endeca means of.</v>

1277
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Or like India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1278
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.680
<v Speaker 2>So when you go to India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the cannabis that's grown there </v>

1279
00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 2>is endeca because it's in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you go there,</v>

1280
00:53:32.341 --> 00:53:37.341
<v Speaker 2>you'll find tropical varieties down by </v>
<v Speaker 2>goer and northern varieties up by the </v>

1281
00:53:37.341 --> 00:53:41.010
<v Speaker 2>area that's now Pakistan and hindu kush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the entire range of cannabis.</v>

1282
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:43.500
<v Speaker 2>And it's all indycar history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lesson is interesting,</v>

1283
00:53:43.501 --> 00:53:48.501
<v Speaker 2>but either everyone today who wants pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two different effects in tacoma.</v>

1284
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Makes you sleepy and it makes you couch </v>
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>

1285
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 2>It makes you what a lot of people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>of as a stoner.</v>

1286
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Sativa is a totally different experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes you much more introspective</v>

1287
00:53:59.101 --> 00:54:02.370
<v Speaker 2>and makes you start looking at fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>telescopes and space documentaries.</v>

1288
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:04.920
<v Speaker 2>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me saY strain.</v>

1289
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 2>What should we call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1290
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:08.970
<v Speaker 2>it's an equatorial variety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from near the equator because.</v>

1291
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Let me break this down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two different effects though.</v>

1292
00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:16.311
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I want people not pot </v>

1293
00:54:16.311 --> 00:54:17.550
<v Speaker 2>smokers to understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go into these deep historical,</v>

1294
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:22.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but definitely in the sixties and </v>

1295
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:22.770
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the pot that was coming into America</v>

1296
00:54:22.771 --> 00:54:24.030
<v Speaker 2>was acapulco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold,</v>

1297
00:54:24.031 --> 00:54:24.850
<v Speaker 2>michu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ican,</v>

1298
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 2>molly wiley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jamaican.</v>

1299
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 2>All of these strange were the equator </v>
<v Speaker 2>tropical.</v>

1300
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.260
<v Speaker 2>They made you hoppi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horny,</v>

1301
00:54:31.261 --> 00:54:33.630
<v Speaker 2>well organized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to do things like protests,</v>

1302
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.640
<v Speaker 2>and then the hippies went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>

1303
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:40.790
<v Speaker 2>They found this short fat leaves plant </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they thought was endeca and they </v>

1304
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:44.451
<v Speaker 2>started mixing it with all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>tropical varieties like maui wowie and </v>

1305
00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:47.751
<v Speaker 2>thai stick and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they shortened the time it takes to </v>

1306
00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:51.111
<v Speaker 2>flower cannabis and they picked </v>
<v Speaker 2>varieties that yielded the most amount </v>

1307
00:54:51.111 --> 00:54:51.810
<v Speaker 2>of pot because it isn't being</v>

1308
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:57.130
<v Speaker 3>the ones that were ecuadorian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones that were growing on the </v>

1309
00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:58.210
<v Speaker 3>equator needed a longer cycle of sun</v>

1310
00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.470
<v Speaker 2>because it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're in a 12,</v>

1311
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.990
<v Speaker 2>12 and those are the ones</v>

1312
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:04.510
<v Speaker 3>that have the different psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

1313
00:55:04.511 --> 00:55:07.850
<v Speaker 3>The ones that come in contact more with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun or the ones that make</v>

1314
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 2>not so much more with the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the varieties that develop </v>

1315
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:15.781
<v Speaker 2>near the equator where there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer cycle are more innocent psycho </v>

1316
00:55:15.781 --> 00:55:18.250
<v Speaker 2>and in a sense in America they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be grown indoors.</v>

1317
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happened is the hippies in</v>

1318
00:55:20.171 --> 00:55:22.600
<v Speaker 2>a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started breeding this afghan with all of</v>

1319
00:55:22.601 --> 00:55:27.601
<v Speaker 2>their tropical varieties and through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties we kind of developed this one </v>

1320
00:55:27.601 --> 00:55:29.650
<v Speaker 2>hit wonder pot that took away all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>good energy and took away all that.</v>

1321
00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And now for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always smoke haze.</v>

1322
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I like super silver haze and then a five</v>
<v Speaker 2>by what people don't understand what </v>

1323
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:37.900
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haze mean sativa in a sense.</v>

1324
00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:40.390
<v Speaker 2>It Does in the sense our terminology of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sativa,</v>

1325
00:55:40.391 --> 00:55:42.980
<v Speaker 2>but sativa really means most useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1326
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:44.030
<v Speaker 3>The way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1327
00:55:44.031 --> 00:55:49.031
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's that's not how it's used in </v>

1328
00:55:49.031 --> 00:55:50.300
<v Speaker 3>dispensary's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indycar and sativa is how it's used.</v>

1329
00:55:50.301 --> 00:55:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Sativa is the heady more trippy space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd and endeca is</v>

1330
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:56.250
<v Speaker 2>couch high energy.</v>

1331
00:55:57.070 --> 00:56:02.070
<v Speaker 3>My whole point in the beginning was I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did not know there was two different </v>

1332
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:04.861
<v Speaker 3>types of pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought pat was pot and then all pod </v>

1333
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:05.320
<v Speaker 3>had a similar effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some pot maybe stronger than other pond,</v>

1334
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's basically all pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to smoke pot,</v>

1335
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:09.580
<v Speaker 3>you leave get really high or what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the same.</v>

1336
00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:14.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not even remotely the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are two different experiences and </v>

1337
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:18.571
<v Speaker 3>almost everyone is used to India because</v>
<v Speaker 3>India [inaudible] the easiest shit to </v>

1338
00:56:18.571 --> 00:56:19.150
<v Speaker 3>grow and because the shit that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>

1339
00:56:19.151 --> 00:56:22.630
<v Speaker 3>if you're getting it from some dudes are</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming down from Canada,</v>

1340
00:56:22.631 --> 00:56:22.910
<v Speaker 3>growing</v>

1341
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.740
<v Speaker 1>brick weed that grows the fastest and us</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most.</v>

1342
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:31.741
<v Speaker 1>And now that we're getting through </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibition will see these varieties </v>

1343
00:56:31.741 --> 00:56:34.650
<v Speaker 1>that take longer and yield less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but have a profoundly different effect </v>

1344
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:37.270
<v Speaker 1>on our energy and our thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how is it wrong?</v>

1345
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 1>What I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's not sativa,</v>

1346
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:42.010
<v Speaker 1>everybody's calling it sativa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sativa really means hemp.</v>

1347
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.750
<v Speaker 1>It's indo european hemp derived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1348
00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:46.840
<v Speaker 1>But we've decided we haven't named what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1349
00:56:46.841 --> 00:56:47.710
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what everyone.</v>

1350
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Universally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the pot community,</v>

1351
00:56:49.601 --> 00:56:51.780
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at two different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>into and sativa.</v>

1352
00:56:51.781 --> 00:56:52.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what they called it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1353
00:56:52.691 --> 00:56:54.280
<v Speaker 1>That's as universally in the poc </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1354
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:56.190
<v Speaker 1>They're all just annoys you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make with your mouth.</v>

1355
00:56:56.191 --> 00:56:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Had described something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely different noise soon.</v>

1356
00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to call it sativa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>indica once we went.</v>

1357
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1358
00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now we look,</v>

1359
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:09.190
<v Speaker 1>we call reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>California's not that lead and coach.</v>

1360
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:10.450
<v Speaker 1>We'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we call it?</v>

1361
00:57:10.451 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 1>We'll call it names like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1362
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 1>arrowhead or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avi on or whatever.</v>

1363
00:57:14.201 --> 00:57:19.201
<v Speaker 1>We're calling that water at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really go get me a bottle of </v>

1364
00:57:19.201 --> 00:57:19.201
<v Speaker 1>water when we're sitting in a five star </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>

1365
00:57:19.201 --> 00:57:23.911
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have and to do you have bottled </v>

1366
00:57:23.911 --> 00:57:26.641
<v Speaker 1>water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I a fucking water kind of sore </v>

1367
00:57:26.641 --> 00:57:26.641
<v Speaker 1>and now I just want water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1368
00:57:26.641 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 1>now trip on this the same way right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk up to a week counter,</v>

1369
00:57:28.361 --> 00:57:32.140
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the same thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make distinguishes like you do</v>

1370
00:57:32.141 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 1>liquor and when you walk up to a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the difference between wine and</v>

1371
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 1>whiskey and if somebody you ought to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiskey and they hand you wine,</v>

1372
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo douche bag.</v>

1373
00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 1>This isn't what I asked for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I go to the store I say,</v>

1374
00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:43.260
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's your sativas?</v>

1375
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got jack cleaner.</v>

1376
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:46.630
<v Speaker 1>We got train regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me some of that train wreck.</v>

1377
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the way we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but technically all drug varieties are </v>

1378
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 1>endeca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1379
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:57.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two different types that when </v>

1380
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:58.891
<v Speaker 1>you go to indicate when you go to India </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get into and it's going to suck </v>

1381
00:57:58.891 --> 00:58:00.610
<v Speaker 1>my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two different experiences.</v>

1382
00:58:00.611 --> 00:58:02.350
<v Speaker 1>We're still good as data people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1383
00:58:02.351 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical knowledge is very important.</v>

1384
00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 1>What all he's saying is all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two different experiences.</v>

1385
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:13.920
<v Speaker 1>There's the couch weed and there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed that makes you think about the </v>

1386
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.070
<v Speaker 1>universe and want to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sativa.</v>

1387
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:17.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The endeca shit is oji kush,</v>

1388
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:23.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a nap and eat cheetos </v>

1389
00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:23.310
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>

1390
00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh gee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grows very much like a sativa just so </v>

1391
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:27.600
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's long and leggy and grows tall and a</v>

1392
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:32.480
<v Speaker 1>small buds and the different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a more version of the event.</v>

1393
00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1394
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:35.140
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hayes,</v>

1395
00:58:35.141 --> 00:58:39.770
<v Speaker 1>my sativa you're calling it came back at</v>
<v Speaker 1>23 point seven thc and my oji cushion.</v>

1396
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Dukkha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came back at 20 point six.</v>

1397
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.730
<v Speaker 1>There was a three point one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Differences.</v>

1398
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.080
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>canabinoids other than thc that make up </v>

1399
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:49.720
<v Speaker 1>the high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just thc.</v>

1400
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Well actually I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a doctorate and by the way,</v>

1401
00:58:52.601 --> 00:58:54.460
<v Speaker 1>we should point out that todd knows his </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1402
00:58:54.461 --> 00:58:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Where's your book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1403
00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.300
<v Speaker 1>who is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God?</v>

1404
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a doctor.</v>

1405
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:03.040
<v Speaker 1>What does he know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what he knows,</v>

1406
00:59:03.041 --> 00:59:08.041
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a book how to grow medical </v>

1407
00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:08.041
<v Speaker 1>marijuana out of europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1408
00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:08.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1409
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I came back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on a delay.</v>

1410
00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.490
<v Speaker 1>This is a a book how to grow medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and it's not.</v>

1411
00:59:12.491 --> 00:59:14.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not in print right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now to get it.</v>

1412
00:59:14.831 --> 00:59:17.470
<v Speaker 1>You go to amazon.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe get a used copy.</v>

1413
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.990
<v Speaker 1>YEs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably do that right on my next book.</v>

1414
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:24.991
<v Speaker 1>Grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medicine's going to come out and I'm </v>

1415
00:59:24.991 --> 00:59:24.991
<v Speaker 1>going to be talking about</v>

1416
00:59:24.991 --> 00:59:24.991
<v Speaker 2>strain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Specific growing.</v>

1417
00:59:24.991 --> 00:59:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could write a lot of books on </v>

1418
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:28.960
<v Speaker 2>growing wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very complex,</v>

1419
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:28.960
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1420
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.750
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of differences when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people try to say,</v>

1421
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generalized is how you grow pot.</v>

1422
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:34.700
<v Speaker 2>You can tell they've never grown pot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because pot is very different to grow.</v>

1423
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

1424
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:41.530
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a question I need answered </v>

1425
00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.511
<v Speaker 2>because I do not understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the there's a female plant and a </v>

1426
00:59:43.511 --> 00:59:46.751
<v Speaker 2>male plant and you need the female plant</v>
<v Speaker 2>is where the medicine comes from.</v>

1427
00:59:46.911 --> 00:59:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Where we come from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1428
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:50.760
<v Speaker 2>they're both right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1429
00:59:50.761 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 2>But they become one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to get the males out.</v>

1430
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Explain what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how it pollinates sales or sex,</v>

1431
00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 2>much like men in in an irony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find fun.</v>

1432
00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Normal with other plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1433
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.090
<v Speaker 2>some plants are either dioecious or have</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sexes on one plant.</v>

1434
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis actually can be both because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter night and sometimes fuse </v>

1435
01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:10.090
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get a mail,</v>

1436
01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.450
<v Speaker 2>you got to get it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1437
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Males actually create their pollen sac </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster than the females actually develop</v>

1438
01:00:16.431 --> 01:00:17.750
<v Speaker 2>their butts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in hemp,</v>

1439
01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:22.751
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the males pollinate and then die off </v>

1440
01:00:22.751 --> 01:00:25.690
<v Speaker 2>early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the roman catholic church </v>

1441
01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:25.690
<v Speaker 2>miscategorized the male and female </v>
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>

1442
01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:27.800
<v Speaker 2>even though the female had the seeds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the male blue,</v>

1443
01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 2>the pollen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't like that.</v>

1444
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:31.990
<v Speaker 2>The male died off early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they called the male,</v>

1445
01:00:31.991 --> 01:00:34.430
<v Speaker 2>the female and the female to male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1446
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.570
<v Speaker 2>they were heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were heavy into their dogma.</v>

1447
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

1448
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

1449
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.730
<v Speaker 2>can't rattle their cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way cannabis where,</v>

1450
01:00:41.731 --> 01:00:46.731
<v Speaker 2>how do you tell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you grow and see if she'd grown a </v>

1451
01:00:46.731 --> 01:00:48.851
<v Speaker 2>bunch of weed plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep an eye on them bitches </v>

1452
01:00:48.851 --> 01:00:51.551
<v Speaker 2>because if they all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all males just like certain </v>

1453
01:00:51.551 --> 01:00:51.551
<v Speaker 2>leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little tiny.</v>

1454
01:00:51.551 --> 01:00:55.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not all these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they do is they develop these </v>

1455
01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.061
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they developed these little male pollen </v>

1456
01:00:58.061 --> 01:00:58.061
<v Speaker 2>sacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

1457
01:00:58.061 --> 01:00:59.300
<v Speaker 2>And what they do is they come off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flower different.</v>

1458
01:00:59.301 --> 01:01:02.570
<v Speaker 2>They come off the plant and they kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hang like little ball sacs and they</v>

1459
01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:03.860
<v Speaker 2>open up and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>

1460
01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.260
<v Speaker 2>then the pollen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a male flower open.</v>

1461
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>The pollen is carried to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever seen the little red hairs</v>

1462
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:13.020
<v Speaker 2>on your pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the sex glands and they are to</v>

1463
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:18.250
<v Speaker 2>hire at all what the red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The red hair doesn't get you higher at </v>

1464
01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:18.830
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The red hair doesn't have crystals on,</v>

1465
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:22.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just had these cool though.</v>

1466
01:01:22.191 --> 01:01:24.940
<v Speaker 2>So you get some weed and you're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that red hair scott.</v>

1467
01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1468
01:01:26.481 --> 01:01:31.481
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because it's so pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when that male pollen hits those </v>

1469
01:01:31.481 --> 01:01:34.961
<v Speaker 2>pistols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it does is it causes that to </v>

1470
01:01:34.961 --> 01:01:36.791
<v Speaker 2>fertilize in the seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grows in that little pod and if she </v>

1471
01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:40.031
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get fertilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pod just scoot swells and swells </v>

1472
01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:40.031
<v Speaker 2>and swells and the resin develops </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper.</v>

1473
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:45.130
<v Speaker 2>That's why we grow seedless cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like tricking the female </v>

1474
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.160
<v Speaker 2>into like really producing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>residents and a lot of,</v>

1475
01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:51.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just she's waiting and waiting and </v>

1476
01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:51.340
<v Speaker 2>waiting to be fertilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never comes.</v>

1477
01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.010
<v Speaker 2>So it makes it more potent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1478
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:57.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potency I think is an interesting </v>

1479
01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:59.531
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a doctor at the institute of </v>

1480
01:01:59.531 --> 01:02:00.740
<v Speaker 2>medicine who got up one day and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave my patients 10 milligrams thc and</v>

1481
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:05.741
<v Speaker 2>they had a known effect and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him 10 milligrams thc in one </v>

1482
01:02:05.741 --> 01:02:06.050
<v Speaker 2>milligram cbn and it doubled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective dose.</v>

1483
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.240
<v Speaker 2>And I shot my hand up and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1484
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.310
<v Speaker 2>would that replicate in nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1485
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I put my hand down,</v>

1486
01:02:12.411 --> 01:02:17.411
<v Speaker 2>my publisher said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you two geeks just asking each </v>

1487
01:02:17.411 --> 01:02:17.411
<v Speaker 2>other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1488
01:02:17.411 --> 01:02:20.771
<v Speaker 2>basically he told me to breed hemp in </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my drug varieties because cbn for </v>

1489
01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:25.551
<v Speaker 2>instances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chemical that's mostly found in hemp </v>

1490
01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:26.420
<v Speaker 2>and as we have bread away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics of these equity,</v>

1491
01:02:26.421 --> 01:02:28.440
<v Speaker 2>loreal varieties that are more hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1492
01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:33.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have actually bred more towards the </v>

1493
01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.811
<v Speaker 2>drug varieties and we've lowered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical of cbn down while raising the </v>

1494
01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.070
<v Speaker 2>up with less of an effective rate.</v>

1495
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.160
<v Speaker 2>So now we have thc levels over 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent that wouldn't,</v>

1496
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:46.340
<v Speaker 2>that don't hit us as hard as I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>is if we had a little bit of cbn mixed </v>

1497
01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:50.511
<v Speaker 2>in with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many different cannabinoids are </v>

1498
01:02:50.511 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 2>there inside a marijuana plant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1499
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:55.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are over 400 chemicals created by </v>

1500
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:59.001
<v Speaker 2>the cannabis plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the definition of a </v>

1501
01:02:59.001 --> 01:02:59.001
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1502
01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:02.571
<v Speaker 2>the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that 60 of them are known to be </v>

1503
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:02.571
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic or your shit's vibrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

1504
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 2>We'll ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was coming through the microphone.</v>

1505
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:04.600
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1506
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:08.880
<v Speaker 2>and what's going to happen is that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>science understands these elements of it</v>

1507
01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:11.970
<v Speaker 2>more than they'll be able to better </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct what the different chemicals.</v>

1508
01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:15.600
<v Speaker 2>And alSo terpene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because terpenes are these volatile oils</v>

1509
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:20.601
<v Speaker 2>that are on the bud and what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of steamed off when it's </v>

1510
01:03:20.601 --> 01:03:24.681
<v Speaker 2>dried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if anybody's ever picked up a </v>

1511
01:03:24.681 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 2>cannabis flower and it had good body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you squished it and had studied moisture</v>

1512
01:03:25.591 --> 01:03:26.940
<v Speaker 2>and you could smell it was real strong.</v>

1513
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Those turpines were intact anD even that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a psychoactive effect.</v>

1514
01:03:30.511 --> 01:03:33.150
<v Speaker 2>It's very much an a synergistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive effects.</v>

1515
01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:35.220
<v Speaker 2>So it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

1516
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Overdrawing it bad job because likes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take his weed and put it on the heater.</v>

1517
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I put that shit on a year to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>joints.</v>

1518
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I put that shit on the window sill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it dry out.</v>

1519
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

1520
01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I put it on top of the tv,</v>

1521
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:54.260
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is is because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's getting is people that are </v>

1522
01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 2>hurrying to market and they sell pot </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not dry and not cured.</v>

1523
01:03:56.370 --> 01:04:01.370
<v Speaker 2>The best cannabis is actually not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>dried but cured and then stored for </v>

1524
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:04.410
<v Speaker 2>about three months and then see oil set </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and they're the smoothest.</v>

1525
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a window of when those </v>

1526
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:11.721
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoids actually keep themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is between three months and nine </v>

1527
01:04:11.721 --> 01:04:11.721
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

1528
01:04:11.721 --> 01:04:11.880
<v Speaker 2>So after nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after nine months,</v>

1529
01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.260
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd starts to degrade,</v>

1530
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.150
<v Speaker 2>chemically decompose in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1531
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.230
<v Speaker 2>So old weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whack,</v>

1532
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.760
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about if you cook different,</v>

1533
01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:19.430
<v Speaker 2>how about different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what have you cook with it?</v>

1534
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 2>We feel really good old chocolate bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old chocolate bar.</v>

1535
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:27.291
<v Speaker 2>How long does that last?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have an old we chocolate bar </v>

1536
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:29.660
<v Speaker 2>older than nine months in the dairy </v>
<v Speaker 2>product and it will be moldy and you </v>

1537
01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.820
<v Speaker 2>have other issues with dark chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're ramped up.</v>

1538
01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the kind of pain is you have some of</v>

1539
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:39.120
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1540
01:04:39.121 --> 01:04:42.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old fucking nestle's quik bars have they</v>

1541
01:04:42.121 --> 01:04:43.540
<v Speaker 2>made with wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1542
01:04:43.541 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of why I don't eat cannabis that's</v>

1543
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:50.631
<v Speaker 2>provided to me by people is because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know the conditions in which it's </v>

1544
01:04:50.631 --> 01:04:50.631
<v Speaker 2>made and they don't trust their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1545
01:04:50.631 --> 01:04:51.780
<v Speaker 2>the way they handled it and stuff.</v>

1546
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And yet not Just measuring because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how strong it's going to be.</v>

1547
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know in holland I'm like hash bond </v>

1548
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.090
<v Speaker 2>bonds and brownies are considered a hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>

1549
01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Totally verboten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 2>You can be 16 and go into a dutch coffee</v>
<v Speaker 2>shop,</v>

1551
01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:05.670
<v Speaker 2>buy hash on your way to high school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you cool.</v>

1552
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.430
<v Speaker 2>You can't buy brownie that you told me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about first.</v>

1553
01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:11.130
<v Speaker 2>You're the first person to tell me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 hydroxy.</v>

1554
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.250
<v Speaker 2>That eating we're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd when you eat wheat,</v>

1555
01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:17.650
<v Speaker 2>it goes through your liver and kidneys </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it actually turns a chemical process</v>

1556
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 2>and it turns</v>

1557
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>the psychoactive chemical thc into </v>
<v Speaker 1>another chemical called 11 hydroxy </v>

1558
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.061
<v Speaker 1>metabolite and that 11 hydroxy is two to</v>
<v Speaker 1>five times more psychoactive than the </v>

1559
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:34.501
<v Speaker 1>canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually it's three to five times was </v>

1560
01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:36.211
<v Speaker 1>the estimate I saw out of the uNiversity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Mississippi and you don't get a thcv.</v>

1561
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean a 11 hydroxy in your bloodstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you smoke cannabis.</v>

1562
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:44.880
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a different experience and </v>

1563
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One night,</v>

1564
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the context of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation was,</v>

1565
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:50.521
<v Speaker 1>but it was probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate something that was just too </v>

1566
01:05:50.521 --> 01:05:50.521
<v Speaker 1>fucking strong and you had to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1567
01:05:50.521 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>It's so many people have had it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1568
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a mama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on acid or something.</v>

1569
01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:57.910
<v Speaker 1>It does not feel like pot and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to it because when you smoke pot,</v>

1570
01:05:57.911 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you're only used to dealing with thc in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your bloodstream and that to you and not</v>

1571
01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:04.240
<v Speaker 1>11 hydroxy front man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing you should fear.</v>

1572
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:06.550
<v Speaker 1>We were on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were at a plane the other day.</v>

1573
01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:11.551
<v Speaker 1>We were flying to austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas and a rat ate a cookie in his car </v>

1574
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:12.310
<v Speaker 1>on the way to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1575
01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got there and you know,</v>

1576
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.100
<v Speaker 1>it takes an hour and 20 minutes or so to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick in.</v>

1577
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.600
<v Speaker 1>He got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were on the plane,</v>

1578
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:21.630
<v Speaker 1>on the tarmac and he was seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about telling them that they </v>

1579
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:22.000
<v Speaker 1>had to let him off the plane because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's that high.</v>

1580
01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until we landed some model,</v>

1581
01:06:26.171 --> 01:06:29.340
<v Speaker 1>did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other day I saw dave chappelle did a</v>

1582
01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>to a dave chappelle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a panic moment on the plane.</v>

1583
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I got to get off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might have been that,</v>

1584
01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those things that you </v>

1585
01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:38.010
<v Speaker 1>wonder if you really want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go with it though.</v>

1586
01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:38.010
<v Speaker 1>What if you get off the plane?</v>

1587
01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 1>The plane crashed as you book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you baby.</v>

1588
01:06:39.101 --> 01:06:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not religious.</v>

1589
01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be a moment.</v>

1590
01:06:42.191 --> 01:06:46.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess parachutes high flux so it would</v>

1591
01:06:46.421 --> 01:06:51.421
<v Speaker 1>save george bush's father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his parachute and the first draft of the</v>

1592
01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:56.551
<v Speaker 1>declaration of independence was drafted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him know motherfucker integral part of </v>

1593
01:06:56.551 --> 01:07:01.261
<v Speaker 1>our history men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I'm trying to convince </v>

1594
01:07:01.261 --> 01:07:01.640
<v Speaker 1>people that you needed that had no other</v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

1595
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Canvas was the only thing they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no cotton gin when she knitted</v>

1596
01:07:05.141 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 1>the first american flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1597
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:11.851
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only need look at our history's time </v>
