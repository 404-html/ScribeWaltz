00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I got the interesting thing.</v>

4
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>So daring me asking me what the last time,</v>

5
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I believe you,</v>

6
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you've got a pile of notes.</v>

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>What is it about breathing?</v>

8
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>What is it about breathing or his breathing?</v>

9
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Just one component of this.</v>

10
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Is it breathing and also focusing on what you're trying to accomplish?</v>

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>focus absolutely works.</v>

13
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain a little about,</v>

14
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:25.201
<v Speaker 1>about breathing.</v>

16
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Breathing is chemistry.</v>

17
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Oxygen has chemistry in the body,</v>

18
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>so if you all are able to,</v>

19
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Oksana dies,</v>

21
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>the sells more than we do normally because we talked about the lymphatic system</v>

22
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>and the tissue and actually the,</v>

23
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>the body's able to store up more oxygen than the hundred percent we presumed,</v>

25
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>possible is scientifically,</v>

27
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>we are able to store up more oxygen.</v>

28
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>So Ava breathing technique,</v>

29
00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.051
<v Speaker 1>whatever breathing technique is able to store up more oxygen into cell,</v>

30
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>that means going into the tissue,</v>

31
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>going into the lymphatic system.</v>

32
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly the,</v>

33
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.181
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

34
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>the chemistry becomes alkaline.</v>

35
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>The acid gets out of the body at will and then the mind,</v>

36
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>the mind is positive,</v>

37
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>a little electrical charges,</v>

38
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitters and eh,</v>

39
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>they are suddenly able to connect in a buddy and you enabling you to have</v>

40
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>control and direct all the systems in the body.</v>

41
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the way nature manda to be.</v>

42
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>So the mind,</v>

43
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>a mind condition to be effective in the body is making the body,</v>

44
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>by breath,</v>

46
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>right breathing profound breathing in an alkaline state.</v>

47
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Then these electrical signals are able to travel through.</v>

48
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

49
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>the way nature meant it to be is that we are able to direct any part of the</v>

50
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

51
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>So the immune system,</v>

52
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>endocrine system,</v>

53
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>their lymphatic system,</v>

54
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>vasculars older systems where we told a little bit last time,</v>

55
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>but I get more direct evidence now.</v>

56
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>right now we are working with the universities on the brain on say,</v>

59
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>emotional reactivity and they see incredible things that we actually are able to</v>

60
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:24.321
<v Speaker 1>get into those places where emotion exists and we take emotion,</v>

61
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:25.891
<v Speaker 1>where is it,</v>

62
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:26.724
<v Speaker 1>where is it?</v>

63
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>But at this translated also as something chemical so they can measure motion and</v>

64
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>the chemical form.</v>

65
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

66
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.381
<v Speaker 1>What are they,</v>

67
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:35.214
<v Speaker 1>what are they measuring?</v>

68
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

69
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>they go into say a the hypothalamus,</v>

70
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>

71
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus,</v>

72
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala.</v>

73
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Those are the places where this chemistry is going on and we had no way to get</v>

74
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.434
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>

75
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.891
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

76
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:54.891
<v Speaker 1>if you are able to ox energize those parts and to pressurize with breathing</v>

77
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>techniques into those parts,</v>

78
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>then suddenly you feel you begin cry.</v>

79
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.121
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

80
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Because the chemistry is changing.</v>

81
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>You are dealing with a chemistry which was stored up because he couldn't work it</v>

82
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>out before and now you're able to tap in there,</v>

83
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>change the chemistry and that that's the function.</v>

84
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.661
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

85
00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>you are not able to deal with it now.</v>

86
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So later when you have peace and you are,</v>

87
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.360
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

89
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

90
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>not stressful,</v>

91
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>then work on it and breathing does it,</v>

92
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>it eh,</v>

93
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

94
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

95
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

96
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

97
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>positively influences the chemistry in the,</v>

98
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

99
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>in the depth of the brain.</v>

100
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

101
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

102
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.630
<v Speaker 1>You create 25% more blood flow and blood flow is with oxygen through three</v>

103
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>

104
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.833
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

105
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Well it makes sense because your blood is being,</v>

106
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it's carrying oxygen,</v>

107
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>So the more oxygen you provide your blood and you are definitely providing it</v>

109
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 1>more with these big long,</v>

110
00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>deep breaths and these techniques at you that you pursue.</v>

111
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

112
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>manipulating up the spine,</v>

113
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>the central nervous system up till the tunnel of the light.</v>

114
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>The brainstem is at top.</v>

115
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>So if you pressure rise after act inhaling,</v>

116
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>exhaling like we did last time you did about three minutes almost uh,</v>

117
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.861
<v Speaker 1>without uh,</v>

118
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>in the lungs.</v>

119
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.353
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

120
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.420
<v Speaker 1>First round is very promising for the next round because you get more and more</v>

121
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.653
<v Speaker 1>oxygen.</v>

122
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>It only to show that you are able to store a up oxygen far more than you ever</v>

123
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>used before.</v>

124
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So in case when you need it to regulate the chemistry inside the body,</v>

125
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>then it needs oxygen.</v>

126
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Daniel,</v>

127
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
<v Speaker 1>we are all able with these breathing exercises to get it anywhere where the</v>

128
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>chemistry is messed up and a chemistry master APP,</v>

129
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.490
<v Speaker 1>we'll send off a signal but we are not emotionally not listening because we got</v>

130
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>a worries and we need to do to deadline and this and that.</v>

131
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>So we are not a,</v>

132
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.040
<v Speaker 1>and then there's chemistry stays over there and,</v>

133
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>and will deregulate the system and then we become sick and we don't know what's</v>

134
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:10.331
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

135
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>We go to the doctor and uh,</v>

136
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>or the psychiatrist because we could become depressed and all.</v>

137
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.140
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

138
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.430
<v Speaker 1>we are very able to get into any place in the body and in this case,</v>

139
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

140
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.783
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

142
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.120
<v Speaker 1>and we do all the studies now with the university.</v>

144
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.130
<v Speaker 1>They say cognitive therapy just talking to each other in the psychology and</v>

145
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

146
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>That's not enough.</v>

147
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.490
<v Speaker 1>That was a conference with 200 experts and they did this breathing and then they</v>

148
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:45.101
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

149
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:45.281
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

150
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

151
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.501
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

152
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>talking a only is not enough.</v>

153
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>But if you do this breathing,</v>

154
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>then you really get into the brain and then suddenly you get a sense of control</v>

155
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>because you're creating this extra circulation of blood.</v>

156
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.733
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

157
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

158
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>to get her with oxygen,</v>

159
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>making it alkaline.</v>

160
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly the blockage is created because of Ron chemistry because of trauma</v>

161
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

162
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>anxiety or grief.</v>

164
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly a,</v>

165
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>that chemistry is being dealt with and you get balanced.</v>

166
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] simple.</v>

167
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>And we keep it simple,</v>

168
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

170
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:25.891
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

171
00:06:25.891 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>and try to get this web of our thoughts.</v>

172
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Thinking of so many difficulties and complications,</v>

173
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.690
<v Speaker 1>what is emotion?</v>

174
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.431
<v Speaker 1>What is fair?</v>

175
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>What is PTSD?</v>

176
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>What is trauma?</v>

177
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>What is depression?</v>

178
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>We don't know where it is in the brain.</v>

179
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Just get older brain full of oxygen,</v>

180
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>get to alkalinity up and you are able to steer by going through the spine,</v>

181
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>up in your head and do it all.</v>

182
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that why sit do you believe,</v>

183
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>is that why some studies have shown that rigorous exercise,</v>

184
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>particularly cardio like running a elliptical machines,</v>

185
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines are just as good for depression as medication?</v>

186
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

187
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.621
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

188
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:06.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

190
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>it's dealing with the oxygen tension forcing when you think those giant deep</v>

191
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>breaths you take when you're jogging or,</v>

192
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.490
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

193
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

194
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

195
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

196
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.040
<v Speaker 1>when you do though,</v>

197
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.351
<v Speaker 1>staying,</v>

198
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:18.521
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

199
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:23.521
<v Speaker 1>you actually create a dead body to be effective with the oxygen,</v>

200
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 1>then subtly different mechanisms are at work,</v>

201
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

202
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 1>more oxygen is coming in and the chemistry is balancing out.</v>

203
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 1>A depression is caused by a,</v>

204
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>a wrong chemistry,</v>

205
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.590
<v Speaker 1>creating inflammation.</v>

206
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

207
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm a regular exerciser,</v>

209
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.003
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes,</v>

210
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
