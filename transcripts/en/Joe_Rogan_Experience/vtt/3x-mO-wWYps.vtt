00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>she has like social anxiety,</v>

40
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.391

00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:00.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:01.434
<v Speaker 1>when she goes out,</v>

43
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>she thought it was a joke.</v>

44
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>She looked over and thought this was like a character or something.</v>

45
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

46
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>

47
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.741

<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>

52
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.411
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

55

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.371

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.961
<v Speaker 1>give him the person.</v>

63
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>So I get gave her or she gave him the purse and then he goes,</v>

64
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>get in the car,</v>

65
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>lay on your fucking stomach.</v>

66
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>And he's shoving the gun in my back while I'm laying in the car.</v>

67
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.151
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking like,</v>

68
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:30.361
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

69
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>this is like execution style.</v>

70
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Like he's telling me,</v>

71
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>get in there and then suddenly he goes,</v>

73
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>get laid down to the,</v>

74
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.271
<v Speaker 1>to my girlfriend.</v>

75
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>And she laid down on her back because she was just so freaked out.</v>

76
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

77
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I said later on your fucking stomach bitch.</v>

78
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:42.311
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

79
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>it's just shoving a gun in her back.</v>

80
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And then finally just like both laying there and then he slams the door and then</v>

81
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>just takes off.</v>

82
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And so now,</v>

83
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>like the other day I was at the grocery store and I saw a black guy that was</v>

84
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>tall and I'm now I'm like freaking out.</v>

85
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Like if it was a redhead that robbed me would have been the same way.</v>

86
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>But now I see these guys and I'm like becoming like a racist from the 50s now</v>

87
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>where I'm like walking around like what's he doing on my side of the store?</v>

88
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>You know like it's great.</v>

89
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like at this point you had your,</v>

90
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you were in that moment.</v>

91
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>What did you,</v>

93
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>what was it like?</v>

94
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>It was really when I was laying there and it was like this is it and you think</v>

95
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

96
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.981
<v Speaker 1>what did you think?</v>

97
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:17.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

98
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about anything except my girlfriend the whole time.</v>

99
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

100
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>cause hearing him yell at her,</v>

101
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>that's just you.</v>

102
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>You think that you can just going to look around and look for a weapon or</v>

103
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:26.581
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

104
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but when you're in that biggest shock,</v>

105
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

113
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.021
<v Speaker 1>My immediate,</v>

114
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>my reaction is going to be like,</v>

115
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.480

116
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Let us go.</v>

117
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I will suck your Dick until you let us go.</v>

118
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.301
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll be better than her.</v>

123
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I can really deliver.</v>

125
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:46.951
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

126
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>that's where I go with it.</v>

127
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I would never go defensive or office.</v>

128
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>All these people online.</v>

129
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Of course I was like,</v>

130
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>what'd you give for not doing Jujitsu?</v>

131
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>If I had two guns in my pocket,</v>

132
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I still [inaudible] you add yourself strapped the dynamite,</v>

133
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe then you can be a little look at this bitch,</v>

134
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

135
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

136
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>People are those you should have,</v>

137
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>people should shut the fuck up.</v>

138
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what that's like until that happens to you.</v>

139
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And you should always give someone what they want.</v>

140
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Usually they just want to fucking get your money and run away.</v>

141
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to shoot you.</v>

142
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case?</v>

143
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Usually hear right once in a while though,</v>
