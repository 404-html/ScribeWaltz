1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>He's like Metro pcs because I see all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those commercials that they do.</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>We live right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>We're on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Misha tate were on the air.</v>

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I just had to let me take note of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world was flat.</v>

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>She didn't know that the man has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding us down and fucking with us and </v>

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.891
<v Speaker 1>given us bad information that satellites</v>
<v Speaker 1>are bullshit and that the earth doesn't </v>

7
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:26.541
<v Speaker 1>rely on gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it uses electromagnetism to make </v>

8
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>sure things get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is this coming from?</v>

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>The world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world does a lot of people out there</v>

10
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>in the world that are waking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what being woke is?</v>

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware of being woke or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>

12
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't know about being woke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's woke stay,</v>

13
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>woke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay.</v>

14
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to stay.</v>

15
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Woke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay woke.</v>

16
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>So people think that the earth is flat.</v>

17
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can all use also use wokeness as you</v>

18
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>could use it as like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say like,</v>

19
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I have wokeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

20
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Like you just because you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the UFC bantamweight champion</v>

21
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:59.871
<v Speaker 1>does not equal your wokeness wokeness </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're woke bullshit.</v>

22
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>But the man has been the earth being </v>
<v Speaker 1>round each round or its flattest fuck,</v>

23
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>the earth is flat and chem trails or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government spray in the skies and uh,</v>

24
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>there is no gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's square and stationary earth.</v>

25
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Was this a new one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the parts of the theory you think</v>

26
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>about Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim chose a real.</v>

27
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of wonder what they are and what </v>

29
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

30
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when people take that and</v>

31
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.890
<v Speaker 1>then they go right to conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

32
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a conspiracy theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have questions like I want to know</v>

33
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:41.151
<v Speaker 1>what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a jet engine flies through the sky </v>

34
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>and the jet engine encounters </v>
<v Speaker 1>condensation in the atmosphere,</v>

35
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>it creates an artificial clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an artificial cloud.</v>

36
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.791
<v Speaker 1>It's an actual cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cloud is a direct reaction to </v>

37
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>the jet engine changing the temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the air in the atmosphere.</v>

38
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It is scientifically proven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's repeatable.</v>

39
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:58.941
<v Speaker 1>They could do it over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when you see those things in </v>

40
00:01:58.941 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things exist.</v>

41
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>When the jet engines passed through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>condensation and it changes the </v>

42
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.451
<v Speaker 1>temperature and then they slowly fade </v>
<v Speaker 1>away or not depending upon how much </v>

43
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>moisture is in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some places do it and other ones don't.</v>

44
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some planes are at different </v>

45
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.151
<v Speaker 1>altitudes and some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how clouds exist in some </v>

46
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:17.151
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't exist in other places.</v>

47
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>There's people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe there's no connotation.</v>

48
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

49
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:24.141
<v Speaker 1>there's flights coming in all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you watch a steady stream coming in </v>

50
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:24.141
<v Speaker 1>and none of them have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then like the little like,</v>

51
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like small.</v>

52
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're small planes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not commercial planes.</v>

53
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>The little ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones that make all the </v>

54
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>chem trails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>

55
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.461
<v Speaker 1>they chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if I'm technically </v>

57
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:37.461
<v Speaker 1>saying it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they are.</v>

58
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>What do they call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call them contract.</v>

59
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real like if you ask a scientist,</v>

60
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>they calm cantrell's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ask conspiracy conspiracy,</v>

61
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>people that call him chem trails because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they're spraying chemicals in</v>

62
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:51.861
<v Speaker 1>the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that I had to like </v>

63
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:51.861
<v Speaker 1>deeply study for this show that I did.</v>

64
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Cultural questions about this for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

65
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:58.581
<v Speaker 1>I've heard so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard obviously most of the </v>

66
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody hears about it.</v>

67
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Everybody here is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that they're trying to like </v>

68
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>control the weather with it somehow by </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting gas.</v>

69
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:11.041
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem is that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to control the weather in </v>

70
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spray,</v>

71
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>they do what's called cloud seeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cloud seeding is very different than</v>

72
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:20.491
<v Speaker 1>what you're seeing when you see these </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial clouds with cloud seeding is </v>

73
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>they'll spray a certain type of chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>into in into the atmosphere that will </v>

74
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>create rain and they do it in Abu Dhabi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abu Dhabi,</v>

75
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>they actually do it every every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it once,</v>

76
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>so they've done it like 52 times a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes rain.</v>

77
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been going on for a long time,</v>

78
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>but that's very different than these </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial clouds that are being created</v>

79
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>by jets.</v>

80
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>That's just a side effect for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

81
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Like the artificial travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial jets or the rain?</v>

82
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rain.</v>

83
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Well it's silver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iodine I think and some other stuff that</v>

84
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>they find like find a breathe in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

85
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's not any better than jet </v>

86
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.451
<v Speaker 1>fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's burning in your sky above your </v>

87
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:00.451
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem.</v>

88
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the gas drive in here and all that </v>

89
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>gets people that live near airplanes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>airports rather.</v>

90
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 1>They have a significantly higher rate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lung infections and lung diseases and </v>

91
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>lung disorders like adjusting like how </v>
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

92
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm thinking about how far I live </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Vegas airport.</v>

93
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It takes me like 20 minutes to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

94
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that too close?</v>

95
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think we're all fucked.</v>

96
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all fucked.</v>

97
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>We're all breathing and under the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>

98
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under the same flat earth.</v>

99
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the problems with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole chem trail theory.</v>

100
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Like don't they live down here too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're spraying this guy's like,</v>

101
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>what are they trying to do and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>either the ideas there is either weather</v>

102
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:39.661
<v Speaker 1>modification or that they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change our behavior that some people </v>

103
00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>think it's their change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

104
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>it's something to do with crops too or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and they're trying to.</v>

105
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the growing crops in Vegas,</v>

106
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they grow shit in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tumble weeds,</v>

107
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>they probably got it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a lot of pot grown in </v>

108
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>vegas probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be so illegal,</v>

109
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>like if you went to vegas you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really careful about having weed,</v>

110
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>but now when you drive around they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these giant weed Dr.</v>

111
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Bill Boards and show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

112
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

113
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 2>the call one 800 hot babe on one side </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Dr.</v>

114
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Weed on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird place to live,</v>

115
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

116
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

117
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Vegas is kind of what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it is whatever you make it.</v>

118
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:21.631
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to go down to the strip</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be crazy and be wild and hang out </v>

119
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>with all the hooligans that are there </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the weekend,</v>

120
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:24.350
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if not,</v>

121
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>just live in your little house and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>hike the red rocks and go down to the </v>

122
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 2>lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty barren.</v>

123
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Pretty Ugly Lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>

124
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 2>It came from Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm used to a lot of greenery.</v>

125
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.650
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful there and we've got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>San Juan islands and you could go whale </v>

126
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 2>watching and she's gorgeous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it reminds me too much.</v>

127
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 2>We have a national rain forest up there </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

128
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

129
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of Washington state.</v>

130
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.740
<v Speaker 1>The rain can fuck with your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>

132
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I lived there for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was 18 before I moved to the </v>

133
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 2>eastern side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very different.</v>

134
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the mountain range divide sustain </v>

135
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>half and on the east side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>east side of Washington,</v>

136
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 2>that's super dry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like deserty,</v>

137
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 2>like there's actually tumbleweeds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sand dunes and all that.</v>

138
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.190
<v Speaker 2>It's completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other side of Washington and </v>

139
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.190
<v Speaker 2>moisture comes in from the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hits the mountains,</v>

140
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>rolls back over rains like double duty </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the west side.</v>

141
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 2>And the east side of wash of Washington </v>
<v Speaker 2>is really dry year from spokane,</v>

142
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

143
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Tacoma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tacoma,</v>

144
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Compton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To call it people call it.</v>

145
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

146
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

147
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.900
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I lived on the edge.</v>

148
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 2>It's really big actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

149
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>I think if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should probably know this things,</v>

150
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:37.710
<v Speaker 2>but I don't pay attention to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

151
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.770
<v Speaker 2>You'll probably find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

152
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 2>a lot of statistics and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of like,</v>

153
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 2>well it was fly by the seat of my pants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever's going on.</v>

154
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's,</v>

155
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.850
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the biggest circumvents the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whitest cities,</v>

156
00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:52.680
<v Speaker 2>like not most populated but like most </v>
<v Speaker 2>area in Washington anyway,</v>

157
00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:57.681
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live on the very outskirts like near </v>

158
00:06:57.681 --> 00:06:57.681
<v Speaker 2>Puyallup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I grew up on like five acres and like</v>

159
00:06:57.681 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I had some land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like in the heart of it,</v>

160
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's a pretty cool place.</v>

161
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.680
<v Speaker 3>So going from there to live in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess like as a professional </v>

162
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.361
<v Speaker 3>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your days are probably so filled with </v>

163
00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:12.791
<v Speaker 3>training and recovery and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much time do you have actually have </v>

164
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 3>to even be in the city that you're in?</v>

165
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Like none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

166
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm in camp really not much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe on the weekends sometimes.</v>

167
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:25.901
<v Speaker 2>That's what's nice about it too is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go down there and just enjoy comedy </v>

168
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you come through often,</v>

169
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:32.081
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of acts come through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Hart comes through a lot of </v>

170
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:32.081
<v Speaker 2>musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of concerts.</v>

171
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 2>So it's nice because everyone comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you essentially.</v>

172
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to go travel and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

173
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:40.541
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to just set the cup down </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a minute and take a break from the </v>

174
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:41.290
<v Speaker 2>chain gang or would it go ride the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

175
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big ferris wheel that they have </v>

176
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the on the link,</v>

177
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 2>they want to go ride that or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

178
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:50.700
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

179
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.050
<v Speaker 2>it's nice because there's always so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on as long as you stay outside of </v>

180
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 2>it like Henderson or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

181
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I live in mountains edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

182
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.400
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part I don't ever even see </v>

183
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.411
<v Speaker 2>this trip unless I'm driving by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to go visit the UFC offices or </v>

184
00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:08.411
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

185
00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a good place to live as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional fighter.</v>

186
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's a lot of gyms there.</v>

187
00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:16.111
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of great training there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This across the board strength and </v>

188
00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:16.620
<v Speaker 3>conditioning and Thai boxing.</v>

189
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 2>One is the home of the UFC so it's nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>to not because there's a lot of </v>

190
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.760
<v Speaker 2>extracurricular things that I get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take part of because I'm,</v>

191
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm local.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do a lot more charity things and</v>

192
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.020
<v Speaker 2>with the boys and girls club and you </v>

<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

195
00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:33.480

<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

199
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You a year ago you were talking about </v>

200
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:45.570

<v Speaker 3>You will.</v>

201
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.570
<v Speaker 3>I've got to figure out what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

202
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.140
<v Speaker 3>You're the fucking world champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fricking</v>

205
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't have been different a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago than it is now,</v>

206
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers that,</v>

207
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.550
<v Speaker 2>how that can just in an instant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just never know.</v>

208
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.850
<v Speaker 4>What does that feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you wake up in the </v>

209
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.030
<v Speaker 4>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to go to the belts</v>

210
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.750
<v Speaker 2>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy.</v>

211
00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:16.550
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enlightening.</v>

212
00:09:16.551 --> 00:09:18.560
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great to be the champ.</v>

213
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

214
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely different thing.</v>

215
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:21.980
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

216
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year ago I was so frustrated because,</v>

217
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I lost her onto the last time,</v>

218
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I knew I had a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long road you to,</v>

219
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.880
<v Speaker 2>to work my way back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I thought I had done that and when I</v>

220
00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 2>beat Jessica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

221
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:33.560
<v Speaker 2>it was announced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

222
00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:38.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be then the number one </v>

223
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:38.561
<v Speaker 2>contender eliminator fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards they were like,</v>

224
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:39.440
<v Speaker 2>yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fight Ronda.</v>

225
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Then I felt like the carpet was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just pulled out from under my feet </v>

226
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:44.950
<v Speaker 2>because they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kidding holly.</v>

227
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Holly's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they announced it without telling </v>

228
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:49.900
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I was so upset.</v>

229
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take that shit lightly.</v>

230
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I was training my ass off already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had already reached out to um,</v>

231
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.410
<v Speaker 2>a girl in France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say her name right.</v>

232
00:09:56.411 --> 00:09:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like Jeffery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know some French name,</v>

233
00:09:58.551 --> 00:10:03.551
<v Speaker 2>but she beat Ronda and judo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had already been making plans with </v>

234
00:10:03.551 --> 00:10:05.340
<v Speaker 2>her to train with her and fire over here</v>
<v Speaker 2>and choose changing things.</v>

235
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like such an ass,</v>

236
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.980
<v Speaker 2>like I feel like an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I look like an idiot because here </v>

237
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.470
<v Speaker 2>the announcement was made and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even know.</v>

238
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 2>So I was kind of upset about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

239
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:16.370
<v Speaker 2>we talked about and we smoothed things </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and,</v>

240
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and I took it personally at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it was meant </v>

241
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.220
<v Speaker 2>personally and it was a business </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision and I understand that,</v>

242
00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:25.610
<v Speaker 2>that at the end of the day that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was and it all worked out.</v>

243
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:25.910
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

244
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:31.010
<v Speaker 4>the UFC is in a weird position because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're both a promoter and sort of a </v>

245
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.091
<v Speaker 4>sanctioning body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really rare and matter of </v>

246
00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:38.571
<v Speaker 4>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of any other sport where </v>

247
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:38.571
<v Speaker 4>that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

248
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have just this ability to decide </v>

249
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.051
<v Speaker 4>like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll just decide like this person </v>

250
00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:47.811
<v Speaker 4>gets a show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the whole conor mcgregor situation </v>

251
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:48.720
<v Speaker 4>is a perfect example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all of a sudden if he had beat nate</v>

252
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:53.721
<v Speaker 4>diaz or if he had beaten dos Anjos dos </v>
<v Speaker 4>Anjos didn't get injured and he beat </v>

253
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 4>beat Dosantos you fucking know for sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were going to have him fight Robbie</v>

254
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.010
<v Speaker 4>lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

255
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.900
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were just going to like,</v>

256
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 4>figure out a way to do something with </v>
<v Speaker 4>145 Palm Tata.</v>

257
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 4>And why wouldn't they do it if there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>business people,</v>

258
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 4>because that's where the money is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would have been if he had beat</v>

259
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 4>dos Anjos and then went on and fought </v>
<v Speaker 4>Robbie lawler,</v>

260
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

261
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.110
<v Speaker 4>When you talk about like a $5 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>paper view by event,</v>

262
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 4>they'd have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be insane.</v>

263
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:23.270
<v Speaker 4>But if that was like a sanctioning body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you've seen it before in like </v>

264
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.531
<v Speaker 4>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like someone won't take a mandatory </v>

265
00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 4>challenger and they get stripped even </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they just won the title,</v>

266
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:33.171
<v Speaker 4>it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're a phyto would just win the </v>

267
00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:34.680
<v Speaker 4>title and then they have this mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 4>challenger who nobody knows go fuck that</v>

268
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:36.270
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go fight Canelo Alvarez,</v>

269
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fight this guy or that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he gets stripped.</v>

270
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Like because there's like five different</v>
<v Speaker 4>sanctioning bodies.</v>

271
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:46.221
<v Speaker 4>Like boxing is way more of a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's like pros and cons to doing </v>

272
00:11:46.221 --> 00:11:50.811
<v Speaker 4>it the way the UFC does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But from my point of view of someone </v>

273
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:51.230
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably much more frustrated.</v>

274
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

275
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>know what to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you get curve</v>

276
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 5>balls all the time in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't know what to expect,</v>

277
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:01.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of people were so pissed off </v>

278
00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:01.621
<v Speaker 5>at me for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the Holly Holm,</v>

279
00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:03.540
<v Speaker 5>not having the rematch right away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's like,</v>

280
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not my choice,</v>

281
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:10.381
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have over you because they think </v>

282
00:12:10.381 --> 00:12:13.081
<v Speaker 5>that I like turned it down or I should </v>
<v Speaker 5>have went in there like guns a blazing </v>

283
00:12:13.081 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 5>for holly and like put myself out on my </v>
<v Speaker 5>shield.</v>

284
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

285
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 5>we have to have the holly rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys,</v>

286
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:19.170
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

287
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they call me up.</v>

288
00:12:20.041 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amanda,</v>

289
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 5>July ninth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

290
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:26.640
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

291
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Do you say no?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No you don't.</v>

292
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 5>You can't say no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they come up with you like I'm in.</v>

293
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now you know,</v>

294
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

295
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:38.401
<v Speaker 5>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't get immediate </v>

296
00:12:38.401 --> 00:12:40.051
<v Speaker 5>rematches in their career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like unless you are conor mcgregor or </v>

297
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 5>Rhonda or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone that's really got a presence,</v>

298
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.460
<v Speaker 5>you don't get an immediate rematch.</v>

299
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.740
<v Speaker 5>Like I didn't when I went back and </v>
<v Speaker 5>strikeforce when,</v>

300
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.280
<v Speaker 5>when I lost to Ronda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't get into media.</v>

301
00:12:46.281 --> 00:12:47.950
<v Speaker 5>I've never gotten immediate rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My career.</v>

302
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 5>I would have loved to immediately </v>
<v Speaker 5>rematch cat when I lost to her.</v>

303
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:55.381
<v Speaker 5>But you don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you got to work your way back </v>

304
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:55.381
<v Speaker 5>up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hope for the best.</v>

305
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 5>But we will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it will fight each other again.</v>

306
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 5>She's fighting a Valentino Oshun Shanko </v>
<v Speaker 5>now you're going to be in Chicago,</v>

307
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be on the rumble.</v>

308
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:06.070
<v Speaker 5>Johnson Glover to sharer card,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which yeah,</v>

309
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.900
<v Speaker 5>that's going to be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

310
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 5>And they're both South Pas and Stryker's</v>
<v Speaker 5>is going to be interesting.</v>

311
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.070
<v Speaker 5>Tough shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dog.</v>

312
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.730
<v Speaker 5>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's very like physically strong.</v>

313
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Like the way she fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's very physical.</v>

314
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like they are kind of both.</v>

315
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.510
<v Speaker 5>I was just watching her fight with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Amanda again.</v>

316
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.750
<v Speaker 5>I think I only got through like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>route and a half before I had to go </v>

317
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 5>because I was doing the Fox Fox show the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other day and we weren't,</v>

318
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Speaker 5>we announced the fight with holly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I was watching.</v>

319
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:38.180
<v Speaker 5>She shouldn't Genco and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she seems like a counter striker too </v>

320
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.660
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering when you get to people </v>

321
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:42.660
<v Speaker 5>who are counter strikers but elite </v>
<v Speaker 5>strikers,</v>

322
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 5>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

323
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.790
<v Speaker 5>holly is much more of a kicker and holly</v>
<v Speaker 5>also is like much more fleet of foot so </v>

324
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But holly's not weak either.</v>

325
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 5>She's very physically strong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super strong,</v>

326
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.510
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be an interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a really good fight.</v>

327
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 5>And for shift Chenko it's super </v>
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>

328
00:13:57.941 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's had a couple pretty good fights in</v>

329
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:03.450
<v Speaker 5>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like this is the big one is like the</v>

330
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.990
<v Speaker 5>map.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it headlining?</v>

331
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it'd be a big one.</v>

332
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.330
<v Speaker 5>Is that the main event?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think that's the same card as </v>

333
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 5>rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnson and clover.</v>

334
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That wouldn't be the main event,</v>

335
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:18.540
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be on Fox Fox one.</v>

336
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be a big job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

337
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 5>it's an awesome card period that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chicago.</v>

338
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.130
<v Speaker 5>Chicago's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love Chicago.</v>

339
00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My favorite cities in the world.</v>

340
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever had molly's cupcakes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to say molly,</v>

341
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.090
<v Speaker 5>are you really into the cupcakes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you have this nickname cupcake.</v>

342
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:35.920
<v Speaker 5>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's weird?</v>

343
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:40.921
<v Speaker 5>So recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably the last month I've been </v>

344
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.520
<v Speaker 5>working with a new sports doctor Dr </v>
<v Speaker 5>Edwards and he's changing my diet,</v>

345
00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:47.521
<v Speaker 5>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I've been eating more of a high fat </v>

346
00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:49.471
<v Speaker 5>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ketogenic Diet and I've been staying </v>

347
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 5>away from a lot of sugars and stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel really good.</v>

348
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't been mowing down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cupcakes recently.</v>

349
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past I've been known to put down,</v>

350
00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple</v>

351
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.690
<v Speaker 1>in the moment you said Ketogenic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's thousands of people listening to</v>

352
00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:02.580
<v Speaker 1>this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

353
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:07.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not again because it comes up so often </v>

354
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.800
<v Speaker 1>because I've been doing it for five </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

355
00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I've been eating nothing but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we eat,</v>

356
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.300
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lost like 10 pounds.</v>

357
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

358
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Brian's lost so much weight on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

359
00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:20.731
<v Speaker 2>Like his camp before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a struggle to get the weight </v>

360
00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:22.420
<v Speaker 2>down because it's really big for 1:35,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets up to like one 65,</v>

361
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can get up to one 70 ish.</v>

362
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when he was making the cut the </v>

363
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:29.850
<v Speaker 2>first time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

364
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:30.220
<v Speaker 2>It was hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hard and.</v>

365
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.900
<v Speaker 2>But this one you switched to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 2>with a little bit of carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously if you're an athlete you have </v>

367
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 2>to have some carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

368
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strictly fats and what not,</v>

369
00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:39.490
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight has flown off.</v>

370
00:15:39.491 --> 00:15:41.620
<v Speaker 2>He's way ahead of schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing really good.</v>

371
00:15:41.621 --> 00:15:46.621
<v Speaker 2>So we're pumped about that and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitloads of fats to and staying lean </v>

372
00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:48.010
<v Speaker 2>and healthy and I feel good.</v>

373
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.970
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do what,</v>

374
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 1>what protocol you're following?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is it's like 60 percent fat,</v>

375
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.710
<v Speaker 1>30 percent protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 percent carbs.</v>

376
00:15:57.711 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Like do you need.</v>

377
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that scientific about it.</v>

378
00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:03.280
<v Speaker 2>I kind of just listen to my body and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just eat what I feel.</v>

379
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've been doing it so long </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I just kind of have a natural </v>

380
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.551
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if I'm hungry then I just </v>

381
00:16:11.551 --> 00:16:13.831
<v Speaker 2>choose to eat something that's more fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>based than something that's the sugary </v>

382
00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:17.110
<v Speaker 2>or our carby like what kind of foods are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gravitating towards?</v>

383
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.190
<v Speaker 2>So recently I've been so stoked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>liver Mousse,</v>

384
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.760
<v Speaker 2>liver Mousse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yeah,</v>

385
00:16:24.761 --> 00:16:25.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're delicious.</v>

386
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:27.910
<v Speaker 2>So if you go to whole foods and you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cheese section,</v>

387
00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:32.911
<v Speaker 2>they have these little packages of Moose</v>
<v Speaker 2>liver and they have different flavors </v>

388
00:16:32.911 --> 00:16:37.381
<v Speaker 2>and I got like a truffled one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I ate almost the whole thing in </v>

389
00:16:37.381 --> 00:16:38.020
<v Speaker 2>one sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not that big.</v>

390
00:16:38.021 --> 00:16:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.680
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's kind of a lot of fat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the liver is really,</v>

392
00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:46.681
<v Speaker 2>really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got like vitamin D and tons of </v>

393
00:16:46.681 --> 00:16:48.991
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C I guess more than carrots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like liver has crazy amounts of vitamin </v>

394
00:16:48.991 --> 00:16:50.080
<v Speaker 2>C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like a super food.</v>

395
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.190
<v Speaker 2>And my doctor told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

396
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:51.790
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

397
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I tend to like foods more when I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good for me to something like </v>

398
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.460
<v Speaker 2>mentally in my brain just tells me this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is good for you.</v>

399
00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 2>You'd like it really</v>

400
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you train as much as you do,</v>

401
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 1>that does totally make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.610
<v Speaker 1>And beets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beets,</v>

403
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 1>beets are grade for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

404
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Beet juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

405
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:08.590
<v Speaker 1>That sounds fantastic for your beet </v>
<v Speaker 1>juice.</v>

406
00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it mimics things like,</v>

407
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:13.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the endurance properties of things like,</v>

408
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:18.881
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain mushrooms if you take beats </v>

409
00:17:18.881 --> 00:17:21.620
<v Speaker 1>like rick or rich roll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a endurance athlete,</v>

410
00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:22.570
<v Speaker 1>was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

411
00:17:22.571 --> 00:17:27.571
<v Speaker 1>he found like significant advantages in </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking beet juice and that like blending</v>

412
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:32.981
<v Speaker 1>beats and like a Kale shake or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>along those lines really gave him like </v>

413
00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 1>an extra boost in training.</v>

414
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a little company called love </v>

415
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.590
<v Speaker 2>beets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're little.</v>

416
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.840
<v Speaker 2>They could be big love beets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see a lot of,</v>

417
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.290
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the whole foods too.</v>

418
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>They have like the canopies and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how was doing UFC embedded in.</v>

419
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I had beats on my salad and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached out to me like,</v>

420
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.210
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw she had beats on her salad.</v>

421
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.510
<v Speaker 2>We want to send her out some beet juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe it was,</v>

422
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe she was having libido actually was</v>

423
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 2>love beets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they sent me out this.</v>

424
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit is delicious.</v>

425
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.380
<v Speaker 2>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're the one that's um,</v>

426
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.070
<v Speaker 2>beats and ginger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've that,</v>

427
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.860
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to die for.</v>

428
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.950
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you can get like powerful </v>

429
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 2>natural nutrients like and they come in </v>
<v Speaker 2>last two gen kind of like,</v>

430
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 2>I kinda got on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that glass drinking out of glass instead</v>

431
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 2>of plastic.</v>

432
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 2>I kind of got on that train a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

433
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're around that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely smart.</v>

434
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean plastic for sure can leach some </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical taste it sometimes in the water</v>

435
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:31.011
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like if I feel like if I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>taste it and our body's made up so much </v>

436
00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:34.041
<v Speaker 2>of water anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think with a better water you put </v>

437
00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:34.041
<v Speaker 2>in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes more sense.</v>

438
00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:34.041
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

439
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Well the real issue I think is when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people leave bottles of water,</v>

440
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:39.540
<v Speaker 2>plastic bottles in their car and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat up,</v>

441
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Speaker 2>we'll think about how they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>transported.</v>

442
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they're in a cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good point,</v>

443
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:45.330
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

444
00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 2>you drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cold.</v>

445
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:51.110
<v Speaker 2>If it's cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't taste the plastic as much so </v>

446
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.110
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sell it to you cold,</v>

447
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 2>he put it in the fridge and you drink </v>
<v Speaker 2>your water bottle.</v>

448
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:56.660
<v Speaker 2>And you don't really taste it as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you let it get to room </v>

449
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:56.660
<v Speaker 2>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just buying it from the story,</v>

450
00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.561
<v Speaker 2>probably you'll taste the plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if anybody's ever done any </v>

451
00:19:00.561 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 2>studies where they've taken to arrowhead</v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

452
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Fiji water from the shelf and just test </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and see how much.</v>

453
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is in the actual water itself.</v>

454
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder too,</v>

455
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.190
<v Speaker 2>but I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I can taste it sometimes,</v>

456
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 2>like I think I'll go with glass like </v>
<v Speaker 2>more natural.</v>

457
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 2>It's better for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

458
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.320
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you eat?</v>

459
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you eat a lot of Avocados?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mct Oil,</v>

460
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.130
<v Speaker 2>coq 100 percent mct oils I put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been digging this or you a tumeric </v>

461
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.950
<v Speaker 2>and curcumin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Curcumin,</v>

462
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.130
<v Speaker 2>the Dr Rhonda Patrick Show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>

463
00:19:30.131 --> 00:19:35.131
<v Speaker 2>you blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've listened that episode like five </v>

464
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:37.551
<v Speaker 2>times and I still have to go back over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fine tooth comb and write notes.</v>

465
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.280
<v Speaker 2>I just downloaded the second ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to the first one like five</v>

466
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I figured I think I got enough of the</v>

467
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally.</v>

468
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:48.060
<v Speaker 2>She's so freaking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then now I downloaded the one before</v>

469
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:49.500
<v Speaker 2>the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm about to listen to that one.</v>

470
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Probably on the flight home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She spooky.</v>

471
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

472
00:19:52.061 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 2>So she was talking about all that and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports doctors is in complete agreement.</v>

473
00:19:55.861 --> 00:20:00.861
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I was going with </v>

474
00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:00.861
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you ask about eating?</v>

475
00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coconut oil,</v>

476
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curcumin or turmeric and ginger.</v>

477
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I make like a tea in the morning and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I like blended up.</v>

478
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:13.911
<v Speaker 2>So it's frothy and delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of not eating a lot of sugar </v>

479
00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:13.911
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>

480
00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:18.471
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did use on a UFC tonight last night </v>

481
00:20:18.471 --> 00:20:22.251
<v Speaker 2>and then we did tough talks and the kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kahleel we had a cupcake eating contest.</v>

482
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

483
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I was wrecked for the rest of last night</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I haven't been eating sugar mad,</v>

484
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm competitive so I'm just going down </v>

485
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:34.570
<v Speaker 2>these cupcakes.</v>

486
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:40.310
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave me like smaller ones for the </v>

487
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.310
<v Speaker 2>weight class discrepancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

488
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

489
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.160
<v Speaker 2>but you know what actually it was kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a disadvantage that appeal more of </v>

490
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.910
<v Speaker 2>them spend time trying to peel them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

491
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

492
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I think I ate four and then my sofic is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to shut and it was like,</v>

493
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no more swelling,</v>

494
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 2>another bite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I shoved three more in my mouth and </v>

495
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.761
<v Speaker 2>just like held them in the last sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like shoving them in my </v>

496
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was seven,</v>

497
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:05.850
<v Speaker 2>but I spit three of them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

498
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.650
<v Speaker 2>When you say your soft biggest shock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it like you couldn't swap,</v>

499
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.700
<v Speaker 2>did you have milk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did have milk but there was just too </v>

500
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.381
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't room for milk in my mouth </v>

501
00:21:16.381 --> 00:21:16.381
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just all cupcake.</v>

502
00:21:16.381 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was hilarious.</v>

503
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>The videos on my facebook page if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in watching,</v>

504
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:26.071
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty disgusting actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you feel like after it was </v>

505
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:26.071
<v Speaker 2>over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt terrible,</v>

506
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:27.100
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like shaking.</v>

507
00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:28.390
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

508
00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:31.110
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I kind of had a gut ache was</v>

509
00:21:31.111 --> 00:21:31.710
<v Speaker 2>like this is a really good,</v>

510
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.720
<v Speaker 1>bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird that you could have </v>

511
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:36.720
<v Speaker 1>eaten those things like a year ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

512
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And then I just now for many cupcakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm feeling like garbage.</v>

513
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I was on the Diet for a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I had a cheeseburger and a malt.</v>

514
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I got a big ass chocolate malt and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

515
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like that big.</v>

516
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.110
<v Speaker 1>It was all sugar gets you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wrecked.</v>

517
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I laid down on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is when you just get used to it.</v>

518
00:21:57.101 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're used to it,</v>

519
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:00.050
<v Speaker 1>your body's seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

520
00:22:00.051 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people,</v>

521
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you are,</v>

522
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400
<v Speaker 1>who you are eating a cupcake.</v>

523
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.250
<v Speaker 2>My mouth is watch and I'm throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're counting down.</v>

524
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

525
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.670
<v Speaker 2>It's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disgusting.</v>

526
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.740
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the referee outfit on.</v>

527
00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have three cupcakes in my mouth.</v>

528
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I know my lips are literally bursting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

529
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.440
<v Speaker 1>see if this was fear factor we would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have made you swallow it and open your </v>

530
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:27.440
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way accounts would have.</v>

531
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to do that show.</v>

532
00:22:29.371 --> 00:22:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch it all the time to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you out of it.</v>

533
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I could eat that disgusting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you could.</v>

534
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I think I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

535
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.310
<v Speaker 1>you could probably eat some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat some of it.</v>

536
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Really as I asked you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the most disgusting thing that </v>

537
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.300
<v Speaker 1>they made some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think blended stuff is the worst,</v>

538
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.830
<v Speaker 1>like blended bugs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did pancreas and different.</v>

539
00:22:49.831 --> 00:22:54.831
<v Speaker 1>Disgusting like blended the spleens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some and you know what's </v>

540
00:22:54.831 --> 00:22:59.331
<v Speaker 1>really interesting is one of the ways we</v>
<v Speaker 1>made things more disgusting was </v>

541
00:22:59.331 --> 00:23:00.300
<v Speaker 1>expensive cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to,</v>

542
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.000
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A formal ga for Azure.</v>

543
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Cheesy story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but go ahead and tell me.</v>

544
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.920
<v Speaker 1>They will go to the Beverly Hills store </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sells like super expensive,</v>

545
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:15.330
<v Speaker 1>like Primo French cheese and it smells </v>
<v Speaker 1>like donkey Dick.</v>

546
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.210
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You open up the top of it and you go,</v>

547
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:20.640
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is wrong with French </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

548
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:27.650
<v Speaker 2>That's my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my disgusting stinky cheese </v>

549
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.681
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in France the first time I went </v>

550
00:23:29.681 --> 00:23:31.571
<v Speaker 2>to Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was over Valentine's Day and Brian </v>

551
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:33.470
<v Speaker 2>and I were on this really beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner boat thing and you know,</v>

552
00:23:33.471 --> 00:23:36.020
<v Speaker 2>they bring out all this food and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting for grandma and like whatever,</v>

553
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.500
<v Speaker 2>and they bring out cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cheese lover.</v>

554
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I love cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could never give up cheese.</v>

555
00:23:42.681 --> 00:23:45.050
<v Speaker 2>It's the one that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would venture to say,</v>

556
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well especially now for</v>

557
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 5>sure I'd picked cheese over cupcakes if </v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to cut something out of my diet by</v>

558
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.570
<v Speaker 5>buy cupcakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm eating,</v>

559
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm sticking with the cheese anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They bring this cheese on,</v>

560
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 5>there's three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One is fine.</v>

561
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.710
<v Speaker 5>The other ones like it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>stinky,</v>

562
00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:02.711
<v Speaker 5>but I think I'll try.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other one smelled like a rotting </v>

563
00:24:02.711 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 5>carcass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kid you not,</v>

564
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 5>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It smelled like someone ran over </v>

565
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.160
<v Speaker 5>roadkill and then they like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they served it up like two weeks </v>

566
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.740
<v Speaker 5>later after it had been like an </v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely soft.</v>

567
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 5>People eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

568
00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:18.540
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like getting away.</v>

569
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:23.550
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole was</v>
<v Speaker 5>in beverly hills where we used to send </v>

570
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.971
<v Speaker 5>the people that worked for fear factor </v>
<v Speaker 5>to buy it and they would walk by this </v>

571
00:24:27.971 --> 00:24:30.200
<v Speaker 5>place and they open the door and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>be like,</v>

572
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:31.160
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck?</v>

573
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.840
<v Speaker 5>And meanwhile people are paying a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>money for this thing that if it smelled </v>

574
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.370
<v Speaker 5>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>small,</v>

575
00:24:38.371 --> 00:24:41.360
<v Speaker 5>like I might've struggled to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been with the same stuff.</v>

576
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't know what it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have to call my friend,</v>

577
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.040
<v Speaker 5>just plugged my notes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to think I'd be able to eat </v>

578
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.040
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>

579
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you're pretty mentally tough.</v>

580
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.290
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could get through it and was over.</v>

581
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.600
<v Speaker 5>You probably blank out of your mind that</v>
<v Speaker 5>deals with that and just go into the </v>

582
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 5>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>throw it in and then you're like,</v>

583
00:24:58.641 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 5>am I good?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

584
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:03.380
<v Speaker 5>Then he'd run over to the garbage pail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened.</v>

585
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:08.650
<v Speaker 5>I saw more people throw up and probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say like if you like look at me </v>

586
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Speaker 5>and like maybe catch cafeteria lunch </v>
<v Speaker 5>ladies.</v>

587
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 5>We've probably seen the most people </v>
<v Speaker 5>throw up in the world.</v>

588
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet.</v>

589
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:20.490
<v Speaker 5>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw how fucking people throw up every </v>

590
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:20.490
<v Speaker 5>week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw people throw it.</v>

591
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 5>I became completely immune to throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You I think would be more gross than the</v>

592
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:28.060
<v Speaker 5>blended stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like as long as there was enough </v>

593
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.060
<v Speaker 5>liquid to be able to just swallow it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I get through it,</v>

594
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.280
<v Speaker 5>but I think it would be hard for me as </v>
<v Speaker 5>the like crunchy bugs,</v>

595
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 5>dirt easy really well for me because </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like anything.</v>

596
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not the taste,</v>

597
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 5>the texture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sound,</v>

598
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:43.390
<v Speaker 5>the sound of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the shell crunching and then like </v>

599
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:43.390
<v Speaker 5>the guts exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

600
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 5>We were just talking like this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>disgusting topic,</v>

601
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 5>but that's like my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like that.</v>

602
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:49.470
<v Speaker 5>Or the big old caterpillar's like where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they pop in your mouth.</v>

603
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Like hearing something like that I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>is what would get me to eat a tomato </v>

604
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:54.550
<v Speaker 5>horn worm.</v>

605
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't the best tasting thing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>

606
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 5>That one popped in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those things.</v>

607
00:25:57.951 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 5>I think that would be a little hard for </v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

608
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.950
<v Speaker 5>but it's nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gum,</v>

609
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.200
<v Speaker 5>remember that gum used to have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>squirt center.</v>

610
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.170
<v Speaker 5>It's good for your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You remember that stuff?</v>

611
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They still have that stuff.</v>

612
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That gum is like tomato horn worm.</v>

613
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.380
<v Speaker 5>You pop it except it doesn't taste good </v>
<v Speaker 5>when squirts.</v>

614
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.860
<v Speaker 5>Tastes like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it does.</v>

615
00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:17.720
<v Speaker 5>It's like neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be a struggle for me.</v>

616
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:18.970
<v Speaker 5>That's just my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

617
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:24.250
<v Speaker 5>That's my thing is like anticipating the</v>
<v Speaker 5>pop or the crunch telling you you would </v>

618
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 5>just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you nothing.</v>

619
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 5>The bugs or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in Mexico recently and they were </v>

620
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 5>served crickets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The crickets.</v>

621
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.731
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it was a snack that they left in a </v>

622
00:26:36.731 --> 00:26:36.731
<v Speaker 5>hotel like fried crickets.</v>

623
00:26:36.731 --> 00:26:41.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess if I could do it at my own pace </v>

624
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.511
<v Speaker 5>and I like they were cooked crickets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably try one own peers and </v>

625
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.050
<v Speaker 5>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is,</v>

626
00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:50.051
<v Speaker 5>what would be the thing that you only </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a certain time or one where they </v>

627
00:26:50.051 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 5>stuck with those spiders with like super</v>
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>

628
00:26:51.301 --> 00:26:56.301
<v Speaker 5>long legs and it was like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>crawl out of the person's mouth while </v>

629
00:26:56.301 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 5>they were eating it and like that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

630
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.520
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be a African cave dwelling </v>

631
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.730
<v Speaker 5>spider.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ain't one of those two really.</v>

632
00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 5>I eat a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's alive.</v>

633
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 5>He always threw it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chewed up.</v>

634
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.890
<v Speaker 5>Can I bite you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They tried really felt like a little </v>

635
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:13.910
<v Speaker 5>pinch her on my lip but serious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I am death.</v>

636
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 5>You just mounted down and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got down on those cupcakes.</v>

637
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.120
<v Speaker 5>You imagine being a force,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bartered some fucking gag for a TV show </v>

638
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.120
<v Speaker 5>and someone's going to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

639
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.990
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

640
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:32.110
<v Speaker 5>The most bugs don't taste like anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet the ones that are really bad or </v>

641
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 5>poisonous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they probably would fuck with you.</v>

642
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Speaker 5>Like if you had a black widow probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>tastes like shit.</v>

643
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.800
<v Speaker 5>Nobody ever had like a live snake or </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything like that?</v>

644
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:38.640
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

645
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Well we can't give any of the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had,</v>

646
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Speaker 5>we did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we did do some stuff with snakes.</v>

647
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.550
<v Speaker 5>It was really interesting what people </v>
<v Speaker 5>would get upset about and what people </v>

648
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't get upset about like p,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Peta would,</v>

649
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.770
<v Speaker 5>they would get really upset if we did </v>
<v Speaker 5>things with rats or things with rodents.</v>

650
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 5>Particularly problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people didn't get upset about things</v>

651
00:27:58.171 --> 00:28:03.171
<v Speaker 5>with bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a really clear hierarchy </v>

652
00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:05.781
<v Speaker 5>that people have with life and people </v>
<v Speaker 5>just don't seem to get that upset about </v>

653
00:28:05.781 --> 00:28:10.430
<v Speaker 5>bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like certain animals take almost </v>

654
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.430
<v Speaker 5>feel bad.</v>

655
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:11.880
<v Speaker 5>If I was to eat a live bug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of me would feel bad.</v>

656
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about lobster and throw lobster and</v>

657
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 5>a pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel bad about that too.</v>

658
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:22.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prefer to just kill it real quick </v>

659
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.130
<v Speaker 5>first and then I'm fine with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

660
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.320
<v Speaker 5>I think they're meant to be eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fine.</v>

661
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 5>Like with Hyundai doesn't bother me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

662
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.350
<v Speaker 5>the idea of them may be experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 5>extrusion,</v>

663
00:28:28.351 --> 00:28:33.351
<v Speaker 5>eat amount of pain before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just just like seven in the head </v>

664
00:28:33.351 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 5>real quick and then it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dead.</v>

665
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:35.340
<v Speaker 5>You killed it humanely and then eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No problem.</v>

666
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.880
<v Speaker 5>Care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they say the lobsters can't feel </v>

667
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.000
<v Speaker 5>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I say bullshit bullshit too.</v>

668
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.930
<v Speaker 5>How do you know you're not a lobster?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever been lot?</v>

669
00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:47.110
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

670
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.070
<v Speaker 5>So I just say err on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 5>caution.</v>

671
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.080
<v Speaker 5>Just kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First used to go crabbing up in the San </v>

672
00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:57.200
<v Speaker 5>Juan Islands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd catch fresh dungeness crabs.</v>

673
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 5>Cook it within like an hour that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>taste so much better that way.</v>

674
00:29:01.381 --> 00:29:02.320
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

675
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Brian can't eat seafood to save his life</v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

676
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.170
<v Speaker 5>Like he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot stomach it.</v>

677
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.760
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't eat anything out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>water.</v>

678
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 5>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even like seaweed,</v>

679
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.740
<v Speaker 5>anything psychological?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

680
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.150
<v Speaker 5>I think part of it's psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just doesn't like it at all.</v>

681
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 5>He thinks it tastes disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the taste of the ocean.</v>

682
00:29:20.731 --> 00:29:23.830
<v Speaker 5>Like you get a lot in fish skin or like </v>
<v Speaker 5>seaweed,</v>

683
00:29:23.831 --> 00:29:26.880
<v Speaker 5>like anything that tastes resembles the </v>
<v Speaker 5>flavor of the ocean.</v>

684
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:28.050
<v Speaker 5>Something watery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hates it.</v>

685
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:33.170
<v Speaker 5>Is He from Washington state too?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was it like an overdose of fish </v>

686
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.260
<v Speaker 5>because everybody's up there eating fish</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

687
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.970
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he lived on the.</v>

688
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:41.040
<v Speaker 5>He lived in central Washington area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right on the other side of the </v>

689
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.941
<v Speaker 5>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's a little more like grainy and </v>

690
00:29:43.941 --> 00:29:43.941
<v Speaker 5>dry and a little bit farther away from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the water.</v>

691
00:29:43.941 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he ate dungeness crab.</v>

692
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.630
<v Speaker 5>This was going to get back to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

693
00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 5>that will have a crab that we caught </v>
<v Speaker 5>that day and killed it and boiled and we</v>

694
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:51.780
<v Speaker 5>had this sweet butter to debit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

695
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually.</v>

00:29:52.421 --> 00:29:53.290
<v Speaker 5>Like he ate it and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

697
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:58.291
<v Speaker 5>it was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those was the only seafood thing he's </v>

698
00:29:58.291 --> 00:30:00.301
<v Speaker 5>ever eaten in his life that was swarming</v>
<v Speaker 5>crabs on the seafloor.</v>

699
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

700
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.010
<v Speaker 5>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousands and thousands of crabs.</v>

701
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 5>You can even see the floor off the coast</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Panama says,</v>

702
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.200
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What kind of crabs are these?</v>

703
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.390
<v Speaker 5>Red,</v>
<v Speaker 5>red crabs?</v>

704
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 5>And they just covering the floor like </v>
<v Speaker 5>sand.</v>

705
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.320
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't.</v>

706
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.880
<v Speaker 5>When I think of when I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said they didn't know what it was.</v>

707
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.880
<v Speaker 5>They thought it was just the moving sand</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the ground until they got to put </v>

708
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:26.880
<v Speaker 5>light on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they saw that it was crabs.</v>

709
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are the little tiny crabs,</v>

710
00:30:28.811 --> 00:30:33.811
<v Speaker 5>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look like they'd be pretty big </v>

711
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.340
<v Speaker 5>crabs are the cleanup crew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crabs and lobster.</v>

712
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:39.100
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting how good they taste </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you consider what they do.</v>

713
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:42.960
<v Speaker 5>They just basically eat rotten things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that like sharks leave behind other fish</v>

714
00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:47.961
<v Speaker 5>leave behind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean they're just the cleanup </v>

715
00:30:47.961 --> 00:30:47.961
<v Speaker 5>crew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

718
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:54.870
<v Speaker 5>we can eat shit eating now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy that brian doesn't eat </v>

719
00:30:56.321 --> 00:31:01.321
<v Speaker 5>any seafood because I would imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially considering that he cuts </v>

720
00:31:01.321 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 5>through so much weight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that would be like a good source of</v>

721
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 5>lean protein fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His friends wanted to mess with them one</v>

722
00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Speaker 5>time and he had like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's at a restaurant and one of them had</v>

723
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 5>had salmon.</v>

724
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:16.230
<v Speaker 5>Brian's like one of those guys like does</v>
<v Speaker 5>he want to look like if you're eating </v>

725
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.230
<v Speaker 5>seafood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does he want it?</v>

726
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.320
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

727
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 5>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just so like so grossed out about it.</v>

728
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.220
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he got up to go to the bathroom and I</v>

729
00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:22.860
<v Speaker 5>guess I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't dating but this,</v>

730
00:31:22.861 --> 00:31:27.861
<v Speaker 5>this was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they picked up a piece of the </v>

731
00:31:27.861 --> 00:31:29.881
<v Speaker 5>salmon and rubbed it all over the rib of</v>
<v Speaker 5>his cup of milk and he smelled it and </v>

732
00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:32.860
<v Speaker 5>then threw it like he went to take a sip</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he almost just see,</v>

733
00:31:32.861 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 5>just like lost it because he's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

734
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:39.481
<v Speaker 5>he smelled it and I don't know.</v>

735
00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:39.481
<v Speaker 5>when he was a little kid or something?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

740
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.030

<v Speaker 5>I went to the hospital,</v>

760
00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:36.250
<v Speaker 5>I had to get a spinal tap because all my</v>
<v Speaker 5>veins had collapsed.</v>

761
00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:37.450
<v Speaker 5>I was so,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't remember exactly the details </v>

766
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.460
<v Speaker 2>about why you liked the bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

767
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.980
<v Speaker 2>We never really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>

768
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:53.981
<v Speaker 2>That was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have chicken pox and then I had a </v>

769
00:32:53.981 --> 00:32:57.520
<v Speaker 2>form of hepatitis hepatitis B.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I had all three at the same </v>

770
00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.261
<v Speaker 2>time because my immune system was down </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the chicken pox and then I caught </v>

771
00:33:02.261 --> 00:33:03.260
<v Speaker 2>that and then I kinda have to add and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

772
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

773
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.940
<v Speaker 2>so my parents took me obviously to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital and they couldn't,</v>

774
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.910
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

775
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I had a phobia of needles for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

776
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.370
<v Speaker 2>They got an ivy and me barely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

777
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:18.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how like they're supposed to leave the </v>

778
00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:19.661
<v Speaker 2>ivy and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they changed the tubing will </v>

779
00:33:19.661 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 2>the stupid nurse pulled it out and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>my veins were so collapsed they couldn't</v>

780
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Speaker 2>get a needle in anymore.</v>

781
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 2>So they would come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just passed out.</v>

782
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.320
<v Speaker 2>They would come in on the hour almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>every hour on the hour and I would wake </v>

783
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.710
<v Speaker 2>up to like 10 or 15 people holding me </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

784
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:32.300
<v Speaker 2>It felt like 10 or 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was five.</v>

785
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.360
<v Speaker 2>It was probably like three people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just see lights and see will </v>

786
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.111
<v Speaker 2>holding me down and they'd be trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick needles in the top of my hand in </v>

787
00:33:40.111 --> 00:33:42.530
<v Speaker 2>my ankles and the tops of my feet behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>my knees like that.</v>

788
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 2>And they hold me down trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>fluids in me because I couldn't keep </v>

789
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.621
<v Speaker 2>anything down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so finally it was so bad that they </v>

790
00:33:50.621 --> 00:33:52.500
<v Speaker 2>told my mom to like call it if she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious,</v>

791
00:33:52.501 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I call her pastor and like have him </v>
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>

792
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:55.900
<v Speaker 2>And like they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

793
00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:56.860
<v Speaker 2>like she's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

794
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.200
<v Speaker 2>so they brought me in to give me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinal tap and my God,</v>

795
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.240
<v Speaker 2>it was the most painful thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced in my life because he take </v>

796
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.300
<v Speaker 2>fluid out and epidurals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I hear really painful too,</v>

797
00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's an injection as opposed to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>removing the fluid,</v>

798
00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 2>which is more painful.</v>

799
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember feeling the most excruciating</v>

800
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 2>pain in my life and then passing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so weak anyways.</v>

801
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:15.950
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

802
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 2>it was back to the chocolate part of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I went to the hospital,</v>

803
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I was running such a bad fever and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing up and my mom thought,</v>

804
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's give her ice cream.</v>

805
00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.410
<v Speaker 2>And she had like some Neapolitan ice </v>
<v Speaker 2>cream downstairs and she was like,</v>

806
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:31.240
<v Speaker 2>they're really cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crap.</v>

807
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.530
<v Speaker 2>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't grow up in,</v>

808
00:34:32.531 --> 00:34:37.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of money or anything like </v>

809
00:34:37.531 --> 00:34:37.531
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We struggled.</v>

810
00:34:37.531 --> 00:34:37.531
<v Speaker 2>So it was like the cheap fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>strawberry,</v>

811
00:34:37.531 --> 00:34:41.500
<v Speaker 2>the cheap vanilla in the really shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheap chocolate and I tried to eat some </v>

812
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:46.541
<v Speaker 2>of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strawberry and the vanilla and I </v>

813
00:34:46.541 --> 00:34:49.091
<v Speaker 2>fell asleep and I woke up and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hungry and really thirsty and I </v>

814
00:34:49.091 --> 00:34:53.861
<v Speaker 2>went and the all the chocolate had </v>
<v Speaker 2>melted so it was like a super bowl of </v>

815
00:34:53.861 --> 00:34:57.281
<v Speaker 2>warm ice cream and I took try to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bite of it because it's just a little </v>

816
00:34:57.281 --> 00:35:01.121
<v Speaker 2>kid and I lost my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I puked everywhere and to this day it </v>

817
00:35:01.121 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>ruined it for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ruined anything chocolate flavored.</v>

818
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 2>What I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dark chocolate,</v>

819
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>a real chart but has to be quality.</v>

820
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody brings you like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superbowl neapolitan ice cream right now</v>

821
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.180
<v Speaker 1>and it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

822
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

823
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 1>it is mentally fucked me forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the definition,</v>

824
00:35:19.671 --> 00:35:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull that back up again.</v>

825
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the definition of rise.</v>

826
00:35:22.641 --> 00:35:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

827
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:26.450
<v Speaker 1>look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rare but serious condition that causes</v>

828
00:35:26.451 --> 00:35:29.630
<v Speaker 1>swelling in the liver and the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>liver damage perfectly.</v>

829
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.140
<v Speaker 1>They said it was permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

830
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Most often affects children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers recovering from a viral </v>

831
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.890
<v Speaker 1>infection most commonly the flu or </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>

832
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

833
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard no that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never looked at it,</v>

834
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:43.390
<v Speaker 5>but I knew that I had some liver damage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They actually told me to.</v>

835
00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 5>It's been linked to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have this use caution when giving</v>

836
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:49.380
<v Speaker 5>aspirin to children and teenagers and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly when.</v>

837
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.940
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why.</v>

838
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why that happened because my mom </v>

839
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.321
<v Speaker 5>told me she called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She called the hospital and ask them </v>

840
00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:57.940
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my daughter has chickenpox,</v>

841
00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 5>what should I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what should I give them,</v>

842
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 5>give her whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're like,</v>

843
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.800
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just give her aspirin,</v>

844
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give her some aspirin to help her with </v>

845
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what caused that.</v>

846
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 5>And then it was just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really,</v>

847
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:12.741
<v Speaker 5>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so weird that it's connected to </v>

848
00:36:12.741 --> 00:36:12.741
<v Speaker 5>aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what the fuck.</v>

849
00:36:12.741 --> 00:36:12.741
<v Speaker 5>The fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know that actually,</v>

850
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.900
<v Speaker 5>but I just know that like that I had </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in,</v>

851
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:15.690
<v Speaker 5>that had liver damage.</v>

852
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:20.690
<v Speaker 5>They actually told me that I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably never be able to excel as an </v>

853
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:24.110
<v Speaker 5>athlete because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of your liver damage because of </v>

854
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.841
<v Speaker 5>the liver and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if maybe that's why I'm </v>

855
00:36:26.841 --> 00:36:28.941
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so maybe just show up and maybe I </v>

856
00:36:28.941 --> 00:36:28.941
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't blame,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blame my,</v>

857
00:36:28.941 --> 00:36:29.700
<v Speaker 5>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my lack of,</v>

858
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:30.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

859
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 5>of paying attention to situations and </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge of things.</v>

860
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:37.791
<v Speaker 5>I can never remember people's names.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I will say I get punched in the </v>

861
00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:40.191
<v Speaker 5>head for living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it was that like brain damage and </v>

862
00:36:40.191 --> 00:36:40.191
<v Speaker 5>liver damage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those things can be great.</v>

863
00:36:40.191 --> 00:36:44.070
<v Speaker 5>But if anybody said that you would never</v>
<v Speaker 5>make it as an athlete told me like,</v>

864
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:44.540
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

865
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:45.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

866
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.920
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The doctors were like,</v>

867
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:48.410
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's probably going to always have an,</v>

868
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:53.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an issue as an athlete to like to excel </v>

869
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.690
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever got like a liver toxology </v>

870
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.690
<v Speaker 5>toxology no examination or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that?</v>

871
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never had.</v>

872
00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.900
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it'd be a good idea to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My mom always told me she's like,</v>

873
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:03.810
<v Speaker 5>you should do a visualization of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>liver healing itself.</v>

874
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 5>So you said you had to like envision my </v>
<v Speaker 5>liver,</v>

875
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:09.000
<v Speaker 5>like growing moms?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

876
00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:09.660
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

877
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:11.970
<v Speaker 5>she was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She never totally visually than anything</v>

878
00:37:11.971 --> 00:37:13.680
<v Speaker 5>else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember that now this is bringing</v>

879
00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:14.490
<v Speaker 5>back memories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

880
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:15.450
<v Speaker 5>you should try to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

881
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 5>think about your liver being healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it helps.</v>

882
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.610
<v Speaker 5>We use now a lot.</v>

883
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Visualization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely beneficial means the mind has</v>

884
00:37:24.521 --> 00:37:26.920
<v Speaker 1>also to weird properties that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally understand.</v>

885
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.460
<v Speaker 1>That's why placebo effects work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know why they work,</v>

886
00:37:30.461 --> 00:37:35.461
<v Speaker 1>but it does work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's statistically proven that if you </v>

887
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.480
<v Speaker 1>have a positive attitude and you believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>something can help you,</v>

888
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 1>it can help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is people use </v>

889
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.090
<v Speaker 1>that as like an excuse for charlatans </v>
<v Speaker 1>like psychics and palm readers and Tarot</v>

890
00:37:46.091 --> 00:37:49.930
<v Speaker 1>card readers and healers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Healers are a big one.</v>

891
00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:55.290
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy that was working with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of UFC fighters back in the day </v>

892
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:58.740
<v Speaker 1>that people would call like the witch </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor and this guy was like doing all </v>

893
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.550
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember George St Pierre?</v>

894
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

895
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.870
<v Speaker 1>not do remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

896
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:09.070
<v Speaker 1>But do you remember George St Pierre?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had this thing that these do with </v>

897
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.060
<v Speaker 1>him when they would like rub his back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rub his sternum,</v>

898
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.830
<v Speaker 1>they had never understood that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just shit that this guy had talked these</v>

899
00:38:14.831 --> 00:38:16.630
<v Speaker 1>people into doing like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>

900
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Like even fucking randy couture was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to this guy.</v>

901
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy turned out to be a total Ho.</v>

902
00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I met him and I just felt like right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away because I'm so used to hoaxers.</v>

903
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm so used to being around bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists and examining them as soon as </v>

904
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you started talking about the Meridians </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the body and this and that,</v>

905
00:38:33.521 --> 00:38:34.120
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

906
00:38:34.121 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 1>you're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're full of shit.</v>

907
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:38.580
<v Speaker 1>And you got deeper into these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

908
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you're rubbing on them and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening up their chakras.</v>

909
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Old fucking for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are</v>

910
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:48.540
<v Speaker 2>people that do the funny like ci videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's like a cold almost </v>

911
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.620
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's people in there like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I can make someone flip over by just </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this or like whatever.</v>

913
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 2>They do the weirdest things and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that that they convinced to,</v>

914
00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 2>like it takes two to do that obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not real.</v>

915
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So the person doing it and the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the move or whatever done to you</v>

916
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:09.061
<v Speaker 2>have to have know that person has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree to do it and then it's always so </v>

917
00:39:09.061 --> 00:39:12.991
<v Speaker 2>funny to me when you see them get </v>
<v Speaker 2>approached by someone who doesn't </v>

918
00:39:12.991 --> 00:39:13.000
<v Speaker 2>believe in that at all and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

919
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have to me like,</v>

920
00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they really,</v>

921
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.790
<v Speaker 2>they really think that it's gonna work </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the person's just standing there and</v>

922
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:19.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

923
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

924
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not working.</v>

925
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh you know it's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think is going to work,</v>

926
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:30.690
<v Speaker 2>but given the bullshit artists thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to work or you ever see the </v>

927
00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 2>guy that was like trying to chop a shop </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

928
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a pint of almost a pineapple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a coconut try to shop,</v>

929
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.540
<v Speaker 2>but like his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to set a world record.</v>

930
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.080
<v Speaker 2>You guys should pull that video up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what his hand was.</v>

931
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 2>It bare hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a karate guy.</v>

932
00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 2>He'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chopped the boards.</v>

933
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it might have to break a coconut</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your hand.</v>

934
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was funny because he had like a </v>

935
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 2>news crew there and he had like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>coconut set out on like this,</v>

936
00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 2>this bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he starts just hacking at one </v>

937
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 2>hacking at one hack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone?</v>

938
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

939
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.940
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you watch the video.</v>

940
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have.</v>

941
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy think that this would work.</v>

942
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 2>He's one of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you.</v>

943
00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 2>You got a karate outfit on and look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as a metal bar underneath that.</v>

944
00:40:11.231 --> 00:40:13.560
<v Speaker 2>So watch when he misses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

945
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:14.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

946
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>He misses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

947
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

948
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.180
<v Speaker 1>He does this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

949
00:40:21.181 --> 00:40:22.950
<v Speaker 1>He hits the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

950
00:40:22.951 --> 00:40:24.230
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fail.</v>

951
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hits them</v>

952
00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.950
<v Speaker 2>like his hands hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

953
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.840
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to pull away that he doesn't want</v>

954
00:40:29.841 --> 00:40:30.860
<v Speaker 2>to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to,</v>

955
00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:31.730
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to.</v>

956
00:40:31.731 --> 00:40:32.510
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

957
00:40:32.511 --> 00:40:33.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she stepped in.</v>

958
00:40:33.381 --> 00:40:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>

959
00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Why was he thinking that that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

960
00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you practice that before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got on television,</v>

961
00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.920
<v Speaker 1>but you imagine thinking that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>karate chop a fucking coconut open.</v>

962
00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.980
<v Speaker 1>How about just hit the earth in and wake</v>
<v Speaker 1>up people in China?</v>

963
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

964
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:54.710
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind is a very powerful thing where </v>

965
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a gang of videos of these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are doing those key things on </v>

966
00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.181
<v Speaker 1>people and then their students fall to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground and start twitching and </v>

967
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:03.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a great one with this guy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harlem had this,</v>

968
00:41:03.291 --> 00:41:06.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Kung Fu school and he had all these</v>

969
00:41:06.231 --> 00:41:11.231
<v Speaker 1>students and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like doing all this like literally </v>

970
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:15.390
<v Speaker 1>like Dragon Ball z type shit on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would have followed the ground</v>

971
00:41:15.391 --> 00:41:18.170
<v Speaker 1>and start twitching and spasming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like really shitty acting.</v>

972
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.610
<v Speaker 1>But they are into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're in a cult like that.</v>

973
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's what a lot of those martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts are.</v>

974
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:29.220
<v Speaker 1>There are a cult and I think almost all </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional martial arts have like </v>

975
00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:34.181
<v Speaker 1>attributes which can be beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the discipline and desire to please</v>

976
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:39.671
<v Speaker 1>your Sensei or your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Sabam name or whatever you wanna </v>

977
00:41:39.671 --> 00:41:40.600
<v Speaker 1>call them is like it's intense and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

978
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 1>yes sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they bow and all this stuff and they</v>

979
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 1>really believed that their instructor </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot do any harm.</v>

980
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:50.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of good in that because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you have this really intense </v>

981
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:54.350
<v Speaker 1>desire to succeed and this intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief in yourself,</v>

982
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:59.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's not realistic obviously and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of traditional martial arts and </v>

983
00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 1>until the UFC came around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really know how unrealistic it</v>

984
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

985
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Well if you remember like Pat Smith when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fought that Ninja guy and like UFC </v>

986
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 1>one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was UFC too.</v>

987
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which one it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he fought some guy and this guy was </v>

988
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.370
<v Speaker 1>doing these like in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember they used to have the video</v>

989
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:21.371
<v Speaker 1>of the guy training before the fight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was like throwing all these </v>

990
00:42:21.371 --> 00:42:23.390
<v Speaker 1>techniques around a flip and people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground grabbing her neck and fucking</v>

991
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.420
<v Speaker 1>karate chop at the top of their head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fall to the ground and the UFC has </v>

992
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.380
<v Speaker 1>come along way in a short amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

993
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about like football from 93</v>

994
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and then football in 2016 and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like football.</v>

995
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Still the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the UFC in 93,</v>

996
00:42:40.221 --> 00:42:40.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>

997
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Pat Smith was like a real fighter.</v>

998
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.970
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

999
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I just kept charging that Pat Smith and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to.</v>

1000
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I clinched up his name </v>
<v Speaker 1>and math got on top of him and he just </v>

1001
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 1>dropped elbows on them and smash this </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor dudes head open.</v>

1002
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It was awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's 12 to six years.</v>

1003
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:04.400
<v Speaker 1>We're still allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then 12 slash six is the dumbest fucking</v>

1004
00:43:04.401 --> 00:43:05.070
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1005
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:10.420
<v Speaker 1>here's this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this and this is the best part </v>

1006
00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:10.420
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Smith walks off and the fight is not</v>

1007
00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:15.221
<v Speaker 1>done because he's a kind man for walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>off because the referee is saying the </v>

1008
00:43:15.351 --> 00:43:17.300
<v Speaker 1>fight still going on because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1009
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's park.</v>

1010
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy got smashed,</v>

1011
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.150
<v Speaker 1>but what's this guy's name again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1012
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.220
<v Speaker 1>We don't even need to bring up this poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's name,</v>

1013
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but he probably thought it was big John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mccarthy.</v>

1014
00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:31.280
<v Speaker 1>All lean and healthy looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably thought that it was real.</v>

1015
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.550
<v Speaker 1>He probably thought that what he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing was real and he didn't</v>

1016
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:39.551
<v Speaker 1>know until he got in there with a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Pat Smith that what he was doing </v>

1017
00:43:39.551 --> 00:43:42.110
<v Speaker 1>was just some malarkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Mall Strip mall malarkey.</v>

1018
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:45.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that out there still to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this day.</v>

1019
00:43:45.471 --> 00:43:50.471
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of makes you wonder sometimes </v>

1020
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:50.471
<v Speaker 1>as the world that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1021
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that same.</v>

1022
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It's the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the belief in what you can do when </v>

1023
00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.370
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it can benefit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also fuck you up.</v>

1024
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Like he can benefit you if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about your own health,</v>

1025
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.240
<v Speaker 1>like if you really believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's healing you,</v>

1026
00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:06.350
<v Speaker 1>it can heal you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's like physical limitations,</v>

1027
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:11.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you believe that Melvin manhoef </v>

1028
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:11.650
<v Speaker 1>can kick you in the liver and nothing's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen,</v>

1029
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

1030
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.920
<v Speaker 1>You can chop cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1031
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.550
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many of those people though.</v>

1032
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:24.551
<v Speaker 1>So that was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First podcast I ever listened to of </v>

1033
00:44:24.551 --> 00:44:25.210
<v Speaker 1>yours was a guy talking about a cult </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had been involved in.</v>

1034
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

1035
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 1>it was really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talked about his story and how they</v>

1036
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 1>basically took him in and you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1037
00:44:32.431 --> 00:44:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Steve Hassan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1038
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:35.000
<v Speaker 1>he's actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1039
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.020
<v Speaker 1>a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you say his last name?</v>

1040
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.000
<v Speaker 1>H S h a s s n</v>

1041
00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.790
<v Speaker 2>and fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's actually a really warped as mine.</v>

1042
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:46.791
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really got into believing that his </v>

1043
00:44:46.791 --> 00:44:46.791
<v Speaker 2>family was against him and like now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's removed from it,</v>

1044
00:44:46.791 --> 00:44:47.530
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was totally</v>

1045
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.540
<v Speaker 1>my mind manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:44:49.541 --> 00:44:51.670
<v Speaker 1>He's in the moon and he was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moonies that's where,</v>

1047
00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.540
<v Speaker 1>that's what he joined up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's A.</v>

1049
00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird store because that guy now </v>
<v Speaker 1>works to help people get out of cults.</v>

1050
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should go help some of these c's </v>

1051
00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:05.420
<v Speaker 2>height.</v>

1052
00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Gee People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you've,</v>

1053
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've seen the one with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old Asian man who fights the young </v>

1054
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 1>karate guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that one?</v>

1055
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they show him with his students and he's</v>

1056
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:20.451
<v Speaker 1>doing all this stuff and they go flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the room and their body twitches </v>

1057
00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:25.160
<v Speaker 1>and he decides to have an actual no </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules fight with his young Turkish guy </v>

1058
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.800
<v Speaker 1>and this guy just fucks him up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed his shirt and beats his face in </v>

1059
00:45:31.721 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 1>and high kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1060
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's so brutal because the man looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's like in his late sixties.</v>

1061
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks pretty old and not stout.</v>

1062
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.220
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 1>a healthy old 60 either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's got a little potbelly</v>

1064
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 1>and this dude just beat the piss out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1065
00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:52.960
<v Speaker 1>And a got like a beating like that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a young strong guy who's much bigger </v>

1066
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 1>than him to the guy looked like much </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger than him.</v>

1067
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not something that old guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to recover from.</v>

1068
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 1>A key might be fucked forever from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>

1069
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:05.080
<v Speaker 1>In his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought that he was going to fucking </v>

1070
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Kung Fu this dude.</v>

1071
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like have you ever researched much about</v>

1072
00:46:06.651 --> 00:46:09.200
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis and how I've been hypnotized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1073
00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:09.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1074
00:46:09.891 --> 00:46:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Vinny shoreman and it.</v>

1075
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Well Vinny shoreman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know who he is.</v>

1076
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:17.130
<v Speaker 1>He works with a lot of fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worked with Joe Schilling.</v>

1077
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:22.131
<v Speaker 1>He's worked with a lot of MMA fighters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he does what he calls himself a mind</v>

1078
00:46:23.221 --> 00:46:28.221
<v Speaker 1>trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he does is he can talk to you </v>

1079
00:46:28.221 --> 00:46:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and put you in a state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird thing,</v>

1080
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:35.210
<v Speaker 1>like it's not what people think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like take off your pants and my</v>

1081
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.940
<v Speaker 1>dick gets down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

1082
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you're aware kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like an altered state of </v>

1083
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.060
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he puts you in like a.</v>

1084
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're under a drug or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1085
00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:46.960
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1086
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I just recorded a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started my own podcast.</v>

1087
00:46:49.791 --> 00:46:51.440
<v Speaker 2>And what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do people find it?</v>

1088
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Mutated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Misha tate.</v>

1089
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Show the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you come up with that name or.</v>

1090
00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.500
<v Speaker 2>No?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starting to think about that one a lot.</v>

1091
00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.050
<v Speaker 2>How about the cupcake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our right,</v>

1092
00:46:59.051 --> 00:47:00.350
<v Speaker 2>like I'm getting our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1094
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I sat down with Mark [inaudible] who </v>
<v Speaker 2>does a comedy hypnosis show 10 years on </v>

1095
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:11.381
<v Speaker 2>the Strip and absolutely fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about the conscious mind </v>

1096
00:47:11.381 --> 00:47:15.401
<v Speaker 2>and the subconscious mind and how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious mind really is kind of the </v>

1097
00:47:15.401 --> 00:47:15.401
<v Speaker 2>tip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the tip of the iceberg,</v>

1098
00:47:15.401 --> 00:47:20.261
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much more beneath it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your subconscious mind is we're talking </v>

1099
00:47:20.261 --> 00:47:23.201
<v Speaker 2>about how the power of mind and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of go in and out of hypnosis </v>

1100
00:47:23.201 --> 00:47:27.191
<v Speaker 2>states all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're driving and you start </v>

1101
00:47:27.191 --> 00:47:27.191
<v Speaker 2>daydreaming or you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1102
00:47:27.191 --> 00:47:27.460
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of space out.</v>

1103
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.500
<v Speaker 2>You're not really looking at whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at anymore.</v>

1104
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:32.320
<v Speaker 2>You're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a daydream or at night,</v>

1105
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:37.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a state of an awake </v>

1106
00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:37.630
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis and that you can kind of go in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and out of those yourself you do all the</v>

1107
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:42.631
<v Speaker 2>time during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a hypnotists can kind of guide you </v>

1108
00:47:42.631 --> 00:47:44.290
<v Speaker 2>into that and then plant certain good </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeds,</v>

1109
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess are bad seeds if they wanted to,</v>

1110
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I always thought of that too,</v>

1111
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:52.591
<v Speaker 2>like a Kooky guy that was going to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do dumb shit while you don't know </v>

1112
00:47:52.591 --> 00:47:56.190
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was fascinating to me because </v>

1113
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 2>he talks about how he helps people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have phobias.</v>

1114
00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who has a phobia of a dog.</v>

1115
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:02.390
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fear is like one dog,</v>

1116
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 2>this dog bit you and your child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're scared of that dog phobia is this</v>

1117
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:08.620
<v Speaker 2>dog bit you and you're scared of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>

1118
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Now some people are so terrified they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get these phobias.</v>

1119
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:13.960
<v Speaker 2>They can't even leave their house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're so scared of the neighbor's</v>

1120
00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 2>dog walking by and going to jump out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere and bite them.</v>

1121
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.740
<v Speaker 2>So they're crippled by these fears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he could put them in a hypnotic </v>

1122
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.480
<v Speaker 2>state and kind of go back and remove </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fear essentially.</v>

1123
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1124
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he said,</v>

1125
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:34.711
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of layers to the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that one of the most </v>

1126
00:48:34.711 --> 00:48:36.490
<v Speaker 1>fascinating aspects of it is when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do those comedy hypnotism shows,</v>

1127
00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 1>those comedy hypnotism shows are 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent real.</v>

1128
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Like I've seen them live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a guy named Frank Santos </v>

1129
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.260
<v Speaker 1>was a big comedy hypnotist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy In Boston and his son still does it.</v>

1130
00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:52.261
<v Speaker 1>Frank Santos Junior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Frank Santos would do this show </v>

1131
00:48:52.261 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>weekly show it stitches and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>

1132
00:48:53.051 --> 00:48:58.051
<v Speaker 1>We would come from like all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>town to watch this because we couldn't </v>

1133
00:48:58.051 --> 00:48:58.051
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

1134
00:48:58.051 --> 00:49:02.371
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck is he doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would get people and he would </v>

1135
00:49:02.371 --> 00:49:02.371
<v Speaker 1>know when they were under and when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were an under.</v>

1136
00:49:02.371 --> 00:49:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Like you would know when people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>faking it,</v>

1137
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:08.530
<v Speaker 1>when they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would get them off the stage when </v>

1138
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:08.530
<v Speaker 1>they're faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people that we're really under,</v>

1139
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 1>you could see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just were baffled.</v>

1140
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he couldn't explain why it would </v>

1141
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 1>work on some people and why it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work on others.</v>

1142
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 1>He didn't really know.</v>

1143
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked mark the same question because </v>

1144
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1145
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.111
<v Speaker 2>he'll invite as many people that want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteer out of the audience as you </v>

1146
00:49:23.111 --> 00:49:24.860
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he'll get 30 plus people up there and</v>

1147
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.010
<v Speaker 2>he'll just pick people off as they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't into it.</v>

1148
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:30.710
<v Speaker 2>But he has people doing the craziest </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny things,</v>

1149
00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:31.190
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1150
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so funny.</v>

1151
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are all these people in on this?</v>

1152
00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Well they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really do like this.</v>

1153
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:40.270
<v Speaker 1>The Frank Santos used to have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1154
00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:43.060
<v Speaker 1>This is like in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when Madonna was hot.</v>

1155
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if you said you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex with Madonna now guys would go,</v>

1156
00:49:45.881 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1157
00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.980
<v Speaker 1>That looks good for her age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For her age.</v>

1158
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the big part though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For her age.</v>

1159
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1160
00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.300
<v Speaker 1>She still looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1161
00:49:55.301 --> 00:50:00.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone knows even if she looks </v>

1162
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:00.301
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that pitches like 60,</v>

1163
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:00.301
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1164
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:02.860
<v Speaker 1>like I say bitch with all due respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>this piano like a bad bitch,</v>

1165
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:04.990
<v Speaker 1>bad ass bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1166
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:10.530
<v Speaker 1>but you would watch him like he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk someone into believing that they </v>

1167
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:12.010
<v Speaker 1>were having sex and Madonna and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys have the orgasm in their pants.</v>

1168
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.200
<v Speaker 1>So like you'd see them go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he would tell them and you know,</v>

1169
00:50:15.201 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 1>and now you're going to come in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pants and you'd see the guy go,</v>

1170
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:21.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're watching it,</v>

1171
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.200
<v Speaker 1>you're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

1172
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:26.310
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You almost want to go,</v>

1173
00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 1>jude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see your underwear.</v>

1174
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Let's</v>

1175
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 4>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:30.900
<v Speaker 4>I want to see if it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1177
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:35.950
<v Speaker 4>I can see the proof in the pudding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but frank tried to explain to us he had </v>

1178
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:40.121
<v Speaker 4>worked with people where it would help </v>
<v Speaker 4>people quit smoking and things along </v>

1179
00:50:40.121 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 4>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But until Vinny shoreman did it to me,</v>

1180
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>

1181
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:47.111
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still haven't been hypnotized by fema </v>

1182
00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:47.111
<v Speaker 4>to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be in the United States.</v>

1183
00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:50.470
<v Speaker 4>I'll connect you guys together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would like it because he's used to </v>

1184
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 4>working with fighters and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's great about like setting a mindset.</v>

1185
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:56.231
<v Speaker 4>I think Ian Mccall worked with them too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's great about putting you in a </v>

1186
00:50:56.231 --> 00:50:59.981
<v Speaker 4>certain state of mind and working on </v>
<v Speaker 4>various aspects of like maybe your </v>

1187
00:50:59.981 --> 00:51:02.060
<v Speaker 4>performance or or your attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:04.310
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's all about staying woke.</v>

1189
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.970
<v Speaker 4>Stay woke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's woke you.</v>

1190
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 4>I want some net achieve wokeness.</v>

1191
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super important to achieve wokeness.</v>

1192
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the mind is a really fascinating </v>

1193
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.760
<v Speaker 4>thing and I think that especially for </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>

1194
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I would have to say that it's just one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the most important aspects of your </v>

1195
00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 4>ability to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like physically is one thing,</v>

1196
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:30.560
<v Speaker 4>but the ability to like you're inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cage,</v>

1197
00:51:30.561 --> 00:51:33.470
<v Speaker 4>the pin goes into the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you ready?</v>

1198
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's get it on.</v>

1199
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:38.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is the craziest moment in </v>
<v Speaker 4>all sports.</v>

1200
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:43.690
<v Speaker 4>There's no moment like that where you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean think about like a basketball </v>

1201
00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 4>player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball players.</v>

1202
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.430
<v Speaker 4>Even if there's a lot of pressure for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>three point shot,</v>

1203
00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:51.460
<v Speaker 4>if you miss that three point shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get another shot </v>

1204
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:51.460
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone's going to hand you the ball.</v>

1205
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Luckily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or if not someone's gonna hang up all </v>

1206
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:56.050
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow or someone will hand you the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball next week,</v>

1207
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:57.650
<v Speaker 4>but if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you fight,</v>

1208
00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:58.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1209
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.130
<v Speaker 6>between team sports and individual </v>
<v Speaker 6>sports too,</v>

1210
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.260
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's like when you lose,</v>

1211
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.920
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it's not unless you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The kicker on the football team and like</v>

1212
00:52:07.921 --> 00:52:09.790
<v Speaker 6>you literally cost them but it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's still like a,</v>

1213
00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's still a team sport.</v>

1214
00:52:12.121 --> 00:52:17.121
<v Speaker 6>Your team,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your team obviously didn't get you far </v>

1215
00:52:17.121 --> 00:52:17.121
<v Speaker 6>enough to where you had to rely on that </v>
<v Speaker 6>kick,</v>

1216
00:52:17.121 --> 00:52:17.760
<v Speaker 6>but you go inside the cages is just you.</v>

1217
00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 4>It's not just you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just you involved in the most </v>

1218
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.060
<v Speaker 4>humbling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous,</v>

1219
00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.170
<v Speaker 4>extreme version of a contest between two</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings.</v>

1220
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:30.600
<v Speaker 4>You can get outside of sword fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1221
00:52:30.601 --> 00:52:35.601
<v Speaker 4>outside of fighting to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing is extreme as a cage </v>

1222
00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:35.601
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you guys,</v>

1223
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.560
<v Speaker 6>I have to laugh when people say like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1224
00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:40.000
<v Speaker 6>We're scared to fight someone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1225
00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:40.810
<v Speaker 6>like people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1226
00:52:40.811 --> 00:52:44.370
<v Speaker 6>you're scared to fight holly again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't listen to those people.</v>

1227
00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:49.440
<v Speaker 6>Scared is not a relative.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not a term that I feel like </v>

1228
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:49.440
<v Speaker 6>fighters really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't,</v>

1229
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.390
<v Speaker 6>we don't have scared the way normal </v>
<v Speaker 6>people have scared,</v>

1230
00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:53.560
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:52:53.561 --> 00:52:55.690
<v Speaker 6>Like a normal person would be scared to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

1232
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.090
<v Speaker 6>to get off their couch and go to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>gym,</v>

1233
00:52:58.091 --> 00:53:03.091
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to spar something like that's what we </v>

1234
00:53:03.091 --> 00:53:03.091
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we live like what most people would</v>

1235
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:04.650
<v Speaker 6>shit their pants</v>

1236
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:08.690
<v Speaker 4>and you would have to be a fool to not </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that it's a dangerous fight.</v>

1237
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 4>So it's not a matter of not being aware </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the danger,</v>

1238
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:15.140
<v Speaker 4>but it's a matter of managing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences are like,</v>

1239
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 4>I think you did a fantastic job with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>holly fight,</v>

1240
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:21.530
<v Speaker 4>like literally you did in that fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>other than the fifth round,</v>

1241
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:24.600
<v Speaker 4>which is the most amazing part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you did everything.</v>

1242
00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 4>Like when we were about like what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to do to beat her.</v>

1243
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's got to stay on the outside.</v>

1244
00:53:28.741 --> 00:53:32.000
<v Speaker 4>She could have very her rhythm and she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>got let holly come to her like she,</v>

1245
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 4>she can't rush in because you rush into </v>
<v Speaker 4>holly.</v>

1246
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:38.340
<v Speaker 4>It's like Russian into Machida are </v>
<v Speaker 4>rushing to anybody who's a great counter</v>

1247
00:53:38.341 --> 00:53:43.341
<v Speaker 4>striker and you saw the Rhonda fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronda just came bulldog and honor and </v>

1248
00:53:43.341 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 4>tried to out bulldogger and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that with holly.</v>

1249
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 4>She's too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Footwork to her,</v>

1250
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.620
<v Speaker 4>her striking is so precise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her,</v>

1251
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 4>her counters are so clean</v>

1252
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:53.930
<v Speaker 6>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very hard to read.</v>

1253
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:58.960
<v Speaker 6>Like it's very unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember what a couple times I tried </v>

1254
00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.660
<v Speaker 6>to maybe come forward and get her to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the fence and I couldn't tell whether</v>

1255
00:53:59.661 --> 00:54:01.340
<v Speaker 6>she was going to jet out to the right of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the left.</v>

1256
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:04.330
<v Speaker 6>Like usually like two steps back left </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I was like,</v>

1257
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.030
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1258
00:54:05.031 --> 00:54:10.031
<v Speaker 6>like I couldn't even tell like she had </v>
<v Speaker 6>gave no indication of which way she was </v>

1259
00:54:10.031 --> 00:54:10.031
<v Speaker 6>going to go.</v>

1260
00:54:10.031 --> 00:54:13.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you just did a fantastic job of </v>

1261
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.461
<v Speaker 4>varying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your approach to your speed was </v>

1262
00:54:16.461 --> 00:54:16.461
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

1263
00:54:16.461 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did a lot of fainting,</v>

1264
00:54:16.981 --> 00:54:21.981
<v Speaker 4>you varied things up a lot and you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell like she was like almost like </v>

1265
00:54:21.981 --> 00:54:25.551
<v Speaker 4>waiting for these moments to happen when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to come forward and then </v>

1266
00:54:25.551 --> 00:54:26.940
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't come forward and then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes like a test of patience,</v>

1267
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.490
<v Speaker 4>like who's going to get outside of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfort zone,</v>

1268
00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:32.550
<v Speaker 4>who's going to take chances?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's gonna who's gonna engage.</v>

1269
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:37.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she also has that weird stance to </v>

1270
00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.280
<v Speaker 4>was she kinda halfway stands like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxer and halfway stands like a karate </v>

1271
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.731
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She throws like a lot of side kicks on </v>

1272
00:54:43.731 --> 00:54:43.731
<v Speaker 4>the front leg techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1273
00:54:43.731 --> 00:54:44.220
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>

1274
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:49.250
<v Speaker 4>she's a tricky one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we put together a really good game </v>

1275
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.250
<v Speaker 4>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was happy with that.</v>

1276
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did.</v>

1277
00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 4>I was happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a fifth round.</v>

1278
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.330
<v Speaker 4>Fifth round was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1279
00:54:54.331 --> 00:54:59.331
<v Speaker 4>when you grabbed a hold of her and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually got her back and got her to </v>

1280
00:54:59.331 --> 00:55:02.430
<v Speaker 4>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so crazy because every aspect of,</v>

1281
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:06.450
<v Speaker 4>from your initial entrance to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>takedown to getting her back,</v>

1282
00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.820
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent about it.</v>

1283
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.310
<v Speaker 4>It was all touch and go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all scramble.</v>

1284
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:15.750
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like you had complete total </v>
<v Speaker 4>control over like maybe like Damien Maia</v>

1285
00:55:15.751 --> 00:55:20.751
<v Speaker 4>versus Rick Story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he daymond my gets rick stories </v>

1286
00:55:20.751 --> 00:55:23.211
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got them locked up and then he </v>

1287
00:55:23.211 --> 00:55:23.211
<v Speaker 4>anaconda asm and squeezes them and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets them.</v>

1288
00:55:23.211 --> 00:55:27.560
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like you were fighting for your </v>

1289
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.110
<v Speaker 4>fucking life and you knew there was no </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1290
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:33.240
<v Speaker 4>There was no time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were likely down by like at least </v>

1291
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.481
<v Speaker 4>one round and you were headed into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fifth and final round and maybe if you </v>

1292
00:55:35.481 --> 00:55:35.700
<v Speaker 4>won that round you could have got the </v>
<v Speaker 4>decision,</v>

1293
00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:37.170
<v Speaker 4>but fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fighting the champ.</v>

1294
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:38.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

1295
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what's gonna Happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take our back and then when she </v>

1296
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:46.521
<v Speaker 4>tries to shake you off the top and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hang in there and you hang in there and </v>

1297
00:55:46.521 --> 00:55:47.100
<v Speaker 4>you see what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I watched them like,</v>

1298
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's going to go out.</v>

1299
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 4>And when she went out and you climbed </v>
<v Speaker 4>off her and she was unconscious like,</v>

1300
00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:54.510
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1301
00:55:54.511 --> 00:55:57.330
<v Speaker 4>What a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was incredible.</v>

1302
00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.290
<v Speaker 4>It was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the best moments in all of</v>

1303
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:05.280
<v Speaker 4>women's championship fighting as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>like like an extreme,</v>

1304
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:09.540
<v Speaker 4>extremely dramatic moment where like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1305
00:56:09.541 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to accomplish something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's fighting tooth and claw.</v>

1306
00:56:12.481 --> 00:56:17.481
<v Speaker 4>Neither one of you are exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's not like anyone's like </v>

1307
00:56:17.481 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 4>physically compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a fucking mad scramble between</v>

1308
00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:24.261
<v Speaker 4>two killers and you get her and got her </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and then you get back and you sink </v>

1309
00:56:24.261 --> 00:56:28.861
<v Speaker 4>the choke and she's trying to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>shake you off and you hung in there and </v>

1310
00:56:28.861 --> 00:56:29.620
<v Speaker 4>when she rolled and you're on top of her</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

1311
00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:31.540
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hung onto it and you realize like,</v>

1312
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's going out.</v>

1313
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.260
<v Speaker 4>And she is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't even tap.</v>

1314
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 4>She was throwing punches in the air </v>
<v Speaker 4>while you were choking her unconscious.</v>

1315
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:39.980
<v Speaker 4>I kept thinking</v>

1316
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:40.950
<v Speaker 6>to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1317
00:56:40.951 --> 00:56:43.110
<v Speaker 6>when is she going to tap?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't in my,</v>

1318
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.600
<v Speaker 6>in that instinctual moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm so used to,</v>

1319
00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.670
<v Speaker 6>in training you get people in a choke,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know they tap.</v>

1320
00:56:47.671 --> 00:56:49.170
<v Speaker 6>So I'm waiting for that tap and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1321
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.780
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when is this girl going to tap?</v>

1322
00:56:51.781 --> 00:56:53.300
<v Speaker 6>Like I know I've got her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does she mean to,</v>

1323
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tap on it and then,</v>

1324
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.530
<v Speaker 6>then I felt her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw her from my peripherals,</v>

1325
00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:58.740
<v Speaker 6>kind of do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do something.</v>

1326
00:56:58.741 --> 00:57:03.741
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't quite sure if she was tapping </v>
<v Speaker 6>or what she was doing until I watched </v>

1327
00:57:03.741 --> 00:57:03.741
<v Speaker 6>the video later and then I felt him pull</v>
<v Speaker 6>me off and I'm like,</v>

1328
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:06.680
<v Speaker 6>that's the feeling that we fight for is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that feeling that,</v>

1329
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.780
<v Speaker 6>that feeling of like I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I established my dominance,</v>

1330
00:57:09.781 --> 00:57:10.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1331
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:10.700
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1332
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a prideful sport in some ways,</v>

1333
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:17.661
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's hand to hand combat with someone </v>

1334
00:57:17.661 --> 00:57:17.661
<v Speaker 6>else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1335
00:57:17.661 --> 00:57:17.661
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1336
00:57:17.661 --> 00:57:17.661
<v Speaker 6>I did it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was better</v>

1337
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:22.940
<v Speaker 4>to be prideful because otherwise there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just certain sacrifices in certain fires</v>

1338
00:57:22.941 --> 00:57:27.941
<v Speaker 4>that you're not going to walk through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to have every fucking </v>

1339
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:28.220
<v Speaker 4>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be Zen,</v>

1340
00:57:28.221 --> 00:57:33.221
<v Speaker 4>but you also have to have an ego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There has to be so many things going on </v>

1341
00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:34.610
<v Speaker 4>for you to achieve that highest level of</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatness.</v>

1342
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:36.240
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on a tight rope,</v>

1343
00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:41.590
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people that are just like that perfect </v>

1344
00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:41.590
<v Speaker 6>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1345
00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:41.880
<v Speaker 6>I'm walking between buildings that are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1346
00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:45.000
<v Speaker 6>hundreds of stories high or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then it's like,</v>

1347
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:46.290
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's Kinda like that.</v>

1348
00:57:46.291 --> 00:57:48.000
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to have the perfect balance and</v>

1349
00:57:48.001 --> 00:57:50.400
<v Speaker 6>everything has to meet perfectly and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that moment,</v>

1350
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.230
<v Speaker 6>including the training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not overtraining.</v>

1351
00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:56.430
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever hear that video that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>video is not that good?</v>

1352
00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:58.050
<v Speaker 6>But the audio is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is awesome.</v>

1353
00:57:58.051 --> 00:58:00.990
<v Speaker 6>It's between the fourth and fifth round </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's my corners,</v>

1354
00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.270
<v Speaker 6>what they're telling me between fourth </v>
<v Speaker 6>and fifth round.</v>

1355
00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.390
<v Speaker 6>It's such an emotional video for me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I watched it,</v>

1356
00:58:06.391 --> 00:58:11.391
<v Speaker 6>it makes me relive that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Brian came in there and essentially </v>

1357
00:58:11.391 --> 00:58:11.910
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Misha,</v>

1358
00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:14.910
<v Speaker 6>you've got to get after you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have got to put your chin down.</v>

1359
00:58:14.911 --> 00:58:16.170
<v Speaker 6>And Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this chick.</v>

1360
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.760
<v Speaker 6>And that basically means just get after </v>
<v Speaker 6>her,</v>

1361
00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:18.360
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get,</v>

1362
00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:19.320
<v Speaker 6>get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get after it,</v>

1363
00:58:19.321 --> 00:58:21.570
<v Speaker 6>take the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>risk getting knocked out,</v>

1364
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.850
<v Speaker 6>go for broke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1365
00:58:23.851 --> 00:58:24.670
<v Speaker 6>it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1366
00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:29.720
<v Speaker 6>plays into the round and basically </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're just telling me fucking Mike </v>

1367
00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.260
<v Speaker 6>Tyson her like get after her bulldog or </v>
<v Speaker 6>do whatever you've got to do.</v>

1368
00:58:31.261 --> 00:58:32.550
<v Speaker 6>Is that because you're running out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

1369
00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:36.140
<v Speaker 6>and I remember in that fifth round still</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to get out of that,</v>

1370
00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:40.020
<v Speaker 6>that mindset of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I to find the perfect opportunity.</v>

1371
00:58:40.021 --> 00:58:42.660
<v Speaker 6>I have to be patient because the whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>training camp was,</v>

1372
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:48.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>patient but persistent patient but </v>

1373
00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:48.020
<v Speaker 6>persistent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one run into anything because you,</v>

1374
00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:48.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll get caught,</v>

1375
00:58:48.661 --> 00:58:49.950
<v Speaker 6>you get knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll get need,</v>

1376
00:58:49.951 --> 00:58:51.450
<v Speaker 6>you'll get kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll get punched.</v>

1377
00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.860
<v Speaker 6>So don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you've got to look for the,</v>

1378
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.760
<v Speaker 6>the opening when it's the right timing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all about timing.</v>

1379
00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:00.630
<v Speaker 6>And after I took her down in that second</v>
<v Speaker 6>round and I just beat her up that round,</v>

1380
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:06.500
<v Speaker 6>she was so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm so cautious in the third and fourth </v>

1381
00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:06.540
<v Speaker 6>and so perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1382
00:59:06.541 --> 00:59:08.370
<v Speaker 6>her game plan was perfect to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to beat me,</v>

1383
00:59:08.371 --> 00:59:11.940
<v Speaker 6>to stay just far enough out of the range</v>
<v Speaker 6>and keep me from not wanting to come in.</v>

1384
00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.720
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't find in a perfect opening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It couldn't get in on anything.</v>

1385
00:59:15.721 --> 00:59:17.010
<v Speaker 6>There wasn't mistakes that she was </v>
<v Speaker 6>making.</v>

1386
00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:19.800
<v Speaker 6>And then in the fifth round I just </v>
<v Speaker 6>decided,</v>

1387
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to have to,</v>

1388
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna have to take the chance of </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting knocked out.</v>

1389
00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.090
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what it's boiling down to.</v>

1390
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:30.680
<v Speaker 6>Now you've got like three minutes left </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the clock and now it's do or die.</v>

1391
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.070
<v Speaker 6>It's either you go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1392
00:59:32.071 --> 00:59:33.890
<v Speaker 6>you go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you do Russian,</v>

1393
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 6>she catches you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get knocked out,</v>

1394
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:41.321
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gave it everything you got or you </v>

1395
00:59:41.321 --> 00:59:41.321
<v Speaker 6>don't make something happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When have finished the fight,</v>

1396
00:59:41.321 --> 00:59:43.810
<v Speaker 3>the question was really like whether the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second round was a 10,</v>

1397
00:59:43.811 --> 00:59:46.960
<v Speaker 3>eight round on all three judges score </v>
<v Speaker 3>cards.</v>

1398
00:59:46.961 --> 00:59:47.820
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1399
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I was watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the judges said.</v>

1400
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Well it should have been but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm.</v>

1401
00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:56.320
<v Speaker 3>What I meant was the question watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like I want like when we were,</v>

1402
00:59:56.321 --> 00:59:58.900
<v Speaker 3>when you were headed into the fifth </v>
<v Speaker 3>round with my question was,</v>

1403
00:59:58.901 --> 01:00:01.960
<v Speaker 3>was I wonder if she got a ten eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>round for that second round.</v>

1404
01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Because if she did then this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is even fight.</v>

1405
01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.930
<v Speaker 3>So what's happening right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1406
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:09.820
<v Speaker 3>How the judge is looking at it going </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the fifth round.</v>

1407
01:00:09.821 --> 01:00:11.350
<v Speaker 3>It was even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1409
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.540
<v Speaker 3>That was such a crazy moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does another time.</v>

1410
01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:21.570
<v Speaker 3>The Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the postcode interview where almost </v>

1411
01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:22.120
<v Speaker 3>cried like a bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

1429
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.360
<v Speaker 6>I had visualized that moment so many </v>
<v Speaker 6>times that I felt like I was confused in</v>

1430
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.530
<v Speaker 6>that it was hard for me to distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 6>that that was the real moment</v>

1431
01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:09.080
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine it was so.</v>

1432
01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:14.110

<v Speaker 3>Best moments in my life for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only imagine.</v>

1449
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean anyone that watches that sport,</v>

1450
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.200
<v Speaker 3>that moment when you choked her out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the whole exchange of the.</v>

1451
01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like the really the whole fight </v>

1452
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.440
<v Speaker 3>because fight is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in a weird way.</v>

1453
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean we call this martial arts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that have a </v>

1454
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:12.201
<v Speaker 3>problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in my mind that there is an art to </v>

1455
01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:15.651
<v Speaker 3>what you guys did in that fight and even</v>
<v Speaker 3>what holly did because up until that </v>

1456
01:02:15.651 --> 01:02:18.780
<v Speaker 3>fifth round mean like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the third and fourth.</v>

1457
01:02:18.781 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 3>She was what she wanted to do.</v>

1458
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 4>She was shoes and there was a display </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

1459
01:02:23.191 --> 01:02:28.191
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a performance going on on top </v>

1460
01:02:28.191 --> 01:02:28.810
<v Speaker 4>of this being a competition to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1461
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 4>someone's sitting there watching it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>calling it.</v>

1462
01:02:30.661 --> 01:02:35.661
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is a work of art and to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in that way which is such a masterful</v>

1463
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:40.080
<v Speaker 4>performance was such a masterpiece </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment and that to me is like one of the</v>

1464
01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:45.081
<v Speaker 4>best moments in mma because it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hard thing to achieve to become </v>

1465
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:51.201
<v Speaker 4>a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for someone like you had tried and </v>

1466
01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:53.691
<v Speaker 4>tried again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He won the title in strikeforce and </v>

1467
01:02:53.691 --> 01:02:54.540
<v Speaker 4>you're trying and trying again and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to make this happen and you know,</v>

1468
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:59.541

<v Speaker 4>then the Rhonda fight didn't happen </v>

1469
01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:00.040
<v Speaker 4>after you beat Jessica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>

<v Speaker 4>ever seen inside the octagon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it wasn't obviously,</v>

1485
01:03:38.271 --> 01:03:40.760
<v Speaker 2>but to most people it was a spectacle at</v>
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>

1486
01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Something they kind of threw on the card</v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of like,</v>

1487
01:03:43.491 --> 01:03:44.330
<v Speaker 2>ah Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1488
01:03:44.331 --> 01:03:45.890
<v Speaker 2>watch the chicks fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1489
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.380
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it'll pop out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1490
01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.240
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't respect us as </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

1491
01:03:56.241 --> 01:03:56.990
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1492
01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.060
<v Speaker 2>that's what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1493
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.630
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the honest truth.</v>

1494
01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the uphill battle that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody took it seriously.</v>

1495
01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:07.271
<v Speaker 2>We didn't make any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were fighting for bread crumbs at </v>

1496
01:04:07.271 --> 01:04:08.600
<v Speaker 2>best and kept you going during those </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1497
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.350
<v Speaker 2>The Passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Cliche as it sounds,</v>

1498
01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:17.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm just the desire to want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled and I felt like that was the </v>

1499
01:04:17.541 --> 01:04:21.170
<v Speaker 2>most fulfilling thing in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't college.</v>

1500
01:04:21.171 --> 01:04:22.520
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>

1501
01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.090
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing else that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfilling.</v>

1502
01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:29.740
<v Speaker 4>But what is it about fighting that </v>
<v Speaker 4>attracted you to it when there wasn't </v>

1503
01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.011
<v Speaker 4>any clear future because you were in it </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a time.</v>

1504
01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Think</v>

1505
01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.190
<v Speaker 2>about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much early on now.</v>

1506
01:04:36.191 --> 01:04:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think about it as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1507
01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.020
<v Speaker 2>this needs to be lucrative for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This needs to be,</v>

1508
01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:46.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to some of it was I was probably </v>

1509
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:51.750
<v Speaker 2>three years into my career before I even</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that I could maybe like actually</v>

1510
01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:58.140
<v Speaker 2>possibly make a living at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was just something that I was </v>

1511
01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:58.720
<v Speaker 2>doing to feel alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1512
01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just something that I was doing </v>

1513
01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make me feel accomplished.</v>

1514
01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:08.750
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't put a price on how something </v>

1515
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.750
<v Speaker 2>makes you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1516
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:12.310
<v Speaker 2>a memory and experience happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1517
01:05:12.311 --> 01:05:13.270
<v Speaker 2>those emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1518
01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.270
<v Speaker 2>people say like the day that they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>married,</v>

1519
01:05:15.271 --> 01:05:17.060
<v Speaker 2>the day that they had their kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day you,</v>

1520
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.690
<v Speaker 2>those are like mile markers in people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

1521
01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess if you ask someone on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>deathbed,</v>

1522
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 2>what were the moments that made you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive?</v>

1523
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Like what did your life amount to what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>

1524
01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Those key markers in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of my fights have been markers </v>

1525
01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:33.370
<v Speaker 2>in my life that's more than most people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can say.</v>

1526
01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:38.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess it was such a sense of </v>

1527
01:05:38.371 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 2>fulfillment and now the fact that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hard,</v>

1528
01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:44.090
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so hard and so many people were </v>

1529
01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:46.321
<v Speaker 2>so against me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that made me really determined </v>

1530
01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:46.321
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of people,</v>

1531
01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>my Grandpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

1532
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Speaker 2>my grandpa was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was chauvinistic to be quite honest.</v>

1533
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:55.441
<v Speaker 2>He was not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was embarrassed that his </v>

1534
01:05:55.441 --> 01:05:55.441
<v Speaker 2>granddaughter was a fighter and he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>give my dad a hard time all the time,</v>

1535
01:05:55.441 --> 01:05:56.470
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you let your daughter do that?</v>

1536
01:05:56.471 --> 01:05:58.150
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let her do anything.</v>

1537
01:05:58.151 --> 01:05:59.260
<v Speaker 2>She just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's her own person.</v>

1538
01:05:59.261 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not proud of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my grandpa,</v>

1539
01:06:02.261 --> 01:06:02.710
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>

1540
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1541
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.360
<v Speaker 2>had a big change of heart when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I actually lost my title too,</v>

1542
01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 2>when I won my title against Marley's </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoon and,</v>

1543
01:06:16.631 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really became obviously big fan,</v>

1544
01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very proud of you.</v>

1545
01:06:21.161 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to my neighbors about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1546
01:06:22.901 --> 01:06:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I lost my fight to Rhonda,</v>

1547
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:32.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Right when he got diagnosed with </v>

1548
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:32.100
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1549
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.000
<v Speaker 2>that's eventually what passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1550
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.970
<v Speaker 2>so I went straight from that fight down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see him,</v>

1551
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:39.910
<v Speaker 2>to see how he was doing and my dad was </v>
<v Speaker 2>down there visiting.</v>

1552
01:06:39.911 --> 01:06:42.070
<v Speaker 2>He lives in Florida so very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very far away.</v>

1553
01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.840
<v Speaker 2>And I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1554
01:06:43.841 --> 01:06:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Grandpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1555
01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm really sorry that I didn't win this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1556
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.090
<v Speaker 2>when it makes me emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1557
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I didn't win this fight for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1558
01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:50.530
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter,</v>

1559
01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1560
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the last fight that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he ever saw unfortunately.</v>

1561
01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:57.760
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1562
01:06:57.761 --> 01:06:58.210
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1563
01:06:58.211 --> 01:07:00.670
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot of heart and so proud of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1564
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.440
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you attracted to other extreme </v>

1565
01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.340
<v Speaker 2>sports when you were younger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1566
01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:13.350
<v Speaker 2>because I wasn't raised that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't raised with like extreme </v>

1567
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:13.350
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1568
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:14.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1569
01:07:14.591 --> 01:07:17.410
<v Speaker 2>my dad's still saw me as even segregate </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1570
01:07:17.411 --> 01:07:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1571
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.190
<v Speaker 2>he saw me as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1572
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:24.210
<v Speaker 2>it was a little girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he didn't take me four wheeling or </v>

1573
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:24.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1574
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.390
<v Speaker 2>riding dirt bikes or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took me down hill,</v>

1575
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:27.940
<v Speaker 2>not downhill mountain biking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it kind of turned into that.</v>

1576
01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:32.941
<v Speaker 2>We rode for miles out to a lake with my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my little brother and a friend of </v>

1577
01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:35.470
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then um,</v>

1578
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was riding back and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like big rocks and boulders and my </v>

1579
01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:44.791
<v Speaker 2>dad and his buddy have have had downhill</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain bikes may for I'm writing like </v>

1580
01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:44.910
<v Speaker 2>a little street bikes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

1581
01:07:44.911 --> 01:07:46.750
<v Speaker 2>they're expecting that I'm just going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to,</v>

1582
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:51.751
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just carry down the hill or </v>

1583
01:07:51.751 --> 01:07:51.751
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1584

<v Speaker 2>hear from,</v>

1586
01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:56.980

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1587
01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:00.730
<v Speaker 2>when I fell and I just got up and my dad</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1588
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.010
<v Speaker 2>this is like one of the moments I </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize you were different.</v>

1589
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:04.900
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just popped up and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I never saw anything like that.</v>

1594
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I thought you're right that we were </v>

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 4>so it was just something that was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>in you,</v>

1600
01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:25.130
<v Speaker 4>I guess just deal.</v>

1601
01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom always told me,</v>

1602
01:08:27.731 --> 01:08:30.250
<v Speaker 2>and this something I realized when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to mark hypnosis,</v>

1603
01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:35.490
<v Speaker 2>he's telling me about how much children </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be affected by people who are </v>

1604
01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:36.820
<v Speaker 2>negative in their life with people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1605
01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:42.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never gonna amount to anything </v>

1606
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:42.060
<v Speaker 2>and how that can affect the subconscious</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

1607
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:42.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a dad who's like,</v>

1608
01:08:42.610 --> 01:08:44.050
<v Speaker 2>you suck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're terrible.</v>

1609
01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:45.340
<v Speaker 2>You're never gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1610
01:08:45.341 --> 01:08:50.341
<v Speaker 2>you're never gonna be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How that can create crippling ripple </v>

1611
01:08:50.341 --> 01:08:54.001
<v Speaker 2>effects that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that translate on all the way through </v>

1612
01:08:54.001 --> 01:08:54.001
<v Speaker 2>the rest of that person's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1613
01:08:54.001 --> 01:08:54.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if it's the opposite?</v>

1614
01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Like what if you had a parent that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you that you're amazing all the </v>

1615
01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.641
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could do whatever you want and </v>

1616
01:09:02.641 --> 01:09:02.641
<v Speaker 2>they really true heartedly believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1617
01:09:02.641 --> 01:09:02.641
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1618
01:09:02.641 --> 01:09:03.550
<v Speaker 2>that can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be amazing.</v>

1619
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:04.690
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing too.</v>

1620
01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.910
<v Speaker 2>And it made me start thinking because my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom and I,</v>

1621
01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.750
<v Speaker 2>we've had a really rough relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>the past three,</v>

1622
01:09:10.751 --> 01:09:12.690
<v Speaker 2>four years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1623
01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a struggle.</v>

1624
01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:15.790
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting better,</v>

1625
01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:18.500
<v Speaker 2>but I will give her a ton of credit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1626
01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:24.020
<v Speaker 2>as a single mom for part of my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up and even not single,</v>

1627
01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:29.670
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she never made me feel like I wasn't </v>

1628
01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:29.670
<v Speaker 2>capable of doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>

1629
01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:29.680
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

1630
01:09:29.681 --> 01:09:34.681
<v Speaker 2>she always made me feel like I could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do whatever I want and I could be </v>

1631
01:09:34.681 --> 01:09:36.550
<v Speaker 2>the best at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like most people when I would go five,</v>

1632
01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:37.300
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

1633
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:39.940
<v Speaker 2>eight years old and I want to be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>astronaut.</v>

1634
01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Like every little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1635
01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:41.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1636
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:42.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1637
01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my grandpa was the first one to be </v>

1638
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not realistic.</v>

1639
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:47.860
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1640
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:49.240
<v Speaker 2>not going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually my mom was like,</v>

1641
01:09:49.241 --> 01:09:50.620
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will just like,</v>

1642
01:09:50.621 --> 01:09:51.460
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1643
01:09:51.461 --> 01:09:53.140
<v Speaker 2>if that's what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you will.</v>

1644
01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:54.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like Misha,</v>

1645
01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be the best at it.</v>

1646
01:09:57.710 --> 01:09:59.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably good to have both.</v>

1647
01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:04.530
<v Speaker 4>It's probably good to have someone who </v>
<v Speaker 4>wholeheartedly believes in you and </v>

1648
01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:07.211
<v Speaker 4>someone else who's like doubting you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like a little motivation to </v>

1649
01:10:07.211 --> 01:10:09.240
<v Speaker 4>prove them wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other person rise.</v>

1650
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:10.580
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feed off of that.</v>

1651
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 4>I love proving people wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>

1652
01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:16.910
<v Speaker 4>You're a very even tempered person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is very unusual for a fighter.</v>

1653
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:21.970
<v Speaker 4>You're very feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're also very flat and very </v>

1654
01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 4>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're very like,</v>

1655
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:27.430
<v Speaker 4>this is Meesha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is how you are like it was </v>

1656
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:28.610
<v Speaker 4>when you were on the ultimate fighter </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Rhonda.</v>

1657
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.840
<v Speaker 4>It was when it was highlighted the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she's so manic.</v>

1658
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 4>She gets so hot and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons why people love her so much.</v>

1659
01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:42.340
<v Speaker 4>She gets so fucking crazy and she's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>competitive and angry that like when you</v>

1660
01:10:42.501 --> 01:10:44.840
<v Speaker 4>guys did that wall climbing thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that she's like,</v>

1661
01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.550
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's giving you the finger.</v>

1662
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:50.330
<v Speaker 4>Like you're just like you just your </v>
<v Speaker 4>level the election,</v>

1663
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:51.860
<v Speaker 4>but how has that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

1664
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:56.890
<v Speaker 4>when did would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that your whole life you're like </v>

1665
01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:59.231
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or is that something you learned how to </v>

1666
01:10:59.231 --> 01:10:59.231
<v Speaker 4>do?</v>

1667
01:10:59.231 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Pretty easy going my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is I don't like to be stressed</v>

1668
01:10:59.511 --> 01:11:02.300
<v Speaker 2>out and I don't like to be pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't like to not be happy,</v>

1669
01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:06.230
<v Speaker 2>so I do everything within my power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be stressed out.</v>

1670
01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I can be about to miss a flight or </v>
<v Speaker 2>has something.</v>

1671
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:12.650
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what can I do now?</v>

1672
01:11:12.651 --> 01:11:13.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

1673
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:18.890
<v Speaker 2>it's sometimes it's a bad thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't plan ahead enough or I'm not </v>

1674
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:19.530
<v Speaker 2>really good with time management because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be.</v>

1675
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever want to rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if I'm late to something I don't</v>

1676
01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:23.450
<v Speaker 2>like to rush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1677
01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:25.890
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes that's a bad thing.</v>

1678
01:11:25.891 --> 01:11:29.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the most organized person </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm so relaxed about everything.</v>

1679
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1680
01:11:29.781 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 2>my taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do those later,</v>

1681
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of thing.</v>

1682
01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.730
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a great recipe for life </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1683
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:40.900
<v Speaker 4>Is It on both ends?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one does it this way.</v>

1684
01:11:40.901 --> 01:11:41.710
<v Speaker 4>Seems good.</v>

1685
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1686
01:11:42.501 --> 01:11:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1687
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I save save all my tension and stuff I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess for when I get inside the cage,</v>

1688
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>but I like to be relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like to be shown.</v>

1689
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to be pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to be stressed out.</v>

1690
01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Like what a miserable life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

1691
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:54.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are just angry all the time.</v>

1692
01:11:54.781 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're like perma scrooge,</v>

1693
01:11:57.451 --> 01:11:59.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just all the time angry.</v>

1694
01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:04.791
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you not even realize how bad your </v>

1695
01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:04.791
<v Speaker 2>life must suck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if,</v>

1696
01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:05.100
<v Speaker 2>if you just looked at things </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently,</v>

1697
01:12:05.101 --> 01:12:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a way better life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1698
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:07.740
<v Speaker 2>I never want to be that person.</v>

1699
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:11.860
<v Speaker 4>I remember Mike Tyson when he was in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>prime and they asked him about something</v>

1700
01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:14.060
<v Speaker 4>and he was talking about being angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1701
01:12:14.061 --> 01:12:16.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm angry all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm angry at my dog.</v>

1702
01:12:16.391 --> 01:12:17.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm angry at everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm angry.</v>

1703
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.780
<v Speaker 4>The mailman just get the fuck out of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1704
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.800
<v Speaker 4>Like when he was in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was just a ball of fury,</v>

1705
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was just this wrecking machine,</v>

1706
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 4>which is like a lot of people associate </v>
<v Speaker 4>that with being a championship level </v>

1707
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:35.311
<v Speaker 4>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like almost like you have to have a </v>

1708
01:12:35.311 --> 01:12:37.591
<v Speaker 4>certain level of discontent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a certain level of </v>

1709
01:12:37.591 --> 01:12:38.050
<v Speaker 4>anger to motivate you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with you,</v>

1710
01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:42.040
<v Speaker 4>I think if you could look at like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person's graph,</v>

1711
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:45.700
<v Speaker 4>like a sound graph of how they speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>their whole life.</v>

1712
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:47.380
<v Speaker 4>Mine would be all over the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

1713
01:12:47.381 --> 01:12:49.360
<v Speaker 4>going up and down and be all crazy and.</v>

1714
01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:54.630
<v Speaker 4>But Yours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it'd be like this like flat </v>

1715
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:55.840
<v Speaker 4>up in little tiny ups and downs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like very minor ripples,</v>

1716
01:12:55.841 --> 01:12:56.480
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1717
01:12:56.490 --> 01:13:01.490
<v Speaker 4>like a little bit of like a flat lake </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the water comes in a little bit,</v>

1718
01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:05.340
<v Speaker 4>but it's nothing fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no tidal waves.</v>

1719
01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:06.220
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No chaos,</v>

1720
01:13:06.221 --> 01:13:09.070
<v Speaker 4>no tsunamis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're just flat and steady.</v>

1721
01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.840
<v Speaker 4>I try to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not always,</v>

1722
01:13:10.841 --> 01:13:14.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm still a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's usual for a fighter,</v>

1723
01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This flat level sort of way.</v>

1724
01:13:18.431 --> 01:13:21.390
<v Speaker 4>And I say flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It almost sounds like a pejorative and I</v>

1725
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.320
<v Speaker 4>don't mean it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like a Zen,</v>

1726
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:26.890
<v Speaker 4>like you have a very zen thing going on.</v>

1727
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1728
01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:33.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have issues with anxiety a </v>

1729
01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.841
<v Speaker 2>little bit when I was in high school and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like have my track meets and </v>

1730
01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:35.841
<v Speaker 2>something and I would have anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks.</v>

1731
01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:40.611
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a problem with it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess I've always been a very open </v>

1732
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:45.981
<v Speaker 2>minded person and I always asked myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions whenever there's something </v>

1733
01:13:45.981 --> 01:13:46.200
<v Speaker 2>wrong with myself or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue that I'm having.</v>

1734
01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 2>I asked myself why am I having that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1735
01:13:48.211 --> 01:13:53.211
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it comes full circle and I was </v>

1736
01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:55.461
<v Speaker 2>able to answer those questions in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I have never suffered from anxiety </v>

1737
01:13:55.461 --> 01:13:58.521
<v Speaker 2>since I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of put myself in a zen state </v>

1738
01:13:58.521 --> 01:13:58.950
<v Speaker 2>of mind early on in my career because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hated it so much.</v>

1739
01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:01.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't want to live having </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety issues.</v>

1740
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Like why do I have that?</v>

1741
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1742
01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 2>What am I afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1743
01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:05.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1744
01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:10.101
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not afraid enough to where I'm not </v>

1745
01:14:10.101 --> 01:14:10.420
<v Speaker 2>going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's just not make it a big,</v>

1746
01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.760
<v Speaker 2>not make it something I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I do like it.</v>

1747
01:14:12.761 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm doing track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

1748
01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:15.430
<v Speaker 2>I like MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm doing it.</v>

1749
01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make it something I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>

1750
01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make it something I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't enjoy because it's not.</v>

1751
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:22.510
<v Speaker 2>So that's not why I do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do this because I love it,</v>

1752
01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:25.450
<v Speaker 2>so let's not make it something I hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1753
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very rational approach though.</v>

1754
01:14:28.271 --> 01:14:29.790
<v Speaker 2>It's very unusual for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1755
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Like there's nothing in this life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I want to do it,</v>

1756
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:35.540
<v Speaker 2>that fear is going to stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fears are realistic thing.</v>

1757
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 2>It's scary to get into the cage.</v>

1759
01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:42.480
<v Speaker 2>It's scary to think about losing weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've tasted the most bitter losses </v>

1760
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.070
<v Speaker 2>you could ever dream of and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>devastating.</v>

1761
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 2>It's crushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most scary thing.</v>

1762
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:52.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not getting beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not breaking your nose or breaking </v>

1763
01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.740
<v Speaker 2>my orbital bone or letting my arm gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>snapped in half.</v>

1764
01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:56.500
<v Speaker 2>That's not the scary part about fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I do.</v>

1765
01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.040
<v Speaker 2>The scary part is not being adequate </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

1766
01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:03.850
<v Speaker 2>not being good enough that you're 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent wasn't good enough.</v>

1767
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:06.580
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really scary.</v>

1768
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:08.980
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had that.</v>

1769
01:15:08.981 --> 01:15:12.250
<v Speaker 2>I've had to face that point blank right </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face many times before.</v>

1770
01:15:12.251 --> 01:15:15.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's the hardest thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bar none.</v>

1771
01:15:15.521 --> 01:15:17.170
<v Speaker 2>It's the hardest thing to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and be like,</v>

1772
01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't enough.</v>

1773
01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one else can be responsible for that.</v>

1774
01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do it.</v>

1775
01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:28.111
<v Speaker 2>I have to own this and to come back from</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and think that you </v>

1776
01:15:28.111 --> 01:15:32.731
<v Speaker 2>can still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still get it back or you can </v>

1777
01:15:32.731 --> 01:15:32.731
<v Speaker 2>still do it again or you could still get</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1778
01:15:32.731 --> 01:15:33.700
<v Speaker 2>You can learn from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1779
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.920
<v Speaker 2>that's also the challenging part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:38.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had to,</v>

1781
01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:43.420
<v Speaker 2>to get to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had to get over those situations </v>

1782
01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.250
<v Speaker 2>where I thought that my world had ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1783
01:15:45.251 --> 01:15:47.950
<v Speaker 2>my second last or Rhonda was the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>devastating.</v>

1784
01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:50.980
<v Speaker 2>The first loss was devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second loss was a,</v>

1785
01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was horrible.</v>

1786
01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I thought my world was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was coming to an end and you know,</v>

1787
01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:57.430
<v Speaker 2>and nobody cared about my family and </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

1788
01:15:57.431 --> 01:15:59.080
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care.</v>

1789
01:15:59.081 --> 01:16:00.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't care about second place.</v>

1790
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.930
<v Speaker 2>They don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1791
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're mean.</v>

1792
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.010
<v Speaker 2>People are harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're mean on social media.</v>

1793
01:16:06.011 --> 01:16:09.340
<v Speaker 2>You have to get thick skin quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody teaches you how to deal with that</v>

1794
01:16:09.341 --> 01:16:11.140
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no mma,</v>

1795
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.540
<v Speaker 2>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>101 or like you don't,</v>

1796
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.600
<v Speaker 2>you just sink or swim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you figure it out or you don't either </v>

1797
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:18.600
<v Speaker 2>bothers you or doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1798
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.840
<v Speaker 2>either you yell back at everyone or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

1799
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:20.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1800
01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:22.740
<v Speaker 5>like when you're in the first generation</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's ever had to deal with.</v>

1801
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's never been anybody in the </v>

1802
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:30.231
<v Speaker 5>last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it new occurrence and they don't </v>

1803
01:16:30.231 --> 01:16:31.020
<v Speaker 5>teach you how to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to deal with it or how to not let it</v>

1804
01:16:31.021 --> 01:16:32.850
<v Speaker 5>affect you emotionally?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one knows.</v>

1805
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:33.660
<v Speaker 5>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1806
01:16:33.661 --> 01:16:36.000
<v Speaker 5>this is a total new field learning </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience,</v>

1807
01:16:36.001 --> 01:16:38.250
<v Speaker 5>especially for someone who does what you</v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

1808
01:16:38.251 --> 01:16:42.720
<v Speaker 5>which is the most exposed an athlete </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever gets ever like if you lose a tennis</v>

1809
01:16:42.721 --> 01:16:44.640
<v Speaker 5>match and the world says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1810
01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:49.050
<v Speaker 5>you fucking suck at tennis or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch move on with your life.</v>

1811
01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.130
<v Speaker 5>But if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1812
01:16:50.131 --> 01:16:52.080
<v Speaker 5>Rhonda beat you again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucking dumb hoe.</v>

1813
01:16:52.081 --> 01:16:53.580
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1814
01:16:53.581 --> 01:16:56.740
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People so goddamn mean.</v>

1815
01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.610
<v Speaker 5>And it's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the most primal thing.</v>

1816
01:16:59.611 --> 01:17:02.370
<v Speaker 5>So everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what other sport or sports always buyout</v>

1817
01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:04.410
<v Speaker 5>boiled down to and they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 5>another person is</v>

1818
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:09.430
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the most primal way to deal </v>

1819
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.430
<v Speaker 2>with something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once your sport is fighting,</v>

1820
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>people like feel like</v>

1821
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 1>that more justification to talk shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're just like,</v>

1822
01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to laugh because Jon Jones and </v>

1823
01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were in New York,</v>

1824
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.740
<v Speaker 1>they opened up the questions to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

1825
01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I big mistake because these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipsqueaks they got on the microphone.</v>

1826
01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so Daniel Cormier,</v>

1827
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say I have a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important question for you.</v>

1828
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>How is it going to feel when Jon Jones </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks your ass again?</v>

1829
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just like,</v>

1830
01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:40.820
<v Speaker 1>you idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were,</v>

1831
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have the balls to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was just you and Daniel in this </v>

1832
01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.571
<v Speaker 1>room and no one was going to know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome of what happened after you said </v>

1833
01:17:49.571 --> 01:17:49.571
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1834
01:17:49.571 --> 01:17:50.690
<v Speaker 1>the fact that people feel so safe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

1835
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:55.010
<v Speaker 1>can do that killer like Daniel cormier </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they did the same thing to John</v>

1836
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see what they did?</v>

1837
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.950
<v Speaker 1>The Rashad Evans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rashad Evans,</v>

1838
01:17:57.951 --> 01:18:01.970
<v Speaker 1>was that the photo signing and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up to him with a picture of,</v>

1839
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an iconic photo of when Leo </v>

1840
01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out or he's like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumpled up against the cage and this </v>

1841
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:13.121
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little skinny kid with a smile on </v>

1842
01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:16.271
<v Speaker 1>his face wanted Rashad to sign that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we shot a crumple it up and threw it </v>

1843
01:18:16.271 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm and looked at him like,</v>

1844
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:18.740
<v Speaker 1>are you out of your fucking mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1845
01:18:18.741 --> 01:18:20.330
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I could do to you right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

1846
01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Like he tried to hurt my feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to make me feel bad trying to punk </v>

1847
01:18:25.690 --> 01:18:27.490
<v Speaker 1>me in front of people while you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera on me because you're filming it,</v>

1848
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:32.500
<v Speaker 1>like your friends are filming this </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to you sticking just his </v>

1849
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.000
<v Speaker 1>callousness and also just being </v>
<v Speaker 1>oblivious,</v>

1850
01:18:35.170 --> 01:18:37.520
<v Speaker 1>like oblivious to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to do that?</v>

1851
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want to say that to John?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

1852
01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Why is he so dummies grow up watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro wrestling and they,</v>

1853
01:18:44.091 --> 01:18:47.400
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand that this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

1854
01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.560
<v Speaker 1>like you say hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's it going to feel to get your ass </v>

1855
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:52.940
<v Speaker 1>kicked again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What started that?</v>

1856
01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Like they were expecting like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fake thing.</v>

1857
01:18:56.370 --> 01:19:01.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's just oblivious to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you're hurting someone's </v>

1858
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:04.610
<v Speaker 1>feelings for no reason and you can also </v>
<v Speaker 1>get caught up in it emotionally.</v>

1859
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1860
01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:10.700
<v Speaker 1>people get caught up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched conor Mcgregor's social </v>

1861
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.960
<v Speaker 1>media after Nate Diaz beat him and Holy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit I was,</v>

1862
01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I was saying to my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1863
01:19:14.301 --> 01:19:19.301
<v Speaker 1>I hope he stays off line for a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't go anywhere near a computer </v>

1864
01:19:19.301 --> 01:19:20.000
<v Speaker 1>for like a solid week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1865
01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Because it's just the cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept of the world.</v>

1866
01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Just the deluge twice for it.</v>

1867
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love it and they hate their own </v>

1868
01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:31.560
<v Speaker 1>lives is the thing is that nobody wins </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our sport forever.</v>

1869
01:19:31.561 --> 01:19:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Like so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always.</v>

1870
01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.370
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to face that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point.</v>

1871
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:38.000
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most exciting things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it is that it's so volatile.</v>

1872
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Like the Chris Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke rockhold fight to me is like a </v>

1873
01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:45.941
<v Speaker 1>perfect example that I often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see Chris Weidman training or watch </v>

1874
01:19:45.941 --> 01:19:46.760
<v Speaker 1>videos of him training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1875
01:19:46.761 --> 01:19:51.761
<v Speaker 1>what is going on in his mind right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Weidman was so dominant and you </v>

1876
01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:56.480
<v Speaker 1>even in that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly competitive and he throws one</v>

1877
01:19:56.481 --> 01:19:57.800
<v Speaker 1>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One crazy.</v>

1878
01:19:57.801 --> 01:20:02.801
<v Speaker 1>We'll kick one ill advised we'll kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>rockhold takes him down and smashes him </v>

1879
01:20:02.801 --> 01:20:06.170
<v Speaker 1>and I just wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much does that kick haunt him?</v>

1880
01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>How much does that haunt him?</v>

1881
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Like how might what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is going on in his mind?</v>

1882
01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a guy who destroys Anderson </v>

1883
01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beats the fuck out of Leo Machida.</v>

1884
01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Vito Belfort smashes him in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>round,</v>

1885
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:20.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you watch his fights and you just go,</v>

1886
01:20:20.221 --> 01:20:21.250
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1887
01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:23.790
<v Speaker 3>what is this rockhold fight going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>play off like,</v>

1888
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:28.910
<v Speaker 3>and then when rockhold beat them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat them down the way he did and </v>

1889
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.910
<v Speaker 3>destroys him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1890
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a changing of the guard here.</v>

1891
01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Like these moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these pivotal moments of like,</v>

1892
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:36.360
<v Speaker 3>your whole life changes you go from </v>
<v Speaker 3>being Chris Weidman,</v>

1893
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:41.510
<v Speaker 3>UFC middleweight champion of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best fighters in the planet </v>

1894
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:44.451
<v Speaker 3>to Chris Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>former UFC middleweight champion of the </v>

1895
01:20:44.451 --> 01:20:47.961
<v Speaker 3>world now hoping he gets a shot at his </v>
<v Speaker 3>title in a rematch and now that he's got</v>

1896
01:20:48.361 --> 01:20:49.860
<v Speaker 3>it and it's going to happen soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1897
01:20:49.861 --> 01:20:52.320
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the drama and the buildup,</v>

1898
01:20:52.321 --> 01:20:55.740
<v Speaker 3>like I can't imagine being him right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1899
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:59.460
<v Speaker 3>like the tension that he's under right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and the pressure and what,</v>

1900
01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:04.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much emotional connection he has </v>

1901
01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:07.221
<v Speaker 3>towards this attempt to win his title </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and how intense it's going to be </v>

1902
01:21:07.221 --> 01:21:07.221
<v Speaker 3>once they get in there.</v>

1903
01:21:07.221 --> 01:21:11.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're really starting to not like </v>

1904
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:11.640
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The last time I was here for Fox,</v>

1905
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.240
<v Speaker 6>I think it was about a month or so ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were,</v>

1906
01:21:13.241 --> 01:21:18.241
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were there and there was some </v>

1907
01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:20.971
<v Speaker 6>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course they were in studio and you </v>

1908
01:21:20.971 --> 01:21:20.971
<v Speaker 6>could tell Chris was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was not,</v>

1909
01:21:20.971 --> 01:21:22.720
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1910
01:21:22.721 --> 01:21:27.721
<v Speaker 6>he's pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not happy with the situation and </v>

1911
01:21:27.721 --> 01:21:27.721
<v Speaker 6>Luke rockhold is kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1912
01:21:27.721 --> 01:21:31.981
<v Speaker 6>he's happy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got the belt and he was kind of </v>

1913
01:21:31.981 --> 01:21:32.080
<v Speaker 6>boasting it around a little bit and he's</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of ribbing Chris,</v>

1914
01:21:32.081 --> 01:21:34.960
<v Speaker 6>you could tell like trying to get under </v>
<v Speaker 6>his skin a little bit and Chris is like,</v>

1915
01:21:34.961 --> 01:21:37.870
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could just tell he was like upset,</v>

1916
01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 6>like they were kind of friendly</v>

1917
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:40.630
<v Speaker 3>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>

1918
01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.750
<v Speaker 3>They were friendly before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for a long time,</v>

1920
01:21:43.751 --> 01:21:45.310
<v Speaker 3>like there's photos of the two of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

1921
01:21:45.311 --> 01:21:48.190
<v Speaker 3>smiling and not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1922
01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.170
<v Speaker 3>when a guy beats you down like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1923
01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:52.510
<v Speaker 3>and you lose your title the way Weidman </v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

1924
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:55.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Brock holds fucking good.</v>

1925
01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:56.890
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking good.</v>

1926
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.450
<v Speaker 6>I saw holly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1927
01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:03.470
<v Speaker 6>once instance a fight and I was really </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually kind of nervous about it </v>

1928
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.600
<v Speaker 6>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was,</v>

1929
01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at the Jones osp fight.</v>

1930
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:09.010
<v Speaker 6>Those just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1931
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:14.030
<v Speaker 6>we were both of the VIP party and my </v>
<v Speaker 6>friend Heather Clark used to train </v>

1932
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.030
<v Speaker 6>heather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe Clark actually fighting this weekend</v>

1933
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 6>in Rotterdam.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyways,</v>

1934
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:17.130
<v Speaker 6>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you should go and talk to him.</v>

1935
01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1936
01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:18.150
<v Speaker 6>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

1937
01:22:18.230 --> 01:22:19.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to come off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1938

1962
01:22:59.310 --> 01:23:01.850

01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Some tomfoolery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't make any sense.</v>

1967
01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:15.630
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't fit the mold either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like both of you guys are really </v>

1968
01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:18.121
<v Speaker 4>interesting representatives of MMA and </v>
<v Speaker 4>great representatives because you break </v>

1969
01:23:18.121 --> 01:23:18.980
<v Speaker 4>that mold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know</v>

1970
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.170
<v Speaker 2>her manager though?</v>

1971
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Who is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1972
01:23:22.711 --> 01:23:24.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I've ever met him </v>
<v Speaker 2>in person.</v>

1973
01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I probably haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I have.</v>

1974
01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:26.880
<v Speaker 2>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't memorable.</v>

1975
01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1976
01:23:28.530 --> 01:23:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess he went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Dana went down.</v>

1977
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:32.340
<v Speaker 2>So Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana told me this.</v>

1978
01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Dana went down to albuquerque before </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fight ever came together of her and</v>

1979
01:23:35.971 --> 01:23:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1980
01:23:37.170 --> 01:23:38.850
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1981
01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:41.670
<v Speaker 2>you guys need to wait for Rhonda.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's the big money fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fight.</v>

1983
01:23:43.531 --> 01:23:44.790
<v Speaker 2>You want to wait for him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went down there.</v>

1984
01:23:44.791 --> 01:23:45.570
<v Speaker 2>He told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my face.</v>

1985
01:23:45.571 --> 01:23:48.120
<v Speaker 2>He went down there to tell them don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight me.</v>

1986
01:23:48.121 --> 01:23:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Should take like they didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give me.</v>

1987
01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.810
<v Speaker 2>The UC did not want that fight to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1988
01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:57.170
<v Speaker 2>They wanted the rematch should be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first fight and holly's manager told him</v>

1989
01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:03.680
<v Speaker 2>we want me should tay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Dana said he threw up his hands and </v>

1990
01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:03.680
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

1991
01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:03.690
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's been the baddest,</v>

<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1993
01:24:05.761 --> 01:24:10.761
<v Speaker 2>and you want to take her lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you're just going to walk </v>

1994
01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:10.761
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1996
01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:12.390

1998
01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:17.560

<v Speaker 2>But then he told Dana that,</v>

1999
01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.070
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they thought that I was going to be</v>

2000
01:24:20.071 --> 01:24:20.700
<v Speaker 2>a tuneup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2008
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:35.670
<v Speaker 4>That's not the right attempt.</v>

2009

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2061
01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.480
<v Speaker 6>I guess I've never been on team Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some all or none.</v>

2062
01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:23.080
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2063
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:26.080
<v Speaker 1>that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2064
01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:31.860
<v Speaker 1>people love both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting like people love your </v>

2065
01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:33.400
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people also love like shit talking,</v>

2066
01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people love Nate Diaz for that and </v>

2067
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:38.420
<v Speaker 1>people love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love the drama,</v>

2068
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.140
<v Speaker 1>but they also love someone like you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hugger.</v>

2069
01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhere in the middle though </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I get a lot of flack for</v>

2070
01:26:44.530 --> 01:26:45.970
<v Speaker 6>no my mouth like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you just can't go.</v>

2071
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
<v Speaker 6>I say what I'm thinking and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty transparent and sometimes </v>

2072
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:51.430
<v Speaker 6>people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2073
01:26:51.431 --> 01:26:53.110
<v Speaker 6>I get a lot of flack,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh you're fake or this.</v>

2074
01:26:53.111 --> 01:26:54.760
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not really like,</v>

2075
01:26:54.761 --> 01:26:55.480
<v Speaker 6>just because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2076
01:26:55.481 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll say like I'm a fan of Connor,</v>

2077
01:26:57.441 --> 01:27:00.160
<v Speaker 6>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like his fighting style and his antics</v>

2078
01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:01.570
<v Speaker 6>at first were kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

2079
01:27:01.571 --> 01:27:02.530
<v Speaker 6>who is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it?</v>

2080
01:27:02.531 --> 01:27:03.640
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I'm like,</v>

2081
01:27:03.641 --> 01:27:05.260
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>props to him.</v>

2082
01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:09.400
<v Speaker 6>He's done amazing things like good for </v>
<v Speaker 6>him and he's done really good things for</v>

2083
01:27:09.401 --> 01:27:11.710
<v Speaker 6>our sport.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you didn't show up to film that</v>

2084
01:27:11.711 --> 01:27:13.500
<v Speaker 6>commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm not,</v>

2085
01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:15.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll be honest like yeah,</v>

2086
01:27:15.161 --> 01:27:18.190
<v Speaker 6>I kind of rubbed me the wrong way </v>
<v Speaker 6>because people are like,</v>

2087
01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:20.230
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he does so much more media than you guys</v>

2088
01:27:20.231 --> 01:27:20.500
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

2089
01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:21.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd probably does.</v>

2090
01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:22.300
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they probably does.</v>

2091
01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.040
<v Speaker 6>I do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He probably does more.</v>

2092
01:27:24.130 --> 01:27:29.130
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I don't have a private jet flying </v>

2093
01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:29.830
<v Speaker 6>out to pick me up and bring me back and </v>
<v Speaker 6>fly 20 people in my crew with me too.</v>

2094
01:27:29.890 --> 01:27:34.890
<v Speaker 6>He does more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he gets more when they bring them to </v>

2095
01:27:34.890 --> 01:27:34.890
<v Speaker 6>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they put them up in a penthouse,</v>

2096
01:27:34.890 --> 01:27:35.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they make sure he has everything that he</v>

2097
01:27:35.231 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 6>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't get that,</v>

2098
01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:37.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I'm,</v>

2099
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:38.170
<v Speaker 6>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2100
01:27:38.171 --> 01:27:39.790
<v Speaker 6>he's earned that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's in that spot.</v>

2101
01:27:40.090 --> 01:27:45.090
<v Speaker 6>No problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think three months out from a </v>

2102
01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:45.090
<v Speaker 6>fight camp,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2103
01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:46.000
<v Speaker 6>you have a private jet coming to pick </v>
<v Speaker 6>you up with.</v>

2104
01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:51.120
<v Speaker 6>You can bring one of your teammates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could probably work out on the jet </v>

2105
01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:51.310
<v Speaker 6>if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the way there because it's yours,</v>

2106
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.970
<v Speaker 6>it's private.</v>

2107
01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.150
<v Speaker 6>Do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2108
01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.540
<v Speaker 6>You could probably hit mental agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could totally,</v>

2109
01:27:55.541 --> 01:27:55.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2110
01:27:55.901 --> 01:27:59.350
<v Speaker 6>you're three months out and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to show for your media obligations.</v>

2111
01:27:59.351 --> 01:28:04.030
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't really understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like it just,</v>

2112
01:28:04.031 --> 01:28:05.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess I'm trying to figure it out,</v>

2113
01:28:05.471 --> 01:28:08.750
<v Speaker 6>but the only issue that I had and it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't bother me.</v>

2114
01:28:08.751 --> 01:28:10.630
<v Speaker 6>Like if he didn't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's his own thing.</v>

2115
01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:15.660
<v Speaker 6>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that I showed up the day to film the </v>

2116
01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.810
<v Speaker 6>commercial and I had two segments I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to film and that's all that was</v>

2117
01:28:16.811 --> 01:28:18.300
<v Speaker 6>on my schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they asked me.</v>

2118
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:24.250
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can you please help us out because </v>

2119
01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:27.121
<v Speaker 6>Connor's not here and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't know what we're doing for this </v>

2120
01:28:27.121 --> 01:28:28.180
<v Speaker 6>third segment of the commercial that was</v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be conor and nate.</v>

2121
01:28:28.210 --> 01:28:32.720
<v Speaker 6>So can you please come back later that </v>
<v Speaker 6>day and film that segment Muslim,</v>

2122
01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:37.150
<v Speaker 6>that was during my practice time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I had to come back and you know,</v>

2123
01:28:37.151 --> 01:28:38.950
<v Speaker 6>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was a company woman,</v>

2124
01:28:38.951 --> 01:28:41.770
<v Speaker 6>but like it was just frustrating because</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like Dang,</v>

2125
01:28:41.771 --> 01:28:42.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I had known about this,</v>

2126
01:28:42.881 --> 01:28:44.650
<v Speaker 6>I could have planned my training </v>
<v Speaker 6>otherwise,</v>

2127
01:28:44.651 --> 01:28:49.651
<v Speaker 6>but now I kind of have to like scramble </v>
<v Speaker 6>to get my second workout in and then it </v>

2128
01:28:49.651 --> 01:28:49.651
<v Speaker 6>affected me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

2129
01:28:49.651 --> 01:28:51.280
<v Speaker 6>his decision did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it probably is actually,</v>

2130
01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't made any more money in the </v>

2131
01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:56.600
<v Speaker 6>sport yet because of Connor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people like to like,</v>

2132
01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:59.881
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you must have got a bigger payday </v>

2133
01:28:59.881 --> 01:28:59.881
<v Speaker 6>because I last,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2134
01:28:59.881 --> 01:29:02.041
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I wasn't the champion so I </v>

2135
01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:02.041
<v Speaker 6>didn't get any more of like get any </v>
<v Speaker 6>paper views.</v>

2136
01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:04.350
<v Speaker 6>I get any more money and now he's like </v>
<v Speaker 6>not on this fight card.</v>

2137
01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:05.910
<v Speaker 6>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2138
01:29:05.911 --> 01:29:06.840
<v Speaker 6>but it's whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2139
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.690
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's connors deal and uh,</v>

2140
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:10.200
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't hate connor,</v>

2141
01:29:10.201 --> 01:29:12.900
<v Speaker 6>but I'm going to say how I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2142
01:29:12.901 --> 01:29:14.250
<v Speaker 6>And I would say it if he was sitting </v>
<v Speaker 6>here too.</v>

2143
01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

2144
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:16.920
<v Speaker 6>why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You probably,</v>

2145
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:22.640
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's a bunch of issues </v>
<v Speaker 4>here and we are the only way to really </v>

2146
01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:27.051
<v Speaker 4>get a firm understanding of it is to sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>down with everyone involved and say what</v>

2147
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:30.210
<v Speaker 4>was communicated your manager?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he know what the,</v>

2148
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:33.000
<v Speaker 4>what the appearance schedule was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be like?</v>

2149
01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:35.310
<v Speaker 4>Did you guys agree to this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you understand what you were getting</v>

2150
01:29:35.311 --> 01:29:37.260
<v Speaker 4>into when you were fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a misunderstanding,</v>

2151
01:29:37.261 --> 01:29:38.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

2152
01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:43.370
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the way he went about it was </v>

2153
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:43.660
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like saying I'm retired,</v>

2154
01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:45.840
<v Speaker 4>thanks for the cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then saying I'm not retired.</v>

2155
01:29:45.841 --> 01:29:50.080
<v Speaker 4>And then saying I'm glad the UFC decided</v>
<v Speaker 4>to give the fans what they want and be,</v>

2156
01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be on UFC 200 numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2157
01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:57.810
<v Speaker 4>And so like what he's doing is he's kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like using the media to try to get </v>

2158
01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:04.611
<v Speaker 4>this thing to pass through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't understand Dana and </v>

2159
01:30:04.611 --> 01:30:07.250
<v Speaker 4>Lorenzo and frank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's never going to work.</v>

2160
01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're either in or you're not in like.</v>

2161
01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:14.730
<v Speaker 4>And they're like real clear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to set a precedent.</v>

2162
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.760
<v Speaker 4>So like if you say fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing media that kind of go oh </v>

2163
01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:19.760
<v Speaker 4>well okay fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not fighting,</v>

2164
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.070
<v Speaker 4>but hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm conor mcgregor where the UFC,</v>

2165
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:24.450
<v Speaker 4>this is what it is.</v>

2166
01:30:25.090 --> 01:30:26.890
<v Speaker 6>My name is Doris,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't make many more</v>

2167
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.730
<v Speaker 4>and we might lose millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're not on UFC 200.</v>

2168
01:30:29.770 --> 01:30:31.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well he,</v>

2169
01:30:31.630 --> 01:30:32.620
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had put,</v>

2170
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:37.830
<v Speaker 6>they put 10 million ended up promoting </v>
<v Speaker 6>this Saturday 10 million and he's like </v>

2171
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.830
<v Speaker 6>we're way over budget,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

2172
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:42.031
<v Speaker 6>So that's why I was like you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 6>show up and do you know that's how </v>

2173
01:30:42.031 --> 01:30:45.661
<v Speaker 6>connor was made is through that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So now like at what point do you get to </v>

2174
01:30:45.661 --> 01:30:47.080
<v Speaker 6>decide that you don't have to do that </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore?</v>

2175
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:49.630
<v Speaker 6>Like if that's what made you who you are</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I mean don't,</v>

2176
01:30:49.631 --> 01:30:52.750
<v Speaker 6>you kind of have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does that make sense what I'm saying?</v>

2177
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:56.930
<v Speaker 6>I mean at what point do you get to </v>
<v Speaker 6>decide like when you don't have to like,</v>

2178
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:59.380
<v Speaker 6>like I use the machine and now like I </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't,</v>

2179
01:30:59.381 --> 01:31:01.030
<v Speaker 6>I just want to hop off now that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

2180
01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:06.570
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you kind of have to keep it the same </v>

2181
01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:06.570
<v Speaker 6>boys?</v>

2182
01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:08.230
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is also like a fine line,</v>

2183
01:31:08.231 --> 01:31:09.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can do too much.</v>

2184
01:31:09.461 --> 01:31:14.461
<v Speaker 4>Like when I was watching the Jose Aldo </v>
<v Speaker 4>media tour when they were going all </v>

2185
01:31:14.461 --> 01:31:14.470
<v Speaker 4>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2186
01:31:14.471 --> 01:31:19.471
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that you want to promote </v>

2187
01:31:19.471 --> 01:31:19.471
<v Speaker 4>this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2188
01:31:19.471 --> 01:31:22.780
<v Speaker 4>but how much of this is helping the </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual fight itself and then how much of</v>

2189
01:31:22.781 --> 01:31:27.781
<v Speaker 4>it is just conor mcgregor constantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking Shit at press conferences and </v>

2190
01:31:27.781 --> 01:31:31.141
<v Speaker 4>grabbing the belt and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That mean that's really kind of selling </v>

2191
01:31:31.141 --> 01:31:31.141
<v Speaker 4>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that.</v>

2192
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:33.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did a lot of it,</v>

2193
01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.190
<v Speaker 4>but apparently connor was sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was like,</v>

2194
01:31:36.191 --> 01:31:39.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm just constantly fighting off a cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>is really hard to get in shape.</v>

2195
01:31:39.281 --> 01:31:44.281
<v Speaker 4>Really hard to train because every week </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you're traveling from here to </v>

2196
01:31:44.281 --> 01:31:48.001
<v Speaker 4>there and they already here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just you're constantly getting </v>

2197
01:31:48.001 --> 01:31:48.001
<v Speaker 4>beaten down and you know what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>if I give you ever.</v>

2198
01:31:48.190 --> 01:31:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever flown into Brazil and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fought?</v>

2199
01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:52.150
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fall in there for fight cards though.</v>

2200
01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.120
<v Speaker 4>What is the furthest you've ever had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>flight of fight?</v>

2201
01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:56.710
<v Speaker 4>Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan.</v>

2202
01:31:56.711 --> 01:31:59.050
<v Speaker 4>So that's an interesting one because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a long flight,</v>

2203
01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 4>like 16 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2204
01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:01.520
<v Speaker 3>What is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2205
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:06.080
<v Speaker 3>like adjusting and then competing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to</v>

2206
01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:11.420
<v Speaker 6>started adjusting my schedule at home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like black and white windows a little </v>

2207
01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:11.420
<v Speaker 6>bit or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like to,</v>

2208
01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:13.230
<v Speaker 6>to make the timeframe but you'd never </v>
<v Speaker 6>get fully adjusted.</v>

2209
01:32:13.231 --> 01:32:14.800
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my mind frame is like when,</v>

2210
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:16.950
<v Speaker 6>when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when fight time comes,</v>

2211
01:32:16.951 --> 01:32:19.510
<v Speaker 6>whether it's two in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my time or not like I'm going to be game</v>

2212
01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:22.500
<v Speaker 6>so I would just look at it that way but </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not fun.</v>

2213
01:32:22.501 --> 01:32:26.430
<v Speaker 6>Like I remember three weeks out from my </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight with Retina Chi,</v>

2214
01:32:26.490 --> 01:32:31.490
<v Speaker 6>which I didn't even want to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want to do that fight because </v>

2215
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.490
<v Speaker 6>she was so unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was undefeated.</v>

2216
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:35.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm going over there to fight on a newly</v>
<v Speaker 6>blooming fight pass and I was like,</v>

2217
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:37.980
<v Speaker 6>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>feels like it does nothing for me.</v>

2218
01:32:37.981 --> 01:32:39.930
<v Speaker 6>And like if she wins it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>springboards her,</v>

2219
01:32:39.931 --> 01:32:44.931
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then she'll be 17 and no shove a judo </v>

2220
01:32:44.931 --> 01:32:44.931
<v Speaker 6>background.</v>

2221
01:32:44.931 --> 01:32:44.931
<v Speaker 6>They're going to want to make that fight</v>
<v Speaker 6>for,</v>

2222
01:32:44.931 --> 01:32:49.290
<v Speaker 6>for her and Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that's what they're trying to do </v>

2223
01:32:49.290 --> 01:32:49.290
<v Speaker 6>is they're trying to use,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2224
01:32:49.290 --> 01:32:50.850
<v Speaker 6>business use me as that springboard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like I don't really want to use but</v>

2225
01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:56.240
<v Speaker 6>I did it but three weeks before the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight they had me fly to Japan to do </v>

2226
01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.950
<v Speaker 6>some promotional stuff and I was flying </v>
<v Speaker 6>longer than I was even on the ground and</v>

2227
01:32:58.951 --> 01:33:02.100
<v Speaker 6>they said like ticket sales went up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything was really good.</v>

2228
01:33:02.101 --> 01:33:03.960
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was exhausting.</v>

2229
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:05.340
<v Speaker 6>So I do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand that before.</v>

2230
01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:06.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's hard.</v>

2231
01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:09.150
<v Speaker 6>Really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really hard.</v>

2232
01:33:09.151 --> 01:33:14.151
<v Speaker 6>Ramping it up three weeks in super hard </v>
<v Speaker 6>and after my fight with holly I got to </v>

2233
01:33:14.161 --> 01:33:19.161
<v Speaker 6>spend a little time in Australia and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then I went straight from Australia to </v>

2234
01:33:19.161 --> 01:33:19.161
<v Speaker 6>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Spent a day there,</v>

2235
01:33:19.161 --> 01:33:22.710
<v Speaker 6>did a full day of media,</v>
<v Speaker 6>went to Connecticut to espn,</v>

2236
01:33:22.711 --> 01:33:24.210
<v Speaker 6>did a full day of media,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what to Toronto,</v>

2237
01:33:24.211 --> 01:33:29.211
<v Speaker 6>did a full day media and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's non stop from like you start your </v>

2238
01:33:29.881 --> 01:33:32.940
<v Speaker 6>first interview at eight in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 6>so you have to pick up at like seven and</v>

2239
01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:37.941
<v Speaker 6>you go until seven at night and even </v>
<v Speaker 6>while you're driving to the next place </v>

2240
01:33:37.951 --> 01:33:39.120
<v Speaker 6>they'll have you on the phone.</v>

2241
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.820
<v Speaker 6>Was with the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the,</v>

2242
01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:41.660
<v Speaker 6>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2243
01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:43.200
<v Speaker 6>with a radio interview,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2244
01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:45.200
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's no break.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all,</v>

2245
01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.920
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty intense.</v>

2246
01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.900
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty exhausting.</v>

2247
01:33:48.901 --> 01:33:51.750
<v Speaker 6>So I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been in those shoes before.</v>

2248
01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:53.790
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2249
01:33:53.791 --> 01:33:54.780
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2250
01:33:54.781 --> 01:33:57.150
<v Speaker 6>maybe there's more extended research.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe he was hurt or something.</v>

2251
01:33:57.151 --> 01:33:59.850
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you didn't want people to see like</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe I don't know,</v>

2252
01:33:59.851 --> 01:34:01.350
<v Speaker 6>like what if there's even something like</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2253
01:34:01.351 --> 01:34:06.351
<v Speaker 6>Like what if he had hurt himself or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something and he didn't want nate to </v>

2254
01:34:06.351 --> 01:34:06.351
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>

2255
01:34:06.351 --> 01:34:06.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2256
01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2257
01:34:07.681 --> 01:34:12.681
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he also had to realize there was a lot </v>

2258
01:34:12.681 --> 01:34:12.681
<v Speaker 3>of work that needed to be done to beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>nate.</v>

2259
01:34:12.681 --> 01:34:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's hitting eight with some of his</v>

2260
01:34:14.731 --> 01:34:18.870
<v Speaker 3>best shots and nate was fine with it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a real problem.</v>

2261
01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:24.380
<v Speaker 6>That's more what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that he was just obsessed with </v>

2262
01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:24.380
<v Speaker 6>beating nay and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get that too.</v>

2263
01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:25.380
<v Speaker 6>I don't take that away from him for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>minute.</v>

2264
01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:30.410
<v Speaker 6>Like he wanted to stay home and.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or he was in Iceland I guess training </v>

2265
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.780
<v Speaker 6>and he wants to train to be nate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

2266
01:34:31.170 --> 01:34:32.040
<v Speaker 6>Totally get it.</v>

2267
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it too.</v>

2268
01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:36.200
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the only way also I felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

2269
01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.880
<v Speaker 3>But then again he could have brought us </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole gym with him,</v>

2270
01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:38.810
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2271
01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:44.170
<v Speaker 3>We could have tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was going to be a difficult </v>

2272
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:46.550
<v Speaker 3>time just trying to find the moments to </v>
<v Speaker 3>train and to stay in shape.</v>

2273
01:34:46.551 --> 01:34:49.500
<v Speaker 3>And then obviously being exhausted from </v>
<v Speaker 3>flying and all that jazz</v>

2274
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:52.330
<v Speaker 6>turnaround too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2275
01:34:52.331 --> 01:34:54.370
<v Speaker 6>like as far as.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I don't think he was supposed to be</v>

2276
01:34:54.371 --> 01:34:56.080
<v Speaker 6>there more than like two days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I</v>

2277
01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>honestly think he's better off not doing</v>

2278
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think he's better off like </v>

2279
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:04.940
<v Speaker 4>sequestering himself for a few months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really focusing on what went wrong,</v>

2280
01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:07.520
<v Speaker 4>how to correct it and can you correct </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2281
01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:12.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you like when it comes to the ground </v>

2282
01:35:12.730 --> 01:35:13.010
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I saw on the ground,</v>

2283
01:35:13.011 --> 01:35:13.730
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

2284
01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.130
<v Speaker 4>this is a long road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you've got a long road to beat.</v>

2285
01:35:16.131 --> 01:35:20.240
<v Speaker 4>A guy like nate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so much further along in,</v>

2286
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.900
<v Speaker 4>in and ground and pound Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>positioning everything.</v>

2287
01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:26.780
<v Speaker 4>When I was watching nate beat them up on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground and choke him,</v>

2288
01:35:26.781 --> 01:35:27.410
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

2289
01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:33.190
<v Speaker 4>That happened quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not like Weidman and rockhold </v>

2290
01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:37.070
<v Speaker 4>was a prolonged beating before rockhold </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually stopped him the next round.</v>

2291
01:35:37.071 --> 01:35:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with why with nate and connor wasn't</v>

2292
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:46.150
<v Speaker 4>that prolonged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happened pretty quickly and when you </v>

2293
01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:46.150
<v Speaker 4>see that you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

2294
01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:48.830
<v Speaker 4>this is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot to overcome.</v>

2295
01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.360
<v Speaker 4>It's not unsurmountable takes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times the skill sets,</v>

2296
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:53.750
<v Speaker 4>they don't just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't come overnight.</v>

2297
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:56.240
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can pick up your cardio pretty quick.</v>

2298
01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:57.650
<v Speaker 4>You can do a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

2299
01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:03.100
<v Speaker 4>you can't build a skill set any faster </v>
<v Speaker 4>than it's going to go through your </v>

2300
01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.920
<v Speaker 4>muscle memory and being Rep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to put thousands of reps in </v>

2301
01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 4>and there's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>

2302
01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:08.330
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to fast forward through </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2303
01:36:08.331 --> 01:36:11.120
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to cut the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no right.</v>

2304
01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:12.980
<v Speaker 4>You can't just repetition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>repetition,</v>

2305
01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:17.981
<v Speaker 4>repetition would also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It highlights all the various eccentric </v>

2306
01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:19.460
<v Speaker 4>aspects of your training that people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2307
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this what makes connor great?</v>

2308
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:22.250
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

2309
01:36:22.251 --> 01:36:23.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nate calling it touch button,</v>

2310
01:36:23.691 --> 01:36:25.130
<v Speaker 4>the park,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the dude,</v>

2311
01:36:25.150 --> 01:36:29.300
<v Speaker 4>all these cartwheels and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then video is so funny.</v>

2312
01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:30.950
<v Speaker 4>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2313
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:32.990
<v Speaker 4>I was dying laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clarius.</v>

2314
01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:38.320
<v Speaker 4>So when this all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know he's doing all these work with </v>

2315
01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:42.851
<v Speaker 4>this movement guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you see what happens when it </v>

2316
01:36:42.851 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 4>actually comes to fighting skills and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

2317
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:49.990
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe this is not the way to do it </v>

2318
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:52.990
<v Speaker 4>because like I've talked to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that were like this stuff that </v>

2319
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:55.010
<v Speaker 4>he's doing his utter horse shit like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2320
01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Doing cartwheels and being obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>

2321
01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:59.330
<v Speaker 4>Here's the movements you need to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried about.</v>

2322
01:36:59.331 --> 01:37:00.830
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moving your feet,</v>

2323
01:37:00.831 --> 01:37:05.831
<v Speaker 4>throwing kicks and punches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take down defense and Jujitsu on the </v>

2324
01:37:05.831 --> 01:37:05.831
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2325
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding takedowns yourself,</v>

2326
01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.890
<v Speaker 4>taking people down if you must,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trip sweeps,</v>

2327
01:37:09.891 --> 01:37:14.891
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But all this cart wheels and what this </v>

2328
01:37:14.891 --> 01:37:18.380
<v Speaker 4>guy was explaining to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to name any names because </v>

2329
01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:18.380
<v Speaker 4>they're prominent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

2330
01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:22.390
<v Speaker 4>you have to understand that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>limited amount of energy you have in </v>

2331
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:26.051
<v Speaker 4>your time training and you are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect at all of these other aspects of</v>

2332
01:37:26.721 --> 01:37:27.200
<v Speaker 4>mma.</v>

2333
01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:29.510
<v Speaker 4>So if you are not perfect all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>other aspects of,</v>

2334
01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:30.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>may you have to say,</v>

2335
01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:31.850
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much.</v>

2336
01:37:31.851 --> 01:37:36.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of this stuff is going to help </v>

2337
01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:36.851
<v Speaker 4>me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will a guy like George St Pierre,</v>

2338
01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:38.840
<v Speaker 4>he looked at gymnastics and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what's going to help me because</v>

2339
01:37:38.841 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 4>I can be stronger physically and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>no better way.</v>

2340
01:37:42.531 --> 01:37:46.220
<v Speaker 4>I think like as far as like manipulating</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body than gymnastics,</v>

2341
01:37:46.221 --> 01:37:49.030
<v Speaker 4>like doing the rings and developing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception.</v>

2342
01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:54.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're learning how to manipulate your </v>

2343
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:56.201
<v Speaker 4>body and all kinds of contorted </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions being upside down and </v>

2344
01:37:56.201 --> 01:37:56.201
<v Speaker 4>understanding where you are</v>

2345
01:37:56.201 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 6>when you're upside down and where you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be with the momentum you have.</v>

2346
01:37:59.281 --> 01:38:04.281
<v Speaker 6>You have to calculate that your mouth is</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing constant algorithms and math </v>

2347
01:38:04.281 --> 01:38:07.260
<v Speaker 6>equations essentially when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting to weight distribution where we</v>

2348
01:38:07.261 --> 01:38:12.261
<v Speaker 6>are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when you tie up with someone </v>

2349
01:38:12.261 --> 01:38:13.701
<v Speaker 6>else and you have to feel their way and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to manipulate it in a way to </v>

2350
01:38:13.701 --> 01:38:14.460
<v Speaker 6>get it where you want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's against the cage or whether</v>

2351
01:38:14.461 --> 01:38:18.390
<v Speaker 6>it's on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your body is using a equation.</v>

2352
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:24.250
<v Speaker 6>You know your mind is equating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how much force do I need to make this </v>

2353
01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 6>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How little forest?</v>

2354
01:38:25.051 --> 01:38:27.600
<v Speaker 6>Like what if I go the opposite direction</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they're pushing into me.</v>

2355
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:30.960
<v Speaker 6>There's all these different things that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to over.</v>

2356
01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:36.050
<v Speaker 6>There's no other way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then then a trial and error process and </v>

2357
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.050
<v Speaker 6>over and over and over and over again.</v>

2358
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you look at someone who's like </v>

2359
01:38:41.530 --> 01:38:42.790
<v Speaker 3>really good at one aspect of MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Yoel Romero who is just a </v>

2360
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:44.270
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you go,</v>

2361
01:38:44.271 --> 01:38:46.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how much touch button the park.</v>

2362
01:38:46.041 --> 01:38:49.640
<v Speaker 3>Is that guy doing cartwheels?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he doing?</v>

2363
01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Is he tumbling?</v>

2364
01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:55.840
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I bet you he does 100 double eggs a </v>

2365
01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:55.910
<v Speaker 6>day at least.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2366
01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.790
<v Speaker 6>he's doing all kinds of legs and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>100 body locks.</v>

2367
01:38:58.800 --> 01:38:59.420
<v Speaker 6>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2368
01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:01.870
<v Speaker 3>connor lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like,</v>

2369
01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:03.880
<v Speaker 3>this is what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need a movement coach.</v>

2370
01:39:04.210 --> 01:39:05.170
<v Speaker 3>I need to move in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coach,</v>

2371
01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it still might.</v>

2372
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:07.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean as</v>

2373
01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:11.480
<v Speaker 6>George St Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it has massive benefits to get that kind</v>

2374
01:39:11.481 --> 01:39:12.860
<v Speaker 6>of coordination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Physical strength.</v>

2375
01:39:12.861 --> 01:39:15.610
<v Speaker 6>Do you like about connor though?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is like um,</v>

2376
01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:20.620
<v Speaker 6>his balance is impeccable and that could</v>
<v Speaker 6>be part of that and like he is never </v>

2377
01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:23.740
<v Speaker 6>over himself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least with the striking part of it in</v>

2378
01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:25.820
<v Speaker 6>the ground is a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2379
01:39:25.821 --> 01:39:28.850
<v Speaker 6>But when he's in striking range and it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>just his body,</v>

2380
01:39:28.851 --> 01:39:33.080
<v Speaker 6>his eye hand coordination is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And his balance,</v>

2381
01:39:33.081 --> 01:39:36.440
<v Speaker 6>like he's never too far over a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's never too far back.</v>

2382
01:39:36.441 --> 01:39:39.080
<v Speaker 6>He's always centered,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's always centered,</v>

2383
01:39:39.081 --> 01:39:40.700
<v Speaker 6>he throws a kick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he never gets,</v>

2384
01:39:40.701 --> 01:39:45.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see people kick and they miss and </v>

2385
01:39:45.701 --> 01:39:45.701
<v Speaker 6>they kinda like stumbled like their </v>
<v Speaker 6>weights off balance or,</v>

2386
01:39:45.701 --> 01:39:49.720
<v Speaker 6>or they kick and even land and even when</v>
<v Speaker 6>they put their foot down it's kind of </v>

2387
01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:49.720
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not a good landing,</v>

2388
01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:53.561
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm not like the world's best </v>

2389
01:39:53.561 --> 01:39:53.561
<v Speaker 6>kicker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when I watched conor do it,</v>

2390
01:39:53.561 --> 01:39:55.820
<v Speaker 6>it's like he kicks or push kicks and </v>
<v Speaker 6>sticks it.</v>

2391
01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:57.440
<v Speaker 6>He is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

2392
01:39:57.610 --> 01:39:58.980
<v Speaker 6>a gymnast in the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2393
01:39:59.070 --> 01:40:00.950
<v Speaker 6>the flip and then they want to just </v>
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

2394
01:40:00.951 --> 01:40:03.500
<v Speaker 6>stick it like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's really,</v>

2395
01:40:03.501 --> 01:40:08.501
<v Speaker 6>really good at that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's where the movement does </v>

2396
01:40:08.501 --> 01:40:08.501
<v Speaker 6>benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

2397
01:40:08.501 --> 01:40:10.790
<v Speaker 6>So then he never is over himself in his </v>
<v Speaker 6>weight distribution but isn't the case</v>

2398
01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:15.940
<v Speaker 3>whenever someone loses though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone always second guess is what </v>

2399
01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.360
<v Speaker 3>they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if what they were doing was getting</v>

2400
01:40:17.361 --> 01:40:20.480
<v Speaker 3>them to be like 16 and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally undefeated world champion.</v>

2401
01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:25.960
<v Speaker 3>When you'd make a mistake or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes wrong or something goes right for </v>

2402
01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:30.431
<v Speaker 3>your opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should probably say immediately </v>

2403
01:40:30.431 --> 01:40:30.431
<v Speaker 3>people start questioning everything you </v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

2404
01:40:30.431 --> 01:40:31.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely all the time.</v>

2405
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.620
<v Speaker 6>I mean it happened with me when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2406
01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.330
<v Speaker 6>when I lost to Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that guy,</v>

2407
01:40:35.331 --> 01:40:36.830
<v Speaker 6>you got to change this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotta change everything,</v>

2408
01:40:36.831 --> 01:40:38.000
<v Speaker 6>but as long as you're winning people </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2409
01:40:38.001 --> 01:40:43.001
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>keep doing what you're doing and it's </v>

2410
01:40:43.001 --> 01:40:43.001
<v Speaker 6>working,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then he loses it,</v>

2411
01:40:43.001 --> 01:40:43.430
<v Speaker 6>like change everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2412
01:40:43.431 --> 01:40:44.840
<v Speaker 6>Jeez,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was quick.</v>

2413
01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's also the Rhonda criticism in the </v>

2414
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 3>Holly Holm fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was like looking at her like a</v>

2415
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:52.420
<v Speaker 3>dominating Betco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heyo would stand up,</v>

2416
01:40:52.690 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm beating</v>

2417
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.040
<v Speaker 4>Sarah Mcmahon and the way she did Alexis</v>
<v Speaker 4>Davis beating her down the way she did </v>

2418
01:40:59.040 --> 01:40:59.040
<v Speaker 4>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll look.</v>

2419
01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.240
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda obviously is getting so good at </v>
<v Speaker 4>striking,</v>

2420
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:06.250
<v Speaker 4>so just such an elite athlete that she </v>
<v Speaker 4>can do what she's doing to anybody and </v>

2421
01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:10.711
<v Speaker 4>then her trainer saying that she could </v>
<v Speaker 4>go box women professionals and knock </v>

2422
01:41:10.711 --> 01:41:14.281
<v Speaker 4>them out and so you get this thing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your head that you can do what you have </v>

2423
01:41:14.281 --> 01:41:16.990
<v Speaker 4>been doing and then you fight someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>like holly and you go,</v>

2424
01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:17.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2425
01:41:17.501 --> 01:41:19.480
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2426
01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:21.790
<v Speaker 4>there's a leather sole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many levels.</v>

2427
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:26.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the more fascinating things </v>

2428
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:26.990
<v Speaker 4>about martial arts is that there are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many levels.</v>

2429
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's never.</v>

2430
01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:32.290
<v Speaker 2>It's never ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never ending story really is,</v>

2431
01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:33.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Is this a song that I ever just goes on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2433
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2434
01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:41.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's literally,</v>

2435
01:41:41.501 --> 01:41:45.190
<v Speaker 2>it's you never injected when you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have it all figured out.</v>

2436
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There goes the curve ball.</v>

2437
01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what's addicting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sport though.</v>

2438
01:41:49.101 --> 01:41:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Like it's safe to say it's like a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2439
01:41:50.991 --> 01:41:54.370
<v Speaker 2>it's addicting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think adversity in some weird way.</v>

2440
01:41:54.371 --> 01:41:59.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely addicted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it when things seem </v>

2441
01:41:59.371 --> 01:42:02.470
<v Speaker 2>insurmountable or their look too hard or</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people don't believe that I can do</v>

2442
01:42:02.471 --> 01:42:02.680
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2443
01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.130
<v Speaker 4>That's such a weird quality because most</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have the opposite.</v>

2444
01:42:06.131 --> 01:42:08.260
<v Speaker 4>Most people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it when I know I can take a nap.</v>

2445
01:42:08.710 --> 01:42:11.140
<v Speaker 4>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it when that couch looks soft and</v>

2446
01:42:11.141 --> 01:42:12.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna walk over there and plop </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself down.</v>

2447
01:42:12.911 --> 01:42:14.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

2448
01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to run up that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain with no air.</v>

2449
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:20.980
<v Speaker 4>See how I see how long I could go before</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pass out.</v>

2450
01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Weird quality.</v>

2451
01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2452
01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird,</v>

2453
01:42:25.741 --> 01:42:28.980
<v Speaker 2>but I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno like that about myself because I</v>

2454
01:42:28.981 --> 01:42:31.410
<v Speaker 2>know anytime I ever get into a hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation about,</v>

2455
01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.810
<v Speaker 2>about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I can get through it.</v>

2456
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen worse,</v>

2457
01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:35.840
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2458
01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:38.770
<v Speaker 4>Well you definitely have proven that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt about it.</v>

2459
01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:43.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you've proven it inside the octagon </v>

2460
01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:44.080
<v Speaker 4>just leading up to this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously he proved it in this fight,</v>

2461
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 4>but you proved it leading up to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2462
01:42:45.401 --> 01:42:50.401
<v Speaker 4>Like the Sara Mcmann fight I think was </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of your most impressive fights </v>

2463
01:42:50.401 --> 01:42:53.670
<v Speaker 4>because you got her down and you were me</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's a fucking silver medalist in </v>

2464
01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:55.690
<v Speaker 4>the Olympics and you were dominating the</v>
<v Speaker 4>top position.</v>

2465
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.860
<v Speaker 4>You out scrambled or you stayed on top </v>
<v Speaker 4>of her and beat her down and I was like,</v>

2466
01:42:59.861 --> 01:43:01.660
<v Speaker 4>that is it does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big victory.</v>

2467
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:03.610
<v Speaker 4>Heavy top game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do.</v>

2468
01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.190
<v Speaker 4>We should grapple sometime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2469
01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:09.130
<v Speaker 4>Well I'm scared now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Girls say we should grapple sometimes.</v>

2470
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:11.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But always gets odd.</v>

2471
01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>

2472
01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.460
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you do.</v>

2473
01:43:15.461 --> 01:43:15.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2474
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:21.350
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to wrestling and I think just </v>

2475
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.690
<v Speaker 2>experience and knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2476
01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.800
<v Speaker 2>wrestling can translate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of sports can translate well into </v>

2477
01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:27.800
<v Speaker 2>two mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marsha,</v>

2478
01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.610
<v Speaker 2>I happen to think wrestling is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best translations,</v>

2479
01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:34.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to like someone typically </v>

2480
01:43:34.670 --> 01:43:35.490
<v Speaker 2>boxers coming into the sport don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>typically transition as well.</v>

2481
01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Kickboxers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2482
01:43:36.421 --> 01:43:41.421
<v Speaker 2>because they have so much more to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the fundamentals of </v>

2483
01:43:41.421 --> 01:43:41.421
<v Speaker 2>wrestling kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2484
01:43:41.421 --> 01:43:46.030
<v Speaker 2>they encompass a lot of what you need in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma and if you are the better wrestler </v>

2485
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you can decide do I want to stay on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeder?</v>

2486
01:43:46.601 --> 01:43:49.320
<v Speaker 2>I want to take it to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dictates what dictates.</v>

2487
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.720
<v Speaker 2>So with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2488
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.980
<v Speaker 6>I think I learned how to use the pieces </v>
<v Speaker 6>that work for wrestling and MMA and take</v>

2489
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:02.471
<v Speaker 6>out the ones that don't because there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of stuff in the wrestling or any </v>

2490
01:44:02.471 --> 01:44:05.351
<v Speaker 6>other sport that you're going to bring </v>
<v Speaker 6>over the doesn't work from because I'm </v>

2491
01:44:05.351 --> 01:44:07.510
<v Speaker 6>amazed the sport of its own.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think maybe like Mcmahon Ha,</v>

2492
01:44:07.610 --> 01:44:12.610
<v Speaker 6>like she's such an elite level wrestler </v>
<v Speaker 6>that she's so ingrained with just </v>

2493
01:44:12.610 --> 01:44:12.710
<v Speaker 6>wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestle,</v>

2494
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:17.711
<v Speaker 6>wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestle that it's hard sometimes with </v>

2495
01:44:17.711 --> 01:44:18.890
<v Speaker 6>the more elite you are at something to </v>
<v Speaker 6>like water it down again,</v>

2496
01:44:19.130 --> 01:44:24.130
<v Speaker 6>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of what you have to do that </v>

2497
01:44:24.130 --> 01:44:24.130
<v Speaker 6>you have to take pieces out for mixed </v>
<v Speaker 6>martial arts.</v>

2498
01:44:24.130 --> 01:44:25.160
<v Speaker 6>There's some things that you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 6>to do because Oh,</v>

2499
01:44:25.161 --> 01:44:26.480
<v Speaker 6>you got choked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you do that,</v>

2500
01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:28.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you're in wrestling,</v>

2501
01:44:28.251 --> 01:44:29.550
<v Speaker 6>the last thing you want to do is be on </v>
<v Speaker 6>your back.</v>

2502
01:44:29.551 --> 01:44:32.030
<v Speaker 6>So you turn over you and you arch out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you lift your neck.</v>

2503
01:44:32.031 --> 01:44:32.930
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh man,</v>

2504
01:44:32.931 --> 01:44:37.931
<v Speaker 6>if you try to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you try to stand up the way that you </v>

2505
01:44:37.931 --> 01:44:37.931
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A wrestling match,</v>

2506
01:44:37.931 --> 01:44:37.931
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get choked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't do that.</v>

2507
01:44:37.931 --> 01:44:39.140
<v Speaker 6>You've got to keep your Chin tucked and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you've got to hand fight.</v>

2508
01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.780
<v Speaker 6>So there's things that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 6>relearn.</v>

2509
01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.110
<v Speaker 6>And I think when you're such an elite </v>
<v Speaker 6>elitist at something,</v>

2510
01:44:45.111 --> 01:44:46.760
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it's hard to relearn those.</v>

2511
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:49.910
<v Speaker 4>That's very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think you could also use that same</v>

2512
01:44:49.911 --> 01:44:54.911
<v Speaker 4>point where you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>strikers learning takedown defense and </v>

2513
01:44:54.911 --> 01:44:57.050
<v Speaker 4>that like a lot of strikers like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up really straight and you know,</v>

2514
01:44:57.051 --> 01:44:59.870
<v Speaker 4>as soon as they get involved in </v>
<v Speaker 4>exchanges with people,</v>

2515
01:44:59.871 --> 01:45:04.871
<v Speaker 4>they fall into their old striking ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's when a got like George St </v>

2516
01:45:04.871 --> 01:45:06.140
<v Speaker 4>Pierre who was so good at being </v>
<v Speaker 4>unpredictable.</v>

2517
01:45:06.141 --> 01:45:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Like you never knew if he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take you down if he's going to stand for</v>

2518
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:13.510
<v Speaker 6>one of the most flawless fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you say as far as like a game by </v>

2519
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:14.750
<v Speaker 6>sticking a game plan and being </v>
<v Speaker 6>disciplined and we're getting emotional.</v>

2520
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:16.280
<v Speaker 6>Never getting away from the game plan.</v>

2521
01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:21.480
<v Speaker 4>Well in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at during his run and no one </v>

2522
01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.630
<v Speaker 4>keeps her run up forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But during his run,</v>

2523
01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:27.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean he beat everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put in front of him and he fought </v>

2524
01:45:27.930 --> 01:45:30.670
<v Speaker 4>in some incredible fights where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>fought some really,</v>

2525
01:45:30.671 --> 01:45:35.671
<v Speaker 4>really dangerous difficult guys and </v>
<v Speaker 4>manage his way through the water to </v>

2526
01:45:35.671 --> 01:45:38.971
<v Speaker 4>victory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's all you could ever expect </v>

2527
01:45:38.971 --> 01:45:38.971
<v Speaker 4>from a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people will say like,</v>

2528
01:45:38.971 --> 01:45:39.460
<v Speaker 4>oh well here's some of the sites were </v>
<v Speaker 4>boring,</v>

2529
01:45:39.461 --> 01:45:41.860
<v Speaker 4>or he played safety first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Jesus Christ,</v>

2530
01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.980
<v Speaker 4>he fought the killers of the killers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had five rounds and in during those </v>

2531
01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:47.740
<v Speaker 4>five rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2532
01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.230
<v Speaker 4>Carlos Condit head kicks him and drops </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2533
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:52.570
<v Speaker 4>Matt Serra knocked him out and won the </v>
<v Speaker 4>title.</v>

2534
01:45:52.690 --> 01:45:56.530
<v Speaker 4>He's had adversity like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he beat everybody.</v>

2535
01:45:56.990 --> 01:46:01.990
<v Speaker 4>You can't ask for more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you think would happen if </v>

2536
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:05.491
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this mentality that some fans </v>

2537
01:46:05.491 --> 01:46:08.131
<v Speaker 4>want where they want a guy who wants a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bite down his mouthpiece and just swing </v>

2538
01:46:08.131 --> 01:46:09.760
<v Speaker 4>away and like come on seven and hope for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best.</v>

2539
01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:14.820
<v Speaker 4>That's so retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not what martial arts are </v>

2540
01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:14.820
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

2541
01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:18.010
<v Speaker 6>Not One hundred percent people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People sometimes tend to enjoy the </v>

2542
01:46:18.161 --> 01:46:20.800
<v Speaker 6>excitement of amateur fights more </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they're more chaotic.</v>

2543
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:22.030
<v Speaker 6>Like people don't know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>

2544
01:46:22.031 --> 01:46:27.031
<v Speaker 6>So it's just like stick to two people in</v>
<v Speaker 6>there that Kinda know how to throw </v>

2545
01:46:27.031 --> 01:46:30.391
<v Speaker 6>punches and maybe Kinda know how to </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestle and they just go balls to the </v>

2546
01:46:30.391 --> 01:46:33.241
<v Speaker 6>wall because that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all that they know that they're </v>

2547
01:46:33.241 --> 01:46:33.241
<v Speaker 6>confident in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just go as hard as you can.</v>

2548
01:46:33.241 --> 01:46:38.040
<v Speaker 4>It's also like a really good debate </v>
<v Speaker 4>between two very articulate and very </v>

2549
01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:42.911
<v Speaker 4>intelligent people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one is going to get the real upper </v>

2550
01:46:42.911 --> 01:46:45.461
<v Speaker 4>hand real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's gonna be points and </v>

2551
01:46:45.461 --> 01:46:45.620
<v Speaker 4>counterpoints is going to go back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>forth.</v>

2552
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Both guys going to be very well </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepared.</v>

2553
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:49.410
<v Speaker 4>Both women are going to be very well </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepared.</v>

2554
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:53.850
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get like a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>clear winner right away unless something</v>

2555
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:56.030
<v Speaker 4>crazy happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Aldo in Mcgregor,</v>

2556
01:46:56.370 --> 01:47:01.370
<v Speaker 4>like all those just so mad at Mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 4>from all this fucking shit talking he's </v>

2557
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:04.851
<v Speaker 4>been doing for months and months and </v>
<v Speaker 4>months that he just runs at them and </v>

2558
01:47:04.851 --> 01:47:06.960
<v Speaker 4>gets clipped crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For a guy like Aldo,</v>

2559
01:47:07.110 --> 01:47:12.110
<v Speaker 4>that's gotta be maddening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hold the title for nine fucking </v>

2560
01:47:12.110 --> 01:47:12.840
<v Speaker 4>years or however long you held it.</v>

2561
01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:15.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2562
01:47:15.141 --> 01:47:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean any scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although do that.</v>

2563
01:47:16.821 --> 01:47:18.450
<v Speaker 2>He was so emotionally charged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2564
01:47:18.451 --> 01:47:23.451
<v Speaker 2>He was very upset and that just goes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show how much the mind is a powerful </v>

2565
01:47:23.661 --> 01:47:24.170
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you.</v>

2566
01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:27.650
<v Speaker 2>If if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think you can or think you can't,</v>

2567
01:47:27.651 --> 01:47:28.790
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way,</v>

2568
01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:31.130
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really derived from your,</v>

2569
01:47:31.131 --> 01:47:32.180
<v Speaker 2>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2570
01:47:32.181 --> 01:47:37.181
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can have all the skills in the </v>

2571
01:47:37.181 --> 01:47:37.181
<v Speaker 2>world if you don't believe you can do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2572
01:47:37.181 --> 01:47:41.470
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the confidence in your </v>

2573
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.470
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't just interesting.</v>

2574
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Or if someone puts a seed in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2575
01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.510
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like connor,</v>

2576
01:47:44.511 --> 01:47:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I just think that he was so good at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental warfare and you know,</v>

2577
01:47:47.650 --> 01:47:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Josie never had to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

2578
01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:51.060
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like</v>

2579
01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:53.620
<v Speaker 4>he was all respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone that he fought,</v>

2580
01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:55.420
<v Speaker 4>shook his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>respected him.</v>

2581
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:57.730
<v Speaker 4>I realized he's this killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2582
01:47:57.731 --> 01:48:02.731
<v Speaker 4>and he was the reigning featherweight </v>
<v Speaker 4>champion for as long as there was a </v>

2583
01:48:02.731 --> 01:48:03.520
<v Speaker 4>featherweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the first,</v>

2584
01:48:03.521 --> 01:48:08.521
<v Speaker 4>the original.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He held that title for longer than </v>

2585
01:48:08.521 --> 01:48:09.880
<v Speaker 4>anybody and was flawless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he had some amazing fights,</v>

2586
01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:12.790
<v Speaker 4>but he started this show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some chinks in his armor or towards</v>

2587
01:48:12.791 --> 01:48:17.791
<v Speaker 4>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the second fight that he had with </v>

2588
01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:20.971
<v Speaker 4>Chad Mendez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's shit like that was a real war </v>

2589
01:48:20.971 --> 01:48:21.130
<v Speaker 4>and real grueling fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas,</v>

2590
01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:22.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first fight with Mendez,</v>

2591
01:48:22.811 --> 01:48:27.811
<v Speaker 4>he just looks insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked tremendous and stop Mendez </v>

2592
01:48:27.811 --> 01:48:27.811
<v Speaker 4>quick,</v>

2593
01:48:27.811 --> 01:48:30.850
<v Speaker 2>so I think nobody rides for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They train so hard in Brazil to.</v>

2594
01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.510
<v Speaker 2>They're insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt God no.</v>

2595
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And yellow in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2596
01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:38.740
<v Speaker 2>they go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a good saying about training.</v>

2597
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm smarter and not harder sometimes are</v>
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>

2598
01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:43.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually it's working,</v>

2599
01:48:43.751 --> 01:48:47.270
<v Speaker 2>but same thing goes for training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Overtraining is a big thing in this.</v>

2600
01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:52.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad you brought that up because I </v>

2601
01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:53.761
<v Speaker 4>wanted to talk to you about that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had mentioned that in the hallway </v>

2602
01:48:53.761 --> 01:48:53.761
<v Speaker 4>fight he had made sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2603
01:48:53.761 --> 01:48:55.720
<v Speaker 4>we were training for a five round fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>in particular.</v>

2604
01:48:56.110 --> 01:49:01.110
<v Speaker 4>How do you make sure that you are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>peak performance level but you're not </v>

2605
01:49:01.110 --> 01:49:01.300
<v Speaker 4>overtraining?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like who?</v>

2606
01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Who Designs your program?</v>

2607
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2608
01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it depends on athlete </v>
<v Speaker 2>input.</v>

2609
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Does someone can design a program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you show up one day and you're </v>

2610
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:12.150
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be pushing sleds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2611
01:49:12.151 --> 01:49:14.130
<v Speaker 2>or do something heavy and hard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2612
01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're like,</v>

2613
01:49:16.530 --> 01:49:19.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to dial back your feedback.</v>

2614
01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Your heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2615
01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wear like a polar heart rate monitor,</v>

2616
01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I take it in the morning when you wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and all the HRV and see where I'm at.</v>

2617
01:49:26.641 --> 01:49:29.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heart rate variable.</v>

2618
01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically it tells you how,</v>

2619
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:37.910
<v Speaker 2>how your heart is recovering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you first wake up in the </v>

2620
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.910
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2621
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:42.080
<v Speaker 2>from my understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more like the more that your heart </v>

2622
01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.151
<v Speaker 2>is kind of like irregular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe for a better sense of terms means </v>

2623
01:49:44.151 --> 01:49:48.531
<v Speaker 2>that it's responding to things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly if it's kind of sluggish and </v>

2624
01:49:48.531 --> 01:49:51.351
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really reading that kind of quick </v>

2625
01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:51.520
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not,</v>

2626
01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:53.620
<v Speaker 2>then you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is still broken down.</v>

2627
01:49:53.621 --> 01:49:55.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not recovered though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2628
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:58.150
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of looking for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>irregular kind of Bouncy,</v>

2629
01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:00.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a rhythm,</v>

2630
01:50:00.281 --> 01:50:02.740
<v Speaker 2>but there's something that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hrv reads,</v>

2631
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:06.400
<v Speaker 2>not just the heart rate but something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the heart in it and it reads it.</v>

2632
01:50:06.401 --> 01:50:10.090
<v Speaker 2>The heart rate variable and I'm tells </v>
<v Speaker 2>you whether you're actually recovered or</v>

2633
01:50:10.091 --> 01:50:10.390
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2634
01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.710
<v Speaker 4>And who goes over this stuff with you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a?</v>

2635
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2636
01:50:16.730 --> 01:50:18.020
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sports doctor,</v>

2637
01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll go over it with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2638
01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.280
<v Speaker 2>you're basically calling the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2639
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:22.610
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy to read.</v>

2640
01:50:22.611 --> 01:50:24.500
<v Speaker 2>It's either green,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orange or red,</v>

2641
01:50:24.630 --> 01:50:26.840
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in the red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't kill yourself that day.</v>

2642
01:50:26.841 --> 01:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Like it tells you it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2643
01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:29.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very simple.</v>

2644
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A wake up in the morning and if your </v>

2645
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:37.061
<v Speaker 2>heart rate variables in the red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means like there should be a </v>

2646
01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:40.240
<v Speaker 2>relatively easy day either a rest day or</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively easy and maybe should go for </v>

2647
01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.231
<v Speaker 2>a nice run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just let your body recover because </v>

2648
01:50:44.231 --> 01:50:46.040
<v Speaker 2>if you don't realize you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger while you're training,</v>

2649
01:50:46.130 --> 01:50:48.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't get stronger while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights,</v>

2650
01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:52.430
<v Speaker 2>you're actually damaging your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're actually going backwards.</v>

2651
01:50:52.670 --> 01:50:56.540
<v Speaker 2>You get stronger when you're resting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recovering from the work.</v>

2652
01:50:56.541 --> 01:50:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

2653
01:50:58.190 --> 01:51:00.710
<v Speaker 2>That's literally what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is when you're resting,</v>

2654
01:51:00.711 --> 01:51:03.650
<v Speaker 2>after you've worked out hard and after </v>
<v Speaker 2>you tore everything apart.</v>

2655
01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you work out 24 slash seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no chance to repair and heal and</v>

2656
01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:10.400
<v Speaker 2>grow and get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2657
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.110
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just goes back to that,</v>

2658
01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:15.710
<v Speaker 2>that science and that balance of when to</v>
<v Speaker 2>push hard and when to,</v>

2659
01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:19.460
<v Speaker 2>when to not push hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that our sport typically has</v>

2660
01:51:19.461 --> 01:51:23.210
<v Speaker 2>a lot of really tough people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to ever think,</v>

2661
01:51:23.211 --> 01:51:24.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just in that work hard mentality</v>

2662
01:51:24.951 --> 01:51:27.410
<v Speaker 2>because we're fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like the toughest people,</v>

2663
01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.100
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times they don't stop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think like,</v>

2664
01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:32.060
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter how tough you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like science is science buddy,</v>

2665
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2666
01:51:32.801 --> 01:51:33.730
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

2667
01:51:33.731 --> 01:51:35.810
<v Speaker 2>You're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to work out harder.</v>

2668
01:51:35.811 --> 01:51:40.811
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to push through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna spar hard today even though I </v>

2669
01:51:40.811 --> 01:51:40.811
<v Speaker 2>feel like crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2670
01:51:40.811 --> 01:51:42.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's something we said maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>for mental toughness,</v>

2671
01:51:42.231 --> 01:51:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2672
01:51:43.131 --> 01:51:44.810
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go in there and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to push through it.</v>

2673
01:51:44.811 --> 01:51:46.640
<v Speaker 2>There's times for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2674
01:51:46.670 --> 01:51:49.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't question my mental toughness.</v>

2675
01:51:49.851 --> 01:51:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So I just listen to my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2676
01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not at a point in my career where I </v>

2677
01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:56.500
<v Speaker 2>have anything to prove as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>how tough I am.</v>

2678
01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Skins and Misha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my coaches always tell me like,</v>

2679
01:51:58.910 --> 01:52:03.910
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need to approve how tough you </v>

2680
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.910
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Should we already know that?</v>

2681
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.910
<v Speaker 2>So let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2682
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:04.330
<v Speaker 2>if you don't feel like sparring today </v>
<v Speaker 2>was tomorrow.</v>

2683
01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the things</v>

2684
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:11.600
<v Speaker 4>that I think really does trip up a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of fighters is that they're so tough and</v>

2685
01:52:11.601 --> 01:52:16.601
<v Speaker 4>they figure out how to push through </v>
<v Speaker 4>injuries to figure out how to force </v>

2686
01:52:16.601 --> 01:52:19.190
<v Speaker 4>themselves through situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they get these,</v>

2687
01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:23.750
<v Speaker 4>these damage to their joints are damaged</v>
<v Speaker 4>to their back or.</v>

2688
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:28.930
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of it comes from not recognize</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between an actual injury </v>

2689
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:31.880
<v Speaker 4>and pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a little bit of discomfort and pain</v>

2690
01:52:31.881 --> 01:52:33.440
<v Speaker 4>is normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's constant.</v>

2691
01:52:33.441 --> 01:52:38.441
<v Speaker 4>It's never going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody who does martial arts </v>

2692
01:52:38.441 --> 01:52:39.290
<v Speaker 4>experiences that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for someone like Cain Velasquez,</v>

2693
01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:44.500
<v Speaker 4>it almost becomes like a detriment </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's such a fucking gorilla and </v>

2694
01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 4>he just knows how to push through </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that he blows everything out.</v>

2695
01:52:46.251 --> 01:52:48.600
<v Speaker 4>He blows his shoulder out and then he </v>
<v Speaker 4>blows the other shoulder around.</v>

2696
01:52:48.610 --> 01:52:50.840
<v Speaker 4>He his knees out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It blows back out.</v>

2697
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:52.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2698
01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:54.170
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was at his best,</v>

2699
01:52:54.171 --> 01:52:57.340
<v Speaker 4>he's the greatest of all time is between</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and fader.</v>

2700
01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Those are the two possible heavyweights </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fate or one always has to have </v>

2701
01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:06.950
<v Speaker 4>an asterick because he was fighting in </v>
<v Speaker 4>pride and it was,</v>

2702
01:53:06.951 --> 01:53:08.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the steroid era,</v>

2703
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.180
<v Speaker 4>you could do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not saying even that he was on it,</v>

2704
01:53:11.181 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 4>but who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

2705
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:18.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the guys that he fought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though he looked amazing against </v>

2706
01:53:18.370 --> 01:53:22.421
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think Hong Man Choi is at the </v>

2707
01:53:22.421 --> 01:53:25.151
<v Speaker 4>same level as like junior dos Santos </v>
<v Speaker 4>when junior dos Santos was at his best </v>

2708
01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:27.020
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when cain fought them.</v>

2709
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:32.200
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think even junior dos Santos was </v>

2710
01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.320
<v Speaker 4>overtrained for one of their fights and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2711
01:53:33.321 --> 01:53:35.690
<v Speaker 4>they talked about it like they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>measured his,</v>

2712
01:53:35.691 --> 01:53:36.770
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

2713
01:53:36.771 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>creatine levels in his blood and he was,</v>

2714
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:41.360
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just hadn't recovered correctly.</v>

2715
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

2716
01:53:42.210 --> 01:53:44.220
<v Speaker 2>that's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big part of it.</v>

2717
01:53:44.221 --> 01:53:47.150
<v Speaker 2>It's very being so tough because you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go in,</v>

2718
01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:49.180
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a three round fight or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>five round fight,</v>

2719
01:53:49.181 --> 01:53:54.181
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you'll see people gas out like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a round and a half around it and you're </v>

2720
01:53:54.281 --> 01:53:54.820
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2721
01:53:54.821 --> 01:53:56.000
<v Speaker 2>they must not a train hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2722
01:53:56.050 --> 01:53:57.300
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They trained too hard.</v>

2723
01:53:57.490 --> 01:53:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably what it is.</v>

2724
01:53:58.991 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 2>They're probably still beat up </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

2725
01:54:01.221 --> 01:54:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I will go like fight week and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the workout,</v>

2726
01:54:05.110 --> 01:54:10.110
<v Speaker 2>you know the mat room that they have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hotel and sometimes I'll see these </v>

2727
01:54:10.110 --> 01:54:11.950
<v Speaker 2>guys in there and they're just going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are going,</v>

2728
01:54:11.951 --> 01:54:16.951
<v Speaker 2>they're hitting mitts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just ripping the big take downs </v>

2729
01:54:16.951 --> 01:54:19.270
<v Speaker 2>and they're just blowing it all out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like thinking,</v>

2730
01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.640
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fight week calmed down and the hard</v>

2731
01:54:21.641 --> 01:54:26.641
<v Speaker 2>work should have already all been done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this week is about recovery and </v>

2732
01:54:26.641 --> 01:54:31.230
<v Speaker 2>usually it's like people not like </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreigners that are still in that </v>

2733
01:54:31.230 --> 01:54:32.380
<v Speaker 2>mindset of like know they're a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more old school mentality.</v>

2734
01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I feel like some of those gyms still </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't caught up to the.</v>

2735
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:39.040
<v Speaker 2>The idea that it's not always about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard you go.</v>

2736
01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:44.600
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt Hughes told me that he used to </v>

2737
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:44.600
<v Speaker 4>train hard up until the day of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2738
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.040
<v Speaker 4>They just trained hard and he's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>always trained hard and you know,</v>

2739
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:50.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking work though.</v>

2740
01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Worked for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2741
01:54:51.391 --> 01:54:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>

2742
01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a high level athlete for a long </v>

2743
01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:59.380
<v Speaker 2>time and he knew how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to harness what and you know,</v>

2744
01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:01.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not saying that it can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it can't work,</v>

2745
01:55:01.691 --> 01:55:06.691
<v Speaker 2>but I still think that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be said about preserving the </v>

2746
01:55:06.691 --> 01:55:08.560
<v Speaker 2>longevity of your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not be able to do that as long</v>

2747
01:55:09.390 --> 01:55:09.790
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2748
01:55:10.130 --> 01:55:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a guy like Matt Hughes,</v>

2749
01:55:11.841 --> 01:55:16.841
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say that now because he was such a </v>

2750
01:55:16.841 --> 01:55:18.410
<v Speaker 4>pioneer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was at the early,</v>

2751
01:55:18.411 --> 01:55:23.411
<v Speaker 4>early days of the UFC and it was one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the great champions and one of the </v>

2752
01:55:23.411 --> 01:55:27.641
<v Speaker 4>greatest champions ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you look at his title run and </v>

2753
01:55:27.641 --> 01:55:29.680
<v Speaker 4>his reign of 170 pound division,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like during his heyday,</v>

2754
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:34.990
<v Speaker 4>he had to say like this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's sort of paved the way and a </v>

2755
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:36.730
<v Speaker 4>lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially for a wrestler that developed</v>

2756
01:55:36.731 --> 01:55:41.731
<v Speaker 4>some really good submission skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's got some excellent </v>

2757
01:55:41.731 --> 01:55:43.100
<v Speaker 4>submission victories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including that arm bar that he submitted</v>

2758
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:48.110
<v Speaker 4>George St Pierre with mean he had some </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good submission skills for a </v>

2759
01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:48.110
<v Speaker 4>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2760
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:50.400
<v Speaker 4>he's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that it was time a little bit,</v>

2761
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:53.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely ahead of his time.</v>

2762
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:55.890
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an an important pioneer.</v>

2763
01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:58.650
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the overall game like </v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2764
01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:01.950
<v Speaker 4>there's these moments where a person </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerges and they go,</v>

2765
01:56:01.951 --> 01:56:06.951
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we haven't seen one of those guys </v>

2766
01:56:06.951 --> 01:56:06.951
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

2767
01:56:06.951 --> 01:56:06.951
<v Speaker 4>Like Yoyo Rodriguez is a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

2768
01:56:06.951 --> 01:56:09.540
<v Speaker 4>Like this fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched that guy fight and I go,</v>

2769
01:56:09.541 --> 01:56:11.760
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like here's a new thing.</v>

2770
01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:16.940
<v Speaker 4>Here's a guy who's like this elite </v>
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo guy who knows how to do </v>

2771
01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:19.380
<v Speaker 4>everything else too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he throws these taekwondo kicks,</v>

2772
01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.170
<v Speaker 4>like a normal person throws a jab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

2773
01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:24.510
<v Speaker 4>they're a part of his arsenal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's throwing,</v>

2774
01:56:24.511 --> 01:56:29.511
<v Speaker 4>jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roundhouse kicks and we'll kicks and </v>

2775
01:56:29.511 --> 01:56:29.511
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing shit that like,</v>

2776
01:56:29.511 --> 01:56:33.741
<v Speaker 4>you gotta you gotta get ready for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>because this guy's going to do this </v>

2777
01:56:33.741 --> 01:56:35.660
<v Speaker 4>every round and this is a totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>different type of engaging a.</v>

2778
01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:40.680
<v Speaker 4>you've got to be aware of things coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>from all these crazy angles and they're </v>

2779
01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.911
<v Speaker 4>coming fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These wheeled kicks and the jumping </v>

2780
01:56:43.911 --> 01:56:44.490
<v Speaker 4>roundhouse kick did hit a feely with </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2781
01:56:44.491 --> 01:56:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was crazy.</v>

2782
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:47.610
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

2783
01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:51.780
<v Speaker 4>he's one of these new guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's got so much skill.</v>

2784
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:53.560
<v Speaker 6>We used to train with philly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you?</v>

2785
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:58.840
<v Speaker 6>Sacramento were a part of the team Alpha</v>
<v Speaker 6>male and it was funny like he,</v>

2786
01:56:59.650 --> 01:57:04.650
<v Speaker 6>he's come such a long way like he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he used to have for some reason he had </v>

2787
01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 6>like a house arrest thing on his ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the bad things,</v>

2788
01:57:07.201 --> 01:57:08.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>train with it on.</v>

2789
01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.320
<v Speaker 6>He had to trim it that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he did not want to train.</v>

2790
01:57:11.321 --> 01:57:14.110
<v Speaker 6>So I guess he got permission to go to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the gym and I don't know what it was,</v>

2791
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:14.920
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it was for.</v>

2792
01:57:14.921 --> 01:57:16.390
<v Speaker 6>But it's a funny story because it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2793
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:18.790
<v Speaker 6>I just remember him back then and he was</v>
<v Speaker 6>just still like,</v>

2794
01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:24.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was still relatively new to the game </v>

2795
01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:26.191
<v Speaker 6>and now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's doing well and then obviously his </v>

2796
01:57:26.191 --> 01:57:26.191
<v Speaker 6>last loss.</v>

2797
01:57:26.191 --> 01:57:28.790
<v Speaker 4>Well he zigged and zagged and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just what happens in the game.</v>

2798
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got caught and he also fought a guy </v>

2799
01:57:33.850 --> 01:57:35.690
<v Speaker 4>who was one of the elite of the elite </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now at 1:45.</v>

2800
01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:38.060
<v Speaker 4>He's unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wild.</v>

2801
01:57:38.190 --> 01:57:40.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He and his fucking ground game is really</v>

2802
01:57:40.071 --> 01:57:42.110
<v Speaker 4>good to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can do everything.</v>

2803
01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2804
01:57:42.921 --> 01:57:47.921
<v Speaker 4>Something mad he is signed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew he was something but feeling </v>

2805
01:57:47.921 --> 01:57:51.581
<v Speaker 4>something to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a tough fucking kid and I thought </v>

2806
01:57:51.581 --> 01:57:51.581
<v Speaker 4>that was going to be a great fight like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2807
01:57:51.581 --> 01:57:56.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm really interested to see how feeling</v>
<v Speaker 4>navigates the kicks because that's the </v>

2808
01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:59.411
<v Speaker 4>big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he going to try to kick with this </v>

2809
01:57:59.411 --> 01:57:59.411
<v Speaker 4>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he going to try to like.</v>

2810

<v Speaker 4>Valvoline?</v>

2813
01:58:07.090 --> 01:58:12.090

<v Speaker 4>He is a traditional Moy Thai style </v>

2814
01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:15.311
<v Speaker 4>fighter and he just just kept his hands </v>
<v Speaker 4>up high and just chop the legs and </v>

2815
01:58:15.311 --> 01:58:17.510
<v Speaker 4>chopped them down and eventually knocked</v>
<v Speaker 4>them out with a head kick,</v>

2816
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:20.730
<v Speaker 4>but Raymond Daniels is this wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker,</v>

<v Speaker 4>eventually got into kickboxing and he's </v>

2821

<v Speaker 4>to the face where people like that who </v>
<v Speaker 4>can recreate that style to get someone </v>

2824
01:58:45.110 --> 01:58:46.030

<v Speaker 4>You'd have to get a karate or that.</v>

2825
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:49.330
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's all you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2826
01:58:49.630 --> 01:58:54.630

2844
01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:43.920
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't wear shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just puts his fucking feet everywhere </v>

2845
01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:46.261
<v Speaker 4>and it kind of freaks people out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Eddie will sit there and he'll just </v>

2846
01:59:46.261 --> 01:59:49.330
<v Speaker 4>like be like stretching himself up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He'd be sitting watching TV and he'll</v>

2847
01:59:49.331 --> 01:59:54.331
<v Speaker 4>be ready to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he'll be like sitting there and </v>

2848
01:59:54.331 --> 01:59:56.500
<v Speaker 4>it'll hold it and he can do that without</v>
<v Speaker 4>like pulling on it.</v>

2849
01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:01.800
<v Speaker 4>Like he doesn't have to have arms that </v>
<v Speaker 4>pull his legs in these positions so he </v>

2850
02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:05.671
<v Speaker 4>could just tuck his legs in the places </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden you're like locked </v>

2851
02:00:05.671 --> 02:00:09.601
<v Speaker 4>up in a Gogo plot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you don't even know how the fuck he </v>

2852
02:00:09.601 --> 02:00:11.881
<v Speaker 4>got his leg there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I grappled with him once years </v>

2853
02:00:11.881 --> 02:00:12.420
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like retarded.</v>

2854
02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:13.360
<v Speaker 4>Really tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's like,</v>

2855
02:00:13.630 --> 02:00:15.790
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like grappling with the dude.</v>

2856
02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Is that feel good or that.</v>

2857
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always a compliment.</v>

2858
02:00:22.511 --> 02:00:24.370
<v Speaker 2>As long as people don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look like a dude,</v>

2859
02:00:24.371 --> 02:00:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I can grapple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do it all day long.</v>

2860
02:00:25.991 --> 02:00:27.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2861
02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:30.070
<v Speaker 2>never an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dread the day when like I love it when</v>

2862
02:00:30.071 --> 02:00:30.670
<v Speaker 2>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2863
02:00:30.671 --> 02:00:31.690
<v Speaker 2>you don't look like a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2864
02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:32.380
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

2865
02:00:32.381 --> 02:00:37.381
<v Speaker 2>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really dread the day when people </v>

2866
02:00:37.381 --> 02:00:37.381
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2867
02:00:37.381 --> 02:00:37.381
<v Speaker 2>you look like a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2868
02:00:37.381 --> 02:00:38.530
<v Speaker 2>oh whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went too far.</v>

2869
02:00:38.770 --> 02:00:43.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pushed the edge of the envelope and I </v>

2870
02:00:43.770 --> 02:00:45.060
<v Speaker 2>didn't come out on the winning side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The grapple like a dude is isn't okay.</v>

2871
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2872
02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:50.380
<v Speaker 2>you make out like a dude that's not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>

2873
02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Is this conversation going back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2874
02:00:58.290 --> 02:01:03.290
<v Speaker 4>there is a definite difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching some women grapple and what </v>

2875
02:01:04.210 --> 02:01:09.210
<v Speaker 4>some women can do it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This got to be some benefits to like </v>

2876
02:01:09.210 --> 02:01:09.310
<v Speaker 4>being a woman when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>grappling.</v>

2877
02:01:09.370 --> 02:01:10.330
<v Speaker 2>There is sometimes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2878
02:01:10.350 --> 02:01:15.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rappel some guys and I don't realize </v>

2879
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.350
<v Speaker 2>it's much different to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2880
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:16.280
<v Speaker 2>you are so flexible or like you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2881
02:01:16.530 --> 02:01:21.530
<v Speaker 2>your ankles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I try to log and it was like most </v>

2882
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.530
<v Speaker 2>guys would attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was like,</v>

2883
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.530
<v Speaker 2>you were fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2884
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2885
02:01:22.050 --> 02:01:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2886
02:01:22.610 --> 02:01:25.250
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ballerinas used?</v>

2887
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:27.770
<v Speaker 4>And this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a new device,</v>

2888
02:01:27.771 --> 02:01:31.430
<v Speaker 4>but it's like you slide your foot into </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>

2889
02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:33.950
<v Speaker 4>It seems like a rubber sheath has like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2890
02:01:33.951 --> 02:01:38.951
<v Speaker 4>a flat board and they just like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>rubber sheath and you slide your foot </v>

2891
02:01:38.951 --> 02:01:40.550
<v Speaker 4>into and that do these exercises</v>

2892
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:45.550
<v Speaker 3>with your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And somebody put it up on one of the </v>

2893
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu pages that I follow on </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram.</v>

2894
02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:50.740
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the best way to prevent foot </v>

2895
02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:51.440
<v Speaker 3>locks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like literally it just strengthens it,</v>

2896
02:01:51.441 --> 02:01:56.441
<v Speaker 3>strengthens it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stretches it to the point where if </v>

2897
02:01:56.441 --> 02:01:56.441
<v Speaker 3>somebody gets you into like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2898
02:01:56.441 --> 02:02:01.260
<v Speaker 3>a footlocker and they're pushing down </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a toehold in there as they're </v>

2899
02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:02.950
<v Speaker 3>pushing down on your foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the hyper extending of the ankle if</v>

2900
02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.330
<v Speaker 3>it gets you to tap because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2901
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I think someone's going to tear and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people tap and this gets your foot into </v>

2902
02:02:09.501 --> 02:02:14.501
<v Speaker 3>this flexible position where you've kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of strengthen and make it so flexible </v>

2903
02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:17.330
<v Speaker 3>that you can't get tapped in certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

2904
02:02:17.331 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 3>You never tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't Jamie's odors.</v>

2905
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks similar.</v>

2906
02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:25.300
<v Speaker 3>That's similar as pro arch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's it's called?</v>

2907
02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:28.010
<v Speaker 3>That looks like it's making it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>where your feet are like.</v>

2908
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:30.290
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the arch of the Ballerina foot.</v>

2909
02:02:30.291 --> 02:02:32.340
<v Speaker 3>That's probably like strengthening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2910
02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.580
<v Speaker 3>To be able to stand on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that.</v>

2911
02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:37.000
<v Speaker 3>You weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Birkenstocks is brutal.</v>

2912
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 3>The feet feet are so nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so bad.</v>

2913
02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:44.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2914
02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I thought my feet were bad news girl who</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a ballerina,</v>

2915
02:02:46.641 --> 02:02:49.090
<v Speaker 3>and she had to have her feet fixed </v>
<v Speaker 3>because her,</v>

2916
02:02:49.150 --> 02:02:53.660
<v Speaker 3>her toes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had smashed her toes for so long,</v>

2917
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:58.190
<v Speaker 3>like doing like point and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand on their toes that she had to get,</v>

2918
02:02:58.191 --> 02:03:02.150
<v Speaker 3>like she had these scars over the top of</v>
<v Speaker 3>her feet where she had to get her toes,</v>

2919
02:03:02.151 --> 02:03:05.120
<v Speaker 3>like realigned and deter ligaments </v>
<v Speaker 3>repaired.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Valets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hard hard support from,</v>

2921
02:03:08.130 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 3>from my understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't think they get enough </v>

2922
02:03:13.130 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 3>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also have to starve themselves.</v>

<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they had a rule where she's having to </v>

2949
02:04:13.321 --> 02:04:15.810
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the Vietnamese side of her family,</v>

2950
02:04:15.811 --> 02:04:17.790
<v Speaker 2>so she was a little bit bigger bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gorgeous,</v>

2951
02:04:17.791 --> 02:04:19.770
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

2954
02:04:24.450 --> 02:04:28.710
<v Speaker 2>her family was so hard on her because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she weighed over a hundred pounds,</v>

2955
02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:31.890
<v Speaker 2>like you were supposed to be under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be 99 or less because</v>

2956

<v Speaker 2>they're all super tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was half,</v>

2957
02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:35.850
<v Speaker 2>so her aunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got her half of her White Dad's side</v>

2958
02:04:35.851 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 2>and she was like on nine or something</v>

2959
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:39.140
<v Speaker 5>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

2960
02:04:39.170 --> 02:04:40.200
<v Speaker 5>you lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lynn.</v>

2961
02:04:40.410 --> 02:04:41.280
<v Speaker 5>Lynn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you lose weight.</v>

2962
02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:42.960
<v Speaker 5>You too heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Too heavy.</v>

2963
02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:44.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2964
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:45.690
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2965
02:04:45.691 --> 02:04:50.691
<v Speaker 5>And she had just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she got eating disorders and stuff like </v>

2966
02:04:50.691 --> 02:04:50.691
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like later,</v>

2967
02:04:50.691 --> 02:04:52.560
<v Speaker 5>because she was so just mortified that </v>
<v Speaker 5>she weighed more,</v>

2968
02:04:52.561 --> 02:04:54.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't want her to weigh over 100.</v>

2969
02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:55.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's so crazy.</v>

2970
02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:58.580
<v Speaker 5>The number crazy number on things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Numbers.</v>

2971
02:04:58.800 --> 02:04:59.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter to me.</v>

2972
02:04:59.821 --> 02:05:01.830
<v Speaker 5>How do you look if you look good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does it,</v>

2973
02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:04.800
<v Speaker 5>what difference does it make?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like obviously being a fighter,</v>

2974
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.480
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be denser.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2975
02:05:06.481 --> 02:05:09.420
<v Speaker 5>how anybody wouldn't understand that a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman like you,</v>

2976
02:05:09.450 --> 02:05:10.410
<v Speaker 5>what do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five,</v>

2977
02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.220
<v Speaker 5>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

2978
02:05:11.221 --> 02:05:11.960
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

2979
02:05:11.970 --> 02:05:12.810
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

2980
02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:16.050
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>145 pounds.</v>

2981
02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:18.300
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have a ton of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2982
02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:20.340
<v Speaker 5>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're doing all the grappling,</v>

2983
02:05:20.341 --> 02:05:23.460
<v Speaker 5>you're doing what kind of strength and </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditioning program and you on,</v>

2984
02:05:24.370 --> 02:05:25.680
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go usually like two,</v>

2985
02:05:25.690 --> 02:05:30.690
<v Speaker 6>three days a week and I go to this place</v>
<v Speaker 6>called phase one sports and they work </v>

2986
02:05:30.690 --> 02:05:33.751
<v Speaker 6>with a lot of athletes that were the </v>
<v Speaker 6>boxers and football players and things </v>

2987
02:05:33.751 --> 02:05:36.691
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I do like the most that I really do </v>

2988
02:05:36.691 --> 02:05:40.351
<v Speaker 6>for like actual lifting weights is </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably power cleans or like hang </v>

2989
02:05:40.351 --> 02:05:40.351
<v Speaker 6>cleans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

2990
02:05:40.351 --> 02:05:44.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>flip the bar that's I think really good </v>

2991
02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:44.590
<v Speaker 6>explosive movement for um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like for wrestling and things like that.</v>

2992
02:05:45.110 --> 02:05:50.110
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do sled pushing and do a lot of body </v>

2993
02:05:50.110 --> 02:05:50.110
<v Speaker 6>weight stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of footwork and you know,</v>

2994
02:05:50.110 --> 02:05:54.771
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we kind of mix cardio and weight so </v>

2995
02:05:54.771 --> 02:05:57.931
<v Speaker 6>we'll do like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he'll like do one set of the workout </v>

2996
02:05:57.931 --> 02:05:59.050
<v Speaker 6>that's strength based.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's like anaerobic.</v>

2997
02:05:59.110 --> 02:06:02.680
<v Speaker 6>And then we'll run sprints.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So kind of like to simulate a fight.</v>

2998
02:06:02.681 --> 02:06:06.370
<v Speaker 6>Like you're going through a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a combination and it's anaerobic,</v>

2999
02:06:06.371 --> 02:06:11.371
<v Speaker 6>you throwing five,</v>
<v Speaker 6>six punches and you're doing that </v>

3000
02:06:11.371 --> 02:06:11.371
<v Speaker 6>without oxygen.</v>

3001
02:06:11.371 --> 02:06:12.420
<v Speaker 6>Anaerobic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you do something where,</v>

3002
02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:17.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you circle away and you move or </v>

3003
02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:17.440
<v Speaker 6>something that's a robotic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3004
02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:18.010
<v Speaker 6>are you coming for the take down?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of an anaerobic movement.</v>

3005
02:06:18.011 --> 02:06:20.770
<v Speaker 6>And then so it simulates the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we do a lot of,</v>

3006
02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:22.690
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

3007
02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:24.520
<v Speaker 6>it's not really anything super rocket </v>
<v Speaker 6>science,</v>

3008
02:06:24.521 --> 02:06:26.130
<v Speaker 6>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I like it.</v>

3009
02:06:26.131 --> 02:06:31.131
<v Speaker 6>It works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's done a strength and conditioning </v>

3010
02:06:31.131 --> 02:06:31.131
<v Speaker 6>program.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love strength and conditioning and I'm</v>

3011
02:06:31.131 --> 02:06:33.040
<v Speaker 6>in high school and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I lifted a lot of weights.</v>

3012
02:06:33.041 --> 02:06:35.950
<v Speaker 6>I get criticized a lot actually in high </v>
<v Speaker 6>school because I was pretty buff in high</v>

3013
02:06:35.951 --> 02:06:40.951
<v Speaker 6>school and I wrestled and criticized </v>
<v Speaker 6>when girls or boys actually guys mostly </v>

3014
02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:47.400
<v Speaker 6>I think the girls were kind of scared of</v>
<v Speaker 6>me even though I was never </v>

3015
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:47.400
<v Speaker 6>confrontational.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never really fought people.</v>

3016
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:49.990
<v Speaker 6>It was like pretty nice everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm like,</v>

3017
02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:51.610
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the girls are probably like,</v>

3018
02:06:51.611 --> 02:06:54.460
<v Speaker 6>if they knew,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they would mess with me,</v>

3019
02:06:54.461 --> 02:06:56.380
<v Speaker 6>I probably would have wrecked them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

3020
02:06:56.381 --> 02:07:01.381
<v Speaker 6>I was just kinda like passive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was a people watcher and uh,</v>

3021
02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:02.530
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the guys were like,</v>

3022
02:07:02.531 --> 02:07:03.720
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stop lifting.</v>

3023
02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.580
<v Speaker 6>MEESHA getting to buff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like maybe you need to lift more.</v>

3024
02:07:08.710 --> 02:07:11.940
<v Speaker 5>Were you wrestling in high school?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrestled in high school.</v>

3025
02:07:12.090 --> 02:07:14.190
<v Speaker 5>What was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was hard,</v>

3026
02:07:14.191 --> 02:07:19.191
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was actually the first half of my </v>

3027
02:07:19.191 --> 02:07:19.191
<v Speaker 5>season was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you wrestling dudes.</v>

3028
02:07:19.191 --> 02:07:21.540
<v Speaker 5>Are you wrestling girls?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Primarily guys.</v>

3029
02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:26.600
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was the only consistent female on my </v>

3030
02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:30.021
<v Speaker 5>team for four years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck motivated you to go do </v>

3031
02:07:30.021 --> 02:07:30.870
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like wrestling dudes.</v>

3032
02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:33.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3033
02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:34.620
<v Speaker 5>actually that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

3034
02:07:34.621 --> 02:07:36.850
<v Speaker 5>it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my first day.</v>

3035
02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:39.070
<v Speaker 5>My Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I'll get to why I did it.</v>

3036
02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:41.770
<v Speaker 5>I did it because I can't play </v>
<v Speaker 5>basketball.</v>

3037
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:45.730
<v Speaker 5>That was really the reason why I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>

3038
02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:47.450
<v Speaker 5>Did you want to play basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3039
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:52.950
<v Speaker 5>I hate basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's probably why he can't play </v>

3040
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:54.631
<v Speaker 5>basketball because I bet if you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 5>to play basketball you figured out how </v>

3041
02:07:54.631 --> 02:07:55.110
<v Speaker 5>to get really good at basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So don't,</v>

3042
02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:00.200
<v Speaker 5>don't say you can't play basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would have been a long road man.</v>

3043
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't it ever tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's taken a long time as if MMA isn't a</v>

3044
02:08:05.021 --> 02:08:06.970
<v Speaker 5>long road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's way more fun.</v>

3045
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:10.420
<v Speaker 5>What does it mean crazy though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the odds of you getting famous as a</v>

3046
02:08:10.421 --> 02:08:13.300
<v Speaker 5>female basketball player or nonexistent?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3047
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:16.150
<v Speaker 5>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the NBA still exists,</v>

3048
02:08:16.151 --> 02:08:19.030
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Name one famous NBA player named one.</v>

3049
02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:20.080
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ready Go.</v>

3050
02:08:20.230 --> 02:08:23.170
<v Speaker 5>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But female fighters at the time,</v>

3051
02:08:23.171 --> 02:08:28.171
<v Speaker 5>it was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're in high school and said one </v>

3052
02:08:28.171 --> 02:08:28.171
<v Speaker 5>day I'm going to be a female cage </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighter.</v>

3053
02:08:28.171 --> 02:08:29.770
<v Speaker 5>People like it was crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get away from her.</v>

3054
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:32.590
<v Speaker 5>She never fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile you're famous.</v>

3055
02:08:33.190 --> 02:08:35.410
<v Speaker 5>He was just barely coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3056
02:08:35.411 --> 02:08:37.680
<v Speaker 5>so I know it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3057
02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:41.700
<v Speaker 5>so I decided to do it out of default </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I want to do,</v>

3058
02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:46.800
<v Speaker 5>to do a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was really reluctant to play </v>

3059
02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:46.990
<v Speaker 5>basketball or even try.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't like,</v>

3060
02:08:46.991 --> 02:08:49.720
<v Speaker 5>it just didn't appeal to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't click can't dribble the ball.</v>

3061
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:51.250
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't shoot well,</v>

3062
02:08:51.251 --> 02:08:52.780
<v Speaker 5>like I didn't pee a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3063
02:08:52.781 --> 02:08:55.570
<v Speaker 5>this is not the sport for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't jump very high.</v>

3064
02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:59.200
<v Speaker 5>Like everything is just like not I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 5>made to play basketball.</v>

3065
02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:02.890
<v Speaker 5>And so I went out for wrestling and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

3066
02:09:02.891 --> 02:09:04.150
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess I'll try this.</v>

3067
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:09.270
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we didn't tell my dad at first either </v>

3068
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.270
<v Speaker 5>because he would have probably been </v>
<v Speaker 5>mortified.</v>

3069
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:13.800
<v Speaker 5>He was mortified when we told him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was too late by then already I </v>

3070
02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:13.800
<v Speaker 5>was already in.</v>

3071
02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.450
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think my mom thought I was going to </v>

3072
02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:20.191
<v Speaker 5>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she tried to hide it from him for </v>

3073
02:09:20.191 --> 02:09:20.191
<v Speaker 5>like two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three weeks or so,</v>

3074
02:09:20.191 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 5>like thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3075
02:09:20.711 --> 02:09:25.711
<v Speaker 5>she's probably going like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I love the girls were on the team </v>

3076
02:09:25.711 --> 02:09:26.440
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One other girl that was my best friend,</v>

3077
02:09:26.441 --> 02:09:28.150
<v Speaker 5>Sharon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was actually her idea.</v>

3078
02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:29.590
<v Speaker 5>I never probably would have thought of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3079
02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.920
<v Speaker 5>We were an honors English class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will smarty pants and she looks at me </v>

3080
02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:35.650
<v Speaker 5>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3081
02:09:35.651 --> 02:09:40.651
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to do a sport but I don't want </v>

3082
02:09:40.651 --> 02:09:40.651
<v Speaker 5>to play basketball either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to go out for wrestling.</v>

3083
02:09:40.651 --> 02:09:42.550
<v Speaker 5>I like wrestling and I always taught </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling was so weird.</v>

3084
02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:45.880
<v Speaker 5>Like in middle school as a kid I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are they doing?</v>

3085
02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:50.440
<v Speaker 5>Like these boys in these tight suits </v>
<v Speaker 5>like rolling around.</v>

3086
02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:55.480
<v Speaker 5>This is a weird um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I had this like distaste for </v>

3087
02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:55.480
<v Speaker 5>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's kind of like,</v>

3088
02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:57.490
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's better than basketball probably.</v>

3089
02:09:57.490 --> 02:09:57.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

3090
02:09:57.881 --> 02:10:00.500
<v Speaker 5>Let's try it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3091
02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:05.520
<v Speaker 5>that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's nothing against the </v>

3092
02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:05.520
<v Speaker 5>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just,</v>

3093
02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:05.520
<v Speaker 5>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3094
02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:07.060
<v Speaker 5>How did you know that you liked it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wrestling?</v>

3095
02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:12.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well the first day I got my ass kicked </v>

3096
02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:15.210
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I left with like Matt Burns all </v>

3097
02:10:15.210 --> 02:10:15.310
<v Speaker 5>over my body and my face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I didn't know what I was doing.</v>

3098
02:10:15.311 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 5>They tried to get me to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want the girl,</v>

3099
02:10:17.291 --> 02:10:20.210
<v Speaker 5>they did not want us there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they meaning the teammates,</v>

3100
02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:21.910
<v Speaker 5>teammates and the coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3101
02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:23.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the coach.</v>

3102
02:10:23.151 --> 02:10:25.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The coach was kind of an ass,</v>

3103
02:10:25.511 --> 02:10:28.000
<v Speaker 5>like he was only there for one year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He actually ended up getting,</v>

3104
02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:30.250
<v Speaker 5>he had of getting fired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyways,</v>

3105
02:10:30.251 --> 02:10:31.750
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3106
02:10:31.751 --> 02:10:33.370
<v Speaker 5>they did not want us there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think they thought like,</v>

3107
02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 5>if we make this as</v>

3108
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.830
<v Speaker 2>hard on them as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just quit because that's like,</v>

3109
02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:38.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they had a couple years before,</v>

3110
02:10:38.841 --> 02:10:40.370
<v Speaker 2>like a girl come out and like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

3111
02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:45.400
<v Speaker 2>they never lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they never made it past the two </v>

3112
02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:45.400
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think I kind of felt that and I was</v>

3113
02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:46.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just wait for us.</v>

3114
02:10:46.730 --> 02:10:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to prove you wrong.</v>

3115
02:10:48.441 --> 02:10:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stick around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this.</v>

3116
02:10:50.121 --> 02:10:52.130
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as sure as hell no,</v>

3117
02:10:52.131 --> 02:10:53.630
<v Speaker 2>I can't get any worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

3118
02:10:53.631 --> 02:10:57.080
<v Speaker 2>so the law of diminishing returns says </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bound to get better.</v>

3119
02:10:57.740 --> 02:10:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3120
02:10:58.881 --> 02:11:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I kept coming back every day and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hardest thing that I've ever done.</v>

3121
02:11:02.661 --> 02:11:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why I liked it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking hard,</v>

3122
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:07.760
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard.</v>

3123
02:11:07.761 --> 02:11:09.530
<v Speaker 2>And they did a lot of conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

3124
02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I loved,</v>

3125
02:11:11.050 --> 02:11:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mind that at all.</v>

3126
02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Like I love that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love working,</v>

3127
02:11:14.031 --> 02:11:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I love conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love pushing myself.</v>

3128
02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.880
<v Speaker 2>The part that was the most challenging </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the actual wrestling because they </v>

3129
02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:22.280
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to teach us anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't teach me anything.</v>

3130
02:11:22.281 --> 02:11:27.281
<v Speaker 2>I remember they put me in there with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who placed third in state and he </v>

3131
02:11:27.281 --> 02:11:28.040
<v Speaker 2>just wrecked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3132
02:11:28.041 --> 02:11:29.810
<v Speaker 2>can you at least show me a double ad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3133
02:11:29.811 --> 02:11:34.811
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to do any of this </v>

3134
02:11:34.811 --> 02:11:34.811
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3135
02:11:34.811 --> 02:11:34.811
<v Speaker 2>can you show me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3136
02:11:34.811 --> 02:11:34.811
<v Speaker 2>just a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3137
02:11:34.811 --> 02:11:34.811
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3138
02:11:34.811 --> 02:11:36.620
<v Speaker 2>just go wrestle and you just embarrassed</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

3139
02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:38.960
<v Speaker 2>What a Shitty fucking wrestling coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3140
02:11:38.961 --> 02:11:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3141
02:11:40.761 --> 02:11:45.761
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want us there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that the first time that you knew </v>

3142
02:11:45.761 --> 02:11:47.921
<v Speaker 2>about yourself though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you liked to overcome adversity </v>

3143
02:11:47.921 --> 02:11:51.071
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could do liked difficult </v>

3144
02:11:51.071 --> 02:11:51.071
<v Speaker 2>challenges?</v>

3145
02:11:51.071 --> 02:11:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Looking back on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so because I didn't realize how </v>

3146
02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:55.670
<v Speaker 2>tough I was until I got through like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling season.</v>

3147
02:11:55.671 --> 02:11:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy crap.</v>

3148
02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:02.080
<v Speaker 2>That was really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal for people who've never done </v>

3149
02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:03.790
<v Speaker 2>anything difficult to is probably like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first.</v>

3150
02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't say when you start out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a big team and half the people drop</v>

3151
02:12:08.901 --> 02:12:13.901
<v Speaker 2>like flies really quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of kind of dwindle out and </v>

3152
02:12:13.901 --> 02:12:15.950
<v Speaker 2>you're left with like a few that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really there to do it.</v>

3153
02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:18.080
<v Speaker 2>And especially with me being so </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

3154
02:12:18.081 --> 02:12:20.140
<v Speaker 2>like I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3155
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean I probably lost about every match</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're,</v>

3156
02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I'd never wrestled before and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>competing against guys.</v>

3157
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember exactly.</v>

3158
02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd be a girl like later in the </v>

3159
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:34.840
<v Speaker 2>season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first year and I lost my very first </v>

3160
02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:34.840
<v Speaker 2>wrestling match was actually against </v>
<v Speaker 2>another female,</v>

3161
02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:36.740
<v Speaker 2>which was rare and it lost by points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was like a senior,</v>

3162
02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:38.480
<v Speaker 2>so it was whatever.</v>

3163
02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I just tried to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got pinned.</v>

3164
02:12:40.670 --> 02:12:43.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I got Penn,</v>

3165
02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:46.070
<v Speaker 2>she was a senior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like second round and I didn't,</v>

3166
02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't know very much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3167
02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:50.150
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I went on it.</v>

3168
02:12:50.151 --> 02:12:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Actually my senior year I ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling varsity.</v>

3169
02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3170
02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:56.420
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you went through freshmen,</v>

3171
02:12:56.421 --> 02:12:57.410
<v Speaker 2>sophomore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior,</v>

3172
02:12:57.411 --> 02:12:58.650
<v Speaker 2>and senior year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3173
02:12:58.850 --> 02:13:00.110
<v Speaker 2>All four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four years.</v>

3174
02:13:00.111 --> 02:13:00.840
<v Speaker 2>You wrestled?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3175
02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:02.510
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

3176
02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Won't go live for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3177
02:13:05.121 --> 02:13:10.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the senior year you were a varsity </v>

3178
02:13:10.121 --> 02:13:11.150
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck what?</v>

3179
02:13:11.151 --> 02:13:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the hilarious part.</v>

3180
02:13:13.281 --> 02:13:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3181
02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:18.380
<v Speaker 2>So I was good but I wasn't male varsity </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3182
02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:19.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love wrestling.</v>

3183
02:13:19.671 --> 02:13:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I worked hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came early,</v>

3184
02:13:21.021 --> 02:13:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I stayed late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did all that.</v>

3185
02:13:22.610 --> 02:13:26.120
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't that level right.</v>

3186
02:13:26.121 --> 02:13:27.860
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing was is that we didn't have</v>

3187
02:13:27.861 --> 02:13:29.210
<v Speaker 2>152 pounder.</v>

3188
02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:31.830
<v Speaker 2>We had to one $45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrestled 1:45.</v>

3189
02:13:31.831 --> 02:13:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to cut weight so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just what I was walking at at the time.</v>

3190
02:13:34.530 --> 02:13:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I was heavier and heavier in high school</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I am now and I didn't know anything</v>

3191
02:13:38.641 --> 02:13:40.290
<v Speaker 2>about diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anything about anything.</v>

3192
02:13:40.410 --> 02:13:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I thought what I joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how stupid I was.</v>

3193
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I thought that when I had to make wait </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day that I needed to eat the </v>

3194
02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:51.651
<v Speaker 2>most low calorie foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would go like get the jar of salsa </v>

3195
02:13:51.651 --> 02:13:55.440
<v Speaker 2>which has had or I don't know how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of milligrams of sodium,</v>

3196
02:13:55.530 --> 02:13:57.600
<v Speaker 2>which is going to help you hold water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

3197
02:13:57.601 --> 02:13:58.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3198
02:13:58.171 --> 02:14:00.690
<v Speaker 2>it's five calories per serving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me eat this whole thing.</v>

3199
02:14:00.691 --> 02:14:05.691
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it was like a balloon the next </v>

3200
02:14:05.691 --> 02:14:08.060
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's no wonder like I couldn't cut </v>

3201
02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:09.771
<v Speaker 2>any way like nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody taught me anything about cutting </v>

3202
02:14:12.841 --> 02:14:15.510
<v Speaker 2>wakes up to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw garbage bag on and run around,</v>

3203
02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3204
02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:19.190
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3205
02:14:19.230 --> 02:14:20.340
<v Speaker 2>there was two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:45</v>

3206
02:14:20.341 --> 02:14:21.720
<v Speaker 2>pounders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no 1:52</v>

3207
02:14:21.721 --> 02:14:23.670
<v Speaker 2>pounders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they would do is basically I was</v>

3208
02:14:23.671 --> 02:14:27.720
<v Speaker 2>the sacrificial lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would both weigh in at 1:45</v>

3209
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:32.750
<v Speaker 2>for varsity and they would decide which </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent was more likely for the guy,</v>

3210
02:14:34.290 --> 02:14:39.290
<v Speaker 2>our guy teammate to beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would match him up so that we </v>

3211
02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:40.560
<v Speaker 2>could get a win and they would put me </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the tougher opponent.</v>

3212
02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 2>So that our guy that had a chance at </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning could win because they were like</v>

3213
02:14:45.601 --> 02:14:47.400
<v Speaker 2>the new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way I probably wasn't able to win</v>

3214
02:14:47.401 --> 02:14:48.130
<v Speaker 2>and get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are,</v>

3215
02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>these are tough guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been wrestling for years.</v>

3216
02:14:50.561 --> 02:14:51.960
<v Speaker 2>They'd been wrestling their whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3217
02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:55.800
<v Speaker 2>And they're cutting weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So half the time I'm wrestling 1:50,</v>

3218
02:14:55.801 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 2>two pound men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm weighing in at 1:45</v>

3219
02:14:59.430 --> 02:15:02.820
<v Speaker 2>on Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Varsity team and just getting,</v>

3220
02:15:02.850 --> 02:15:04.800
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

3221
02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Did you beat any dudes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

3222
02:15:06.601 --> 02:15:09.870
<v Speaker 2>but not in Varsity varsity guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I beat some other guys.</v>

3223
02:15:09.871 --> 02:15:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I made him cry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a few guys quit.</v>

3224
02:15:12.630 --> 02:15:14.310
<v Speaker 2>It would always get back to our school.</v>

3225
02:15:16.330 --> 02:15:18.180
<v Speaker 2>It would always get back to our school </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

3226
02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy you beat last week.</v>

3227
02:15:19.741 --> 02:15:21.990
<v Speaker 2>He quit the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3228
02:15:22.050 --> 02:15:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I would come back to our school because </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously there was a,</v>

3229
02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:25.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rival school or whatever.</v>

3230
02:15:25.471 --> 02:15:27.020
<v Speaker 2>But somehow it would get back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3231
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess he quit the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much that.</v>

3232
02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3233
02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wound care.</v>

3234
02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

3235
02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3236
02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:41.790
<v Speaker 2>we're not gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:45.480
<v Speaker 2>You gotta keep going one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what a Saturday night right?</v>

3238
02:15:45.481 --> 02:15:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3239
02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you explain it to people?</v>

3240
02:15:48.630 --> 02:15:50.910
<v Speaker 2>It's the most brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically,</v>

3241
02:15:51.290 --> 02:15:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got by like a hundred 50,</v>

3242
02:15:54.631 --> 02:15:58.140
<v Speaker 2>two pounds state placer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I weighed in at 1:45.</v>

3243
02:15:58.170 --> 02:16:03.170
<v Speaker 2>I remember he wrestled for White River </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he went out and just bulldoze me </v>

3244
02:16:03.781 --> 02:16:07.260
<v Speaker 2>right over and Saturday night ride pin </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and like 18 seconds.</v>

3245
02:16:07.261 --> 02:16:12.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean he crushed me but it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing and do like it's a last,</v>

3246
02:16:12.750 --> 02:16:17.750
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a girl in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the last way that you want them </v>

3247
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.750
<v Speaker 2>to on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically they,</v>

3248
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:22.550
<v Speaker 2>they lay like straight on top of you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a starfish position and they wrap </v>

3249
02:16:23.011 --> 02:16:28.011
<v Speaker 2>your arm both of your arms with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>arms and wrap your legs with your legs </v>

3250
02:16:28.011 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 2>so that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just starfish out on your back.</v>

3251
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:32.500
<v Speaker 6>And like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what an asshole.</v>

3252
02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:34.090
<v Speaker 6>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he did it on purpose.</v>

3253
02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Well why does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it was effective,</v>

3254
02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:41.700
<v Speaker 1>why is that more embarrassing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because your legs are all spread </v>

3255
02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:41.700
<v Speaker 1>out</v>

3256
02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:42.480
<v Speaker 6>and it looks like a sexual position kind</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

3257
02:16:42.481 --> 02:16:47.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they're like right on top of </v>

3258
02:16:47.481 --> 02:16:47.481
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stomach to stomach,</v>

3259
02:16:47.481 --> 02:16:47.481
<v Speaker 6>chest to chest pain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Groin.</v>

3260
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:48.900
<v Speaker 6>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3261
02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:49.440
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>

3262
02:16:49.441 --> 02:16:51.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's close.</v>

3263
02:16:51.450 --> 02:16:52.310
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's amount.</v>

3264
02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:56.950
<v Speaker 6>Someone mounting grape vining someone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3265
02:16:57.550 --> 02:16:59.970
<v Speaker 6>it's not really pulling up the one go </v>
<v Speaker 6>down again.</v>

3266
02:16:59.971 --> 02:17:01.350
<v Speaker 6>The black and white one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3267
02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:03.120
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3268
02:17:03.121 --> 02:17:03.750
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3269
02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:06.250
<v Speaker 6>that's kind of like basically I'm sort </v>
<v Speaker 6>of.</v>

3270
02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:07.560
<v Speaker 6>But he's kind of doing more of an </v>
<v Speaker 6>Armbar.</v>

3271
02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:10.640
<v Speaker 6>So just imagine if you had thing amount </v>
<v Speaker 6>with a double bond.</v>

3272
02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:12.300
<v Speaker 6>So it's just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

3273
02:17:12.301 --> 02:17:14.750
<v Speaker 6>It was just like demoralizing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3274
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:15.950
<v Speaker 6>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>damn it.</v>

3275
02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:21.000
<v Speaker 6>And it was so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But usually actually I didn't get pinned</v>

3276
02:17:21.001 --> 02:17:23.280
<v Speaker 6>on Varsity so it was so flexible because</v>
<v Speaker 6>back to that,</v>

3277
02:17:23.310 --> 02:17:26.300
<v Speaker 6>like people couldn't turn me over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even the varsity guys like I would.</v>

3278
02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:31.340
<v Speaker 6>That was my survival technique was like </v>
<v Speaker 6>my shoulders were so flexible that if </v>

3279
02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:35.361
<v Speaker 6>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in high school wrestling you can't go </v>

3280
02:17:35.361 --> 02:17:37.671
<v Speaker 6>past was potentially dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not allowed to like dislocate </v>

3281
02:17:37.671 --> 02:17:40.221
<v Speaker 6>someone's shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's like they would try to turn me </v>

3282
02:17:40.221 --> 02:17:40.221
<v Speaker 6>on my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my arm,</v>

3283
02:17:40.221 --> 02:17:40.221
<v Speaker 6>it be going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>

3284
02:17:40.221 --> 02:17:40.221
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>

3285
02:17:40.221 --> 02:17:40.980
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they were like,</v>

3286
02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:43.740
<v Speaker 6>you can't go past that or you're going </v>
<v Speaker 6>to dislocate your arm,</v>

3287
02:17:43.741 --> 02:17:44.550
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was like,</v>

3288
02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:46.440
<v Speaker 6>that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my Hail Mary.</v>

3289
02:17:46.441 --> 02:17:48.840
<v Speaker 6>It was like I'm really flexible and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>super tough and I would just,</v>

3290
02:17:48.841 --> 02:17:53.841
<v Speaker 6>would not let.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would have let my arm dislocate for </v>

3291
02:17:53.841 --> 02:17:53.841
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was not going to let him turn me.</v>

3292
02:17:53.841 --> 02:17:53.841
<v Speaker 6>That's totally fine.</v>

3293
02:17:53.841 --> 02:17:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Interesting things about wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3294
02:17:55.260 --> 02:18:00.260
<v Speaker 1>This is like there's some things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would do in a fight that you're not </v>

3295
02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:00.260
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do.</v>

3296
02:18:00.430 --> 02:18:01.900
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's collegiate wrestling,</v>

3297
02:18:01.901 --> 02:18:03.580
<v Speaker 6>so it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's different styles.</v>

3298
02:18:03.581 --> 02:18:06.010
<v Speaker 6>There's collegiate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is more safe for schools.</v>

3299
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because our kids.</v>

3300
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:08.320
<v Speaker 6>And then you get into freestyle </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestling,</v>

3301
02:18:08.321 --> 02:18:10.840
<v Speaker 6>which you can throw people in slam and </v>
<v Speaker 6>collegiate.</v>

3302
02:18:10.841 --> 02:18:15.841
<v Speaker 6>You have to kind of set them down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not allowed to just like pick </v>

3303
02:18:15.841 --> 02:18:15.841
<v Speaker 6>someone in the article,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

3304
02:18:15.841 --> 02:18:16.150
<v Speaker 6>throw them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to kind of put them down.</v>

3305
02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:21.440
<v Speaker 1>But even just freestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Mark Schultz fought in </v>

3306
02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:22.590
<v Speaker 1>the Olympics and rip that guy's arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>

3307
02:18:22.650 --> 02:18:25.880
<v Speaker 1>got them into Kamora and sort of tossed </v>
<v Speaker 1>them with the oranges.</v>

3308
02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:27.670
<v Speaker 1>He yanked his arm backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3309
02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got disqualified for that.</v>

3310
02:18:30.660 --> 02:18:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Which we're in the UFC would be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing move.</v>

3311
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:36.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I guess it's a different mindset.</v>

3312
02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:38.590
<v Speaker 6>I guess they think of wrestling is </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestling and fighting is fighting.</v>

3313
02:18:38.650 --> 02:18:39.160
<v Speaker 6>It's different.</v>

3314
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like it's effective grappling </v>

3315
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:45.470
<v Speaker 1>like the use of your body against their </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

3316
02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

3317
02:18:47.770 --> 02:18:52.770
<v Speaker 6>Think for wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you're supposed to use </v>

3318
02:18:52.770 --> 02:18:54.970
<v Speaker 6>like joint manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think maybe that's the difference.</v>

3319
02:18:55.180 --> 02:19:00.180
<v Speaker 6>It's supposed to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can control their body with your </v>

3320
02:19:00.180 --> 02:19:01.690
<v Speaker 6>weight on top of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not necessarily like contort their joint</v>

3321
02:19:01.691 --> 02:19:04.600
<v Speaker 6>in the wrong direction so that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's Jujitsu.</v>

3322
02:19:05.290 --> 02:19:05.890
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu comes in.</v>

3323
02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when Matt Hughes Fought </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo Almeida and choked them out,</v>

3324
02:19:12.100 --> 02:19:13.940
<v Speaker 1>but with like a front headlock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3325
02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Which is a move that is actually using a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling all the time.</v>

3326
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:18.940
<v Speaker 1>That was a fascinating.</v>

3327
02:19:18.990 --> 02:19:21.440
<v Speaker 6>Some wrestlers have adapted more of that</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff too,</v>

3328
02:19:21.450 --> 02:19:26.450
<v Speaker 6>and then they put that in there more </v>
<v Speaker 6>than one start putting some pressure on </v>

3329
02:19:26.450 --> 02:19:28.550
<v Speaker 6>the throat and folding people over it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they try to get a little bit</v>

3330
02:19:28.690 --> 02:19:32.030
<v Speaker 3>who's so fucking strong when he gets a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold of you in that position and he's.</v>

3331
02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's pushing against your.</v>

3332
02:19:34.510 --> 02:19:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Your arm and it's pending against your </v>
<v Speaker 3>neck and then he's squeezing your neck </v>

3333
02:19:39.510 --> 02:19:39.510
<v Speaker 3>on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's choking you out.</v>

3334
02:19:39.510 --> 02:19:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Let's just like a head and arm choke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a reverse position.</v>

3335
02:19:41.770 --> 02:19:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty good.</v>

3336
02:19:42.981 --> 02:19:47.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was amazed when I saw that fight that </v>

3337
02:19:47.981 --> 02:19:50.971
<v Speaker 3>he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was able to choke out Ricardo </v>

3338
02:19:50.971 --> 02:19:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Tomato who's a Jujitsu black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Maura may since then that no one </v>

3339
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:54.250
<v Speaker 3>else has been able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you wrestled?</v>

3340
02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Did you refresh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrestled in high school.</v>

3341
02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Wrestle in high school one year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3342
02:19:56.970 --> 02:19:58.460
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other ones,</v>

3343
02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:00.240
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was both.</v>

3344
02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just decided to tag window was easier.</v>

3345
02:20:03.341 --> 02:20:08.341
<v Speaker 3>I liked that and I like kicking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the biggest things,</v>

3346
02:20:09.521 --> 02:20:10.420
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3347
02:20:10.690 --> 02:20:13.030
<v Speaker 3>well it was also that I had to do it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

3348
02:20:13.350 --> 02:20:18.350
<v Speaker 3>so it was like I had to stay at school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I fucking hated and I was just a </v>

3349
02:20:18.350 --> 02:20:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Zombie like after us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sore.</v>

3350
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:24.400
<v Speaker 3>I remember like we used to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprints upstairs and shit and carry each</v>

3351
02:20:24.401 --> 02:20:27.700
<v Speaker 3>other across the football field and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so fucking sore.</v>

3352
02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I just remember thinking like a bark</v>

3353
02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:37.200
<v Speaker 6>used to do like what they call the gut </v>
<v Speaker 6>busters I think because it literally </v>

3354
02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:39.040
<v Speaker 6>makes me want to vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was doing both at the same time too.</v>

3355
02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:41.390
<v Speaker 6>I was doing taekwondo and wrestling at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the same time.</v>

3356
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:46.870
<v Speaker 6>I just had determined I wish I could've </v>
<v Speaker 6>done more extra curricular like school </v>

3357
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:49.160
<v Speaker 6>activities besides just what was offered</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the school.</v>

3358
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:53.150
<v Speaker 6>That was one thing is like we were so we</v>
<v Speaker 6>struggled a lot financially growing up.</v>

3359
02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:57.410
<v Speaker 6>We didn't grow up in a privileged </v>
<v Speaker 6>household by any means and they couldn't</v>

3360
02:20:57.411 --> 02:21:02.411
<v Speaker 6>afford.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My parents couldn't afford to put me </v>

3361
02:21:02.411 --> 02:21:02.411
<v Speaker 6>into gymnastics at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3362
02:21:02.411 --> 02:21:04.130
<v Speaker 6>but I'm glad because I think that for </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3363
02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:09.160
<v Speaker 6>that's what I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually wanted to do gymnastics </v>

3364
02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:09.160
<v Speaker 6>instead of wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're like,</v>

3365
02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:09.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we just,</v>

3366
02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.380
<v Speaker 6>it's too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>too much and,</v>

3367
02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:16.960
<v Speaker 6>but I'm glad that I didn't come from </v>
<v Speaker 6>super privileged because it just gives </v>

3368
02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:16.960
<v Speaker 6>me a whole different perspective.</v>

3369
02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:18.710
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You appreciate what you've earned,</v>

3370
02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:20.990
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When did you start striking?</v>

3371
02:21:20.991 --> 02:21:24.110
<v Speaker 6>When did you do any sort of striking </v>
<v Speaker 6>martial arts?</v>

3372
02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:26.480
<v Speaker 6>Nineteen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was 19.</v>

3373
02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:28.900
<v Speaker 6>When did you start out with?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3374
02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:30.890
<v Speaker 6>I think it was just kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3375
02:21:30.891 --> 02:21:33.260
<v Speaker 6>just normal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like learning to throw kicks and normal,</v>

3376
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:35.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was kickboxing for mma.</v>

3377
02:21:35.930 --> 02:21:36.770
<v Speaker 6>I never did any,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3378
02:21:36.771 --> 02:21:39.140
<v Speaker 6>just straight anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was always about,</v>

3379
02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:41.390
<v Speaker 6>it was always about mma and obviously I </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestled.</v>

3380
02:21:41.391 --> 02:21:44.390
<v Speaker 6>So the goal was always to grab people </v>
<v Speaker 6>and get them to the ground.</v>

3381
02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:46.040
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

3382
02:21:46.041 --> 02:21:48.230
<v Speaker 6>I started with kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>learning how to throw basic kicks,</v>

3383
02:21:48.231 --> 02:21:50.000
<v Speaker 6>learning how to throw basic punches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>

3384
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:55.030
<v Speaker 6>but before my first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I had like maybe four weeks of </v>

3385
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.400
<v Speaker 6>striking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like nothing.</v>

3386
02:21:56.390 --> 02:21:59.330
<v Speaker 6>Nothing that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy.</v>

3387
02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:00.120
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3388
02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:04.960
<v Speaker 3>in those situations where I had a buddy </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mine who was a Jujitsu black belt,</v>

3389
02:22:05.050 --> 02:22:10.050
<v Speaker 3>really high level Jujitsu guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken an mma fight and we had a </v>

3390
02:22:10.050 --> 02:22:12.790
<v Speaker 3>conversation about it before and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going,</v>

3391
02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:14.830
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much striking are you doing?</v>

3392
02:22:15.130 --> 02:22:17.380
<v Speaker 3>And he's like once a week or get </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and do this.</v>

3393
02:22:17.381 --> 02:22:18.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3394
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

3395
02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:21.640
<v Speaker 3>do you know what you can do to guys on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground?</v>

3396
02:22:22.180 --> 02:22:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone can do that.</v>

3397
02:22:23.171 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you standing up and evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy has to do</v>

3398
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.970
<v Speaker 4>is keep you from getting a hold of him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and your Foxville like you have to.</v>

3399
02:22:29.971 --> 02:22:34.110
<v Speaker 4>You have to be understanding that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a difference in the consequences</v>

3400
02:22:34.111 --> 02:22:39.111
<v Speaker 4>as well because the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being in there with like a dangerous </v>

3401
02:22:39.111 --> 02:22:43.071
<v Speaker 4>striker or one wrong move and you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>clipped with something and you wake up.</v>

3402
02:22:44.370 --> 02:22:46.350
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a different thing.</v>

3403
02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:49.290
<v Speaker 4>But so many people that are really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>at one thing,</v>

3404
02:22:49.470 --> 02:22:53.250
<v Speaker 4>they think all I have to do is do my one</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and they won't be able to stop me.</v>

3405
02:22:53.450 --> 02:22:54.200
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3406
02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:56.720
<v Speaker 6>I went into my first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of ignorance is bliss,</v>

3407
02:22:56.721 --> 02:22:58.310
<v Speaker 6>to not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not thinking like,</v>

3408
02:22:58.670 --> 02:23:00.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I can't do this because I just didn't</v>

3409
02:23:00.441 --> 02:23:05.441
<v Speaker 6>know how devastating it could be to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>like kneed in the face now up in </v>

3410
02:23:06.561 --> 02:23:11.561
<v Speaker 6>Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't allow amateurs like to throw </v>

3411
02:23:11.561 --> 02:23:11.561
<v Speaker 6>a full on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nice the face.</v>

3412
02:23:11.561 --> 02:23:15.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't allow it like an amateur </v>

3413
02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:17.561
<v Speaker 6>fighting I think in California and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that to like now there's more </v>

3414
02:23:17.561 --> 02:23:20.321
<v Speaker 6>regulations and they don't allow it just</v>
<v Speaker 6>because a lot of times and amateurs are </v>

3415
02:23:20.321 --> 02:23:21.290
<v Speaker 6>still learning and just such a brutal </v>
<v Speaker 6>blow,</v>

3416
02:23:21.490 --> 02:23:23.010
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The need of the face like we are.</v>

3417
02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:25.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's a hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There is no protection.</v>

3418
02:23:25.251 --> 02:23:28.430
<v Speaker 6>It straight like kneebone and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty brutal.</v>

3419
02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:30.950
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my first fight,</v>

3420
02:23:31.130 --> 02:23:32.210
<v Speaker 6>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3421
02:23:32.211 --> 02:23:33.590
<v Speaker 6>I went out there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wrestled her.</v>

3422
02:23:33.591 --> 02:23:35.150
<v Speaker 6>I pretty much just all that's all that I</v>
<v Speaker 6>knew.</v>

3423
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:36.770
<v Speaker 6>I don't even think I threw a punch on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ground.</v>

3424
02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:41.830
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I took her down like the easiest I've </v>

3425
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.830
<v Speaker 6>ever take her down and I think I forgot </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I could punch because I was just,</v>

3426
02:23:41.930 --> 02:23:44.570
<v Speaker 6>that's all I knew is wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So just wrestled her the whole time.</v>

3427
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:50.060
<v Speaker 6>And then the second round I came out and</v>
<v Speaker 6>threw a once you went to and I try to </v>

3428
02:23:50.060 --> 02:23:50.630
<v Speaker 6>grab a hold of her and she put me in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>Thai clinch.</v>

3429
02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:52.130
<v Speaker 6>So her and her husband own the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3430
02:23:52.131 --> 02:23:52.570
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3431
02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:57.640
<v Speaker 6>owned a Thai school up in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So she was like really good striker,</v>

3432
02:23:57.710 --> 02:24:02.710
<v Speaker 6>no wrestling or really much grappling a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit and I didn't know what it </v>

3433
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:06.401
<v Speaker 6>was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even know what a Thai clinch </v>

3434
02:24:06.401 --> 02:24:06.401
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as much less how to defend it.</v>

3435
02:24:06.401 --> 02:24:09.940
<v Speaker 6>So she just starts kneeing my face off </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the only thing I can think to do is </v>

3436
02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:09.940
<v Speaker 6>shoot.</v>

3437
02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:12.230
<v Speaker 6>So I'm just shooting into knees,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it Bam,</v>

3438
02:24:12.231 --> 02:24:13.070
<v Speaker 6>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bam.</v>

3439
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:15.350
<v Speaker 6>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of them caught my nose is clean on,</v>

3440
02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.150
<v Speaker 6>busted it flattened my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3441
02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:22.390
<v Speaker 6>that was in such shock.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she,</v>

3442
02:24:22.430 --> 02:24:27.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because is the first time I've been hit </v>

3443
02:24:27.430 --> 02:24:27.430
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you don't,</v>

3444
02:24:27.430 --> 02:24:30.070
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't take blows to the face in </v>

3445
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.070
<v Speaker 6>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm just like,</v>

3446
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:31.160
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is going on here,</v>

3447
02:24:31.161 --> 02:24:34.690
<v Speaker 6>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she kind of like pushes me down like</v>

3448
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:37.360
<v Speaker 6>because I'm so shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I kinda like slump out of the,</v>

3449
02:24:37.361 --> 02:24:37.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3450
02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:40.430
<v Speaker 6>off of the legs a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a little bit stunned obviously.</v>

3451
02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:45.200
<v Speaker 6>And she spins around and takes my bag.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She tried to choke me and I just,</v>

3452
02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:48.800
<v Speaker 6>I remember I had this epiphany moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like the world stopped,</v>

3453
02:24:48.801 --> 02:24:53.801
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and she's still trying to like fight me </v>

3454
02:24:53.801 --> 02:24:53.801
<v Speaker 6>and beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I remember she tried to choke me and</v>

3455
02:24:53.801 --> 02:24:57.731
<v Speaker 6>I had my hands like this and it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 6>vivid moment because how I got this </v>

3456
02:24:57.731 --> 02:24:58.050
<v Speaker 6>star,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is how I started my career.</v>

3457
02:24:58.051 --> 02:25:03.051
<v Speaker 6>It was my first fight ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm watching this pool of blood and </v>

3458
02:25:04.821 --> 02:25:06.710
<v Speaker 6>there's a steady stream,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like not even dripping,</v>

3459
02:25:06.711 --> 02:25:10.520
<v Speaker 6>like it's just pouring out of my nose </v>
<v Speaker 6>and this pool of blood is getting bigger</v>

3460
02:25:10.580 --> 02:25:15.580
<v Speaker 6>and bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she's still trying to choke me and </v>

3461
02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:16.400
<v Speaker 6>punched me and I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this bitch,</v>

3462
02:25:23.890 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 7>that's</v>

3463
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:26.740
<v Speaker 2>exactly what the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3464
02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:29.440
<v Speaker 2>And I got pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got pissed.</v>

3465
02:25:29.441 --> 02:25:34.441
<v Speaker 2>I lost my temper and the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started bucking her off and that's </v>

3466
02:25:34.441 --> 02:25:38.401
<v Speaker 2>when the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really came out of me because before </v>

3467
02:25:38.401 --> 02:25:38.401
<v Speaker 2>that I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so wrestling.</v>

3468
02:25:38.401 --> 02:25:38.401
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3469
02:25:38.401 --> 02:25:40.840
<v Speaker 2>competing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when the fighter came out.</v>

3470
02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I got fucking pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pissed.</v>

3471
02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my nose was broken.</v>

3472
02:25:44.951 --> 02:25:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Not only that I got hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that she had my back.</v>

3473
02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:50.740
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was what pissed me off.</v>

3474
02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Like the rest was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

3475
02:25:52.271 --> 02:25:54.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was the wrestler.</v>

3476
02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like get off my back like you're the </v>

3477
02:25:59.940 --> 02:25:59.940
<v Speaker 2>striker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to be there.</v>

3478
02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:04.200
<v Speaker 2>So I like started bugging her and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>fell down into the guard position and I </v>

3479
02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:09.001
<v Speaker 2>stood up above her and I reached to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceiling as high as I could and I just </v>

3480
02:26:09.001 --> 02:26:11.020
<v Speaker 2>started raining down punches from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing position.</v>

3481
02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:14.080
<v Speaker 2>And the lead is going everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she soaked in it.</v>

3482
02:26:14.081 --> 02:26:19.081
<v Speaker 2>I've got it all over me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just bleeding like a stuck pig </v>

3483
02:26:19.081 --> 02:26:20.500
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and I remember her face Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wincing,</v>

3484
02:26:20.501 --> 02:26:25.501
<v Speaker 2>like trying to weather the storm and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the how the second round ended </v>

3485
02:26:25.501 --> 02:26:27.070
<v Speaker 2>and then I went back to my corner and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm the head,</v>

3486
02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:32.280
<v Speaker 2>the head coach was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't let you go back out for the </v>

3487
02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:33.370
<v Speaker 2>third round because your nose is just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we don't know how bad it is.</v>

3488
02:26:33.371 --> 02:26:36.460
<v Speaker 2>And I was super bummed because that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the turning point in the fight for me.</v>

3489
02:26:36.461 --> 02:26:41.461
<v Speaker 2>That's when it actually became a fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like I really wanted to go </v>

3490
02:26:41.461 --> 02:26:43.000
<v Speaker 2>back out in the third round and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>whip this girl's ass.</v>

3491
02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:48.640
<v Speaker 2>So you lost the fight but you learned a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot about yourself?</v>

3492
02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ton.</v>

3493
02:26:50.290 --> 02:26:51.190
<v Speaker 2>And I had to go home.</v>

3494
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:53.410
<v Speaker 2>That's bringing this back full circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where my,</v>

3495
02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:56.620
<v Speaker 2>my very chauvinistic grandpa at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3496
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:58.720
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of sexy super old school.</v>

3497
02:26:58.750 --> 02:26:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3498
02:26:59.351 --> 02:27:01.520
<v Speaker 2>women do this and men do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women don't do this.</v>

3499
02:27:01.521 --> 02:27:03.400
<v Speaker 2>So you're not allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are you doing?</v>

3500
02:27:03.630 --> 02:27:06.370
<v Speaker 2>I had to come home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3501
02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:11.400
<v Speaker 2>that was the most dreadful drive I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>had because my nose was literally like </v>

3502
02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:14.500
<v Speaker 2>three times this size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no definition between my,</v>

3503
02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:16.990
<v Speaker 2>the bridge of my nose and my cheekbones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it just went straight out.</v>

3504
02:27:16.991 --> 02:27:20.150
<v Speaker 2>It was flat like a lion and then it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>went straight up to my cheek bones.</v>

3505
02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:25.200
<v Speaker 2>That's how bad it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it got broken bat and then over </v>

3506
02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:28.621
<v Speaker 2>like the next night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I could barely even open my eyes </v>

3507
02:27:28.621 --> 02:27:30.220
<v Speaker 2>and I had two giant black raccoon eyes.</v>

3508
02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:33.580
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no hiding it.</v>

3509
02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Like you get to look your grandpa </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight in the face and he's like,</v>

3510
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.620
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you,</v>

3511
02:27:38.621 --> 02:27:39.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're just like,</v>

3512
02:27:40.570 --> 02:27:41.980
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>

3513
02:27:41.981 --> 02:27:43.120
<v Speaker 2>He was just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3514
02:27:43.210 --> 02:27:46.600
<v Speaker 2>he just wouldn't like would not lay off </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it was,</v>

3515
02:27:46.601 --> 02:27:49.810
<v Speaker 2>this is why you shouldn't be doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is absurd.</v>

3516
02:27:50.410 --> 02:27:52.990
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is embarrassing.</v>

3517
02:27:52.991 --> 02:27:54.800
<v Speaker 2>And my dad's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3518
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:57.430
<v Speaker 2>he's so embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was just.</v>

3519
02:27:57.431 --> 02:27:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was embarrassed.</v>

3520
02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:03.420
<v Speaker 2>And I'm in the back of my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I can't say anything at the </v>

3521
02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:06.451
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the back of my mind I was </v>

3522
02:28:06.451 --> 02:28:07.300
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not done.</v>

3523
02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the back of my mind I was </v>

3524
02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:12.660
<v Speaker 2>thinking because everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well good.</v>

3525
02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:13.870
<v Speaker 2>She good thing she got that out of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

3526
02:28:13.871 --> 02:28:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Like she'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll surely never do that again.</v>

3527
02:28:16.330 --> 02:28:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Thank God she got this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She learned her lesson early and I was </v>

3528
02:28:21.330 --> 02:28:21.330
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3529
02:28:21.330 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got</v>

3530
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:27.130
<v Speaker 6>to get back in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to prove that I can do </v>

3531
02:28:27.130 --> 02:28:27.130
<v Speaker 6>better than that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was too embarrassing.</v>

3532
02:28:27.130 --> 02:28:31.640
<v Speaker 6>I'd have to face every one that was </v>
<v Speaker 6>telling me like I shouldn't be doing </v>

3533
02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:34.271
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know what everyone says to you </v>

3534
02:28:34.271 --> 02:28:36.011
<v Speaker 6>like before you like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at least back then everyone would </v>

3535
02:28:36.011 --> 02:28:37.010
<v Speaker 6>say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't break your nose.</v>

3536
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:43.410
<v Speaker 6>That was like my pre,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like good luck,</v>

3537
02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like people say like,</v>

3538
02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:45.640
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go kill it.</v>

3539
02:28:45.641 --> 02:28:46.980
<v Speaker 6>That meaning break a leg,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3540
02:28:47.010 --> 02:28:48.150

<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3541
02:28:48.690 --> 02:28:49.440
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3542
02:28:49.470 --> 02:28:51.540
<v Speaker 6>good luck in your fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't break your nose.</v>

3543
02:28:52.410 --> 02:28:56.460
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3544
02:28:56.461 --> 02:28:58.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was so embarrassing.</v>

3545
02:28:58.051 --> 02:29:01.590
<v Speaker 6>I think I missed like a week of call,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a week of classes too because I had done</v>

3546
02:29:01.591 --> 02:29:03.930
<v Speaker 6>it over like a break so I had like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I dunno it,</v>

3547
02:29:03.970 --> 02:29:05.730
<v Speaker 6>like winter break or something and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3548
02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:08.130
<v Speaker 6>I missed like a week because it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>still so bad.</v>

3549
02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:11.580
<v Speaker 6>Did you have to get it fixed?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3550
02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:14.100
<v Speaker 6>I probably should have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's still not fixed,</v>

3551
02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:19.160
<v Speaker 6>but you can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you can fill the </v>

3552
02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:19.410
<v Speaker 6>disassociated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My septum is like,</v>

3553
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:24.740
<v Speaker 3>it's not very well to be honest about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right side.</v>

3554
02:29:24.750 --> 02:29:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Like I can barely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a good day.</v>

3555
02:29:28.490 --> 02:29:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had thought about having </v>
<v Speaker 3>it fixed?</v>

3556
02:29:30.321 --> 02:29:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

3557
02:29:32.390 --> 02:29:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

3558
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:38.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully one of these days I just did </v>

3559
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:38.830
<v Speaker 3>it recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Helped him a lot.</v>

3560
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3561
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it till I was 39 my whole </v>

3562
02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:43.600
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a fucked up now.</v>

3563
02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

3564
02:29:45.250 --> 02:29:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Sound really nasally now to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

3565
02:29:47.991 --> 02:29:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll probably go back and listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>

3566
02:29:49.401 --> 02:29:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Like God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sound nasally.</v>

3567
02:29:51.470 --> 02:29:52.880
<v Speaker 3>I used to be just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>

3568
02:29:53.930 --> 02:29:57.440
<v Speaker 3>one side was like three quarters closed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other side was totally useless.</v>

3569
02:29:57.590 --> 02:30:00.710
<v Speaker 3>I had no breathing out of my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just all fucked up in there.</v>

3570
02:30:00.711 --> 02:30:02.360
<v Speaker 3>But now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3571
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:03.920
<v Speaker 3>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

3572
02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:05.120
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm jealous.</v>

3573
02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Wait a rabbit and Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could get it fixed.</v>

3574
02:30:08.610 --> 02:30:09.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I was wondering like,</v>

3575
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:12.400
<v Speaker 3>don't they have to like shave it down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

3576
02:30:12.460 --> 02:30:13.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's inside.</v>

3577
02:30:13.341 --> 02:30:18.341
<v Speaker 3>Straighten it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like open up the like they opened </v>

3578
02:30:18.341 --> 02:30:20.450
<v Speaker 3>it up but then it makes it a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>weaker or something to get broken again.</v>

3579
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:22.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3580
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:23.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll,</v>

3581
02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:26.360
<v Speaker 3>they shaved down the turbinates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The inside,</v>

3582
02:30:26.361 --> 02:30:31.361
<v Speaker 3>like there's these bumps inside your </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose that hinders the opening or the </v>

3583
02:30:31.671 --> 02:30:33.560
<v Speaker 3>opening smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shaved that down,</v>

3584
02:30:33.561 --> 02:30:36.730
<v Speaker 3>they cut out the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all calcified too for me,</v>

3585
02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:40.280
<v Speaker 3>which is like cauliflower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cauliflower ear.</v>

3586
02:30:40.281 --> 02:30:45.281
<v Speaker 3>You get that in your nose as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm asking for it to get </v>

3587
02:30:45.281 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 3>broken again though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I fix it.</v>

3588
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Like it says like it's gonna get broken </v>
<v Speaker 3>again probably anyway.</v>

3589
02:30:47.781 --> 02:30:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you keep fighting,</v>

3590
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:54.190
<v Speaker 3>but I think that like at least you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>more of an opportunity to breathe and </v>

3591
02:30:54.190 --> 02:30:54.190
<v Speaker 3>your cardio will definitely improve.</v>

3592
02:30:54.490 --> 02:30:56.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what they have heard about cardio</v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

3593
02:30:57.050 --> 02:31:02.050
<v Speaker 3>If you breathe out of your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it would help you in a lot of </v>

3594
02:31:02.050 --> 02:31:02.090
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to look into it.</v>

3595
02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3596
02:31:03.890 --> 02:31:06.370
<v Speaker 3>so like when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3597
02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I went to a doctor like when I was 19 or</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 and I had a real problem with it and </v>

3598
02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:11.840
<v Speaker 3>the doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3599
02:31:12.170 --> 02:31:15.530
<v Speaker 3>unless you stop fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to just deal with this and then</v>

3600
02:31:15.531 --> 02:31:20.531
<v Speaker 3>once you're done competing then do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just left it alone but that snore </v>

3601
02:31:20.581 --> 02:31:22.890
<v Speaker 3>really bad and I want to take yoga </v>
<v Speaker 3>class.</v>

3602
02:31:22.891 --> 02:31:25.890
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't breathe out of my nose and </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally I just bit the bullet.</v>

3603
02:31:25.891 --> 02:31:30.891
<v Speaker 3>But after I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a youtube video about it because </v>

3604
02:31:30.891 --> 02:31:30.891
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

3605
02:31:30.891 --> 02:31:31.680
<v Speaker 3>all these people saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like really bad.</v>

3606
02:31:32.010 --> 02:31:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck.</v>

3607
02:31:32.730 --> 02:31:34.650
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing.</v>

3608
02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:37.970
<v Speaker 3>The iteration was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did they like to do?</v>

3609
02:31:37.971 --> 02:31:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Put you under?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3610
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:40.950
<v Speaker 3>but when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody's like,</v>

3611
02:31:40.951 --> 02:31:42.450
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so awful.</v>

3612
02:31:42.451 --> 02:31:44.430
<v Speaker 3>You're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Break your nose.</v>

3613
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:48.130
<v Speaker 3>They definitely get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like break it and reset it though.</v>

3614
02:31:48.140 --> 02:31:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's broken up here like you could </v>

3615
02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:53.140
<v Speaker 3>feel like it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where was.</v>

3616
02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:55.780
<v Speaker 3>I broke it when I was five was the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time I broke it.</v>

3617
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:57.930
<v Speaker 3>I broke it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many times after that,</v>

3618
02:31:57.931 --> 02:32:00.840
<v Speaker 3>but the inside was where it was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

3619
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:05.870
<v Speaker 3>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said it was one of the worst </v>

3620
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:05.870
<v Speaker 3>you've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3621
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:05.870
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing has been broken a lot.</v>

3622
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Said I don't know how many times you </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke and I'm like,</v>

3623
02:32:07.621 --> 02:32:09.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't know either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean a.</v>

3624
02:32:09.210 --> 02:32:11.830
<v Speaker 3>compare my nose though to like vandelay.</v>

3625
02:32:12.310 --> 02:32:17.310
<v Speaker 3>You remember when Vandelay vandelays one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those guys where if you look at </v>

3626
02:32:17.310 --> 02:32:19.450
<v Speaker 3>vandelays first fight everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3627
02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:22.980
<v Speaker 3>So he had to get his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does Nick Diaz,</v>

3628
02:32:23.010 --> 02:32:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Nick Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bone shaved down and he had scar tissue </v>

3629
02:32:28.010 --> 02:32:28.010
<v Speaker 3>removed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with Vandelay,</v>

3630
02:32:28.010 --> 02:32:32.540
<v Speaker 3>he probably had that done too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had a bunch of scar tissue </v>

3631
02:32:32.540 --> 02:32:36.151
<v Speaker 3>removed because he had so much scar </v>
<v Speaker 3>tissue that his eyes were drooping like </v>

3632
02:32:36.151 --> 02:32:39.120
<v Speaker 3>severely and his nose was flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just flatten.</v>

3633
02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:44.150
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he had a piece of cartilage removed </v>

3634
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:47.331
<v Speaker 3>from his rib and then they redid his </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose and he had his nose made big so </v>

3635
02:32:47.491 --> 02:32:52.491
<v Speaker 3>that he could breathe out of it better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he like had the license while he </v>

3636
02:32:52.491 --> 02:32:52.491
<v Speaker 3>was still fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3637
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when he fought in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC?</v>

3638
02:32:55.050 --> 02:32:57.930
<v Speaker 3>He looked one way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought chuck and then like he,</v>

3639
02:32:58.050 --> 02:33:00.180
<v Speaker 3>he looked like a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

3640
02:33:00.650 --> 02:33:05.650
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even notice the nose because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so focused on like the bone </v>

3641
02:33:05.650 --> 02:33:05.790
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like that maybe he had a lot</v>

3642
02:33:05.791 --> 02:33:06.420
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3643
02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:11.580
<v Speaker 3>he's crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've traded as Jim before madman.</v>

3644
02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:14.880
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all all Alec tries to kill people.</v>

3645
02:33:14.940 --> 02:33:15.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3646
02:33:15.601 --> 02:33:20.601
<v Speaker 3>he finds there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no sparring with vandelay </v>

3647
02:33:20.601 --> 02:33:20.601
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3648
02:33:20.601 --> 02:33:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to people that spar with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they were like,</v>

3649
02:33:21.781 --> 02:33:24.570
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just kills people.</v>

3650
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Like no mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like give me mark mark,</v>

3651
02:33:29.390 --> 02:33:34.390
<v Speaker 3>that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was like more of a Russian </v>

3652
02:33:34.390 --> 02:33:34.390
<v Speaker 3>accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what he sounds like it,</v>

3653
02:33:34.390 --> 02:33:37.600
<v Speaker 3>but it was like mean like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to fight and there we go.</v>

3654
02:33:40.410 --> 02:33:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Just making really mean until like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's chewing through his training </v>

3655
02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:45.410
<v Speaker 3>partners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was like.</v>

3656
02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:47.310
<v Speaker 3>That guy got fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really did.</v>

3657
02:33:47.311 --> 02:33:52.311
<v Speaker 3>I was so upset with when they tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give him a lifetime ban and you know </v>

3658
02:33:52.311 --> 02:33:56.570
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they did was really wrong and sent </v>

3659
02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:57.180
<v Speaker 3>him on his tail tailspin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he sent a bunch of crazy shit about</v>

3660
02:33:57.181 --> 02:34:02.181
<v Speaker 3>the UFC and it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing made me really sad </v>

3661
02:34:02.181 --> 02:34:02.850
<v Speaker 3>because they were trying to make an </v>
<v Speaker 3>example out of him.</v>

3662
02:34:02.851 --> 02:34:05.730
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy never failed a drug test.</v>

3663
02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:07.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who the fuck knows what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing.</v>

3664
02:34:07.950 --> 02:34:11.250
<v Speaker 3>He definitely did some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in pride for 100 percent.</v>

3665
02:34:11.570 --> 02:34:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean when he fought cro cop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was 218 pounds,</v>

3666
02:34:14.550 --> 02:34:15.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not from creatine.</v>

3667
02:34:16.250 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 3>He did some shit 100 percent right,</v>

3668
02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:21.640
<v Speaker 4>but back then you were allowed to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want in the UFC.</v>

3669
02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:23.470
<v Speaker 4>He never pissed hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never got caught.</v>

3670
02:34:23.650 --> 02:34:28.650
<v Speaker 4>So to have this one time where he ran </v>
<v Speaker 4>away from a drug test and to say that </v>

3671
02:34:28.871 --> 02:34:30.880
<v Speaker 4>he's banned for life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so ridiculous.</v>

3672
02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:35.960
<v Speaker 4>It was just a total abuse of power and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>really callous abuse by these people </v>

3673
02:34:36.911 --> 02:34:41.911
<v Speaker 4>that are a part of the commission </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they are responsible for this </v>

3674
02:34:41.911 --> 02:34:46.171
<v Speaker 4>guy's livelihood and they just decided </v>
<v Speaker 4>to treat him as an example and not </v>

3675
02:34:46.171 --> 02:34:49.921
<v Speaker 4>respect him as a pioneer of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What my thought is you should treat him </v>

3676
02:34:51.011 --> 02:34:53.830
<v Speaker 4>as if he pissed hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look you randomly from a test,</v>

3677
02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:55.780
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're automatically pits and hot.</v>

3678
02:34:55.781 --> 02:34:59.530
<v Speaker 4>So it would be like nine months and </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead they said life.</v>

3679
02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:01.630
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is crazy.</v>

3680
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:04.370
<v Speaker 4>You can't take away a man's livelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3681
02:35:04.390 --> 02:35:05.380
<v Speaker 4>He would've been better if he.</v>

3682
02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:10.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if he would've pissed hot </v>

3683
02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:10.540
<v Speaker 4>technically yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but much better.</v>

3684
02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:10.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much better.</v>

3685
02:35:10.931 --> 02:35:15.931
<v Speaker 4>If you had been back fighting already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd be already scheduled right now in </v>

3686
02:35:15.931 --> 02:35:19.441
<v Speaker 4>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He probably be still in the UFC and </v>

3687
02:35:19.441 --> 02:35:21.991
<v Speaker 4>still fighting and now I guess he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to fight for Bella tour and he's </v>

3688
02:35:21.991 --> 02:35:24.850
<v Speaker 4>got a fight overseas because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>reduced to suspension to like,</v>

3689
02:35:24.851 --> 02:35:29.851
<v Speaker 4>I think they gave him a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that or maybe even </v>

3690
02:35:29.851 --> 02:35:30.080
<v Speaker 4>less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the time,</v>

3691
02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:34.660
<v Speaker 4>a fight career that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're 38 as it is,</v>

3692
02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:36.520
<v Speaker 4>we want to see 38.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got to be right.</v>

3693
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:37.690
<v Speaker 4>Thirty seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>38.</v>

3694
02:35:38.470 --> 02:35:42.160
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so weird too because the trt thing,</v>

3695
02:35:42.161 --> 02:35:47.161
<v Speaker 4>which was around for quite a few years </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you saw the rejuvenation of Vituro </v>

3696
02:35:47.161 --> 02:35:49.120
<v Speaker 4>and Dan Henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys that were on trt,</v>

3697
02:35:49.121 --> 02:35:52.550
<v Speaker 4>that all of a sudden started doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>really well again and just,</v>

3698
02:35:52.990 --> 02:35:54.820
<v Speaker 4>it's such a gray area like.</v>

3699
02:35:55.100 --> 02:35:57.630
<v Speaker 4>And then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gets removed and then like a,</v>

3700
02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:01.120
<v Speaker 4>everybody's got to go back to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal hormone secretion.</v>

3701
02:36:01.530 --> 02:36:02.030
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3702
02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:04.230
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel about the band?</v>

3703
02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:06.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3704
02:36:06.970 --> 02:36:07.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3705
02:36:07.601 --> 02:36:09.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't like weigh ins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

3706
02:36:09.601 --> 02:36:14.601
<v Speaker 4>this is what I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we have to move away from </v>

3707
02:36:14.601 --> 02:36:17.731
<v Speaker 4>this weight cutting thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a difference between this sport </v>

3708
02:36:17.731 --> 02:36:20.791
<v Speaker 4>in any sport other than boxing and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that the head trauma aspect of it </v>

3709
02:36:21.251 --> 02:36:24.160
<v Speaker 4>makes wayans 24 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Extremely problematic.</v>

3710
02:36:24.161 --> 02:36:26.410
<v Speaker 4>When we understand the science of </v>
<v Speaker 4>rehydrating,</v>

3711
02:36:26.411 --> 02:36:28.900
<v Speaker 4>the brain can take as much as 70 plus </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>

3712
02:36:29.410 --> 02:36:32.380
<v Speaker 4>so that to me says that we're doing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad thing.</v>

3713
02:36:32.650 --> 02:36:35.920
<v Speaker 4>We were doing this silly thing and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>letting fighters compete.</v>

3714
02:36:35.921 --> 02:36:40.921
<v Speaker 4>Compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if someone like you and someone </v>

3715
02:36:40.921 --> 02:36:41.050
<v Speaker 4>like holly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are a similar size.</v>

3716
02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:44.650
<v Speaker 4>I think you guys should make an </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreement and the UFC should say,</v>

3717
02:36:44.651 --> 02:36:45.180
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3718
02:36:45.181 --> 02:36:46.360
<v Speaker 4>Neesha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you weigh right now?</v>

3719
02:36:46.361 --> 02:36:48.610
<v Speaker 4>You wait like 1:46</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in peak condition.</v>

3720
02:36:48.611 --> 02:36:49.540
<v Speaker 4>What do you weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A One?</v>

3721
02:36:49.541 --> 02:36:51.130
<v Speaker 4>40 three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holly,</v>

3722
02:36:51.220 --> 02:36:53.170
<v Speaker 4>are you cool with 1:43?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3723
02:36:53.171 --> 02:36:55.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well let's just way you guys during camp</v>

3724
02:36:55.750 --> 02:37:00.750
<v Speaker 4>will weigh you guys sporadically and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll give you a couple of pounds to </v>

3725
02:37:00.750 --> 02:37:04.141
<v Speaker 4>play with because realistically the </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between a 143 pound person </v>

3726
02:37:04.141 --> 02:37:06.100
<v Speaker 4>and 145 pound person is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

3727
02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:07.480
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

3728
02:37:07.481 --> 02:37:10.150
<v Speaker 4>it's not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as long as no one's dehydrated.</v>

3729
02:37:10.151 --> 02:37:13.090
<v Speaker 4>Let's take hydration level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting concept though,</v>

3730
02:37:13.091 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 4>but think about this for minute </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling week classes typically</v>

3731
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.820
<v Speaker 6>are typically about five pounds apart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you get into the bigger ones.</v>

3732
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:25.150
<v Speaker 6>So in theory five pounds makes a big </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference if when you're talking about </v>

3733
02:37:25.150 --> 02:37:27.620
<v Speaker 6>manipulating someone else's weight </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you're five pounds less,</v>

3734
02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:30.620
<v Speaker 6>but they're five pounds more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's almost like if you think about a</v>

3735
02:37:30.621 --> 02:37:35.621
<v Speaker 6>double,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like in my mind it's almost like a </v>

3736
02:37:35.621 --> 02:37:37.730
<v Speaker 6>double five pounds can be a lot if </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of wrestling striking.</v>

3737
02:37:37.731 --> 02:37:39.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>

3738
02:37:39.351 --> 02:37:44.351
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu maybe not as much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but maybe getting someone to the ground </v>

3739
02:37:44.351 --> 02:37:46.130
<v Speaker 6>or being able to sweep someone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the commander sound like a lot.</v>

3740
02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:48.170
<v Speaker 6>It depends how.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3741
02:37:48.171 --> 02:37:53.171
<v Speaker 6>it depends how big you are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Five pounds to a 300 pound person isn't </v>

3742
02:37:53.171 --> 02:37:53.171
<v Speaker 6>that much?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Five pounds to 100.</v>

3743
02:37:53.171 --> 02:37:58.030
<v Speaker 6>15 pound version is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a bigger percentage of their body </v>

3744
02:37:58.030 --> 02:37:58.030
<v Speaker 6>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a big point.</v>

3745
02:37:58.030 --> 02:37:59.690
<v Speaker 6>Like when you're talking about like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>straw weight or something like that.</v>

3746
02:37:59.691 --> 02:38:02.690
<v Speaker 6>That's a great point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think actually I think holly walks</v>

3747
02:38:02.691 --> 02:38:04.730
<v Speaker 6>around like someone 60 something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does she,</v>

3748
02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:08.120
<v Speaker 6>she's pretty big girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I just feel like she is.</v>

3749
02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could tell she,</v>

3750
02:38:10.110 --> 02:38:15.110
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like there's gotta be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better way to organize weight classes </v>

3751
02:38:15.470 --> 02:38:20.470
<v Speaker 3>and I just don't know if forcing someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>like holly to compromise your body to </v>

3752
02:38:20.470 --> 02:38:23.750
<v Speaker 3>get down to 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then rehydrate up to like 1:50</v>

3753
02:38:23.751 --> 02:38:24.590
<v Speaker 3>or whatever she does</v>

3754
02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:29.720
<v Speaker 6>came into to the whole play because of </v>
<v Speaker 6>like bedding me,</v>

3755
02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:31.200
<v Speaker 6>like back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what they would like.</v>

3756
02:38:31.210 --> 02:38:33.790
<v Speaker 6>Want to show off the fighters and get </v>
<v Speaker 6>people to bet on him.</v>

3757
02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:36.280
<v Speaker 6>Like who do you think's gonna win.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was kind of like more of a showing</v>

3758
02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:39.640
<v Speaker 6>than really like a way in like look how </v>
<v Speaker 6>big this guy is.</v>

3759
02:38:39.641 --> 02:38:41.500
<v Speaker 6>He weighs this much and look how big </v>
<v Speaker 6>this one.</v>

3760
02:38:41.501 --> 02:38:46.501
<v Speaker 6>Which one do you think's gonna win?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they would get people to bet and </v>

3761
02:38:46.501 --> 02:38:48.090
<v Speaker 6>that's Kinda how wins came about the day</v>
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>

3762
02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:53.100
<v Speaker 6>Try to try to get people interested in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fights instead of to both the </v>

3763
02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:53.100
<v Speaker 6>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3764
02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:57.150
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's their shirts off and get them on a </v>

3765
02:38:57.150 --> 02:38:57.150
<v Speaker 6>scale and show how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3766
02:38:57.150 --> 02:38:57.150
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3767
02:38:57.150 --> 02:38:58.090
<v Speaker 6>the size difference or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3768
02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:00.010
<v Speaker 6>So it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They used to do the day of the fight.</v>

3769
02:39:00.190 --> 02:39:01.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>

3770
02:39:01.450 --> 02:39:04.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure about boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was the day of the fight.</v>

3771
02:39:04.530 --> 02:39:09.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure though that that's like </v>

3772
02:39:09.530 --> 02:39:11.460
<v Speaker 6>where that kind of came in and then I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think they started making more weight </v>

3773
02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:14.380
<v Speaker 6>classes and that's how it got got like </v>
<v Speaker 6>more specific,</v>

3774
02:39:14.381 --> 02:39:17.260
<v Speaker 6>like you have to be a certain way and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>understand that you want to wait,</v>

3775
02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:19.870
<v Speaker 6>you want people to be within a certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>weight of each other,</v>

3776
02:39:20.350 --> 02:39:24.970
<v Speaker 6>but then the problem is like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no way to really monitor that,</v>

3777
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:27.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like some people blow up but tween their</v>

3778
02:39:27.971 --> 02:39:30.520
<v Speaker 6>camps and other people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3779
02:39:30.521 --> 02:39:32.410
<v Speaker 6>And how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3780
02:39:32.411 --> 02:39:33.600
<v Speaker 6>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you really regularly,</v>

3781
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:35.080
<v Speaker 6>like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if I said,</v>

3782
02:39:35.081 --> 02:39:36.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I walk around at 1:47</v>

3783
02:39:36.701 --> 02:39:37.630
<v Speaker 6>and holly's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3784
02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:39.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I walk around at one 62.</v>

3785
02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:41.650
<v Speaker 6>Then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well then you can't fight each other.</v>

3786
02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:42.520
<v Speaker 6>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's like,</v>

3787
02:39:42.521 --> 02:39:47.521
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I die it and I do this and it come </v>

3788
02:39:47.521 --> 02:39:47.610
<v Speaker 6>down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can make the same weight as as Misha.</v>

3789
02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:52.640
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how much does she cut though that she </v>

3790
02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:52.640
<v Speaker 6>cut way more than you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or does she lower her body?</v>

3791
02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:57.391
<v Speaker 6>Was sure she lowers the body way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to guess and say she probably </v>

3792
02:39:58.481 --> 02:40:02.260
<v Speaker 6>cuts from about one to 50 what I could </v>
<v Speaker 6>be wrong.</v>

3793
02:40:02.530 --> 02:40:07.530
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're only dealing with a few </v>

3794
02:40:07.530 --> 02:40:07.530
<v Speaker 3>different pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3795
02:40:07.530 --> 02:40:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Like would you say you're like 1:46,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one seven.</v>

3796
02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:09.900
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with three pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3797
02:40:10.090 --> 02:40:11.680
<v Speaker 3>So that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not bad,</v>

3798
02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 3>but that's not cutting weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not</v>

3799
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:16.590
<v Speaker 4>dehydrating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we need to measure the amount of</v>

3800
02:40:16.591 --> 02:40:18.540
<v Speaker 4>hydration that's in the body.</v>

3801
02:40:18.570 --> 02:40:23.570
<v Speaker 6>Then what you do is what they instilled </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the wrestling programs in high </v>

3802
02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:26.841
<v Speaker 6>schools essentially they way you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you also have to pee into a cup and </v>

3803
02:40:26.841 --> 02:40:31.281
<v Speaker 6>you have to be a certain amount hydrated</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they tell you you can't go </v>

3804
02:40:31.281 --> 02:40:34.020
<v Speaker 6>below a certain weight because that </v>
<v Speaker 6>would mean you're dehydrating yourself.</v>

3805
02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:38.040
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's definitely a smart scale.</v>

3806
02:40:38.041 --> 02:40:43.041
<v Speaker 6>And then like also you have to test the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hydration of your urine and so you'd be </v>

3807
02:40:43.041 --> 02:40:44.520
<v Speaker 6>able,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that would be really the only way</v>

3808
02:40:44.521 --> 02:40:49.170
<v Speaker 6>to ensure people are not dehydrating </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves to make a weight.</v>

3809
02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:51.700
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise you do have to be the same way</v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

3810
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:52.970
<v Speaker 6>I mean to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be fair,</v>

3811
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:56.970
<v Speaker 6>to have 135 pound title,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'd be 135 pounds.</v>

3812
02:40:56.971 --> 02:40:57.720
<v Speaker 6>Like you know,</v>

3813
02:40:58.910 --> 02:41:02.210
<v Speaker 4>it should probably be a diet thing more </v>
<v Speaker 4>than a dehydration thing.</v>

3814
02:41:02.450 --> 02:41:04.340
<v Speaker 4>I just think that also would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

3815
02:41:04.430 --> 02:41:09.430
<v Speaker 4>it's such a dangerous sport already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to add this extremely dangerous </v>

3816
02:41:09.430 --> 02:41:13.301
<v Speaker 4>weight cutting aspect to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the guy in Brazil who died last </v>

3817
02:41:13.301 --> 02:41:13.301
<v Speaker 4>year from weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3818
02:41:13.301 --> 02:41:18.220
<v Speaker 4>That can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's happened in high school </v>

3819
02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:20.600
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in college wrestling and it's </v>

3820
02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:20.600
<v Speaker 4>happened in mma a few times now.</v>

3821
02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:21.150
<v Speaker 6>It's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3822
02:41:21.151 --> 02:41:24.330
<v Speaker 6>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the ivy ban from my understanding is</v>

3823
02:41:24.331 --> 02:41:26.190
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of silly because they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they say like,</v>

3824
02:41:26.191 --> 02:41:26.850
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3825
02:41:26.851 --> 02:41:29.940
<v Speaker 6>because it can mask like a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>was it epo</v>

3826
02:41:30.050 --> 02:41:31.700
<v Speaker 4>or something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can mask certain type.</v>

3827
02:41:31.730 --> 02:41:36.730
<v Speaker 4>You have to talk to Novitsky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it can mask certain types of </v>

3828
02:41:36.730 --> 02:41:36.730
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>

3829
02:41:36.730 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 6>So from my understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I understand is that cyclist use to</v>

3830
02:41:40.201 --> 02:41:45.201
<v Speaker 6>use it like right before they knew that </v>
<v Speaker 6>the person was going to come and test </v>

3831
02:41:45.201 --> 02:41:47.901
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would hyperhydrate their blood so </v>

3832
02:41:47.901 --> 02:41:49.971
<v Speaker 6>that it would look like it was a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a normal consistency or whatever </v>

3833
02:41:50.130 --> 02:41:50.760
<v Speaker 6>level.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3834
02:41:50.761 --> 02:41:53.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He crit levels that they would be d hi.</v>

3835
02:41:53.270 --> 02:41:53.660
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>high.</v>

3836
02:41:53.670 --> 02:41:54.630
<v Speaker 6>Oh hyperhydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3837
02:41:54.631 --> 02:41:56.070
<v Speaker 6>there wouldn't be as much when they </v>
<v Speaker 6>would draw it,</v>

3838
02:41:56.700 --> 02:42:01.700
<v Speaker 6>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is in our sport where first of all were </v>

3839
02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:04.260
<v Speaker 6>monitored for at least probably three </v>
<v Speaker 6>hours before a fight.</v>

3840
02:42:04.350 --> 02:42:09.350
<v Speaker 6>We're taking the venue in it and a </v>
<v Speaker 6>commissioner does not leave our side at </v>

3841
02:42:09.350 --> 02:42:09.480
<v Speaker 6>all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way to like cheat.</v>

3842
02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:11.280
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to ivy up for,</v>

3843
02:42:11.281 --> 02:42:12.570
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>real quick,</v>

3844
02:42:12.571 --> 02:42:13.130
<v Speaker 6>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3845
02:42:13.140 --> 02:42:14.610
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they're in the bathroom with you.</v>

3846
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:18.690
<v Speaker 6>You're completely monitored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I feel like maybe if they were going</v>

3847
02:42:18.691 --> 02:42:23.691
<v Speaker 6>to abandon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe they could do under like a </v>

3848
02:42:23.691 --> 02:42:25.071
<v Speaker 6>medical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you need an Ivy afterwards and </v>

3849
02:42:25.071 --> 02:42:25.230
<v Speaker 6>you have to go to the hospital and get </v>
<v Speaker 6>one administered or something like there</v>

3850
02:42:25.231 --> 02:42:30.231
<v Speaker 6>could be a way around it because the </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing about cyclists and other sports </v>

3851
02:42:30.231 --> 02:42:30.720
<v Speaker 6>that they banned it and then they just </v>
<v Speaker 6>transferred it over to mma.</v>

3852
02:42:30.721 --> 02:42:33.260
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't add up because we do cut </v>
<v Speaker 6>weight,</v>

3853
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:38.900
<v Speaker 6>you know that I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes sense or not taking that into </v>

3854
02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:38.900
<v Speaker 6>account.</v>

3855
02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:43.500
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that I would say is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing by the ban is keeping</v>

3856
02:42:44.140 --> 02:42:48.190
<v Speaker 4>their checking plastics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that plastic residue that comes from the</v>

3857
02:42:48.191 --> 02:42:52.090
<v Speaker 4>tubes into your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that could be from blood doping.</v>

3858
02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:57.630
<v Speaker 4>So blood doping could be one way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could have an advantage in illegal </v>

3859
02:42:57.630 --> 02:43:00.310
<v Speaker 4>advantage over your opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they could eliminate blood doping by</v>

3860
02:43:00.311 --> 02:43:03.030
<v Speaker 4>eliminating ivs because this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3861
02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:08.120
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the small trace amount of plastics that </v>

3862
02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:08.710
<v Speaker 4>show up in your blood from use of an ivy</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the bag and the,</v>

3863
02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:10.330
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tube and all that stuff.</v>

3864
02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 4>You could use</v>

3865
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:15.820
<v Speaker 3>that with blood and gain an endurance </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage over your opponent.</v>

3866
02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:22.420
<v Speaker 3>You're saying by by using the ivy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting like injecting like an epo is </v>

3867
02:43:22.661 --> 02:43:26.470
<v Speaker 3>that you're saying by blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by putting blood like blood doping,</v>

3868
02:43:26.471 --> 02:43:27.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood doping,</v>

3869
02:43:27.281 --> 02:43:31.360
<v Speaker 3>you take blood out of your body your way</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and then once you weigh in,</v>

3870
02:43:31.580 --> 02:43:36.580
<v Speaker 3>when they reintroduce that blood back in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body have much more blood because </v>

3871
02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:36.970
<v Speaker 3>your body's replenish the blood that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>missing.</v>

3872
02:43:37.270 --> 02:43:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Now you all of a sudden have a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance advantage.</v>

3873
02:43:40.860 --> 02:43:45.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what epo replicates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What epo replicates is what they were </v>

3874
02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:48.520
<v Speaker 3>getting by just blood doping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what blood doping.</v>

3875
02:43:48.540 --> 02:43:50.350
<v Speaker 3>It's just pulling blood out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

3876
02:43:50.351 --> 02:43:53.590
<v Speaker 3>storing it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you put your own blood.</v>

3877
02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never heard of this?</v>

3878
02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of evo,</v>

3879
02:43:56.141 --> 02:43:57.270
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3880
02:43:57.271 --> 02:43:58.420
<v Speaker 3>that's what EPO is.</v>

3881
02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:03.160
<v Speaker 3>Epo is a drug that stimulates your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like you were at a high altitude.</v>

3882
02:44:03.161 --> 02:44:08.161
<v Speaker 3>I knew about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't think about like taking </v>

3883
02:44:08.161 --> 02:44:08.161
<v Speaker 3>your own blood out and putting it back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

3884
02:44:08.161 --> 02:44:09.550
<v Speaker 3>You just have too much blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3885
02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:14.580
<v Speaker 3>you would have too much blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but temporarily it gives you a big </v>

3886
02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:17.491
<v Speaker 3>endurance advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually your body brings your blood </v>

3887
02:44:17.491 --> 02:44:18.300
<v Speaker 3>back to baseline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what he was doing with epo is</v>

3888
02:44:18.301 --> 02:44:23.301
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is accelerating the amount of red blood </v>

3889
02:44:23.301 --> 02:44:26.311
<v Speaker 3>cells of your body produces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What blood doping is doing is </v>

3890
02:44:26.311 --> 02:44:29.641
<v Speaker 3>reintroducing blood that you pulled out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once your body's replenished that </v>

3891
02:44:29.641 --> 02:44:33.811
<v Speaker 3>missing blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're throwing even more blood in </v>

3892
02:44:33.811 --> 02:44:36.691
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably actually safer than the </v>

3893
02:44:36.691 --> 02:44:38.950
<v Speaker 3>EPO.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Epo can cause strokes and a epo is,</v>

3894
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:40.540
<v Speaker 3>is tricky stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3895
02:44:40.750 --> 02:44:42.820
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also a drug that,</v>

3896
02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:47.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fighters have gotten caught </v>

3897
02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:47.840
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

3898
02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Well I thought because I didn't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>

3899
02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:49.960
<v Speaker 3>but I thought epo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that like you can tell when it's,</v>

3900
02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I guess like the color of the blood or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something or a little bit different when</v>

3901
02:44:52.901 --> 02:44:55.150
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or when you have epo in your system.</v>

3902
02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Like they can tell if it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3903
02:44:56.951 --> 02:44:58.330
<v Speaker 3>they didn't use to be able to test for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3904
02:44:58.650 --> 02:44:59.890
<v Speaker 3>but now they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they can.</v>

3905
02:45:00.130 --> 02:45:05.130
<v Speaker 3>But I think the two issues with the ivy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main one is the masking of other </v>

3906
02:45:07.631 --> 02:45:12.631
<v Speaker 3>performance enhancing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but another one is the possibility of </v>

3907
02:45:12.631 --> 02:45:14.860
<v Speaker 3>using these bags and these tubes to add </v>
<v Speaker 3>additional blood to your body.</v>

3908
02:45:15.350 --> 02:45:18.040
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've also been told that that can be</v>

3909
02:45:18.041 --> 02:45:23.041
<v Speaker 3>worked around with a glass syringe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a glass container for the blood or </v>

3910
02:45:25.991 --> 02:45:28.930
<v Speaker 3>or ivy fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if that's true either.</v>

3911
02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:30.940
<v Speaker 3>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3912
02:45:30.941 --> 02:45:35.941
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be a lot of moves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>countermoves Novitsky was saying that </v>

3913
02:45:37.181 --> 02:45:40.180
<v Speaker 3>they figured out a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone out of animals.</v>

3914
02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:42.010
<v Speaker 3>They're taking testosterone from </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

3915
02:45:42.011 --> 02:45:47.011
<v Speaker 3>It's indistinguishable from the bio </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone that your actual body </v>

3916
02:45:47.011 --> 02:45:48.610
<v Speaker 3>produces versus like the stuff they make</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

3917
02:45:48.970 --> 02:45:53.200
<v Speaker 3>which they make in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratory environment with wild yams.</v>

3918
02:45:53.470 --> 02:45:58.470
<v Speaker 3>That's how they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they make testosterone with </v>

3919
02:45:58.470 --> 02:46:00.961
<v Speaker 3>the yams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why a carbon </v>

3920
02:46:00.961 --> 02:46:03.631
<v Speaker 3>isotope test can differentiate between </v>
<v Speaker 3>exogenous testosterone and testosterone.</v>

3921
02:46:04.041 --> 02:46:06.730
<v Speaker 3>This naturally produced by the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3922
02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:09.340
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know what I mean?</v>

3923
02:46:09.350 --> 02:46:11.660
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with this massive,</v>

3924
02:46:11.690 --> 02:46:15.320
<v Speaker 3>massive sport that's just so crazy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

3925
02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:20.560
<v Speaker 3>And we have to tell you it's there's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>edges that you gain,</v>

3926
02:46:20.810 --> 02:46:25.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean the edge that you got to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about all the strength and conditioning </v>

3927
02:46:25.810 --> 02:46:28.100
<v Speaker 3>that you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the crazy drills you did,</v>

3928
02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:33.280
<v Speaker 3>it all came down to that moment in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifth round where you knew you had to </v>

3929
02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:37.301
<v Speaker 3>take holly down and in that battle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was so touch and go like it was </v>

3930
02:46:37.731 --> 02:46:39.110
<v Speaker 3>like she was countering.</v>

3931
02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:41.180
<v Speaker 3>You were dragging her down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a struggle.</v>

3932
02:46:41.780 --> 02:46:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Any little edge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any little edge there is the difference </v>

3933
02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:47.600
<v Speaker 3>between you walking away the new champ </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you losing a decision.</v>

3934
02:46:48.010 --> 02:46:51.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean any little edge there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where it comes down to people</v>

3935
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:55.280
<v Speaker 3>and that's where people get fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>shady as fuck,</v>

3936
02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:01.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

3937
02:47:01.470 --> 02:47:03.740
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be the hardest feeling in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world though,</v>

3938
02:47:03.741 --> 02:47:08.741
<v Speaker 3>to know that the reason why you did when</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be satisfying camper,</v>

3939
02:47:10.030 --> 02:47:13.220
<v Speaker 3>he can't now or if it is then it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like why?</v>

3940
02:47:13.730 --> 02:47:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you do?</v>

3941
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Why would you do a sport like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I dunno.</v>

3942
02:47:17.390 --> 02:47:22.390
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes people do it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they think other people are doing it </v>

3943
02:47:22.390 --> 02:47:22.390
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember Fitch,</v>

3944
02:47:22.390 --> 02:47:23.600
<v Speaker 3>I had a conversation with Fitch wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>

3945
02:47:23.601 --> 02:47:25.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never do anything.</v>

3946
02:47:25.491 --> 02:47:28.250
<v Speaker 3>This is back when testosterone was legal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>

3947
02:47:28.251 --> 02:47:30.230
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do anything until I'm done.</v>

3948
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:31.780
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I'm done fighting is.</v>

3949
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely take hormone </v>

3950
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.790
<v Speaker 3>replacement therapy when I'm older and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this chance.</v>

3951
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:40.601
<v Speaker 3>But right now he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would want to know that I did </v>

3952
02:47:40.601 --> 02:47:43.361
<v Speaker 3>everything I did by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then Fitch pissed hot now.</v>

3953
02:47:43.610 --> 02:47:45.200
<v Speaker 3>Then he got caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3954
02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:50.680
<v Speaker 3>he was fighting Paul Horace and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows Paul might very drawn a </v>

3955
02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:51.950
<v Speaker 3>little something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3956
02:47:51.951 --> 02:47:54.680
<v Speaker 3>And so I think maybe it was one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things where he's like,</v>

3957
02:47:54.681 --> 02:47:56.450
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a level playing field.</v>

3958
02:47:56.510 --> 02:48:01.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna Cheat Myself while this </v>

3959
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:02.250
<v Speaker 3>guy is doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the problem was like,</v>

3960
02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:03.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone says cheating.</v>

3961
02:48:03.711 --> 02:48:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Then you either have to or there's gotta</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a way to combat it.</v>

3962
02:48:06.770 --> 02:48:08.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's the asterix on the pride </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

3963
02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:11.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one thing you have to look at</v>

3964
02:48:11.241 --> 02:48:12.020
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta go man,</v>

3965
02:48:12.021 --> 02:48:12.980
<v Speaker 3>amazing times.</v>

3966
02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:15.740
<v Speaker 3>But who knows what the fuck everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing,</v>

3967
02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:19.100
<v Speaker 3>who knows what everybody was on 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

3968
02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:24.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting and it's really </v>

3969
02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:27.170
<v Speaker 3>interesting that this sport is so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3970
02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:32.240
<v Speaker 3>it's so popular now and there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>riding on it that it really sort of </v>

3971
02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:36.341
<v Speaker 3>highlights all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these moving and pushing of the </v>

3972
02:48:36.341 --> 02:48:37.160
<v Speaker 3>boundaries and trying to achieve an </v>
<v Speaker 3>edge,</v>

3973
02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much can you achieve through </v>

3974
02:48:42.610 --> 02:48:42.610
<v Speaker 3>supplementation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like natural things,</v>

3975
02:48:42.610 --> 02:48:44.930
<v Speaker 3>quarter's eps mushrooms and be 12 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural supplements.</v>

3976
02:48:44.931 --> 02:48:46.910
<v Speaker 3>And how much can you achieve through </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3977
02:48:47.210 --> 02:48:50.270
<v Speaker 3>And how close does it get to illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>means?</v>

3978
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3979
02:48:51.330 --> 02:48:53.720
<v Speaker 3>I think when money gets involved it </v>
<v Speaker 3>always changes things.</v>

3980
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:58.750
<v Speaker 3>State politics changed a lot of changes </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot,</v>

3981
02:48:59.331 --> 02:49:04.331
<v Speaker 3>so people are willing to do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can to get that win and get that </v>

3982
02:49:04.331 --> 02:49:04.331
<v Speaker 3>paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess some people,</v>

3983
02:49:04.331 --> 02:49:09.280
<v Speaker 3>not everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do you have a plan for how long </v>

3984
02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:09.280
<v Speaker 3>you want to do this?</v>

3985
02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:10.570
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to,</v>

3986
02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:14.470
<v Speaker 6>I used to think I had a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That plan went out the window.</v>

3987
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:17.170
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I turned 29.</v>

3988
02:49:17.171 --> 02:49:21.480
<v Speaker 6>I just turned 29 last August.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3989
02:49:21.610 --> 02:49:23.680
<v Speaker 6>I still feel pretty damn good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3990
02:49:23.681 --> 02:49:25.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's weird that I feel that,</v>

3991
02:49:25.170 --> 02:49:30.170
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>technically I've been doing this for 10 </v>

3992
02:49:30.170 --> 02:49:32.041
<v Speaker 6>years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I still feel like I have so much to </v>

3993
02:49:32.041 --> 02:49:32.200
<v Speaker 6>learn and so much to offer and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm learning so quickly.</v>

3994
02:49:32.201 --> 02:49:34.180
<v Speaker 6>Like man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3995
02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:36.340
<v Speaker 6>I talked about the law of diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 6>return,</v>

3996
02:49:36.341 --> 02:49:38.650
<v Speaker 6>all that I don't feel like that applies </v>
<v Speaker 6>to me for some reason.</v>

3997
02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:42.580
<v Speaker 6>Like I still feel like I'm just evolving</v>
<v Speaker 6>so quickly and so rapidly,</v>

3998
02:49:42.581 --> 02:49:47.581
<v Speaker 6>especially with my striking because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>wasn't something I ever focused on </v>

3999
02:49:47.581 --> 02:49:48.400
<v Speaker 6>before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that it sounds weird.</v>

4000
02:49:48.401 --> 02:49:49.960
<v Speaker 6>Like I didn't focus on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You start folks.</v>

4001
02:49:49.980 --> 02:49:54.980
<v Speaker 6>Got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started focusing on it more right </v>

4002
02:49:54.980 --> 02:49:57.520
<v Speaker 6>before I fought Ronda focusing on it.</v>

4003
02:49:58.180 --> 02:50:03.180
<v Speaker 6>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I moved my camp to Las Vegas like </v>

4004
02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:03.670
<v Speaker 6>halfway through that training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was,</v>

4005
02:50:04.270 --> 02:50:08.350
<v Speaker 6>it needed to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was bad timing in that I'm just,</v>

4006
02:50:08.351 --> 02:50:12.040
<v Speaker 6>I'm getting like a couple of new coaches</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we don't have the lingo down yet.</v>

4007
02:50:12.041 --> 02:50:17.041
<v Speaker 6>And it's like a language you learned </v>
<v Speaker 6>between your coaches and we didn't have </v>

4008
02:50:17.041 --> 02:50:17.041
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there was definitely some hiccups.</v>

4009
02:50:17.290 --> 02:50:17.680
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4010
02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:18.340
<v Speaker 6>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4011
02:50:18.341 --> 02:50:20.540
<v Speaker 6>I won firefights and won a title,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4012
02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:22.180
<v Speaker 6>so I think I definitely made the right </v>
<v Speaker 6>move,</v>

4013
02:50:22.181 --> 02:50:25.210
<v Speaker 6>just maybe the timing was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I started focusing on it,</v>

4014
02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:27.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>six weeks before that camp.</v>

4015
02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:29.680
<v Speaker 6>And then since then I've been working </v>
<v Speaker 6>with my coach,</v>

4016
02:50:29.681 --> 02:50:31.750
<v Speaker 6>Jimmy Gifford,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4017
02:50:31.810 --> 02:50:36.810
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's helped me tremendously and </v>

4018
02:50:36.810 --> 02:50:39.301
<v Speaker 6>focused more on my strength and </v>
<v Speaker 6>conditioning actually making a regiment </v>

4019
02:50:39.301 --> 02:50:40.120
<v Speaker 6>and doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing all the things that I guess you're</v>

4020
02:50:40.121 --> 02:50:43.750
<v Speaker 6>supposed to do as a professional athlete</v>
<v Speaker 6>because before what I was doing just was</v>

4021
02:50:43.751 --> 02:50:46.660
<v Speaker 6>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was a little bit ignorant and I worked</v>

4022
02:50:46.661 --> 02:50:49.690
<v Speaker 6>hard but worked harder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not smarter kind of a thing.</v>

4023
02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:52.510
<v Speaker 6>Now I have people back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have a nutritionist,</v>

4024
02:50:52.511 --> 02:50:54.730
<v Speaker 6>I was sports Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>have a strength coach,</v>

4025
02:50:54.731 --> 02:50:59.731
<v Speaker 6>I have a striking coach,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have a to mma coaches and wrestling </v>

4026
02:50:59.731 --> 02:51:03.661
<v Speaker 6>coach and they've got it all like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I feel like I finally figured it </v>

4027
02:51:03.661 --> 02:51:03.661
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Finally,</v>

4028
02:51:03.661 --> 02:51:03.670
<v Speaker 6>have a good gym where I'm at and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything too.</v>

4029
02:51:03.671 --> 02:51:03.970
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

4030
02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it all comes together,</v>

4031
02:51:05.991 --> 02:51:10.991
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is when your dedication matches your </v>

4032
02:51:10.991 --> 02:51:11.210
<v Speaker 3>talent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>matches your focus and your desire.</v>

4033
02:51:11.211 --> 02:51:14.330
<v Speaker 3>And it all comes together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now as a champion,</v>

4034
02:51:14.331 --> 02:51:16.320
<v Speaker 3>do you feel like do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

4035
02:51:16.370 --> 02:51:19.340
<v Speaker 3>do you have more confidence now being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion?</v>

4036
02:51:19.341 --> 02:51:24.341
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you feel like a fucking did it </v>

4037
02:51:24.341 --> 02:51:24.341
<v Speaker 3>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I belong here.</v>

4038
02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:27.440
<v Speaker 6>It's one thing to believe you can and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's another to know you can,</v>

4039
02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:29.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>believing you can.</v>

4040
02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:31.790
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's crucial.</v>

4041
02:51:31.791 --> 02:51:36.791
<v Speaker 6>You have to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's entirely different once you </v>

4042
02:51:36.791 --> 02:51:36.791
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

4043
02:51:36.791 --> 02:51:39.230
<v Speaker 6>and now I know not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only do I know,</v>

4044
02:51:39.231 --> 02:51:41.960
<v Speaker 6>but everyone else knows too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4045
02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:44.360
<v Speaker 6>that's a different feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a whole different animal.</v>

4046
02:51:44.361 --> 02:51:45.830
<v Speaker 6>It's a whole different ballgame.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I,</v>

4047
02:51:45.930 --> 02:51:50.930
<v Speaker 6>something's changed inside me that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>can't explain some things just </v>

4048
02:51:50.930 --> 02:51:51.970
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

4049
02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:53.240
<v Speaker 6>felt like I hit a new level.</v>

4050
02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:55.750
<v Speaker 3>You feel very satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am saying this,</v>

4051
02:51:55.751 --> 02:51:56.280
<v Speaker 3>I can tell</v>

4052
02:51:56.400 --> 02:51:58.470
<v Speaker 6>super confident,</v>
<v Speaker 6>super satisfied,</v>

4053
02:51:58.471 --> 02:52:03.471
<v Speaker 6>super confident.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was still hungry or I still feel like </v>

4054
02:52:03.471 --> 02:52:03.471
<v Speaker 6>I have a lot to accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4055
02:52:03.471 --> 02:52:04.350
<v Speaker 6>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I have a really tough match.</v>

4056
02:52:04.351 --> 02:52:07.550
<v Speaker 6>And Amanda definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's mad at Nunez is no joke.</v>

4057
02:52:07.570 --> 02:52:08.920
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's dangerous job.</v>

4058
02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:11.320
<v Speaker 6>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you watch her fight with Julia Budd?</v>

4059
02:52:11.410 --> 02:52:16.410
<v Speaker 6>Strikeforce,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she knocked her out with that one </v>

4060
02:52:16.410 --> 02:52:17.390
<v Speaker 6>punch and Julie Bud was the bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stronger girl and a striker.</v>

4061
02:52:17.860 --> 02:52:18.550
<v Speaker 6>She knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4062
02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:21.810
<v Speaker 6>she's got one punch knockout power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She showed up against a good man.</v>

4063
02:52:22.170 --> 02:52:22.720
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

4064
02:52:22.721 --> 02:52:23.830
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she beat.</v>

4065
02:52:24.610 --> 02:52:25.930
<v Speaker 6>She'd be down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sarah Mcmahon.</v>

4066
02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:27.760
<v Speaker 6>She beat her down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She hit her so hard.</v>

4067
02:52:27.761 --> 02:52:32.761
<v Speaker 6>That just made her on it quit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then she climbed on her back and </v>

4068
02:52:32.761 --> 02:52:32.761
<v Speaker 6>choked her out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4069
02:52:32.761 --> 02:52:32.980
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's good.</v>

4070
02:52:32.981 --> 02:52:35.770
<v Speaker 6>She's well dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's very dangerous.</v>

4071
02:52:36.130 --> 02:52:41.130
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that she might have an issue </v>

4072
02:52:41.130 --> 02:52:42.691
<v Speaker 6>with cardio if I was going to pick out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pick out something that might be </v>

4073
02:52:42.691 --> 02:52:42.880
<v Speaker 6>something you maybe she's not as </v>
<v Speaker 6>efficient in the cage,</v>

4074
02:52:42.881 --> 02:52:43.910
<v Speaker 6>but she's.</v>

4075
02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:45.480
<v Speaker 6>We are working to change that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4076
02:52:45.490 --> 02:52:47.260
<v Speaker 6>she knows this is a five round fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

4077
02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:52.270
<v Speaker 6>I can't rely on someone getting tired.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's never a good game plan.</v>

4078
02:52:52.300 --> 02:52:52.750
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

4079
02:52:52.751 --> 02:52:55.980
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to try to stay out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>harm's way until she gets tired.</v>

4080
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.240
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4081
02:52:56.260 --> 02:52:59.410
<v Speaker 6>she seems to explode and fights and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>drain the gas tank.</v>

4082
02:52:59.580 --> 02:53:02.740
<v Speaker 6>She's trying to stop people and if it </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't work out that way,</v>

4083
02:53:02.741 --> 02:53:07.741
<v Speaker 6>she has a little bit of an issue ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>wins or something or first round </v>

4084
02:53:07.741 --> 02:53:07.741
<v Speaker 6>finishes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's a monster.</v>

4085
02:53:07.741 --> 02:53:08.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very,</v>

4086
02:53:08.501 --> 02:53:11.200
<v Speaker 6>very strong striker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did very physically strong person.</v>

4087
02:53:11.201 --> 02:53:16.201
<v Speaker 6>She's kind of like a brown or black belt</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Jujitsu and a brown or a black belt </v>

4088
02:53:16.201 --> 02:53:16.201
<v Speaker 6>in judo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

4089
02:53:16.201 --> 02:53:16.340
<v Speaker 6>Very well rounded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4090
02:53:16.341 --> 02:53:18.820
<v Speaker 6>There's not that many girls in our </v>
<v Speaker 6>division that are that well rounded.</v>

4091
02:53:19.570 --> 02:53:24.570
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so she doesn't have a lot of holes in </v>

4092
02:53:24.570 --> 02:53:26.161
<v Speaker 6>her game besides,</v>
<v Speaker 6>besides a seeming to hit a wall </v>

4093
02:53:26.161 --> 02:53:26.161
<v Speaker 6>sometimes in a fight and yeah,</v>

4094
02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:30.620
<v Speaker 4>with her as one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>said about holly and the Rhonda fight,</v>

4095
02:53:30.621 --> 02:53:35.621
<v Speaker 4>it's like you look at how accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 4>holly is outside of the UFC and you wait</v>

4096
02:53:36.260 --> 02:53:41.260
<v Speaker 4>until the moment which you could put it </v>
<v Speaker 4>all together inside the octagon and she </v>

4097
02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:43.400
<v Speaker 4>might put it all together inside the </v>
<v Speaker 4>octagon when the moment is the biggest,</v>

4098
02:53:43.580 --> 02:53:45.470
<v Speaker 4>when she has to rise to the occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might,</v>

4099
02:53:45.500 --> 02:53:50.300
<v Speaker 4>when you push her back against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be when you see her at her best</v>

4100
02:53:50.301 --> 02:53:53.210
<v Speaker 4>and it turned out to be exactly that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone like Amanda,</v>

4101
02:53:53.211 --> 02:53:55.340
<v Speaker 4>she's going to realize like this is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

4102
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:57.740
<v Speaker 4>this is the opportunity to put it all </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

4103
02:53:57.930 --> 02:54:02.060
<v Speaker 4>Can't half ass a thing in training thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>with nutrition thing with your mind.</v>

4104
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:05.840
<v Speaker 4>She has to show up 100 percent focused </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so for someone like you,</v>

4105
02:54:06.050 --> 02:54:08.090
<v Speaker 4>you have to look at her like her </v>
<v Speaker 4>potential</v>

4106
02:54:08.110 --> 02:54:12.340
<v Speaker 6>and look at all of all the girl would </v>
<v Speaker 6>beat Sara Mcmann.</v>

4107
02:54:12.341 --> 02:54:13.690
<v Speaker 6>That's the one that I'm training,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4108
02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:16.060
<v Speaker 6>and even better than that girl because </v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to assume she's evolved.</v>

4109
02:54:16.490 --> 02:54:21.490
<v Speaker 6>That's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I've seen her look so I have to </v>

4110
02:54:21.490 --> 02:54:21.490
<v Speaker 6>assume like she's going to be better </v>
<v Speaker 6>than that even.</v>

4111
02:54:21.580 --> 02:54:23.160
<v Speaker 6>Do you have goals</v>

4112
02:54:23.430 --> 02:54:26.340
<v Speaker 4>as far as like what you want to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the title?</v>

4113
02:54:26.670 --> 02:54:30.540
<v Speaker 4>How long do you want to hold it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any thoughts in mind of like</v>

4114
02:54:31.260 --> 02:54:34.540
<v Speaker 4>must be opponents like is getting Rhonda</v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the auction?</v>

4115
02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:36.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's important.</v>

4116
02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:38.530
<v Speaker 6>I need that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that has to happen.</v>

4117
02:54:38.590 --> 02:54:42.130
<v Speaker 6>That's very important to me and I have </v>
<v Speaker 6>Amanda had of me,</v>

4118
02:54:42.131 --> 02:54:45.100
<v Speaker 6>I do not want to look pastor because you</v>
<v Speaker 6>think that would be a huge mistake.</v>

4119
02:54:45.101 --> 02:54:47.380
<v Speaker 6>It's not one that I want to make as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>veteran in my career.</v>

4120
02:54:47.381 --> 02:54:49.370
<v Speaker 6>That would be a rookie move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4121
02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:50.620
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the back of my mind,</v>

4122
02:54:50.621 --> 02:54:53.440
<v Speaker 6>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the fight with Ronda is something I</v>

4123
02:54:53.441 --> 02:54:56.380
<v Speaker 6>want to happen and you don't know when </v>
<v Speaker 6>it will happen.</v>

4124
02:54:56.381 --> 02:55:01.381
<v Speaker 6>It could be anticipated for November.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've heard that be tossed around in the </v>

4125
02:55:01.381 --> 02:55:04.381
<v Speaker 6>UFC that she's planning on coming back </v>
<v Speaker 6>and maybe it might be Madison Square </v>

4126
02:55:04.381 --> 02:55:04.381
<v Speaker 6>Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be great.</v>

4127
02:55:04.381 --> 02:55:06.440
<v Speaker 6>I want to focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to focus on Amanda,</v>

4128
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:08.510
<v Speaker 6>but I know in the back of my mind and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>want,</v>

4129
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:11.120
<v Speaker 6>I want that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I want that to happen.</v>

4130
02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:16.120
<v Speaker 6>I think it's so important to me and my </v>
<v Speaker 6>career to go and beat Ronda and prove </v>

4131
02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:18.230
<v Speaker 6>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I've been an underdog in most of my</v>

4132
02:55:18.231 --> 02:55:23.231
<v Speaker 6>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had been the person that people have </v>

4133
02:55:23.231 --> 02:55:23.360
<v Speaker 6>always counted out in my entire career,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my entire life.</v>

4134
02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:25.940
<v Speaker 6>Most people are telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't,</v>

4135
02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:27.140
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you shouldn't,</v>

4136
02:55:27.141 --> 02:55:29.060
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm,</v>

4137
02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:29.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

4138
02:55:29.751 --> 02:55:31.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm perfectly fine with that.</v>

4139
02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:35.060
<v Speaker 6>I am at the best point in my career and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Rhonda is at the worst.</v>

4140
02:55:35.450 --> 02:55:40.450
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's going through what I've already </v>

4141
02:55:40.450 --> 02:55:42.431
<v Speaker 6>been through time and time again and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>have built myself back up from that </v>

4142
02:55:42.431 --> 02:55:43.670
<v Speaker 6>point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Time and time again.</v>

4143
02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:46.190
<v Speaker 6>I know that I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm confident in that.</v>

4144
02:55:46.191 --> 02:55:51.191
<v Speaker 6>Here I am standing the strongest that </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've ever stood and I've already been </v>

4145
02:55:51.191 --> 02:55:54.461
<v Speaker 6>through that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've already been head kicked and </v>

4146
02:55:54.461 --> 02:55:54.461
<v Speaker 6>knocked out.</v>

4147
02:55:54.461 --> 02:55:54.590
<v Speaker 6>That happened to me before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I picked myself up,</v>

4148
02:55:54.770 --> 02:55:59.770
<v Speaker 6>but pull myself up by my bootstraps,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one foot back in front of the other </v>

4149
02:55:59.770 --> 02:56:00.140
<v Speaker 6>and worked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Got My strike first world title.</v>

4150
02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:05.200
<v Speaker 6>I lost the Toronto pick myself back up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one phone interview the other got </v>

4151
02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:05.510
<v Speaker 6>back on the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fought,</v>

4152
02:56:05.511 --> 02:56:06.110
<v Speaker 6>fought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fought,</v>

4153
02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:08.780
<v Speaker 6>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ronda Rousey was devastated,</v>

4154
02:56:08.781 --> 02:56:13.781
<v Speaker 6>crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thought my world was just falling down </v>

4155
02:56:13.781 --> 02:56:13.781
<v Speaker 6>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Coming to an end,</v>

4156
02:56:14.110 --> 02:56:19.110
<v Speaker 6>pack up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to put one foot in from the </v>

4157
02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.110
<v Speaker 6>other guy back on the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and now here I am,</v>

4158
02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.790
<v Speaker 6>the world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4159
02:56:19.850 --> 02:56:23.870
<v Speaker 6>I know that I'm tough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that I have what it takes to beat</v>

4160
02:56:23.871 --> 02:56:26.180
<v Speaker 6>Ronda.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Many people don't believe that.</v>

4161
02:56:26.330 --> 02:56:28.640
<v Speaker 6>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been in this position before.</v>

4162
02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:30.590
<v Speaker 6>Many most people didn't think I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to beat holly.</v>

4163
02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:32.380
<v Speaker 6>Most people don't think holly was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beat.</v>

4164
02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:34.640
<v Speaker 6>Ronda doesn't matter to me what other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people think.</v>

4165
02:56:34.670 --> 02:56:39.670
<v Speaker 6>It matters what I believe and what I </v>
<v Speaker 6>know and I'm the question mark is how is</v>

4166
02:56:40.721 --> 02:56:45.721
<v Speaker 6>Rhonda going to come back from this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know what I've been hearing from </v>

4167
02:56:45.721 --> 02:56:48.440
<v Speaker 6>Rhonda in the media and the press.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's been a little quiet lately,</v>

4168
02:56:48.441 --> 02:56:53.441
<v Speaker 6>but before that it wasn't what I would </v>
<v Speaker 6>have expected to hear from someone who </v>

4169
02:56:53.441 --> 02:56:55.190
<v Speaker 6>really wants to come back and he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>

4170
02:56:55.191 --> 02:56:58.820
<v Speaker 6>really a fighter at the core.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's a great athlete.</v>

4171
02:56:58.850 --> 02:57:01.040
<v Speaker 6>She's a great fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's accomplished a lot of things.</v>

4172
02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:02.890
<v Speaker 6>Credit where credit's due,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4173
02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:07.900
<v Speaker 6>I give her a round of applause for </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything she's been able to </v>

4174
02:57:07.900 --> 02:57:07.900
<v Speaker 6>accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you what,</v>

4175
02:57:07.900 --> 02:57:12.880
<v Speaker 6>every time I've ever lost in my career,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went bananas to get back in their </v>

4176
02:57:13.490 --> 02:57:14.360
<v Speaker 6>ballistic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

4177
02:57:14.361 --> 02:57:16.970
<v Speaker 6>I have to like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like holly was like,</v>

4178
02:57:17.130 --> 02:57:18.230
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when do you want to fight again?</v>

4179
02:57:18.290 --> 02:57:20.720
<v Speaker 6>Just like tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I meesha.</v>

4180
02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:22.520
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what you want to hear.</v>

4181
02:57:22.521 --> 02:57:25.850
<v Speaker 6>When someone has a devastating loss,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to get back in there right now</v>

4182
02:57:25.851 --> 02:57:28.130
<v Speaker 6>and face that person right now or or </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone else,</v>

4183
02:57:28.131 --> 02:57:30.200
<v Speaker 6>just get that loss of the record.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Erase it.</v>

4184
02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:34.100
<v Speaker 6>When I lost the cat Zingano,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I freaked out.</v>

4185
02:57:34.190 --> 02:57:36.190
<v Speaker 6>I freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I called Sean Shelby and I was like,</v>

4186
02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:39.470
<v Speaker 6>get me another fight right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

4187
02:57:39.471 --> 02:57:41.480
<v Speaker 6>your noses even heal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a fuck.</v>

4188
02:57:41.570 --> 02:57:43.010
<v Speaker 6>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to fight.</v>

4189
02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:48.160
<v Speaker 6>I want it now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to know when it's coming up like </v>

4190
02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:48.800
<v Speaker 6>right now or I'm going to freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what to tell you,</v>

4191
02:57:48.801 --> 02:57:51.610
<v Speaker 6>but I'm going to lose my shit if I don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>have like a fight on the horizon,</v>

4192
02:57:51.620 --> 02:57:53.870
<v Speaker 6>lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I hear Rhonda,</v>

4193
02:57:53.871 --> 02:57:56.780
<v Speaker 6>like I'm going to take a year off and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna.</v>

4194
02:57:57.170 --> 02:57:58.220
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do this.</v>

4195
02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:01.040
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that just doesn't sound like someone who</v>

4196
02:58:01.050 --> 02:58:06.050
<v Speaker 6>really wants this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that fight might've broke </v>

4197
02:58:06.050 --> 02:58:06.050
<v Speaker 6>her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could be wrong,</v>

4198
02:58:06.150 --> 02:58:08.970
<v Speaker 6>but I think something inside of her is </v>
<v Speaker 6>different than it was before.</v>

4199
02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:11.340
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe she's not broken,</v>

4200
02:58:11.341 --> 02:58:12.000
<v Speaker 6>but it's different</v>

4201
02:58:12.290 --> 02:58:17.290
<v Speaker 4>because how much do you think of factor </v>
<v Speaker 4>is how much of a factor do you think </v>

4202
02:58:17.401 --> 02:58:20.850
<v Speaker 4>success is in the park in terms of she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing movies.</v>

4203
02:58:21.150 --> 02:58:26.150
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was a darling always late night </v>

4204
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:28.230
<v Speaker 4>television shows and everybody wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hang out with us doing these commercials</v>

4205
02:58:28.231 --> 02:58:29.720
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4206
02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:33.120
<v Speaker 4>seth rogen on television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how much of a factor is on?</v>

4207
02:58:33.820 --> 02:58:35.170
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she asked security,</v>

4208
02:58:35.171 --> 02:58:37.210
<v Speaker 6>now she has job security outside the </v>
<v Speaker 6>UFC.</v>

4209
02:58:37.211 --> 02:58:42.211
<v Speaker 6>Sushi doesn't really need that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think maybe that's also something </v>

4210
02:58:42.211 --> 02:58:42.850
<v Speaker 6>on her mind is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does she really want this?</v>

4211
02:58:42.851 --> 02:58:45.160
<v Speaker 6>Because winning is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's great.</v>

4212
02:58:45.280 --> 02:58:46.960
<v Speaker 6>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you win,</v>

4213
02:58:46.961 --> 02:58:48.850
<v Speaker 6>everybody loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody supports you.</v>

4214
02:58:48.851 --> 02:58:50.770
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's on your train.</v>

4215
02:58:51.310 --> 02:58:55.780
<v Speaker 6>When you lose fucking sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sucks.</v>

4216
02:58:55.840 --> 02:58:58.540
<v Speaker 6>And only the people that really love </v>
<v Speaker 6>your still really,</v>

4217
02:58:58.541 --> 02:59:00.700
<v Speaker 6>really there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everyone else was just like,</v>

4218
02:59:00.730 --> 02:59:01.780
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the loser,</v>

4219
02:59:01.870 --> 02:59:03.700
<v Speaker 6>and then you have the social media,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4220
02:59:03.701 --> 02:59:08.701
<v Speaker 6>White Knights that come out and want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>tell you what a piece of shit you are </v>

4221
02:59:08.701 --> 02:59:12.091
<v Speaker 6>and how you're never gonna accomplish </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything and you'll never win another </v>

4222
02:59:12.091 --> 02:59:12.091
<v Speaker 6>fight and you might as well just quit </v>
<v Speaker 6>and retire,</v>

4223
02:59:12.091 --> 02:59:12.091
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blah blah.</v>

4224
02:59:12.091 --> 02:59:16.190
<v Speaker 6>So those people and you have to make a </v>
<v Speaker 6>choice,</v>

4225
02:59:16.191 --> 02:59:20.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and my choice is always been the to do,</v>

4226
02:59:20.410 --> 02:59:20.790
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

4227
02:59:20.791 --> 02:59:22.250
<v Speaker 6>to keep fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4228
02:59:22.300 --> 02:59:23.530
<v Speaker 6>to add.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just don't.</v>

4229
02:59:23.610 --> 02:59:28.610
<v Speaker 6>I don't recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of things I recognize in </v>

4230
02:59:28.610 --> 02:59:28.930
<v Speaker 6>Ronda that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can recognize her greatness,</v>

4231
02:59:28.931 --> 02:59:33.931
<v Speaker 6>I can recognize her championship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can recognize things I don't identify </v>

4232
02:59:33.931 --> 02:59:37.090
<v Speaker 6>with that I don't identify with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sitting on that last for a year,</v>

4233
02:59:37.120 --> 02:59:39.100
<v Speaker 6>I cannot understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it was me,</v>

4234
02:59:39.130 --> 02:59:42.350
<v Speaker 6>it would have eaten me alive inside and </v>
<v Speaker 6>out to.</v>

4235
02:59:42.520 --> 02:59:44.680
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't be making a movie.</v>

4236
02:59:44.681 --> 02:59:45.460
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would,</v>

4237
02:59:45.470 --> 02:59:46.330
<v Speaker 6>it would just.</v>

4238
02:59:47.460 --> 02:59:49.060
<v Speaker 4>But does she?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think she has a choice.</v>

4239
02:59:49.270 --> 02:59:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I think if you have movie contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you have to fulfill them.</v>

4240
02:59:52.840 --> 02:59:55.630
<v Speaker 6>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

4241
02:59:55.640 --> 03:00:00.640
<v Speaker 6>does Conrad have to show up for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But showing up for press conferences is </v>

4242
03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:01.010
<v Speaker 6>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think,</v>

4243
03:00:01.160 --> 03:00:03.020
<v Speaker 6>I think she could have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She could have fought because they,</v>

4244
03:00:03.050 --> 03:00:07.430
<v Speaker 6>they said they had anticipated for her </v>
<v Speaker 6>to come back at UFC 200.</v>

4245
03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:12.050
<v Speaker 6>They wanted that and they and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Dana said she could've but should,</v>

4246
03:00:12.051 --> 03:00:14.660
<v Speaker 6>she?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She could have but should she.</v>

4247
03:00:14.770 --> 03:00:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Well I think that could have and should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was because she had to do a movie </v>

4248
03:00:19.770 --> 03:00:20.230
<v Speaker 4>for three months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like doing the movie for three months</v>

4249
03:00:20.231 --> 03:00:22.000
<v Speaker 4>would have taken three months outside of</v>
<v Speaker 4>her camp.</v>

4250
03:00:22.001 --> 03:00:27.001
<v Speaker 4>And you've done a movie before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what it's like you're on the </v>

4251
03:00:27.001 --> 03:00:27.001
<v Speaker 4>set all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's 16 hour days.</v>

4252
03:00:27.001 --> 03:00:28.750
<v Speaker 4>It's long and grueling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have time to train,</v>

4253
03:00:30.220 --> 03:00:35.220
<v Speaker 4>but after a loss like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you really have to have enough </v>

4254
03:00:35.220 --> 03:00:37.450
<v Speaker 4>time to actually focus and then on top </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that to getting,</v>

4255
03:00:37.540 --> 03:00:42.540
<v Speaker 4>getting flatlined like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to have some time to </v>

4256
03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:43.060
<v Speaker 4>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Recover your head.</v>

4257
03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:44.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>

4258
03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:47.790
<v Speaker 6>I just don't know if a year that would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying that would crush me.</v>

4259
03:00:47.791 --> 03:00:49.830
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't be able to do what she's </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing right now.</v>

4260
03:00:50.370 --> 03:00:53.460
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't physically be able to like to</v>
<v Speaker 6>deal with that for years.</v>

4261
03:00:54.350 --> 03:00:56.220
<v Speaker 6>And if I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it would eat me alive.</v>

4262
03:00:56.280 --> 03:01:00.040
<v Speaker 6>Like I think I'd be so depressed and so </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it's eating her alive</v>

4263
03:01:00.130 --> 03:01:05.130
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how do you sit on it for a year </v>

4264
03:01:05.130 --> 03:01:05.130
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you do that?</v>

4265
03:01:05.130 --> 03:01:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Do what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't.</v>

4266
03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4267
03:01:07.031 --> 03:01:08.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all speculation.</v>

4268
03:01:08.350 --> 03:01:10.480
<v Speaker 3>We only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know until she comes back.</v>

4269
03:01:10.910 --> 03:01:12.260
<v Speaker 6>But the other thing too is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4270
03:01:12.290 --> 03:01:13.190
<v Speaker 6>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4271
03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:16.580
<v Speaker 6>she had her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to her downs or her really,</v>

4272
03:01:16.581 --> 03:01:18.440
<v Speaker 6>really low,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I empathize with.</v>

4273
03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:20.250
<v Speaker 6>I've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4274
03:01:20.310 --> 03:01:21.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then she said,</v>

4275
03:01:21.590 --> 03:01:23.180
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking about,</v>

4276
03:01:23.270 --> 03:01:24.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these all these negative thoughts.</v>

4277
03:01:24.861 --> 03:01:26.170
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>

4278
03:01:26.210 --> 03:01:28.430
<v Speaker 6>then I looked up on the hill and she </v>
<v Speaker 6>said this on the Ellen show.</v>

4279
03:01:28.431 --> 03:01:30.760
<v Speaker 6>I looked up and I saw Travis Brown and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>realized,</v>

4280
03:01:30.761 --> 03:01:35.761
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got to stick around to have his </v>

4281
03:01:35.761 --> 03:01:36.971
<v Speaker 6>babies and I thought like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What went through my mind is like I </v>

4282
03:01:36.971 --> 03:01:41.711
<v Speaker 6>gotta get back and get my title back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I gotta get back and win a fight like </v>

4283
03:01:41.711 --> 03:01:45.101
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just seemed like her mindset was </v>

4284
03:01:45.101 --> 03:01:45.110
<v Speaker 6>different than what I would expect a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighter's mindset to be.</v>

4285
03:01:46.250 --> 03:01:48.080
<v Speaker 6>Does that make sense at all?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm trying.</v>

4286
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:53.110
<v Speaker 6>What I'm saying is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it didn't seem like her motivation was </v>

4287
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:54.800
<v Speaker 6>to fight and win again.</v>

4288
03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:56.360
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was other things.</v>

4289
03:01:56.570 --> 03:02:01.570
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm not saying she's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>come back and be great or come back and </v>

4290
03:02:01.570 --> 03:02:05.140
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Questioning that and questioning </v>

4291
03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:07.211
<v Speaker 6>where her true motivation is coming from</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I think while she was winning,</v>

4292
03:02:07.940 --> 03:02:09.560
<v Speaker 6>it was so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like she's like,</v>

4293
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.950
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4294
03:02:09.951 --> 03:02:12.110
<v Speaker 6>I want to keep doing this course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to keep it,</v>

4295
03:02:12.111 --> 03:02:13.940
<v Speaker 6>keep them crushing girls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm demolishing them.</v>

4296
03:02:14.270 --> 03:02:16.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm a star.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All these great things are coming now.</v>

4297
03:02:16.281 --> 03:02:18.070
<v Speaker 6>She already has that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's already making movies.</v>

4298
03:02:18.071 --> 03:02:20.210
<v Speaker 6>She already has millions of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 6>dollars.</v>

4299
03:02:20.810 --> 03:02:23.270
<v Speaker 6>Is Her true motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was it just,</v>

4300
03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:28.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>keeping that undefeated streak because </v>

4301
03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:28.300
<v Speaker 6>she talked about that so much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4302
03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:31.070
<v Speaker 6>I will retire undefeated w and then she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she even said like,</v>

4303
03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:33.950
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm questioning what am I doing now?</v>

4304
03:02:33.951 --> 03:02:34.640
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4305
03:02:34.700 --> 03:02:36.500
<v Speaker 6>now I'm not going to ever retire </v>
<v Speaker 6>undefeated.</v>

4306
03:02:36.501 --> 03:02:37.930
<v Speaker 6>So what is my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4307
03:02:37.980 --> 03:02:39.270
<v Speaker 6>maybe I'm meant for this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I met,</v>

4308
03:02:39.350 --> 03:02:44.350
<v Speaker 6>she doesn't really know that was her </v>
<v Speaker 6>identity was like to be undefeated in </v>

4309
03:02:44.350 --> 03:02:44.350
<v Speaker 6>this sport.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if,</v>

4310
03:02:44.350 --> 03:02:48.060
<v Speaker 6>if that's not the goal anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't know.</v>

4311
03:02:48.061 --> 03:02:53.061
<v Speaker 6>Like I feel like I sent something off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I send something is not right in her </v>

4312
03:02:53.061 --> 03:02:57.341
<v Speaker 6>mindset and I think she's going to come </v>
<v Speaker 6>back and I think she's going to fight </v>

4313
03:02:57.341 --> 03:02:57.341
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She'll fight hard,</v>

4314
03:02:57.341 --> 03:03:01.840
<v Speaker 6>but I just don't know if she still has </v>
<v Speaker 6>it after a brutal loss like that,</v>

4315
03:03:04.340 --> 03:03:06.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if she's still hungry enough.</v>

4316
03:03:06.350 --> 03:03:07.890
<v Speaker 6>Those are fighting words.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Restate.</v>

4317
03:03:08.810 --> 03:03:09.770
<v Speaker 6>Is she $100?</v>

4318
03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:14.800
<v Speaker 3>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing right now is you're </v>

4319
03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:14.880
<v Speaker 3>throwing up the bat signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4320
03:03:15.030 --> 03:03:17.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's how I feel I'm going to down</v>

4321
03:03:17.880 --> 03:03:22.880
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get a lot of shit because people are </v>

4322
03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:22.880
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

4324
03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:22.880
<v Speaker 6>that's not what I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

4325
03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:25.910
<v Speaker 6>I don't apologize for anything that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>say unless I really say it's something </v>

4326
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:29.181
<v Speaker 6>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I didn't mean to say that was </v>

4327
03:03:29.181 --> 03:03:29.181
<v Speaker 6>hurtful to someone and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4328
03:03:29.181 --> 03:03:29.181
<v Speaker 6>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But honestly,</v>

4329
03:03:29.181 --> 03:03:30.390
<v Speaker 6>if it's my opinion is my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you don't like it,</v>

4330
03:03:30.890 --> 03:03:32.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not gonna apologize for my opinion.</v>

4331
03:03:33.090 --> 03:03:38.090
<v Speaker 6>Don't apologize for anything that I have</v>
<v Speaker 6>to say about the way I feel about </v>

4332
03:03:38.090 --> 03:03:38.450
<v Speaker 6>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way I feel about any,</v>

4333
03:03:38.451 --> 03:03:39.820
<v Speaker 6>any of these situations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4334
03:03:39.821 --> 03:03:42.060
<v Speaker 6>so I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be as transparent.</v>

4335
03:03:43.180 --> 03:03:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're saying anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful either and I don't think </v>

4336
03:03:48.180 --> 03:03:50.810
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as a champion and that's what </v>

4337
03:03:50.810 --> 03:03:50.810
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4338
03:03:50.810 --> 03:03:53.890
<v Speaker 3>you're analyzing someone's mindset and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're totally entitled to that.</v>

4339
03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:59.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I have a lot of respect for Rhonda </v>

4340
03:03:59.080 --> 03:03:59.080
<v Speaker 6>was an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4341
03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:00.950
<v Speaker 6>a lot of guys think you'll ever be </v>
<v Speaker 6>friends after all said and done.</v>

4342
03:04:01.510 --> 03:04:03.140
<v Speaker 6>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

4343
03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:08.280
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think she thinks that I've done so </v>

4344
03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:08.510
<v Speaker 6>many things and like she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think she would ever.</v>

4345
03:04:08.750 --> 03:04:11.330
<v Speaker 6>I think she blames me for things that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't even do.</v>

4346
03:04:11.660 --> 03:04:13.370
<v Speaker 6>So that mean how do you even get around </v>
<v Speaker 6>that?</v>

4347
03:04:13.490 --> 03:04:14.180
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4348
03:04:14.181 --> 03:04:16.340
<v Speaker 6>like I heard when you guys did your </v>
<v Speaker 6>interview,</v>

4349
03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:22.300
<v Speaker 6>she said something like that I called a </v>
<v Speaker 6>promotion and like tried to get crispy </v>

4350
03:04:22.300 --> 03:04:25.880
<v Speaker 6>or like mess with him before his fight </v>
<v Speaker 6>or something like that.</v>

4351
03:04:25.890 --> 03:04:30.890
<v Speaker 6>That I guess he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess he was contracted to another </v>

4352
03:04:30.890 --> 03:04:32.210
<v Speaker 6>promotion and he wasn't supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>while he was on the ultimate fighter.</v>

4353
03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:37.300
<v Speaker 6>And I guess that that Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I received a call and then they thought </v>

4354
03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:38.240
<v Speaker 6>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she thought that I did that.</v>

4355
03:04:39.140 --> 03:04:40.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>first of,</v>

4356
03:04:40.700 --> 03:04:45.700
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I didn't even know he signed to </v>

4357
03:04:45.700 --> 03:04:46.040
<v Speaker 6>another organization at all and if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know that can be was,</v>

4358
03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:47.930
<v Speaker 6>it didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't have even crossed my mind.</v>

4359
03:04:47.931 --> 03:04:48.830
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you said,</v>

4360
03:04:48.831 --> 03:04:51.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm too easy going to even think of </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

4361
03:04:51.560 --> 03:04:55.020
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not malicious by any means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have nothing against Krispy.</v>

4362
03:04:55.021 --> 03:05:00.021
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think she thought that I tried to </v>

4363
03:05:00.021 --> 03:05:02.681
<v Speaker 6>like mess with him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I called the promoter of whatever </v>

4364
03:05:02.681 --> 03:05:03.800
<v Speaker 6>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 6>little small contract,</v>

4365
03:05:03.890 --> 03:05:05.570
<v Speaker 6>don't even know how I would have known </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

4366
03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:08.630
<v Speaker 6>How would you even know that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you know?</v>

4367
03:05:08.930 --> 03:05:10.940
<v Speaker 6>But this is the same girl that ripped </v>
<v Speaker 6>page for,</v>

4368
03:05:11.300 --> 03:05:16.300

4369
03:05:16.300 --> 03:05:17.990
<v Speaker 6>she's going to hate me until the day she</v>
<v Speaker 6>dies and I'm okay with that.</v>

4370
03:05:19.010 --> 03:05:21.410

<v Speaker 6>We don't need to be friends.</v>
