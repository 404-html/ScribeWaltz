1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.250
Three,
two,
one.

2
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.280
<v 2>Well,
live.
Well live.
What's up brother?
What's up dude?
How are you Betty?</v>

3
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:18.200
Good.
We got you in here finally,
man.

4
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.040
How many times do we have to talk about this?
Several,
right?
This was,

5
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:25.490
the universe wanted it.
The universe made it happen after the till.
Victory.

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.730
There was a,
that was,
that was a,
for a lot of people,

7
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:33.140
a big coming out party for you.
Why is it?
Yeah,
you were already out,

8
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.510
but that was like,
Holy Shit.
The way you put him out,
it was Whoa,

9
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.760
that was a holy shit moment.
I was going for that moment.

10
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:42.060
That's what I was trying to do.
Yeah.

11
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.540
And you had decision wasn't going to come my way that way.
You know,

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.600
I not to say nothing about,
uh,
the English,
but I,

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.100
I don't like the judging over there.

14
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:52.430
I've seen a lot of decisions go like crooked.

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.080
I don't like decisions in almost every state.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean there's,

16
00:00:57.081 --> 00:01:00.800
there's decisions in almost every athletic commission that you just shake your

17
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:03.350
head out and you don't understand.
What's the worst thing you can think of?

18
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.530
I don't know.
I don't know,
I'd have to sit back and go over the archives,

19
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.100
but I've seen some horrible ones.
Even ones where guys,

20
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.110
when they like barely when you're like,
how the fuck was that close?

21
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.530
Like 29 that kind of shit.
And you're like,
what are the town?
Yeah,

22
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:20.390
there's a lot of those.
And it's getting better though.

23
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:23.990
Cause more fighters every are joining that force,
you know?
I see.

24
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:27.170
Or I hear about fighters they used to fight that are involved in the commissions

25
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.310
at least second Florida and stuff.

26
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:32.300
So I know 10 years from now is going to be nothing but productive people in the

27
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.650
people that know what they're looking at.
You know,
we can only hope that,

28
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.960
I mean that's the number one problem.

29
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:39.530
I think that scoring system sucks to like adopting a ten nine even the new

30
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:43.730
improved scoring systems like MMA is so much different than boxing and to adopt

31
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:47.330
this scoring system just because it already existed for boxing,
you know,

32
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:50.330
that's like adopting the rules of tennis for Ping Pong.

33
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.810
Like the different things.
This is a mafia,

34
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.530
is that what is the boxing thing?
Huh?
Yeah.

35
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.830
Why is a boxing commission governing the MMA commission?

36
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.130
Shouldn't we have our own thing?
Yeah.

37
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.450
I think in some places they just didn't have the infrastructure,
you know?

38
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.340
And nowadays we could do it nowadays for sure.
Yeah.
In most places.
But yeah,

39
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.440
it's um,
mean time to change.
I mean,
you been around for a long time.

40
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.950
My friend,
I remember the first time I ever saw you fight.
It was a,
a backyard,

41
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.020
bare knuckle fight in the Kimbo slice days.

42
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.340
That was the first time I heard about you.

43
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:27.290
And then I saw you fight Eve Edwards and Bodog.
Oh,
dog fight.
Yeah.

44
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.340
It was a golden age.
The golden age is Matt's a while ago.
Damn.
It's crazy.

45
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:35.630
Like Bodog fight was fun.
Organization change.
Alaska has fought there.

46
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.880
Chill son and fought there.
Eddie average.
That's right.
Yeah.

47
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.650
Fade or fade or had a fight over there.
Afraid I had a fight over there.

48
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:46.970
Brad Pickett as well.
Yeah.
I'm Mike Brown.
Yeah.

49
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:49.490
But what happened with them?
They went under because of the,

50
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:52.970
the whole gambling rules online changed right off from what I heard.

51
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:56.840
If no one I heard was a spending budget,
I,
well this is what I,
what I heard,
um,

52
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.040
Calvin air,
there was the owner of both,
right?
He

53
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.390
<v 3>put up this huge budget and these are just rumors from what I heard from the</v>

54
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:08.240
people working,
you know,
but it was like $100 million for Xyz and mine.

55
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.590
I used to get them publicity so people would see the fights and then go to the

56
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.850
casino.
That 100 million got blown out like in two,
three years is what I heard.

57
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.780
Ah,

58
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.160
and I wouldn't disagree cause they used to pay me really good and give us super

59
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.650
perks.
They usually give us some super perks,
you know,

60
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.160
take us to exotic locations to fight,
be there for two weeks,

61
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:29.800
you plus two that flout take care of you.
They really,

62
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.450
really took very good care of me.

63
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.570
So when I heard that they blow out 100 million in three years,
I was like,
yeah,

64
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:35.404
it could be,
you know.

65
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.850
Well they were fighting on the beach with hot girls in bikinis and wandered

66
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.630
around dancing.
But you were on the beach like in the sun.
I was like,

67
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.180
what the fuck is fucking ideas and to fight in the sun.

68
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.700
But let me tell you the training sessions that went on,

69
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.580
there were some of the best that I've seen the world cause they,

70
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.000
so you would go and you'd bring two of your corner man.

71
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.940
And then somebody found that and then before you know you had like four people,

72
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:00.400
if your entourage going with you from whatever team that was.

73
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.720
And everybody was doing that and we'd have a training place in what they had

74
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:08.440
done was laid out tarps and mats and it was huge.

75
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:12.160
So we'd have like a hundred proles 50 pros from all over the world,

76
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:14.800
just training,
you know,
and when you to know each other and it's like,
hey,

77
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:16.510
you want to roll?
You know,
it gets competitive,
you know.

78
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.260
So there was some great training sessions that I saw and that I,

79
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:23.230
that I took a part of,
you know?
Wow.
Yeah.
It was fun,
man.

80
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.990
<v 2>Look,
the,
the world needs more of those.
They meed more one fcs.</v>

81
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:31.710
We need more Bella tours.
We need more,
you know,
composition,

82
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.630
whatever the professional fight league is called now.

83
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:36.960
What did they call themselves now?
Is that what it is?

84
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:40.650
It's Pfl used to be world series of fighting.
That's right.
Yeah.
We need more,

85
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.410
need more of them.
Oh,
so PFLs world series event.

86
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.160
He used to be world series downs.
PFL Okay.
Yeah,
I think pretty sure.

87
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.710
Most of the same organization.
Okay.
Yeah.
Do we need,
we need more,
you know,

88
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.290
I need more money.
Yeah.
That Oscar de la Hoya thing,

89
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.200
you know that that's probably never going to happen again after the,

90
00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:02.550
the Tito and chuck fight and it doesn't just look like,
but someone of that ilk,

91
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.590
someone like a golden boy promotions,

92
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.320
they started getting involved in MMA and putting together,

93
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.760
they get some guys that aren't signed but are super high level with a big name.

94
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:15.690
Like maybe the contract comes up and they decided to do something with a big

95
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:17.940
name promoter.
You know,
it'd be good for everybody.

96
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.140
<v 3>Yeah.
Golden boy tried,
uh,
many years ago,
didn't they?</v>

97
00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:24.590
With reflection was an Oscar part of that.
I remember Oscar Donald Trump.

98
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.040
That's right.
Yeah.
Was a part of affliction and that's right.

99
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.010
<v 2>Josh Barnett sunk that ship.
Josh Brent had tested positive and that ship sunk,</v>

100
00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:39.610
remember?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then the UFC bought it like right afterwards.
Yeah.

101
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.540
Yeah.
That they had some fun fights though.

102
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.030
That fucking Tim Silvia Fade or fight was wild as shit.

103
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.070
<v 3>Andrea at [inaudible] art.
Look at Donald Trump.
He would Thomas</v>

104
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.250
<v 2>10th.
Yeah.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.</v>

105
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.760
Back in the day.
Sun.
Yeah.
Donald Trump and Tim Sylvia.

106
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.200
That's hilarious.
He was a totally different character back then to our troubles.

107
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:05.360
Like a fun guy.
Like everybody liked him.

108
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.360
People liked him.
He'd get cheered on.
Now people are so fucking mad at him.

109
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.350
Same Guy.
I don't see him that when it weren't.

110
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.120
No,
they don't.
They don't,
man.
That's why he has us security around them now.

111
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.490
Oh yeah.
You has to.
Yeah.
You fucked up.
Came President yet.

112
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.420
It's a huge mistake for anybody.
You want to enjoy your life.

113
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.510
Don't be fucking president as has,
you know,

114
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:32.720
he could disappear and get facial surgery or something.
Of course,

115
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.320
once you get that booklet with all the secrets of the history,
just for that,

116
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.020
the CFR book just for that,
what do you think gives you that book?
Is it a,

117
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:45.950
the CIA,
the NSA or who comes to you with the book?
Some guy with no face.
Nothing.

118
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.870
No face.
Yeah,
like a,
the,
the guy with the march anyway and the mass.

119
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.950
What is the watchmen,
who was that guy?
Ink Blot.
What's his name?
Shack.
Raw Shack.

120
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.790
That's right.
That guy.
Yeah.
He comes to you and come see what the bone to be.

121
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:02.420
Everything's in that book.
We,
we all know what's in that book.
Tell me,

122
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:04.310
I don't know what's in that book.
You don't know what's in that book?

123
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.450
What's in the book?
You think?

124
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.240
I'm going to say here in Wa are people are listening to get killed.

125
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.780
I can't say I seen the book,
but I can't tell.
What do you think's in the bone?

126
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:14.000
Joe?
What do you think?
If you had to guess,

127
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.450
like he didn't even want to say President Jorge.
You're first day in office.

128
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.280
Mr Mosfet doll a word you like to?
Uh,
would you like to go over first?

129
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.540
Is Elvis still alive?
What about Tupac?

130
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:30.170
Where the fuck we're super guy.
Who else?

131
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:34.600
What's going on with these Amy's Bro,
they real witch,
which was mine,
number one.

132
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.860
One.
Number one I want to know about aliens.
I was hoping,

133
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.940
this is my hope when all these people are screaming his treats about Trump,
like,

134
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.740
Nah,
I was hoping the moment he gets in,

135
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:45.560
he's going to ask about aliens because Trump's into conspiracies.

136
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.020
Like he used to go on the Alex Jones show all the time.

137
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:50.000
I know he's in conspiracies.
If you were going to be the president,

138
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.940
the first thing you ask is fucking aliens.

139
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.820
What do you got going on here with these green fellows?

140
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.890
Now we talk about what's going on with them.
You live in Florida.

141
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:03.200
There's plenty of aliens down there now.
We don't go,
Oh yeah,

142
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.880
we've got a lot of aliens,

143
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:12.140
different types of 18 Florida's we're talking about those reps,
Florida,
the trip.

144
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.230
It's one of my favorite places because it literally,

145
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.050
especially the whole southern Florida area,
like Miami West Palm down,

146
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.510
it seems like you should have a passport to go there.
It's just,

147
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.810
it's so different than the rest of America.
It's going to speak English.

148
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.900
It's great.
The food is all exotic.
It's like it's,
it's,

149
00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:31.640
it's such a different flavor and then the weather's crazy.
It,

150
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.540
which it's almost like going to another country.
Yeah,
you needed a little pat.

151
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:38.960
You go to the guys.
He's in Trump.
Put Gadget.
What language are you speaking?

152
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.660
Nobody speaks English there.
People get upset.

153
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.260
I'm always at a gas station and then somebody like an American person will be in

154
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:47.320
the line and fucking,
dammit man,

155
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.970
nobody speaks English here and then I'll have to like translate it.

156
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.240
I'll come down,
man.
It's okay bro.
There's people who speak English and Spanish,

157
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.050
you know it's,
yeah,
and it's also the weather there.
It's when it gets crazy,

158
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:58.980
it gets so crazy.

159
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:01.440
I went with Eddie Bravo once and he was doing a Jujitsu seminar.

160
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.710
We had to drive from a west palm down to Miami and as we're driving this storm

161
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:09.400
hit,
it was so hard.
You had to,

162
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.740
everyone stopped dead on the highway because you couldn't drive cause you

163
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:17.550
couldn't see in front of you.
We were laughing.
No one could see anything.

164
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.320
It was just all a wall of water that was pounding down in the car for about 10

165
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:25.560
minutes and then it all went away.
We were like,
what in the fuck was that?

166
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.060
You can't see in front of you.

167
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.850
It didn't matter if he had windshield wipers on and you are going nowhere.

168
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.290
You couldn't drive.
You couldn't see.
Sounds about right.
That's about right.

169
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.590
<v 3>Right.
That's why Mami people,
Florida people got that a spastic uh,</v>

170
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.830
behaviors.
We'll just like the weather.
You know where your one moment

171
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.610
<v 2>it's all temporary.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
you being down there though,</v>

172
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.170
you couldn't ask for a better training environment.
I mean with,

173
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.900
with Dave established down there,

174
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.930
I mean it was great when there was the black silicon zero as well.
But I mean,

175
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:59.850
American top team down,
they're like,
Holy Shit,
we are in Florida.

176
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.770
I mean black savings,

177
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.720
just trying to do that casing to saying that they were killing this competition.

178
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.800
I don't whatever happened to that team.
Well the guy died.
No,

179
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:11.480
but before that it was long extinct.
Well,
it's,
look,
Dan Lambert,

180
00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:14.880
Lambert's a bad motherfucker.
It costs a lot of money to do what he did.
And T.

181
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.060
Dot.
Guy is a,
he's one of the treasures of the sport.
Yeah.
You know,

182
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.910
and what he did was not just do it once,
but then build a whole new place.
Yeah.

183
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.150
The giant new place with dormitories and shit.
Stay there.

184
00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:28.770
Our facility and loves him.
And Dan is amazing.

185
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.850
<v 3>Have you,
have you ever been to Dan's house?
Never have.
Oh,</v>

186
00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:34.100
he's probably going to get mad at me.
I'm going to put him on blast and number.

187
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.810
Fuck it.
Let's pick out on real quick.
He's rich.

188
00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.680
So he got a really nice house to start with.
And,
uh,

189
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.410
you going inside the house and you don't see any pictures of his kids,

190
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.500
but she has a beautiful family,
but you do see pictures,

191
00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:48.560
massive pictures I'm talking about.
They won't fit in this room.

192
00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:53.561
They're huge pictures of his finders knocking people out of some baby people all

193
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:58.460
over his living room and you go,
wow,
I the gym is my baby.

194
00:10:58.461 --> 00:11:01.370
I would know where to get rid of this.
You know,
this is,
that's his thing.

195
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:04.880
That's his baby man.
He loves him,
man.
And the hands also.
Tough motherfucker,
Bro.

196
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.290
I rolled with him back in the day when he was maybe like eight years ago.

197
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:13.070
He short with everybody.
And if you were world champion at night and be like,

198
00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:15.560
let's roll.
Just strangers.
It's when he's pointing pretty good man.

199
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.020
<v 2>Yeah,
he's very good.
He's a legit,
yeah,
he's a great guy too.</v>

200
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.640
And I remember when that place is basically just a money hole for him.

201
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.060
He just kept pumping,
pumping money into it.
It was funding fighters.

202
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.980
Some of them took advantage of them,
a lot of them it was,
but he stuck with it.

203
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.790
And then he started developing world champions and now it's like,
wow,

204
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.720
look at that place.
I mean we talk about best gyms on the planet.

205
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.150
You always have to mention att,
you have to,

206
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.840
<v 3>obviously my opinion is biased,
but I think we stand alone in the world.</v>

207
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:48.240
I don't think,
nobody's just sheer numbers.
You know,

208
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:51.600
we just got another title holder on on my card.

209
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:55.180
We got four people from American top team finding against the world.
You know,

210
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.860
I think for awhile I was like Greg Jackson's an AK.

211
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.050
They were producing a lot of people,
but as of late,
the last like four years,

212
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.850
I think he's American top team.

213
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.913
<v 2>Yeah,
down.</v>

214
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.120
It's also the incredible diversity of talent that you could train with.
Yeah.

215
00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:10.350
You know,
there's so many.

216
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.590
<v 3>That's what attraction,
you're one 35 are and back home.</v>

217
00:12:13.591 --> 00:12:17.100
You're the only one 35 are and maybe you're a world class guy,
you come in here,

218
00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:21.400
you got like five one 30 fibers and 30 of them might be in the top 10 in the
UFC.

219
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:21.770
You,

220
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.030
<v 2>what do you attribute your longevity to and your enthusiasm too,</v>

221
00:12:26.031 --> 00:12:30.950
because you've always been a guy who loves fighting and you always been a guy

222
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.810
who mean you've had that enthusiasm for a long time.

223
00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:36.570
Man.

224
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.980
<v 3>You know,
not a lot of things,
uh,
can capture my attention,
you know,
and I,</v>

225
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.130
I can't just watch TV for example,
you know,

226
00:12:43.131 --> 00:12:45.560
like a football game and sit through the whole thing.
You know,

227
00:12:45.561 --> 00:12:48.200
I'm not trying to digital but on that I just don't have that attention span or

228
00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:52.280
basketball or baseball fighting can just like I'm talking to you in a fight goes

229
00:12:52.281 --> 00:12:56.090
on and I'd just like almost get zoned out.
You know,

230
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.450
there's always had my attention since a kid since before I knew that I could

231
00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:03.890
make money off of it.
It just attracted me,
you know,
it's that primal instinct,

232
00:13:03.891 --> 00:13:08.180
survival,
whatever it is,
is just hardwired deep into Mino and my longevity.

233
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.960
One thing I definitely attribute to is a not taking steroids,
man.

234
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.950
Just being natural,
enjoying this ride,
that the natural form,
you know,

235
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.390
not like pushing my body towards limits that I'm bench pressing 400 pounds where

236
00:13:20.391 --> 00:13:24.770
my ligaments are weak like that,
you know?
And I also think God made me for this,

237
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.470
you know,
the way that I've been fighting my whole career.
You know,

238
00:13:27.471 --> 00:13:30.950
I have really good defense.
The last white,
it didn't show,

239
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.050
but I'm also like bill Hardman.
I walked out of the till,

240
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.670
got clipped

241
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.020
<v 2>one left hand in the initial ft Dick kicked him,
which is crazy.</v>

242
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.880
He came out as the first one I ever saw with a opening flying side kicked Dick,

243
00:13:45.881 --> 00:13:49.030
kick Luke,
Hank to the balls.
Sorry.
Um,

244
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:52.000
but then he clipped you with was a perfect straight left,

245
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:55.660
but you survived on the ground.
You survived in the ground.
You covered up,

246
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:56.920
you showed great defense on the ground.

247
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:59.290
You got back to your feet and you kept it together,
you know,

248
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:00.790
and the combination that you hit him with,

249
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:03.500
you'd hit him with that combination a couple times.
You did.

250
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.610
Is that something you prepared for that when you were switching and then

251
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:10.920
throwing that left hand?
Is that,
did you prepare in a way?
Pet,
yeah,

252
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.780
<v 3>me and my coach,
ah,
he's,
he's the one that'll do like all the techniques.</v>

253
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.050
The guy that had been with forever Ballina and nuns,

254
00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:20.680
I think the greatest dragon coach ever,
he,
ah,
he showed me like,
Hey,

255
00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:23.530
let's do this.
You know,
Oh man,
I want to do a new techniques.
Come on,

256
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:25.750
let's just do it.
You know what I mean?
I started doing it,
doing it,
doing it.

257
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:28.780
And this was like a while ago and then for this fight and I had stopped doing
it,

258
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:31.440
you know,
cause a lot of the techniques we work on my lap when initiating,

259
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.980
when he brings me a technique to the table,

260
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.550
we're going to wrap it out 100 times in a week and the next week the same thing

261
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:39.130
to leave fields that I got it.
And then he'd be like,
all right,
cool.

262
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.010
[inaudible] they're in the tool shed when we need it.
We'll Polish it up.

263
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.520
So for this fight,
he's like,
Hey,
remember that technique?
Let's,
let's bring it,

264
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:48.350
I think it'll work here.
And I go,
man,
but he's just South Isaac.

265
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.770
I'm telling you the way he's moving the ways,
you know,
fighting with you,

266
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:55.550
it's gonna work.
So we started doing it and boom money.

267
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.150
You caught him with it a couple of times before you put them away with it.
Right?

268
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.350
I not with that one,
with that same exact one.
Similar ones,
but I didn't,
uh,

269
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.710
I didn't go full south Pato to the blitz,
you know,

270
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.530
I did it a other different ways,
you know,

271
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.360
and I also caught on my lap with like overhand and left hook as he was coming
in,

272
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:16.910
especially in the second round.
I caught him I think maybe twice with that come.

273
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.320
Yeah man,
that's a big knockout.
That was a big knockout.
He's a,

274
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.450
he's an interesting guy because he's really too big for one 70.
Yeah,

275
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.250
he's so fucking tall.
But you are a guy who doesn't cut much weight at all.

276
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.330
Like how much would you cut for Sec?
Well,
by the time I get into shape,
shape,

277
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:37.010
I'm around 182 pounds.
180 pounds.
So fight week,

278
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.560
I get over there and I'm like eight pounds away,

279
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:42.860
some seven pounds away and not so light.
Yeah,
it's nice.

280
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.120
I don't cut any at 55 if uh,

281
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:51.080
if everything went right when they used to fight 155 I got there at 174 pounds,

282
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:55.350
170 30 pounds,
5% body fat,
and the rest is just watermelon.

283
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.180
It would fucking kill me.
So I,
I always felt that was too big for 55.
You know,
I,

284
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:01.010
I loved it because the competition was stiff there,

285
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:04.670
but it was just getting harder and harder once it took those ivs away,
forget it.

286
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.370
There was no way for me to make that weight.
Yeah.

287
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:09.590
And moving up has been very successful for you.
I mean,

288
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:12.920
you look better moving up then I think you have ever in your career.

289
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.280
I don't think I had any stoppages at 55 with the hands,
like ending,

290
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:19.820
somebody had dropped a numerous people,
but I never CalEd somebody stiff,

291
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:21.770
you know.
And at seven I've got a couple of them in.

292
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:26.480
Is Do you tribute that to having more power at 70 energy hub,
healthier,

293
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.370
feeling confident.
You know,
once,

294
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.090
once you run that desert to cut the weight and then you still have to fish
fight,

295
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.880
that's still in the back of your mind like right.
You know,

296
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:38.210
do I have 50 good hot right hands in me,
you know?
Right,
right.

297
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:41.930
And those doubts and stuff come in you and also your insights take a beating.

298
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.600
When you cut that weight,
when you cut it like 12 pounds and up of water,

299
00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.500
your insights take a beating.
So you get hit in the stomach and like,
Whoa,

300
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:53.030
that Shit fucking hurt.
It doesn't hurt like this in practice.
You know?
So,
um,
it,

301
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.210
it sucks man.
It sucks.
Harsh water cuts suck.

302
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.390
We were talking about it outside that I think that they,

303
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:04.180
if they instituted hydration tests and more weight classes and just cut it out,

304
00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:07.850
just cut out,
wait,
just cut out weight,
cutting all together,
cut it out,
man.
Just,

305
00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:10.540
he just figured out a way to eliminate,
make people fight it,
what they were at.

306
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.370
But you've got to have more weight classes.
No,
definitely.

307
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.840
I mean most of the population walks around between like one 45 and one 70 I

308
00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:21.090
think,
man,
you know,
most of my friends are not heavy weights or,

309
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.020
or very short dude,
you know,
they're like right around this show.

310
00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.810
I think definitely knows way classes.
They could definitely add more,
you know,

311
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.500
maybe even seven pounds in those way classes,
every seven pounds a difference.

312
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.790
And then as they get bigger,
they get through like 10 pounds,
you know,

313
00:17:32.791 --> 00:17:35.510
like 85 95 two oh five you know,
I don't think it's,

314
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.660
some people said that boxing is too watered down.
I think what,

315
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.400
what waters down boxing is the different organization.
Yes.

316
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.450
I don't think it's way close.
15 bells per weight class.
Come on.
Yeah,

317
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.950
I don't think there's anything wrong with a one 47 and one 54 and that doesn't

318
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.120
me.
No,
no.
Well

319
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.210
<v 2>that seven pounds,</v>

320
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:56.010
47 one 54 one 60 and they have one 68 I think that's perfect.
Perfect.

321
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.650
Yeah.
I don't think,
I mean I think,
look,

322
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.630
I always thought it was weird that we didn't adopt.

323
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:03.330
If we're going to adopt the boxing 10 point must system,

324
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:06.780
why don't we adopt a weight classes?
Like why do we have our own still weirdest?

325
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:10.620
How is lightweight one 55 lightweights always in one 35 we all know that

326
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.220
welterweight one 47 it's not one 70 how has that welterweight like that's

327
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:15.930
ridiculous.
There was already a welter weight.

328
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.190
Like it's like calling a pound like,
oh well those are our pound in South Dakota.

329
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.490
It's seven pound,
little heavier into South Dakota.
What does that,

330
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.990
you know what I mean?
It's,
it's,
it would be better for the athletes,

331
00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:31.590
but I get the UFC is idea that they don't want to have like all these titles.

332
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.330
They don't want to have like 12 different titles.

333
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:35.520
They didn't want it to be watered down,
but stone and B,

334
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:38.250
we've got a bunch of interim champions.
You're in that door.
Yeah.
Yeah.

335
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.280
Well listen,
those two that we had,
um,
this past weekend,

336
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.090
I don't see how anybody could argue with those more fun,
great fights.

337
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.240
Those are amazing.
Wow.
And uh,
I've been,

338
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.120
I've been training alongside the DP for a while.
She's like,

339
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.640
everybody knows the DPS are ready,

340
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:57.360
but this I think puts him in like a special category for sure.

341
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.890
That like Max and to beat him the way beat him to stun them bad and that first

342
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:06.750
round and then just every time he connected he was rocking him.
I mean he just,

343
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.610
he really showed his power shield the difference between a 5,545 or,
and uh,

344
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:14.600
it just showed the how can crack crack for a while.

345
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.850
I've seen him layout dude stiff in the gym a lot.
You know,

346
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:22.050
he's got one of the higher body counts for lean dude's us not even joking.

347
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.300
I believe it,
Eh,
he's got power.

348
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.200
Another guy who would lay dude stiff on the constant was hectic man.

349
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:32.220
Those guys got body counts for the Lombard.
Yeah,
I can imagine.

350
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:34.800
He kind of sparked hard.
Yeah.
He's as far as his little heart.

351
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.730
He's a wild man.
He's also a freak athlete too.
You know.

352
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.800
I remember when Hector was laying people out in tour before he came over to the

353
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:50.640
UFC.
I mean,
I think he fought his prime fights over there.
Really is.

354
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.680
That was at 85 to,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
70 was a harsh cook for him.
Brutal cut.

355
00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.270
He's so thick.
You know those fucking Cuban genetics,
man.

356
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.000
Yeah.
That's what he looks like.
Thickness oil.

357
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.930
Another got all nick.

358
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.710
She allows ridiculous 42 years old.

359
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.230
Even believe this is a real human when every ways,
and I'm like,

360
00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:17.960
what the fuck is this?
He said,
just specimen.
You know what I mean?
Every dude,
bro.

361
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.670
I've been training along that guy too long.
He does.

362
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:25.080
He's one of the freaker athletes.
Oh yeah,
him Lombard.

363
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.650
And to me,
one of the best athletes I've ever seen that had been around with,

364
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.260
not too many people know him,
but he's,
he's a wild man.

365
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.760
Like the wildest of the button.
He,

366
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:37.050
he's the one that when he comes in the mat in the room,
me,
Joelle,
heck to every,

367
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:40.740
whoever's there that knows him takes you off the hat and goes,
guys,

368
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:43.890
here the man is years Alexis villa.
But that guy's a freak athlete,
Bro.

369
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.560
Two time a world champion wrestler,
Olympic bronze medalist.

370
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 3>But man,
they guy could play any sport,
man like ham ball.
When's he,</v>

371
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:56.130
how long has he been over at att?
No,
no,
he's right now.
He's uh,

372
00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.960
he's beating a sentence right now.
He's a,

373
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:02.320
he's doing a little bit of jail time for,
for a crime that he didn't commit,

374
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:06.130
but he was fine.
He find a better too.
He beat,
AH,
Joe Warren knocked him out.

375
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.440
Oh no shit.

376
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.080
Alexis villa and a man from pure athleticism and this guy would do crazy stuff,

377
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:14.890
you know,

378
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.030
play basketball with like a basketball high school team just by like what the

379
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:19.900
fuck was,

380
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:25.750
he was at one 25 and one 35 freak athlete or some crazy stuff.

381
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:29.170
Jabra free.
Gathy man.
Yeah,

382
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:31.240
there's some freak athletes in the sport now.

383
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:34.570
It's interesting to see the difference between the athletes from like 93,

384
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.860
you know,
or the first UFC he's to now,
it's a crazy difference.

385
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.150
I still don't think that we get the same caliber of athletes as the NFL or the

386
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:45.520
NHL or rather NBA well,

387
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.640
in different ways because we get the,

388
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.350
the best and fastest guys from like one 17 down.
Like those 45,
35 pounders,

389
00:21:53.351 --> 00:21:56.470
they're growing up either wrestling or boxing or doing something of that nature.

390
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:58.900
They know they're not going to play basketball and football.
That's true.

391
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.630
That's true.
Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.

392
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:05.290
We do have some pretty freaky lighter-weight athletes.
Yeah.

393
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.310
How would you sit judo?
How old are you now?
34.
34.
How many more years he,
Phil,

394
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.290
you're going to be doing this uh,
comfortably.
I'm gonna fight till I'm 38.

395
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:18.520
At least four more years.
And then if the money is right,
I'll stick around,

396
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:23.560
you know,
but at 38,
I've,
I've,
uh,
I would live this rollercoaster long enough.

397
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:27.640
It's time to stop,
just dedication sometime until my 2018 pro.

398
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.510
Wow.
Had a couple of amateur fights when pro and,

399
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.320
and enjoy the Schroeder cultures.

400
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:36.790
My favorite roller coaster to what training did you have before you went pro?
Um,

401
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.200
just that fucking somebody that had like maybe one or two pro fights in MMA,

402
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.330
like advising,
you're like,
Hey,

403
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:46.540
I think you should be doing this man when we go chop trees and shit.
All right,

404
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:47.374
let's go do it.
And you know,

405
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.390
[inaudible] fight training had fight training but it wasn't like structured,

406
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:57.370
you know,
um,
a lot of was that first original martial art.
Uh,

407
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:02.430
like as a kid,
my,
My,
uh,
dad had segment again,
anything,
you know,

408
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.120
martial arts because I was a very hyperactive individual,
you know,

409
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:09.160
something like that.
It's like,
man,
I've got to stick this guy in something,

410
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:12.450
you know.
So they had me like in karate.
Um,

411
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.060
what else?
I though maybe some taekwondo,

412
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.130
what I didn't get like far and a lot of these things,

413
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:22.330
cause I'd start to excel in the programs obviously because of my natural

414
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:24.190
aggressiveness.
But then in school,

415
00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:26.410
if I get in trouble with the grades or anything,
my mom be like,
no,

416
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:29.020
we've got to take him out.
It's only going to further the damage.

417
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:31.330
We're not going to let them go there and be at peace.

418
00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:34.000
We're going to take him out every time he messes up at school.

419
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:35.590
So I had started doing good at a gym like two,

420
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.270
three months and then get taken out,
you know?

421
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.900
So I was like a recruiting thing till I got to like 14 years old and I was like,

422
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:44.320
that's him ma'am.
I need to be in the gym all day long,
Sony Way to do it.

423
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.130
So when did you,

424
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:51.200
when you had parts in your career where you took it more seriously?
Oh,
well as a,

425
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:51.741
as a kid,

426
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:56.380
until I got to like 1314 I wasn't able to like Mama,

427
00:23:56.381 --> 00:23:58.880
I'm not going to school to them.
I'm going to the gym now,
you know,

428
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.330
we'll write around.
I got 14 I knew already more or less what I wanted to do.

429
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:06.080
I had already seen the UFC enough and before the UFC came out,
I was like,

430
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.280
I'm either going to box or I'm gonna Wrestle.
Those two things are amazing.

431
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.700
The coolest things I've ever seen.

432
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.660
And then a UFC comes out and blows my fucking mind.
I was like,

433
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:17.330
what the fuck is this?
You're getting paid for this.

434
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:19.490
And then I was hearing what they were getting paid at them.
I was like,
man,

435
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:23.210
I could,
I could make a living off this.
I'm doing this,
fuck that.
You know,

436
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:27.290
and I invested everything I had ever since,
you know,
into this.
Wow.

437
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.770
So will you keep saying the resurrection is a big thing that you're putting on a

438
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.620
social media,
the resurrection,
resurrection.
What is that about?
Um,

439
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:41.210
no,
numerous things,
you know,
uh,
more on the personal side,

440
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.800
just cutting off a lot of bullshit out of my life,
like tremendous amounts of it,

441
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:50.090
you know,
um,
and focusing on what I gotta do,
you know,

442
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.290
done a lot of stupid shit in my career,
you know,
just from being,

443
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.620
from having genetics and being blessed and like,
man,

444
00:24:57.621 --> 00:24:58.940
I could party all night long.

445
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.780
Then Park the car at the gym at 6:00 AM in the morning,

446
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.760
I'll wake up at 10:00 AM and then kick everybody's ass in the workout room.

447
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.330
And I'm not talking Shakas anybody works out women until you everyday that I'm

448
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:09.590
in there,
I'm a nightmare,
you know?

449
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.460
And then I go home to sleep a couple hours and go back to the gym at night and

450
00:25:13.461 --> 00:25:15.890
do stupid shit like that.
And I did that for a while and I've,

451
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:20.060
not that I was currently doing that,
but I did that align with my body.

452
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.530
Your body has to really recover from that and to like a million other dumb

453
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:27.650
things.
So I've just focus on just fighting them,

454
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.450
just doing this a hundred percent and even cut out social media.
Yeah.
That I've,

455
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:37.010
I've caught a a long time ago.
But uh,
you Morna,
you know,
it's,
for me,

456
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:40.100
I'm not good with technology to start with is I'm not the greatest with

457
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.680
technology gives Moen stuff,
man.
You know,

458
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:46.110
you've got the Elon Musk's of this world and you got me on the other spectrum.

459
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.370
I just want to fight.
I just want to do athletic things.

460
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:52.310
Sports him would call me up if you're going to go for a fucking five hour
height,

461
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:54.080
but if I've got to send emails and Shit,
I'm fucked.

462
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.030
So when we're talking about social media,

463
00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.210
I don't know how many followers I got and there's a lot of pressure to keep up

464
00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:02.930
with the stuff,
you know?
But he still list the talking.
Yeah.
I don't ignore it.
I,

465
00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:06.470
I get on it.
No managers stayed on top of me and he helps me out tremendously.

466
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.550
But,
uh,
I was in the special classes in elementary,
you know,
I had the short bus,

467
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:12.560
two teachers in my class,
eight students,
you know,

468
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:16.430
so you can't force me on the social niggas.
It was like I'm back in school.

469
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.240
But you obviously are a smart dude.
You're a smart dude.

470
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.800
I could tell that from talking to you.

471
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:24.380
And you're clearly smart from the way you fight,
you know,

472
00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:26.790
there's no way you could fight the way you fight,

473
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.090
be as creative as you are and not being intelligent.

474
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.710
It's just you're expressing it in a different way.
Yeah,
yeah,
for sure.

475
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:36.260
For fighting.
You had definitely had to be smart is no,

476
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:40.940
unless you're just some crazy freak athlete.
Yeah.
I don't know.
For fighting.
Yeah.

477
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:45.050
I uh,
I definitely got like a good sense of what's good and what's bad.
Yeah.

478
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.000
Yeah,
definitely.
You always had that sense of,

479
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.320
of what's good and what's gap in terms of like if you always had good timing for

480
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:53.940
sparring.
Oh,
for,

481
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:58.990
for a straight the my most gifted ability that God said it here is boxing.

482
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:01.920
Since the first day I walked into the boxing ring,

483
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.610
maybe like three weeks later was the first time I will let the Scotch Bar,

484
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:07.140
you know,
and they put me to spar.

485
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.720
And I remember there was a couple of coaches that didn't know me.

486
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.900
They were handling already that the boxing team for that program.
And uh,

487
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.730
I used to go to this state sponsored program,

488
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:18.530
which was like $40 for the whole year.
You had access to the gym three,

489
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.400
four hours a day.
And it was like perfect.
You know,

490
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.250
it was the best thing that could happen to me.
So it was a lot of good talent.

491
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:25.650
And then we had a couple of national championships come out of the program.

492
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.940
And I remember my first sparring session,
sparring,
the coach is coming up to me,

493
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:32.030
he goes,
hey man,
how many amateur fights you got to go?
No,

494
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.440
I have never fought in my life.
What?

495
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.530
I come over here man and started working with you.
And it was like immediate,

496
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:37.711
you know?

497
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:42.090
And I just had like all natural born radar where I could see the punches in slow

498
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:47.040
motion.
You know,
I didn't know at the time how to react to them.
Right.

499
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.430
You know,
just trying to get out of the way and it would just work,
you know?

500
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:53.820
And still to this day I have that same radar so I'm,

501
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.240
that's just a blessing God gave me.
And also from the as well is my mother.

502
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:57.751
You should give me,

503
00:27:57.751 --> 00:28:02.751
cause when the belt would come with a metal buckle and the shoes that,

504
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.230
that's the first test of the reflexes.
You know,

505
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.550
when I get home like at a tool in the morning,
I was like 1213 years old.

506
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:14.580
My mom be waiting for me.
Dodger Bruin time.

507
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:20.720
You've obviously put more work into though.
Oh yeah.
It's not just a,

508
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:25.170
this whole resurrection is,
he seemed more focused.
Definitely more focused.

509
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.310
I've always been like ultra focused when I got to fight,
you know,

510
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:32.730
like if nothing for forever and all my career,
like I got to fight,

511
00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:36.360
that's all I'm going to make it to every single practice.
It's on my schedule.

512
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:40.140
If I got two practices today and three tomorrow and whatever it is,

513
00:28:40.141 --> 00:28:42.990
I'm always going to do it outside of fighting on like once.

514
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.170
I don't have a fight though.
Seven,
eight weeks madness would happen.

515
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:52.050
Fucking stupid shit,
you know?
So you know,
that gets you into trouble.

516
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:54.870
That gets you out of shape and fucking I love to eat.
You know,

517
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.920
it's another fucking huge problem.
Right?
Yeah.
I don't have the too much.

518
00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:02.640
Maybe what's the heaviest you've ever gotten in between fights was recently.
Um,

519
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.070
right before I went on this reality show,
I checked my weight.

520
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.920
I was at a staggering two.
Sexy,

521
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.670
no,
it was just,
it was time to cut the weight,
man.
It was just too much,
man.
Well,

522
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:17.070
reality show is us.
I went on a,

523
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.270
my manager a bomb and got me this,
uh,
this deal.

524
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.880
We were having trouble.
This was after the Thompson five.

525
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:26.700
We couldn't really get a match up,
couldn't get a fight that I want it.

526
00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:27.830
I to like a tough fine.

527
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.230
They were kind of off of me and I ultimate fighters and things like that.

528
00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:33.900
And no disrespect to them.
I just didn't at that stage in my career,

529
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:37.650
I want the hardest fight or the best fighter that I could get.
And he's like,

530
00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:40.770
calls me up when they say,
Hey,
I got this reality show.
And I was like,
oh awesome,

531
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.613
click

532
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.360
<v 4>and causing me back the next day.
You work.
Don't hang up yet.
Listen to me,</v>

533
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:49.210
you know,
um,
I think you might like,
this is not like that.

534
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:51.130
So then like Jersey shore,
it's like a competitive,

535
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:54.580
like you're going to compete against people.
I'm like,
no,
no thanks bro.
You know,

536
00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:57.940
and then we talk like a week later,
what's going on?
Did I get a fight?
No,

537
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:00.940
we can't get,
you know,
fight yet unless you want to fight Joe blow or this guy,

538
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:04.540
you know what I'm like already been sitting out seven months nursing my age is,

539
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:06.460
I'm already thinking,
yeah,
I'll fight whoever it is,
you know?

540
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.050
So while this is going on,

541
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.050
the reality shows pitching numbers at us to keep increasing the number.

542
00:30:11.051 --> 00:30:15.730
Every time they get to a decent number,
they talked to my manager,

543
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.560
my manager talks to me.
He's like,
yeah,
I can't get,
you know,

544
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:20.410
fight right now that you want.
Why don't you just go there a couple of weeks,

545
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:23.290
one to two weeks,
collect these paychecks,
come back.
And that's it.
You know,

546
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.730
and uh,
the,
the reality shows like you go through like a par core,
um,

547
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.310
kind of obstacles and then at the end you've got to aim.

548
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:31.450
So why your heart rate shot up?

549
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:35.560
You'd have to like knock down water bottles with a Frisbee or football or

550
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:39.910
something like that.
But the cool part is that I'm up against an Olympic gymnast,

551
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.350
Park Core Dude's,
um,
tennis players,
soccer players,

552
00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:46.330
all types of athletes were just mix in there.

553
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:47.830
And we're just all competing in this thing.

554
00:30:47.831 --> 00:30:49.600
So it was pretty cool and it was awesome experience.

555
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:54.280
I ended up lasting 13 weeks in the show and the show ran for about 15 weeks.

556
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:56.950
So I got pretty far deep in it,
you know.
And uh,

557
00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.910
the coolest thing was that I got to be alone by myself because one of the things

558
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:03.910
is there's no cell phone,
there's no TV,
there's no music on the show.

559
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.410
So it's just the interaction of us and outside of that,
that's it.

560
00:31:08.411 --> 00:31:10.900
That's your only interactions.
You don't have no interactions with the town.

561
00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:14.470
People are nothing.
They strictly forbid day,
you know,
they want you like case up.

562
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.380
So it was awesome.
I thought,
you know,
after a while I was the best.

563
00:31:17.381 --> 00:31:18.670
I'd go work out in the nature,

564
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.320
be by myself in the mountains or in the beach and just Shannon and you really

565
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.110
get to notice yourself.
And that's why I call it the resurrection,

566
00:31:26.111 --> 00:31:29.350
because I thought about it like all the negative dumb things that have done in

567
00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:32.530
my life and just let me eliminate them,
whether I like them in my life or not.

568
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:36.010
Let me just eliminate that shit.
And that's it.
You know,
that's what we call it,

569
00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:36.940
the resurrection,
you know?

570
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.430
<v 5>Yeah.
Well that fight would tell man,</v>

571
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.180
if anybody had any doubts that fight or race to all of them.
And that was a,

572
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.670
I mean,
till was top five,
right?

573
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.510
Yeah.
And so,
uh,

574
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:53.170
that puts you in the hunt now and what a crazy goddamn division that is now.
Yes,

575
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:57.580
sir.
I mean,
we got a Robbie Lawler who's,
uh,
he's,

576
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:02.500
uh,
about to fight Tyron Woodley again.
They're going to have a rematch.

577
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:04.620
That's crazy.
Fucking fine.
It's a crazy funny,
ooh.

578
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.990
Spawn is waiting to see who's going to be next for him at one 70.

579
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.010
Now that he's the champ,
I mean,
Wonderboy,
uh,

580
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.940
just got KL pedis,
which is crazy.
That was crazy.

581
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.760
<v 4>And now RDA,
which is a ranked 70 pounders going to fight,
uh,</v>

582
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.650
she gonna fight the 55 registers.
Forgot his name right now.
The second Kevin.

583
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.510
Oh yeah,
Kevin Lee's going to go up to 70 now.

584
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.160
So those are the things that throw me off.
Like if,
if pedis stays at 70 awesome.

585
00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:38.290
But if he goes down to 55 we kind of like makes it more of a of a weird set up.

586
00:32:38.781 --> 00:32:40.130
And same thing with Kevin.
The,
I

587
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.670
<v 2>dunno if he's saying oh a seven year or he's doing like a onetime one night</v>

588
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:47.930
sending,
you know,
staying according to him.
The more I talked to him,
he just had,

589
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.060
it was just too hard for him.

590
00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:52.050
It's like 55 just ruined him every time he got down there he made it.

591
00:32:52.051 --> 00:32:53.990
What would you,
you've met him,
he's big,

592
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.190
he's a big guy and he's walking around like one 85 easy,

593
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.130
maybe more and thick.
You know,
sound like man,

594
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:05.000
this is not a lot of weight there that you can cut off three.
See if he stays,

595
00:33:05.001 --> 00:33:06.890
no problem.
I love it,
you know?
But when it's,

596
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:11.891
when they come and go it like fuck some legislation makes it a labyrinth.

597
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.890
Yeah.
I don't understand why the UFC is so reluctant to have more weight classes.

598
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.880
I really don't get it.

599
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:21.350
Like Dana said that the 165 pound weight class will never happen while he's

600
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:24.140
running the UFC and he's going to be running for the next seven years.

601
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:29.140
He said think it was an ESPN plus Kevin Lee's want to make Rafael dos Anjos

602
00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:34.040
fight at one 65 is asking him to see like if they can make a backroom deal to

603
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:38.480
just both weigh in at one 65 instead of one 70 just to sort of force it.

604
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.280
That's not forcing it.
Why would I?
That doesn't even make any sense.

605
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.713
That's so weird.

606
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.100
I mean five pounds is not that much of a difference and it's not,

607
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.050
but it would be nice if there was a 10 pound gap.
I don't know.
They both,
uh,

608
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:56.540
I mean Delsandro says fought successfully at 170.

609
00:33:56.541 --> 00:34:00.830
He looked great when he fought Lawler,
you know,
be magnitude.
Yeah.

610
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:03.500
But I feel like he's probably a guy that should be one 65 too.

611
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.270
You know they can make it like a one 62 or something like 63 something like
that.

612
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:13.850
We'll probably just fucking whistling in the wind.
Now they have their ideas.

613
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:18.980
I look,
I don't want to run that business.
I don't want to tell them what to do.

614
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.700
Fuck riding in that.
Imagine being run in the UFC when a nightmare.
That would be,

615
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.450
it depends on how much money he can pay for it.
Right.
I gas still.

616
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:29.030
Once you have all that money for a few years and then you're dealing with high

617
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:31.820
blood pressure and your fucking panic attacks the middle of the night.

618
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.980
I got things for high blood pressure.
They're pretty good.
They do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

619
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:42.080
Marijuana.
That does help.
What's it like in Florida getting weed?
Is it hard now?

620
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.190
Florida's a fucking mafia man and I'm going to get killed fish,

621
00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:50.720
but you know every state when Eagle and had the flower and shit,
we only had wax.

622
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.500
That's it.
That's it,
man.
That's what medical,
right?
You have to have a medical.

623
00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.790
They're literally about to become,
I think flower just became legal in Florida.

624
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.900
Or it's about to become the morning to write.
Yeah.
Medical.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
uh,

625
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.630
no.
Just smoking the smoke.

626
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.780
I wonder if they're going to be easy with the medical recommendations,

627
00:35:08.781 --> 00:35:11.720
the way they used to be for opiates,
opiates.

628
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:15.380
He'd be able to just get people to get oxies with like just go to a doctor,

629
00:35:15.381 --> 00:35:18.500
one of those little pain management centers in Florida.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

630
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:22.730
I'm showing how hard it's going to be to get weed because they obviously there's

631
00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:27.070
someone who spending some money trying to keep it from being fully legal there.

632
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.230
Yes.
Yeah.
And I think a big part of it is because,
uh,

633
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.850
like south Florida culture,
um,
there's a lot of natural growers over there.

634
00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.130
They grew like,
it's always been a big business.
It's

635
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.820
<v 3>illegal,
of course,
to grow marijuana in Florida and selling,
you know,</v>

636
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:44.460
especially in Miami,
Florida.
And a lot of people did this.

637
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:48.270
So I think when the rules came about legalizing medical marijuana,
he said,

638
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.510
we're not going to have plans because then everybody's going to grow plants.
And,

639
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.260
you know,
it's like we can't really charge him because it's,
it's legal,
you know?

640
00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:57.350
So that's why I think they did the wax.
Hmm.

641
00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:02.100
Because you can't grow by manufacturer.
Yeah,
I guess.
And I don't really agree.

642
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.340
It's like smoking wax.
Like somebody's giving me wax,
like,
oh,
here's smoke.
This,

643
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:08.160
I don't really know what's in there.
You know?
I always shoes like that,
uh,

644
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.540
from cocaine to crack people's hours.

645
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.370
So cocaine and then you're fucking crack head,
you know?
So the wax,

646
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.510
I don't care how many times somebody tells me,
no,
this is super safe.
I get it.

647
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:22.670
You know?
But I rather the flower if I'm going to smoke.
Yeah.
It's pure.

648
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:26.670
But apparently one of the things we're dealing with in California is pesticides.

649
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.320
Yeah.
At some weed,
uh,
you know,
grown by shitty growers.

650
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:35.250
It has pesticides on it.
You're smoking these pesticides.
I mean,

651
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:39.480
this is why it should be legal.
So you could test things,
test things,

652
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:42.060
and find out what's pure and what's not.
Make things organic.

653
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.770
Only the best of the best.
Make it to that,
to that other side,
you know?
Yeah.

654
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:52.230
I Dunno.
It's just weird.
It's weird that it's so easy to get opiates in,

655
00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:55.980
uh,
in Florida.
So hard to get weed.
I wouldn't know nothing about that.

656
00:36:55.981 --> 00:36:57.510
I wouldn't know nothing about that either.

657
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.850
So when you look at the landscape now,
um,
you,

658
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.480
you're obviously in the running for a shot at the title.

659
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:10.770
Has anybody give you any indication of what you would have to do to get a shot

660
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:15.090
at Uzman or to to be next in line?
The next one is,

661
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.750
is this idiot,

662
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.100
I won't even mention his name on your show because I'm not going to make him

663
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:21.660
famous.
He's a fucking idiot,
you know,

664
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.020
but fight this guy and then go for the title.
That's what it is,
homey.

665
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.950
So you have to find somebody else.
Yeah.
What is his name?
Ryan with?

666
00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:30.423
<v 1>Oh,</v>

667
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.570
<v 3>Dolby.
No,
no,
no.</v>

668
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.080
You don't want to say no.
I was trying to legacy on Edwards.
No,
no,
no.

669
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.290
He just made that guy famous soup.
You made him famous a couple of weeks ago.

670
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.770
I know.
It's,
Oh,
who?

671
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:55.490
Shmenn.
Yeah.
Oh,

672
00:37:55.491 --> 00:37:59.300
that's right.
You're supposed to fight it.
Ben.
Ask around in July fucking door.

673
00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.140
You don't like him now I'm going to be it really home bit.
Not,

674
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.750
not as long as you get the,
that was the fight was scheduled.
Um,
what's,

675
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:12.200
what's the problem with Ben Grin?
He's,
he's that new age,
you know,

676
00:38:12.201 --> 00:38:17.201
and he's like a fucking 40 [inaudible] but he's said these new ones,

677
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.430
dudes just fucking talk.
Like just talk and talk and talk about everybody.

678
00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:26.210
Shut the fuck up.
Because when you,
when,
when somebody sees you in person,

679
00:38:26.211 --> 00:38:30.350
you're not that guy.
And like I said,
I'm,
I don't come from this technology world.

680
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:34.310
I come from like if you,
if you say like,

681
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:38.860
Yo Joe,
you're a fucking idiot.
What are you going to punch me in the face?

682
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:40.330
Or I better be ready for it.
You know,

683
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.610
I'm just not going around and disrespecting people.

684
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.640
I get taught respect because if not,
somebody's gonna make you respect,
you know?

685
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.310
But these guys nowadays,
daisy grow up with these little things.

686
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.030
Nigga just say whatever the fuck they want.
Words carry weight.

687
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:54.640
Especially my kids can read your stupid comments.
You know,

688
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:58.330
my kids have access to the Internet now.
I just don't like them.
You know,

689
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.070
one incident I reminded when Khabib won the title,
right?
And uh,

690
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.820
Ben immediately comes out,
I'm Khabib's Kryptonite,
I would smash them.

691
00:39:06.821 --> 00:39:10.300
Or something like that I for is your 70 pounder.
You fucking moron.

692
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.820
He's a 55 pound there and you're not even in the UFC.
You know,
he's,

693
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.760
he's that type of guy and attention whore.
Look at me,
look at me.
I,

694
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.600
I don't even like his fighting saw.

695
00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:22.600
I like a lot of restaurant style because if that's what you did in your imposing

696
00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:26.620
and,
and when and awesome,
but when your sole purpose is just to hug somebody,

697
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:31.170
leg is hard as you can.
And then,
I dunno what you think about the Ravi five,

698
00:39:31.171 --> 00:39:32.980
but he didn't win that fight in my eyes,
you know,

699
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.320
<v 5>was not asleep several times.
We lost our fight several times.</v>

700
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.710
I thought that rob who's asleep for a second and then Ooh,

701
00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:43.080
Swan showed it to me and then I changed my mind.

702
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.830
And then herb dean came on and talked about and I changed my mind again because

703
00:39:46.831 --> 00:39:50.310
herb dean was saying that what he was concerned with was the way the arm dropped

704
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:52.220
and that it was a cervical lock.

705
00:39:52.221 --> 00:39:55.200
The essentially when you have a bulldog choke it puts,
uh,

706
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.810
puts us some serious leverage on your neck.
He's like,

707
00:39:57.811 --> 00:40:01.920
and he's seen guys go out from that and their whole body goes paralyzed and he

708
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:05.060
saw a guy,
uh,
where that happened to it and he came back.
He is,

709
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.800
he got his movement back again but for awhile it was pretty fucking scary.

710
00:40:07.801 --> 00:40:10.520
So he was getting choked out,
you know,
by getting his neck pinched.

711
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.730
It was pinching down the nerve.

712
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.330
He was worried that that was happening with Robbie said the ways arm dropped.

713
00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:19.110
He goes,
it wasn't normal and he goes at it and he gave me some serious concern.

714
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.710
Um,

715
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:23.820
Ben asked her and said that he let go of the choke a little bit when herb came

716
00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:26.260
over to him cause he thought herb is going to stop it cause he thought Robbie

717
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:28.980
was out and he thinks that during that time when he let go,

718
00:40:28.981 --> 00:40:32.880
Robbie came back to life,
which could have happened.
I don't know.

719
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.480
It's hard for me to say,
but I feel like in herb dean situation,

720
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:40.140
I think he did the right thing cause the arm dropping was fucking weird and
yeah.

721
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.220
<v 3>Yeah.
The arm driving was a little weird.
Yeah.
But he wasn't out.</v>

722
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.850
I never seen nobody go to sleep during it.

723
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.370
<v 5>No.
I seen people go to sleep.
Ashley,
Evan Smith went to sleep with the thumbs up,</v>

724
00:40:52.371 --> 00:40:55.580
thumbs up.
But the what,
here's what the herb said that made sense.
He goes,

725
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.820
was it the thumbs up?
He goes,
I want a thumbs up if someone looks at me,

726
00:40:58.821 --> 00:41:01.100
I want this.
I want this.
It's not,

727
00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.900
is your arm down on that position?
Was it this,

728
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.630
did he do this or it was his arm down.
I don't know.

729
00:41:08.631 --> 00:41:11.810
Only Robbie knows whether or not he was out.
He says he wasn't.

730
00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.040
So you have to also say he's in the middle of war.

731
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.260
If it's up to me,
I want the guy to go peace sign with the cheese.

732
00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.880
The guy's defending the choke with a story.
You know he did.

733
00:41:22.881 --> 00:41:25.280
That was the other thing that herb said he didn't grab for the choke.

734
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.990
He said the natural defense would be to get,

735
00:41:27.991 --> 00:41:31.340
get his hands on the on the hands and tried to separate them.
He didn't do that.

736
00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.280
He said

737
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.890
<v 3>just natural defense Robbie</v>

738
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.890
<v 2>cause he seen this guy do it has a fucking a thing,</v>

739
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:39.530
you know maybe Robbie can be put to sleep from.

740
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.940
There's guys that are weird like that,

741
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:43.550
that just certain positions they could go 30 minutes,

742
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:46.430
you're choking them and then they don't go to see.
Maybe Robbie's,

743
00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:49.590
that guy all knows he wasn't sleeping.
Yeah.
Well that's what Robbie said.

744
00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:53.700
Robbie said that he was waiting for band attires arms out.
That's what he said.

745
00:41:53.701 --> 00:41:56.700
He said he felt the tie,
the squeeze,
the squeeze really tight,
but he's like,

746
00:41:56.701 --> 00:41:58.350
I'll just let him gasses arms out here.

747
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.480
That was his thought look mean.

748
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.490
Michael [inaudible] said that when Kevin Lee got his back and they stopped the

749
00:42:05.491 --> 00:42:06.720
fight before he went out,
he said,

750
00:42:06.721 --> 00:42:08.940
I let my hands go because I was concentrating on my neck.

751
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.170
I was just tightening up by NACC and,
and trying to keep my blood flowing.

752
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.180
<v 3>I think that one was a little different than it was over naked,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

753
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.700
It was different.
You're going to go to sleep eventually

754
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.360
<v 2>and that one,
let a guy go to sleep like that one.</v>

755
00:42:21.361 --> 00:42:23.460
You should let a guy go to sleep and Adam.
Yeah,

756
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.350
<v 3>nothing happens.
You need to just wake them right up.
Hey,
you went to sleep.</v>

757
00:42:26.351 --> 00:42:29.460
Go Big that maybe they pee their pants while they went to sleep.
No big deal.

758
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.060
It's certain net cracks where you just go,
oh no,

759
00:42:33.061 --> 00:42:34.620
but that one's not going to put you in a wheelchair.

760
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.910
Not especially not from Ben's asthma problem.

761
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.500
<v 2>So your take is on all of this,
uh,</v>

762
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:48.200
trash talking media hype shit that you see going on now.

763
00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:49.034
You don't like it?

764
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.730
<v 3>I don't even know.
I think,
uh,
I fast forward,</v>

765
00:42:52.731 --> 00:42:55.170
it's not like it's distasteful right now to some point,

766
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.480
but if you just fast forward to the guys like me when I was 14 years old

767
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.510
watching the sport,
now you're looking at the dude's right not doing it.

768
00:43:02.511 --> 00:43:05.120
You're going to grow up and think,
oh well I got to do the same shit.

769
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.730
I just got to fucking talk shit.
Lot of shit.

770
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.200
I don't really gotta to go to the gym that much.

771
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:14.350
She's got to have a banging lit social network account and I'm fucking Golden,

772
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:18.200
you know?
And we see it,
you know,
a sage Northcutt for example,
you know,

773
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.450
great tans and stuff,
but um,
what he was getting paid out.
Did it make sense?

774
00:43:22.451 --> 00:43:25.790
So a lot of the fighters,
you know,
why,
why was he getting paid so much?

775
00:43:25.791 --> 00:43:26.900
Because of the social media is,

776
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.290
but as he really bringing in those people into the chairs and into the TV,

777
00:43:30.291 --> 00:43:33.360
because you have a lot of likes,
you know,
the things that I wonder,

778
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:34.900
not like to disagreement and them,

779
00:43:34.901 --> 00:43:38.090
but sometimes girls have like tremendous amount of followers,
you know.

780
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:42.470
Do those numbers translate to viewers on the TV or,

781
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.900
or like butts and seats or any of that?
Like I would like to know,
you know,

782
00:43:46.901 --> 00:43:51.170
and a lot of times when I've asked like people in the UFC and stuff,
they say no,

783
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.350
those numbers don't translate.
So what did they get more money?
You know,

784
00:43:54.351 --> 00:43:55.770
I'm not talking about the girls get more money than I was.

785
00:43:55.771 --> 00:43:59.180
I'm talking about guys that have like a social media presence that are just

786
00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:03.200
getting more money.
We'll just kinda translate certain amount.
No,

787
00:44:03.201 --> 00:44:04.250
I'm sure it does.
I'm sure

788
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.320
<v 2>guys like Colby Colby has got to translate.
I mean he's,
he talks so much shit.</v>

789
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:12.910
He gets people excited about the fights.
There's something to it.

790
00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.380
I don't know.
I just,
I appreciate what you're saying though.
And I look,

791
00:44:17.381 --> 00:44:21.430
I appreciate the way one fc handles things cause they concentrate on just

792
00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.940
fighters being honorable and fighting their best and find the best fighters they

793
00:44:24.941 --> 00:44:28.270
can fight.
And they don't emphasize that shit talking at all.

794
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.920
They emphasize the martial arts aspect of I get it,
me and you like each other.

795
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.930
<v 3>John Jones and DC.
I love it.
Cause you</v>

796
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.620
<v 5>feel these guys don't like each other.
You feel it.
Kill each other,
you know,</v>

797
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.220
but to me it's okay,
but he's doing it.
When Max Holloway fought Dustin,

798
00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.120
there was none of that.

799
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:45.940
There was just two guys who were the best in their weight class.

800
00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:48.880
I mean Max is the best hundred and 45 pound ever.

801
00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.020
And Dustin [inaudible] is absolutely one of the best wine at 55 pounders alive.

802
00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.560
And they're going to go after it.
And it was beautiful.
It was beautiful.

803
00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:59.980
It was a parking,
just biting them,
fighting,
shaking hands,

804
00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.080
full respect before and after.

805
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:06.780
<v 3>Yeah.
And I get a lot of people like they have that,
uh,
I hate using,</v>

806
00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.390
you're moving into a fight so they don't want to shake hands.
Like,
fuck you,

807
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:11.490
I don't like you,
you know,
but when,

808
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:16.730
when they're giving so much attention to that WWF stuff and pushing you to the

809
00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:19.950
forefront that,
um,
let me let you know,

810
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:22.980
and just to think that the kids watching it are going to be even worse.

811
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.130
They're going to do it to the next power.
Did,

812
00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:31.240
<v 5>did you get up,
I mean,
when,
when you went over and got into a fight with Leon,</v>

813
00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:33.190
you were being interviewed,

814
00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:37.720
he was yelling some shit at you while you're being interviewed and you walked

815
00:45:37.721 --> 00:45:39.210
over.
And one of the,

816
00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.190
one of the things that I like what you said is he walked over your hands behind

817
00:45:42.191 --> 00:45:43.870
your back.
You're like,
look what,
just talk.

818
00:45:43.871 --> 00:45:45.190
Say what the fuck you want to say to me.

819
00:45:45.191 --> 00:45:47.560
But then when he was standing in front of you like you wanted to punch you,

820
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.113
you're like,
okay

821
00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.480
<v 3>Ma,
you know,
at first or initially,
um,</v>

822
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:57.760
I was doing my interview and he's crossing by and he's with his corner man.

823
00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:02.850
And I dunno if this guy consumes a lot of drugs or what that he thought that

824
00:46:03.281 --> 00:46:04.060
that would intimidate.

825
00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.930
He means he was walking like this looking at me and like pacing back and forth

826
00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.670
and I'm trying to do my interview,
you know,

827
00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:14.680
and he asked me something about something,
a date and I say maybe,
maybe not.

828
00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.410
And then he tells me to shut up,
you know.

829
00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:21.340
Well everybody watching his back home from Miami who was like,

830
00:46:21.341 --> 00:46:23.530
you should've punched him as soon as he asked you a question while you're

831
00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.670
interview,
because that's my natural inkson.
You know,

832
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.460
if you're getting interviewed and some fucking idiot comes here and cuts your

833
00:46:30.461 --> 00:46:33.340
interior off,
but you should get punched or slapped upside your head,
you know,

834
00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.740
that'll teach you respect not to do it and nobody else again,

835
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:39.550
I should immediately done it,
but I didn't,
I answered his question politely.

836
00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.990
Maybe,
maybe not.
He goes on to say,
shut up after that.
I can't take that.

837
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.890
My daughter might be watching this interview.
I'm been telling her,

838
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:49.480
stand up to bullies your whole life.

839
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.090
Don't go running to somebody and tell him as soon.
So is picking on me.

840
00:46:52.091 --> 00:46:54.010
Handle it yourself.
That's what's wrong with this country.

841
00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:56.710
I think with this whole,
somebody picks on you.
Go tell somebody else.

842
00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.590
I'm not going to tell authorities this hooligans picking on me.

843
00:46:59.591 --> 00:47:02.140
I'm gonna handle it myself,
you know,
because I got to see him again.

844
00:47:02.141 --> 00:47:05.200
He's gonna think he could pick on me.
Got To handle it myself.
You know,

845
00:47:05.201 --> 00:47:08.700
I'm in my interview,
man.
You're gonna steal my moment.
I just worked out here.

846
00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.880
Just kicked some butt out here.

847
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.060
You barely want to split decision in your own country.

848
00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.660
I knocked this dude out and you're trying to steal my shine like this.
That,

849
00:47:16.661 --> 00:47:19.630
that's what I'm saying like,
and then he got famous off that,
which I hate.

850
00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:22.360
So only thing I could take back about that night,

851
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.840
that it wasn't filmed that and filmed it,
it'd be even better.
You know,

852
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.640
he was just gone off and sign this,
you know,

853
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.880
neon God has asked to helped you too.
Did it help me?
Yeah,

854
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:33.760
but it helped him more than anything.
No,

855
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.140
it helps people know who the school knows.
Mosfet all doesn't take any shit.

856
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:42.250
People have known that since they light before rainbows had color.

857
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:45.730
They already knew that man.
They didn't,
they didn't need to see me whooping.

858
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.050
They like to see it.
They'd like to get remembered though.
Yeah.

859
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.310
They like to see people have consequences for shit.

860
00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:57.940
Talking in this weird era of constant shit talking,
you know?

861
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.050
I think people enjoy it.
They like it.
And if you guys ever fight,

862
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:06.970
but makes it a bigger fight for sure.
My Gosh,
man,
you know me guess,

863
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.740
but does that like I beat number city.
I've been in this sport for a while.

864
00:48:10.741 --> 00:48:12.100
I've been beating up guys.

865
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:16.700
Would that validate them to fight me when I don't eat in the top 10 guy?

866
00:48:16.701 --> 00:48:19.300
You still yet to be the top 10 guy,
you know,
like,

867
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:23.110
but he could get that fight off that,
that,
that's the new age and era.
That.
Right?

868
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.140
Right.
That's a concern.
That's a concern.

869
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.130
I'll fuck when when his,
when he's beating the top Tim Guy,

870
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:33.850
I'm going to be the first guy to expose him to break his face,

871
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.700
but until that moment comes,
you're,

872
00:48:35.701 --> 00:48:38.200
you're talking about the business side because you already saw on the personal

873
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:42.010
side,
any day of the week I will address you,
but on the business side,

874
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.660
get to my level buddy,
put in the fucking word.
Go beat a top 10 guy.

875
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.280
Knock him the fuck out.

876
00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.790
Did you talk about getting in trouble for punching somebody in another country?

877
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.970
I was scared out of my fucking life,
Joe.
That's what I'm thinking.

878
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.640
I was scared of.
I thought this guy was going to kill me,
man.

879
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.630
I might've not looked it,
but I was scared out of my life.
Yeah,
I get it.

880
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.530
I'm very cold blooded.
You know,
I get that from,
from genetics,

881
00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:07.930
from my pops in them,
but I was scared out of my mind.

882
00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.870
I thought this guy was going to take everything I had.
You know,

883
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.640
you had to do that.
I had to defend.
I understand,

884
00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:16.660
but did you worry at all about them arresting you or any weird shit like that

885
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:20.040
over there?
I mean you,
you're in another corner to press charges.
I,

886
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.010
that's how scared I was.

887
00:49:21.011 --> 00:49:23.590
But I'm not going to press charges because I understand how my man,

888
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.380
but that's how I felt.
You were in danger.

889
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:30.860
I was fucking hell of in danger and just do not see it was not just one say it.

890
00:49:30.861 --> 00:49:34.750
And he's just him and his crew of hooligans.
Hooligans,

891
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.030
lawless people.
I had to defend myself.

892
00:49:37.031 --> 00:49:38.800
I did everything in my right to defend myself.

893
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:43.630
It was one against like three or four dudes and they know it.
It's on video.
Okay,

894
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.920
I understand.
I understand.
And so the,
with the police say to that,

895
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.590
oh they ain't telling me nothing man.
They didn't tell you shit.

896
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:53.910
I didn't speak to know polices.
That's amazing.
No,
no police for me.

897
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:57.880
No talking to anyways in the Spanglish,

898
00:49:57.881 --> 00:50:02.050
immediately we go on mute and I looked to get English.
Huh?

899
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.360
Okay.
And then pick English.
Yeah.

900
00:50:05.361 --> 00:50:08.460
I mean how many times he fought England before the war.
First Time.
Yeah.

901
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:11.800
So like if you've go the rest of your career and you can't go to England.

902
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.980
Oh well no,
that would show up.
I really liked England.
Did you?

903
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.830
Fans are so knowledgeable and they were just cool.

904
00:50:17.831 --> 00:50:21.010
Even the ones who were like till fans and we said like a funny joke to me or

905
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:24.400
something cool.
But it wasn't like that weird bad energy,
you know?

906
00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:27.970
Even if there were till fans,
but just be like,
oh my boy,
Jill's going to get,
you

907
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.800
<v 2>know,
but it'd be like funny and how they say cheeky,
you know,
it was,</v>

908
00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.620
it was a great experience everywhere I went and the people were super,

909
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:38.540
super duper cool.
Yeah.
Um,
Brazil's rough.
If someone's fighting a Brazilian.

910
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.780
Yeah,
they don't,
they don't,
I've heard this story.

911
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.660
I have yet to find a solution for nationalistic and proud.
Very proud.

912
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.290
So they're not into people coming over there and fight and Brazilians and I got

913
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:51.230
to be friendly to you.
Yeah.
But England's different men,
they're very polite,

914
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.113
very knowledgeable.

915
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.600
Every one of the countries has been around for a while with the sport.
Yeah.

916
00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.740
What'd you think about that style?
Bender gasoline fight.
Oh,
that was pretty good,

917
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:05.100
man.
That was wild.
Shadi good tested both.
Both tests.

918
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:09.140
Exam both tested Cason.
Who's got a ton of heart?
Ooh,

919
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:12.710
he's a tank was nobody.
He didn't get mad at him.
If in the fifth round he said,

920
00:51:12.711 --> 00:51:17.690
you know what?
Yeah,
he just fucking kept going.
Stop Dell again.
Survived.

921
00:51:17.691 --> 00:51:20.450
I mean just how incredible it looked like style band and was going to take him

922
00:51:20.451 --> 00:51:21.500
out several times.
Yeah,

923
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:27.070
I mean what a fight and to have Calvin land the first big shot early on and drop

924
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:30.740
style bender and show him some real adversity and let them know,
hey man,

925
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:34.340
do you can get knocked the fuck out in this fight.
You know that that was a,

926
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:39.240
that was a real awesome moment,
man.
What a fight too,
man.
Back and forth.

927
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.430
Yep.
Ooh,

928
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:44.570
so much chaos and till have Calvin head kick him and rock him.

929
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:45.860
How bout that shit?

930
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.180
The thing that really rock style bender with a fucking head cake from Calvin.

931
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.800
Calvin would press him up against the cage,
maybe get a take down,

932
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:57.560
but just definitely keep them up against the Cajun work them there.
You know,

933
00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:01.910
with his wrestling background went,
I didn't,
I didn't see that going like that,

934
00:52:01.911 --> 00:52:05.540
you know?
Yeah.
There was some wild scrambles on the ground too.

935
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:08.420
Was Towel Bennett threw up that fucking triangles.
Like whoa,

936
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:13.070
he's got a game on the ground.
He said gifted athlete and fast as fuck,
man,

937
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:14.150
there's more than just gifted.

938
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:17.880
He you could tell you that puts in the work 100% and he's smart as fuck.
Yeah,

939
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:22.910
he's smart and creative and just has a broad encyclopedia of,
of,

940
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:25.940
first of all striking knowledge.
But obviously when he went to the ground,

941
00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:28.910
he knew what the fuck to do man.
He was throwing up triangles.

942
00:52:28.911 --> 00:52:30.440
He locked Kelvin up in a triangle.

943
00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:34.070
It's just they're slippery and it's the end of the fight and you know,

944
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.310
he popped out of it with all,

945
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:38.780
obviously Kevin use the right technique to get out of it too.

946
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.130
But that was a serious fucking triangle attempt.
This is a serious fight.
Me.

947
00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.920
That was a good areas for your hard earned money for that fight.
Oh yeah.

948
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:50.570
Well I hope um enough people got a chance to watch it cause I dunno what that

949
00:52:50.571 --> 00:52:52.310
ESPN plus Debaca was.

950
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.530
Cause apparently there were a bunch of people that couldn't get it.

951
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:55.091
Like there was,

952
00:52:55.091 --> 00:52:59.510
she had a sign up rate to the APP and there were some crashes and some people

953
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:03.200
wouldn't work on their device and they had an order it online then it still

954
00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:07.250
didn't work.
So on paper views now bought through ESPN?

955
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.090
Yes.
Oh I didn't know that.
I thought it was just like some,
no,

956
00:53:11.091 --> 00:53:14.990
it's all of them from now on.
So can you have direct TV?
Tough Shit.

957
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:18.590
You got to get it through ESPN plus I think it's a good move because I think in

958
00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:20.150
the future that's where everything's going to be.

959
00:53:20.151 --> 00:53:21.830
I think the UFC just got way ahead of it.

960
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:25.440
Whereas most people are still like boxing matches and shit.
You're getting,

961
00:53:25.441 --> 00:53:26.274
most of them,

962
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.450
<v 5>you're getting them off of a paper view on Directv or cable or whatever the fuck</v>

963
00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:34.410
you use.
But now they're using that disown,
you know,
does zone has a lot of uh,

964
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.010
fights you get from that APP and a lot of boxing matches.

965
00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:42.990
The ones just signed Canelo to that huge,
huge deal.
They signed triple G.

966
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.990
Yes.
You know,
so they're doing a lot of streaming shit too.

967
00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:46.630
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

968
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:50.410
I saw a commercial with the other day at Dave and Buster's with a Tracy Morgan,

969
00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:50.780
anything.

970
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:54.140
<v 5>Hmm.
Yeah,
yeah.
Streaming I think is the future.</v>

971
00:53:54.141 --> 00:53:56.600
And I think that's why the design got way ahead of it.

972
00:53:56.601 --> 00:53:58.910
And then ESPN plus getting way ahead of it too.

973
00:53:58.911 --> 00:54:03.911
I think they see where the writing on the wall is just from here to there to

974
00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.410
take a little bit of time because people,

975
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:08.420
everybody's used to just pay per view is a TV,
you know,

976
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:12.530
I think whatever Comcast people going to get used to having their TV connected

977
00:54:12.531 --> 00:54:13.071
to the Internet,

978
00:54:13.071 --> 00:54:15.530
there's a lot of fucking people that don't have their TV connected to the

979
00:54:15.531 --> 00:54:20.060
Internet,
you know?
So once people start using,
yeah,

980
00:54:20.061 --> 00:54:23.210
once people start using like apple TV and connect through that and then get the

981
00:54:23.211 --> 00:54:26.000
APP through apple or use a,
you know,

982
00:54:26.001 --> 00:54:29.270
a android or whatever the fuck they use to get online.

983
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.510
It'll be normal to have that on your TV in five years.

984
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:35.480
But right now it's,
it's rough.

985
00:54:35.481 --> 00:54:37.310
If you don't have that and you want to see the fights

986
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.820
<v 3>or if you come from the stone and you'd like me,</v>

987
00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:45.020
<v 5>you've got an internet labyrinth.
It's,
it gets crazy,
man.
Yeah.</v>

988
00:54:45.021 --> 00:54:46.610
I wonder how the pay structure works.
Like,

989
00:54:46.611 --> 00:54:49.850
say if you get a title fight and say you beat ass grin and then you get a title

990
00:54:49.851 --> 00:54:53.020
fight with Guzman,
um,
what men,

991
00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:57.110
how do they do that with ESPN plus as opposed to like paper view points or

992
00:54:57.111 --> 00:55:00.770
something like that.
That's so true,
man.
How does that work?

993
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:04.850
Oh yeah.
Look at you like you're in pain.
No,
I've got,
I'm using brainpower

994
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.040
and require it requires energy.

995
00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:14.120
That's why there's this gentleman by the name of Abraham cow and let them do it.

996
00:55:14.121 --> 00:55:16.790
All that man.
It's good move.
Yeah,
let Ayp handle it.

997
00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:20.040
<v 3>Yeah,
he's been there.
Done that.
Negotiated bigger contracts in mine.</v>

998
00:55:20.041 --> 00:55:21.970
So just Haber,
take care of me.
You know.

999
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:26.550
<v 5>Now this aspirin fight,
um,
you're,
you're fighting him in July.</v>

1000
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:29.460
That what does that,
July 6th?
Yes sir.
Um,

1001
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.090
when do you like how much of a camp do you give yourself?

1002
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:37.460
How much of like a fully dedicated,
just all in camp,
all day.

1003
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.060
Every day.
All Day.
Every day.

1004
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.140
<v 3>If you look at them from skillset,</v>

1005
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:47.360
Ben's not even worth waking up before like 10:00 AM in the morning.

1006
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:51.590
But I don't like this dude,
man,
before my alarm goes off,
I'm already awake.

1007
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:55.280
I want to break his fucking face,
man on a break,
his fucking rib cage.

1008
00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.550
And I don't want to knock them out early on.
I don't,

1009
00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.570
I just want to hurt towards you.
That guy,
man,

1010
00:55:59.571 --> 00:56:04.571
if I get the chance to torture him 14 minutes and 50 seconds before I stop him,

1011
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:09.560
that's what I'm going to do,
man.
You know,
I just,
I don't like to dude at all.

1012
00:56:09.561 --> 00:56:13.290
Met him a long time ago.
He's a fucking break man.
I don't like me.

1013
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:18.080
There's not too many people that I generally dislike.
He's one of them.
You know,

1014
00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:19.970
if I was a senior right now,

1015
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.010
probably wouldn't be friendly of a greeting,

1016
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.843
<v 5>you know?</v>

1017
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:30.210
Now do you base this on how he talks shit and just plays around and tries to

1018
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:33.820
hype things up?
Or if you had a like a real conversation with them,

1019
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.890
<v 4>combination of things,
you know,
uh,
like,
um,
I'm the type of dude that,
um,
if we,</v>

1020
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.080
if we train you go to American top team Joe,

1021
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.410
and let's say I get lucky and I tap you out twice.

1022
00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:48.940
I'm not going to ever tell nobody that because I,
that's not my glory moment.

1023
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:51.400
That's just fucking training.
I don't give a fuck about that.

1024
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.570
I already forgot about that.

1025
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:57.130
But there's some people and they violate that man cold of Jim and the,

1026
00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.300
I went to American top team and it like,
he's that type of,
of Pussy,
you know,

1027
00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:02.880
and I go,
he's talking about Jim stores.

1028
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:05.830
He came over to American top team after I dumped him on his head.

1029
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.530
We kept wrestling,
he got scrambled me and he said it.
Yeah,

1030
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.550
you beat me rushing with,
we were straight wrestling,
two time national champion.

1031
00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:16.070
You're proud of that.
You're telling people that,
you know,
and,
uh,
it,

1032
00:57:16.071 --> 00:57:19.990
it just shows me his character,
you know,
he's not,
he's not who he pretends to be.

1033
00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:23.260
And then he talks so much online and then I could have respected them a little

1034
00:57:23.261 --> 00:57:25.450
bit if he had held to his guns.

1035
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:29.820
But I see him in London and as soon as I seen him,
I start walking towards him.

1036
00:57:29.821 --> 00:57:32.140
He goes,
hey man,
ah,
I'm going to spare you.

1037
00:57:32.141 --> 00:57:35.620
I'm not going to say nothing to after your fight,
Ben.

1038
00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:38.550
Don't do me no fucking favors,
bro.
You're not doing me no favors.

1039
00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:41.040
Say whatever the fuck you want when you want it.
You know?
And,

1040
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:44.290
and I dressed him and I went up to talk to him and UFC got involved.

1041
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:47.380
He put his head down and they escorted him out of the hotel and he never came

1042
00:57:47.381 --> 00:57:49.180
back to that hotel,
you know?

1043
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:52.150
And he actually wished me good luck at some point too,
like right before,
like,

1044
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:55.780
why are you doing this,
man?
You're not that person on,
on,

1045
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:59.280
on social media that you portray to be.
You're not,
you know,
so you're,

1046
00:57:59.281 --> 00:58:00.370
you're fake as fuck.

1047
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.520
You're selling something to the public that is not there obviously,

1048
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:06.220
and you're a coward.
Fuck it.
Let's throw that in there too.

1049
00:58:06.221 --> 00:58:08.740
And if people don't believe me,
tune in July six I'll show you what,

1050
00:58:08.741 --> 00:58:09.850
how much of a coward he is.

1051
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:11.490
<v 5>Just to play devil's advocate,</v>

1052
00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:15.870
don't you think that what he's doing is smart marketing to play devils?

1053
00:58:15.871 --> 00:58:19.530
I know you don't like it.
I know you don't like it,
but to play devil's advocate,

1054
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.990
but it's corny though.
I when he looks back,
it's Corny.
Like ain't nobody going,

1055
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:29.550
oh,
he just wants validation.
He wants to be accepted.

1056
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.870
I think half of what he's doing is corny on purpose.
All that.
Boom roasted shit.

1057
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.170
Come on,
man.
Half that stuff is corny on purpose.

1058
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.320
<v 4>No,
no,
no.
That guy,</v>

1059
00:58:38.321 --> 00:58:40.240
you haven't seen him and you haven't hung around with that guys.

1060
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:41.230
Just fucking corny.

1061
00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:46.210
<v 5>It's in his DNA.
I like talking to him.
He's a smart motherfucker.</v>

1062
00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.400
It might be smart man,
but he's appointing motherfucker

1063
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:53.140
and he's this cocky for all the wrong reasons.
I just can't wait.

1064
00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:56.350
I love the fact that you're a purist like this though.
I really do.

1065
00:58:56.410 --> 00:59:01.240
I want to hurt that.
I know you do.
I want to hurt that dude.

1066
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:02.990
It's going to be a great fight.
It's,

1067
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.100
it's one of those interesting fights because you've got good wrestling,

1068
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:08.950
takedown defense.
You've got very good wrestling.
You gotta good,
very good.

1069
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:12.490
Takedowns yourself,
but you clearly have a big advantage and striking,

1070
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:16.890
so it's one of those Ken he imposes will kind of get ahold of you.

1071
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:20.550
You to get ahold of these fucking nuts,
man.

1072
00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:24.863
Wow.

1073
00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:34.880
<v 3>They'll say to my face in minute,
cool bro,</v>

1074
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:38.180
I'm a punk,
or whatever you call,
you shared it to my face,
you know,

1075
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.770
but you'd see it online.

1076
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:42.970
It's just the hallway get said about you see it online and then when you see me

1077
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.830
with what's up,
hey,
how are you eating?
Picture

1078
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.740
fucking kidding me,
man.
The fuck is,

1079
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.790
I feel like I've been brought up from like a twilight zone.

1080
00:59:53.791 --> 00:59:54.800
It from a different dimension.

1081
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:58.520
Sometimes there's a lot of these rapper fighters that you see acting like

1082
00:59:58.521 --> 01:00:02.570
criminals on the social media when they see me,
hey,
what's up bro?

1083
01:00:02.571 --> 01:00:05.720
Let me get a picture off fucking fanboyed out.
Oh Man,

1084
01:00:05.721 --> 01:00:09.350
I could have sworn you were just mentioning my name.
Seen some shit,

1085
01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:13.660
<v 5>bro.
It's fucking nuts to me.
Most of my mind.
Right.</v>

1086
01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:17.490
I'm such a simpleton boy.
It just blows my mind.
Every thought.
Europe purist.

1087
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.000
I don't know if it's a pure and simple.
I don't know where you want to put me,

1088
01:00:21.001 --> 01:00:23.460
but it's simple.
Just don't want to play that game.

1089
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:26.070
You're not interested in that game.
It's mine.
Listen,

1090
01:00:26.071 --> 01:00:29.220
Khabib on isn't that fucking game either,
but he was on top of Connor.

1091
01:00:29.221 --> 01:00:33.240
Let's talk now.
Bam.
Let's talk.
Let's talk now.

1092
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:37.020
Same Shit purist.
I love it.
I do.

1093
01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.890
I appreciate when that shit talking has consequences.

1094
01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:43.590
I like some shit talking though.
It's fun

1095
01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:48.030
<v 3>when you back it up.
Yeah.
Back that shit up.</v>

1096
01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:51.920
Now you see me in a hallway lobby and fucking run to security and get a squirt

1097
01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:52.350
it down.

1098
01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:55.470
<v 5>Who's the guy you fought in the past you had the most beef with before you</v>

1099
01:00:55.471 --> 01:00:56.304
actually fought?

1100
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.650
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1101
01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.640
<v 5>I don't know.
I never really had like real deep,
so not like this fight,</v>

1102
01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:14.160
like telling you went back and forth a little bit,
right?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1103
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.250
<v 3>We went back and forth like,
Hey,
you want to fight yet?
A steward.
I fuck it.
Boom,</v>

1104
01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:20.300
boom,
boom.
But we never even,
it was pretty respected.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1105
01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.850
It was a cool dude,
man.
What about cowboy?
Cowboy?
I mean,
yeah,

1106
01:01:23.851 --> 01:01:27.960
a little bit of beef.
You know,
nothing crazy.
Like if I see him in the street,

1107
01:01:27.961 --> 01:01:29.680
we went and start fucking fighting or nothing.
You know?

1108
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.370
Is that what you mean by like beef or just like we were going back and forth

1109
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.910
talking shit to each other like,
yeah,
mean Cambodia,
you buy me Calvin,

1110
01:01:35.911 --> 01:01:40.200
we're talking a lot of shit back and forth to each other,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.

1111
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.580
It was coming from genuine places,
from both sides,
you know?
So it was good.

1112
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:46.980
It made,
it gave that fire,
you know?
Yeah,
that's definitely one.

1113
01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.670
It came from like a little bit of light.
This aspirin one,

1114
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.420
I respect the cap.
We're going into that fight.
You know,
obviously he's,

1115
01:01:54.421 --> 01:01:58.020
I think he's a fucking stud bone.
He proves it again,
by having the most wins.

1116
01:01:58.021 --> 01:02:01.130
Most knockouts,
emissions,
dude's a stud.
I,

1117
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:05.700
I don't think aspirins even yet to get a wind in the UFC.
You know,

1118
01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:09.390
I just think about it like if I had fought Robbie Lawler,

1119
01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.530
which was a great champion and has done amazing things in the sport since the

1120
01:02:13.531 --> 01:02:16.060
start of Robbie to now by the guy still fight him.

1121
01:02:16.061 --> 01:02:20.350
And I remember watching him in the UFC back back in the day 37

1122
01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.260
<v 2>and a half with the fuck discounts when he came along and a half deal fucking</v>

1123
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:28.920
lean.
People still call it looked amazing.
It looks,
yeah,

1124
01:02:28.921 --> 01:02:30.060
it looked fucking amazing.

1125
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:33.180
What's amazing physically when he hoisted ask her up in the air and dumped him

1126
01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:37.710
on his head and then started just driving his fucking knuckles through his
brain.

1127
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:41.760
And it shows you how tough askern is.
The dude's durable is fucked man.

1128
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:45.450
He handled that.
He's built for survival even by his body type.

1129
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:49.860
You can tell that physiologically he's just built for a guy like me to put them

1130
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:52.680
under the radar like,
Oh,
this guy's not a threat.
Look at him,
you know,

1131
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:53.850
but it's not going to work.

1132
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:57.240
I already know what to do to this guy and just fucking hurt a man.

1133
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:00.090
Even the way he's fucking bill is for patheticness.

1134
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:03.120
Let's skip the subject matters to go to somebody else,
man.

1135
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.660
I met this guy famous on your show.
Well,
it's too late.
Too late.
Well,
listen man,

1136
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:11.700
they put his picture up on the,
on the marquee.
He gets a big pop.
It's crazy.

1137
01:03:11.701 --> 01:03:16.290
People love it.
Ask Him.
I guess.
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.
Loved him before.

1138
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.510
He fought in the UFC too.

1139
01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:22.780
I had never seen that because I saw an England and England.

1140
01:03:23.101 --> 01:03:24.930
They didn't fucking hated his ass man.

1141
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:27.960
They were born them out of the fucking stage and she looks like he belongs
there.

1142
01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:31.860
Right?
It looks like,
ah,
you're left us lad.

1143
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:38.160
He looks like an English guy.
Doesn't need,
I guess man does not like a,

1144
01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:40.080
what do you think his nationality is?
Aspirin.

1145
01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.250
He looks like he probably has some English in him.
Curly hair.

1146
01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:48.810
White English dudes and curly hair.
Yeah,
you got it.
He's got a while.

1147
01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:52.410
That's wrestling style,
wrestling style.
It's funky.

1148
01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.020
It's very unusual.
Very effective.

1149
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:57.420
You know he's going to have that wrestle Mattrick Jordan Burroughs.

1150
01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.690
She doesn't get smashed.
Is that before or after yours?
I think you said before.

1151
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:03.210
Does that concern you?
And you might get injured doing that.

1152
01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.660
I don't give a fuck if he does this because he faked an injury out.
You know,

1153
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.520
he knows what he's doing.
He's a big boy.
You know?

1154
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.150
It's like if you're going to fight Joe Romeo and uh,

1155
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.670
one of your teammates might come up to you and tell you like,
hey man,

1156
01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:16.890
I think you should fake the injury in the Drake.
What drove him?

1157
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.230
I would just fake the injury and cop out of that fight.
You don't want no,

1158
01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.560
no problems with that guy,
you know?
So that might be what he's trying to do.

1159
01:04:22.561 --> 01:04:27.540
Who knows?
Man.
Damn.
Damn.
Fucking 185 pound division.

1160
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:31.050
We were Maryland.
What a division now.

1161
01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.050
Now with style vendor and gas,
Tulum and then style benders.

1162
01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:38.130
Gonna Fight Whitaker and I hope you're well fights board.

1163
01:04:38.131 --> 01:04:42.420
Cina they're supposed to fight,
right?
Paulo Kosta that they're supposed to fight.

1164
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.553
I don't know.

1165
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.560
I thought I knew he was gonna Fight Jaggery then Joel got her and Yo al was

1166
01:04:49.951 --> 01:04:52.650
supposed to fight,
um,
Paulo first,

1167
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:56.430
but then someone got hurt there.
It might've been Paulo,

1168
01:04:56.431 --> 01:05:01.431
but Paul's healed up again and the Jacques Rey fights out and so they set a new

1169
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:03.210
fight up for Shakuri.

1170
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.020
So [inaudible] he's got an opponent and now Yo el doesn't

1171
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:13.290
man.
It's fucking crazy division.
Now that division is a real shark tank.

1172
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.011
Tell you truth.

1173
01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:18.450
I would like to see Joel fight for the title cause I feel now take nothing away

1174
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.710
from Whittaker guy.
I think he's one of the baddest dude on the planet.

1175
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:23.860
I feel [inaudible] I feel like you went to the second fight.

1176
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:25.360
The first fight straight or with a good one.

1177
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:27.780
The second one I straight up thought Joel One.

1178
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:32.080
I was actually there in his corner and I was like,
oh we got this.
Wow.
You know,

1179
01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:35.820
he won the third round one,
the fourth one,
the fifth.
And also with the damage,

1180
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.970
significant damage with the new world.
I think,

1181
01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:42.070
I don't know if they use the new scorecards,
the new scoring method,

1182
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:45.660
but if they did and he didn't win then it's a real travesty.
But he had,

1183
01:05:45.661 --> 01:05:49.100
he had him hurt and that wasn't a 10,
eight round original ten seven.

1184
01:05:49.101 --> 01:05:51.520
What's the big difference in that fight?
In my opinion,

1185
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:55.900
Robert Whitaker for sure scored.
He fought well,
he won rounds.

1186
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:58.690
But when you allow hurt him,
he really fucking hurt him.

1187
01:05:58.691 --> 01:06:02.200
And there was no moments like that for Whitaker where he had UL staggered and

1188
01:06:02.201 --> 01:06:07.201
almost out Winokur's I'll fucking based on at superintelligent Duda when he

1189
01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:11.010
fights man him and stop and it's going to be very unusual cause that's a,

1190
01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:15.250
that's a big step up to go from uh,

1191
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:18.580
from style bender to go from the very first fight in the UFC,

1192
01:06:18.581 --> 01:06:20.860
which was only like a year and a half ago,

1193
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.950
all the way up to Robert Whitaker in a year and a half.
It's amazing.

1194
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.090
It's an amazing step up.
Whitaker's something special.

1195
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:32.280
And he's another guy that was a one 70 just cut and way too much weight.

1196
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.580
Couldn't do it.
Went up to one 85 and really found his own place.
So many guys,

1197
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:39.700
I think they're in that category,
whether it'd be healthier if they went up.
Yeah.

1198
01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.760
Oh yeah.
But when you saw Holloway versus poor,
Yay.

1199
01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:47.710
Did you get the impression that really Holloway should stay at one 45 mm?

1200
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.780
Yes and no,
because I,
I know personally [inaudible] I know he packs a punch,

1201
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:55.900
so I don't think it's like all your career 55 is done.

1202
01:06:55.901 --> 01:06:59.080
Max know you fought one of the,
the more clever,

1203
01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:03.830
powerful punches because one of the better boxer,
one of the better box and,

1204
01:07:03.831 --> 01:07:08.300
and to the nit and gritty of it,
man,
dps like a broader,
you know,
he's,

1205
01:07:08.301 --> 01:07:10.960
he likes her bra,
but an intelligent one,
you know,

1206
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:14.680
he wants to hit you as much as he can without getting hit.
Very greedy,
you know?

1207
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:18.940
And uh,
I think it was just a bad fight for Max.
I think Mexican fucking,

1208
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.040
there's a lot of guys max murders at one 55 I think.
You know,
I think so too.

1209
01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:27.490
I think so too.
But I think at one 45 he's almost unstoppable.
Yeah.
That,

1210
01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.520
I don't even know how he makes one 45.
I don't know how it makes it either,

1211
01:07:30.521 --> 01:07:33.820
but when he gets down there,
man,
he's just something special.
He doesn't,

1212
01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:36.340
it doesn't seem to diminish him in his performance.

1213
01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.730
I'll give you look at its performance against Ortega.
He can make it,

1214
01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:43.900
he can make that weight and once he gets there,
man,
good luck catching up.

1215
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:48.190
That gas tank of his is credible.
This,
it's incredible.
Footwork,

1216
01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:51.040
timing,
uh,
the fakes that he throws it,

1217
01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:54.310
he switches up and then he explodes and then he fakes fakes and he explodes as,

1218
01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:56.650
I love his rhythm and patch.
Yeah.
Very,

1219
01:07:56.651 --> 01:08:00.940
very great at distant management and also switching stances and being creative

1220
01:08:00.941 --> 01:08:05.020
and never always giving you a different look.
Yes.
He's,
he's amazing man.

1221
01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.410
He's a special guy.
He really is.
He's in my pound for pound this,
you know,

1222
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:11.340
might as well.
And he takes a loss like a fucking man.
I mean,

1223
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.160
just takes that loss so well.
He now,
he's like,
hey,
it is what it is.
He's a great

1224
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.490
<v 5>champion.
He beat a champion,
you know?
No,</v>

1225
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:22.420
I'm still the champ at one 45 it's like laughing and shit.
Like he,
he took,

1226
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.930
he gave everything he had.
He came up short,
no excuses and,

1227
01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.760
and full respect to Dustin.
It was great man.
Maybe a year or two from the,

1228
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:35.000
I can run it back 100% copa fires from me.
He's only 27 yeah.

1229
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:38.780
That's even crazier.
Already.
The best featherweight of all time.

1230
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:42.170
One of the best pound for pound fighters for sure on the planet earth.

1231
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.960
Only 27 he's good.
And his grappling defensively,
he's pretty fucking good.
Yeah.

1232
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:51.110
He throws his chokes up and shit.
You can do everything.
Scary dude.
Yeah,

1233
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:53.810
he does everything.
He really does.
I mean,
it's a,

1234
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:57.320
it's an amazing time for the sport really is.
There's so much talent right now.

1235
01:08:57.790 --> 01:09:00.860
I wish you still had the 25 division.
I,
I liked that division.

1236
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:04.490
Well they still kind of do,
I mean Benevidez is still,
uh,

1237
01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:08.150
still trying to set up something,
you know,

1238
01:09:08.151 --> 01:09:12.290
and if so Hutto goes up and beat smile Mris and decides to still defend his

1239
01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:17.030
hundred 25 pound title,
that's a huge fight.
Fight.
Marlin's a scary cat.
Yeah,

1240
01:09:17.031 --> 01:09:20.690
he's just scary cat.
But Shawshee judo.
Oh yeah.
Wow.
Oh yeah.

1241
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:25.510
<v 4>I remember when Judah won that gold medal we were watching.
I was,</v>

1242
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:29.440
we were already like fans of him and stuff and he came over to American top team

1243
01:09:29.441 --> 01:09:32.620
not long afterwards and a user already working on and he said,
no,

1244
01:09:32.621 --> 01:09:34.180
I'm going to keep brushing,
but I want to fight him.

1245
01:09:34.181 --> 01:09:38.830
And Jimmy and I remember watching him,
uh,
this guy work out.
He was like maybe 20,

1246
01:09:38.831 --> 01:09:39.940
21 cause he was,
he,

1247
01:09:39.941 --> 01:09:44.080
I think he's the youngest gold medalist ever in at least American history.

1248
01:09:44.081 --> 01:09:45.460
I don't know if all wrestling history.

1249
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:48.100
So I remember watching him work and I was like,
man,
that dude,

1250
01:09:48.101 --> 01:09:51.340
one day we'll do something big in this sport.
If he commits to it.

1251
01:09:51.341 --> 01:09:54.430
The way he did the wrestling and showing off,
he's done fucking huge thing.

1252
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:58.580
<v 5>Well,
the way took out Tj,
I definitely thought it was an early stoppage,</v>

1253
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:03.230
but I definitely thought Tj was fucked.
He was in a bad place and if so,

1254
01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:05.690
who knows if they'd just let it go for another 10 15 seconds.

1255
01:10:05.691 --> 01:10:08.330
He might've shut the lights out on Tj and we don't,
we don't know.

1256
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.840
But the fact that he just staggered them and just came out right off the bat and

1257
01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:16.610
just start dropping bombs on Tj.
I mean that,
that just show and again,

1258
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.870
the backgrounds in wrestling,

1259
01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:21.650
she shows you what an athlete he is and how quick he learns when he fought

1260
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:24.230
Wilson Hayes and all of sudden it's fighting like karate fighter.

1261
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.030
Remember that he was standing sideways and then he drops like blitz,
right?

1262
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:30.800
Hands on.
I'm like,
what the fuck?

1263
01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:33.800
Like look at how he's fighting the fact that he can incorporate all these

1264
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:37.040
different styles too.
He's something special.
Endurance,
power,

1265
01:10:37.041 --> 01:10:39.640
speed and success.
You know the guy,

1266
01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:43.820
the first guy ever to be an Olympic gold medalist and wrestling and then a UFC

1267
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:48.590
world champion.
A beats the best guy ever,
ever,
ever,
ever.

1268
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:51.260
You know what I mean?
It's amazing.
He's an,
he's an amazing guy.

1269
01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:55.280
Something else to me.
That's another guy that the right books on.
Yup.
Whoa.

1270
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.570
That's another scary fucker.
Yeah.
He's uh,
he's a special guy.
I'm a,

1271
01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:01.090
I hope he get fucking

1272
01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:06.410
paid over there at one FC.
I really do.

1273
01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:09.380
And they have a deep talent pool over there.
They have littler guys in Asia.

1274
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:11.180
You know there's a lot of guys over there for him

1275
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:14.010
<v 4>and they got a lot of a,
I know they bring in a lot</v>

1276
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.140
<v 5>of good Muay Thai guys,</v>

1277
01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:19.110
which I know mighty should just scoop them up and put them on the head but still

1278
01:11:19.111 --> 01:11:22.320
be fun and still be fun to say cause those high level Thai guys are fucking

1279
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:23.213
something else.

1280
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.630
Mighty mouse is entertain the idea of having grappling matches over in one fc

1281
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.090
and even maybe possibly kickboxing matches.
They want to say,
cause you know,

1282
01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:34.920
they do everything over there.
One FC has a fucking huge audience,

1283
01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:36.570
man.
And you know,
they're talking about 40,

1284
01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:39.920
80 million people are watching you to vet each event Nasia no way.

1285
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.240
And all throughout the world.
Yeah.
It's giant.

1286
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:46.020
And they hear it over here in America too.
I think it was on the encore network.

1287
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:49.530
I was flipping through the channels and a,
it was on,
I was like Whoa.
Okay.

1288
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.730
So it's on,
it's on TV in America too.
I had no idea.
Yeah,
it was after the fact.

1289
01:11:53.731 --> 01:11:58.590
It wasn't live.
I mean I think you could watch it live on bleacher report live.

1290
01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:02.220
There was a website,
right?
You Watch it on bleacher report live,

1291
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:05.670
what the day of the event.
And I think it was free,
wasn't it?

1292
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:11.090
Uh,
find that out.
I think it was anyway.
Um,

1293
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:13.860
it was free to watch the replay on television and flick.

1294
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:15.210
They got fucking high level athletes.

1295
01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:20.040
That Guy Nasty Ucan who knocked out every Alvarez that cause the guy's legit as

1296
01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:22.590
fuck.
You could take out Eddie Alvarez like that.

1297
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:27.100
You're legit as fuck and got some Thai guys.
Twitter.
Gary was scaring them.

1298
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:32.330
225 fucking Thai fights.
How about yachts and clot?

1299
01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:36.970
How about they got yachts and Clive fighting with MMA gloves on almost.
See,
Ooh,

1300
01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:42.240
he's so dangerous to let him fight Thai style.

1301
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:46.740
But with MMA gloves it's like I love it man.
I fucking love that.

1302
01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:49.710
That's how they get to like they get tagged their grips a little better than

1303
01:12:49.711 --> 01:12:52.590
maybe the take downs are going to come out a little better there and the shell

1304
01:12:52.591 --> 01:12:54.870
does not work as well.
Yeah,
exactly.
The shell,

1305
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:57.780
the hands come sneak through little spots and that's what happened with him and

1306
01:12:57.781 --> 01:13:00.090
Andy Sour and with our glass.
Oof.

1307
01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:04.170
It's what happens when these like high level strikers come into high level like

1308
01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:08.930
MMA.
Amazed.
They think they're safe.
When you're fucking not say perfect examples,

1309
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.130
go con Saki and Kaleel Roundtree round.

1310
01:13:11.131 --> 01:13:14.500
She's just snuck that beautiful straight left right down the pipe.

1311
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:19.070
Boot ain't dropped him.
Did you see Roundtree in his last fight?
No.
Holy Shit.

1312
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:24.030
Against Eric Anders this weekend.
Holy Shit Dude.
Fucking Holy Shit.

1313
01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:27.900
Massacre this to shut out.
It was the best he's ever looked.
He went to Thailand.

1314
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.000
Apparently after he got knocked out by Johnnie Walker,

1315
01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:32.730
he got hit with an elbow in the clinch and decided I really need to work on his

1316
01:13:32.731 --> 01:13:34.060
clinch game.
So he,

1317
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.980
he moved to Thailand and he was there for the entire camp.

1318
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.430
Put all this shit up on his Instagram,
all these videos and training footage.

1319
01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:42.900
He looks sensational,

1320
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:48.000
but when you see him live against Eric and he came out like a Thai guy light on

1321
01:13:48.001 --> 01:13:52.530
the front leg,
hands up in the class and just brutalized him.
Shit.

1322
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:57.120
Brutalized,
hitched,
pitched up fucking shutout man against Anders.

1323
01:13:57.121 --> 01:14:01.230
Who's that savage?
I watch those.
I mean,
I knew what we knew.

1324
01:14:01.231 --> 01:14:03.240
Roundtree was good,
but there was a,

1325
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:08.270
just a giant leap between the round tree of pre Thailand and Post Thailand the

1326
01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:12.970
most I've ever seen a guy improve in in two fights.
Shit.
Amazing.

1327
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.380
Yeah.
Look at the significant strike differential.

1328
01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:22.420
63 more significant strikes.
He landed,
but it was the way he did it,

1329
01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:26.860
man.
It was the highest significant strike differential.
That's crazy.
Oh,

1330
01:14:26.861 --> 01:14:30.400
that's from that event.
But that's all good and everything like that.

1331
01:14:30.401 --> 01:14:32.440
But it was what it looked like.

1332
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.560
His switch kick to the inside thigh was insane.

1333
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:40.510
It was self Fahey such a big guy,
man.
Yeah.
Have to be as fast as he was.

1334
01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:44.710
No,
no.
Uh,
no telegraphing anything.
It was like,

1335
01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.320
like over and over again.
And he was all Thai style.

1336
01:14:48.321 --> 01:14:49.960
It was really interesting to watch,
man.

1337
01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:52.840
He just embraced it and came out way better.

1338
01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:55.720
It was a surprise when he got gold called Lake that,
you know,

1339
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:59.200
but I also knew he could happen because it's,
it's not kickboxing.

1340
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:03.160
And I think Goldman's a stud kickboxer man ain't guys fucking good and

1341
01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:05.980
kickboxing man.
Oh yeah.
For his weight to shit that he does,

1342
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:10.730
he moves like a 55 pounds.
I was surprising to see that.
You know,

1343
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.150
Brown tree has a ridiculously fast trait left.
It's,

1344
01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.610
he caught Anders with it a bunch of times too.

1345
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:19.240
He dropped him and let's at least three times backgrounds.
Rustling or no,
he's,

1346
01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:23.680
it's a Stryker.
Stryker,
yeah.
It's background striking.
He's a beast man.

1347
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:25.410
I mean there's some,

1348
01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.220
I mean it'll be a while before anybody's excited about anybody fighting Jon

1349
01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:34.600
Jones.
Cause it's like,
what do you got?
You know,
you got a dude who's just,

1350
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:38.800
there's certain guys like remember when Anderson was in his prime and it like,

1351
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:40.480
like what are you going to,
who are you going to throw at him?

1352
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:42.880
There was nobody there to,
Weidman came along,

1353
01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.430
everybody that they threw it up and you're like,
hmm,

1354
01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.060
what's Anderson going to do to this dude?
When's Annison got a knockout?

1355
01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:51.870
You should know Cami.
When's he going to connect on this guy?

1356
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.330
And I think that we're in that situation now with John,
you know,

1357
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:58.770
we've got the Tiago Santos fight that's coming up.
It should be interesting.
Yeah.

1358
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.840
But it's just the interesting thing is that Santos is a murderous Stryker.

1359
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.370
Is he going to be able to connect?
That's the,
that's what makes it interesting.

1360
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.490
I think Jones at some of the best defense,
the best

1361
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:12.540
<v 4>grappling in striking just doesn't get hit.</v>

1362
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:17.310
Distance side kick to your fucking knee cap is no longer there.

1363
01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:20.280
And then when you fucking thinking about that sidekick boom,

1364
01:16:20.281 --> 01:16:24.860
left elbow to the IEEE orbital.
Yup.
It's a tough puzzle.
He's letting he's,

1365
01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:25.763
he doesn't,
he isn't.

1366
01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.990
He's not light on his feet fees just right there in front of you,

1367
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.700
like an unmovable for us.
You know,

1368
01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:31.280
it's just going to stand right there in front of you.

1369
01:16:31.281 --> 01:16:32.850
He's not going to go back or nothing.
It's just

1370
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:36.340
<v 5>if he catches you catching a break,
he tried to take a breath,
breath of air.</v>

1371
01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:40.990
WHAP whap porn it on.
So it's kicking your legs front,

1372
01:16:40.991 --> 01:16:44.020
kicking you in the body over and over and over.
He sees you slowing down.

1373
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.340
He's a Predator,
man.

1374
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:49.430
<v 4>I wish.
Like they can make a science experiment.
Make mighty mouse tool five.</v>

1375
01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.570
I make that fight happened or shrink Jon Jones and make that fight happen.

1376
01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:58.220
<v 5>Yeah,
no shit.
Right.
No Shit.
That would be crazy.
That would be,</v>

1377
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:59.303
yeah.

1378
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:04.290
See the thing is no tool five or can move like mighty mouse moves.

1379
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:07.510
You would have to see how can mighty mouse move it?
Two Oh five yeah.

1380
01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.740
Cause the thing gravity.
Yeah.
There's no gravity fucking with him.

1381
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:16.890
When he's won 25 he's fucking to cut and angles and he's,
where is he?
You know,

1382
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:21.200
he's on your legs.
He's,
he could do everything.
But it's technique though is also,

1383
01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:22.034
that's right.

1384
01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:24.690
<v 4>When I see him doing the things like kick soccer,</v>

1385
01:17:24.691 --> 01:17:28.710
fucking tie dude shoots a double leg,
like a fucking good wrestling dude.

1386
01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:33.000
It's not like just an athletic guy.
This explosive,
everything is done just right.

1387
01:17:33.001 --> 01:17:35.810
You know,
same thing with John.
You know,
he's got great technique everywhere.

1388
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.300
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean Matt Hume has produced some great fighters,</v>

1389
01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:41.420
but then there's mighty mouse.
Like he's produced some great talent,

1390
01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:44.420
but then there's mighty mouse.
He's like stands way out.

1391
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:46.670
And you gotta wonder like is it mighty mouse?

1392
01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.140
Is it Madyoon putting more emphasis on him?
Is it a combination of things?

1393
01:17:51.141 --> 01:17:53.270
Cause you usually when you get a guy that's that good,

1394
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:57.400
you get a gym that starts producing multiple champions.
Like that usually.
Right.

1395
01:17:57.470 --> 01:18:02.470
They get to that area like that pankration is not known for having that kind of

1396
01:18:02.751 --> 01:18:06.330
talent other than him.
It was like him.
Josh Barnett.
Yeah.

1397
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:09.620
Josh Barnett came from there.
So put Josh trained everywhere.
Now.

1398
01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:13.340
Josh started his career there,
but he's basically been everywhere.

1399
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.080
Is Matt Hume open to like the public?
Anybody just walking?
I think so.
I mean,

1400
01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.220
he has regular classes,
the whole deal,

1401
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:22.970
but I know he gave a lot of specialized attention to mighty mouse also.

1402
01:18:22.971 --> 01:18:25.150
He just felt like mighty mouse was a real sponge.
You know,

1403
01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.390
you really learned as well.
Yeah.
For a fact.
That guy does everything.
Good man.

1404
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.550
What do you think you gonna do when you retire?

1405
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.550
<v 4>I Dunno.
Yeah.
You don't think about it all?
I do think about it.
Um,
the,</v>

1406
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.340
the main thing is make sure that before I'm retired and my kids are set for life

1407
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.030
with their universities or at their houses,
all that stuff,

1408
01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.640
that's the number one goal.
Then when I retire,
I don't know.

1409
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:54.800
I got a lot of options I could do,
you know,

1410
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.510
I'm going to see which one I'm gonna light the most,

1411
01:18:56.511 --> 01:19:00.380
cause whatever I'm going to do.
Obviously nothing I love as much as fighting.

1412
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:04.320
Nothing will make me wake up at six in the morning to go fucking run.
No nothing.

1413
01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:05.360
Don't have that love.
And me,

1414
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:08.090
when you asked about the longevity is just cause I love it so much.

1415
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:11.750
I don't have to work for it.
I just,
I love it.
I love what I do.

1416
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:14.060
Even hitting the bag for 35,

1417
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:16.640
40 minutes sometimes it's so fucking boring and monotonous.

1418
01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.330
But if I've got the right music going on,
I mean a little bit of water,

1419
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:23.330
let's do it.
You know,
I'm gonna have fun doing it,
you know?
So,
uh,

1420
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:28.360
I got to just find something that my heart is solely in and I'm having fun.

1421
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:32.700
I still haven't figured out what that is.
You know,
maybe skiing,
you know,

1422
01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:35.380
every time I go skiing,
the skews are trying to recruit me.
They're like,
Yo,

1423
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:39.000
who is this guy?
Man,
we need this guy over here in our team to,

1424
01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:41.150
it may maybe scheme and that she gets my blood pumping.

1425
01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:44.420
<v 5>Really?
You like ski.
It's fucking love it man.
I hate it.
I love that.</v>

1426
01:19:44.421 --> 01:19:47.840
She was worried about falling.
So that's your problem.
That isn't my problem.

1427
01:19:47.841 --> 01:19:49.310
Fucking snowman.
I was going to happen.

1428
01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:54.770
You've been kicked in the head forever.
Had their fucking ACL torn apart.

1429
01:19:54.771 --> 01:19:56.810
I've already had two knee reconstructions,

1430
01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:59.750
so when I go down the hill I'm like don't get hurt.
Don't get hurt.

1431
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.360
Don't get hurt.
Didn't get hurt.
That's so crazy.

1432
01:20:02.361 --> 01:20:06.020
I'm brain thing cause I'm thinking there's no way I can get her when I'm on

1433
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:08.310
those names.
I'm just fucking going

1434
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.620
<v 2>as fast as I can tell you one of those guys.
Yeah.</v>

1435
01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:13.200
Like there's no way I could get hurt.
It's fucking snow.
Wow.

1436
01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:16.190
You definitely get hurt.
Yeah,
definitely.
Fucking know.

1437
01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:21.150
While I was standing still like pass my friends.
Hey guys,

1438
01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:25.680
slow down to to say what's up and just like some seven year old men dean and see

1439
01:20:25.681 --> 01:20:29.130
that I'm stopping up moving here and just fucking loud plowed it mean to the

1440
01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:32.010
kneecaps.
Good thing.
There's so more flexible.
Nothing torn.
Nothing.

1441
01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:33.260
But it was like a good hit though.

1442
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:36.330
You don't like a good little low kick out of nowhere.
You know,

1443
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:40.740
I worry about that with my kids some clodhopper Paul.
But if they,

1444
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:44.340
if they start young though to forget about it.
Oh no,
they're good.

1445
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:48.470
They're already doing black diamond.
So fuckers.
Yeah,
but they,
they,

1446
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.860
they're so low to the ground.

1447
01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.520
They're tiny little skis and shut the no fear at that age.

1448
01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.970
Once they already funding and once or twice like,
Oh dad,
it's just snow.

1449
01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.580
I watch some of those fucking men going down those hills though.
Oh,
shush.

1450
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.140
When they like when they drop them off in the helicopter.
Oh,
that's ridiculous.

1451
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:08.550
I watched a video the other night of,
uh,

1452
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:12.390
a guy went down this mountain that no one's ever skied down before.

1453
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:16.830
They dropped him off at the top and he had to climb the first couple of feet

1454
01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:20.040
down with the skis on before he got to this open shoot.
I was like,

1455
01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:23.370
what in the fuck are you doing?
He's climbing like you can't just ski.

1456
01:21:23.371 --> 01:21:28.150
There's rocks everywhere and shit.
That's great.
Fuck you.
Blows my mind.
Yeah,

1457
01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:32.190
go get a better hobby is ridiculous.
Sliding down a mountain.

1458
01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.680
I might end up in there one day.

1459
01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.010
None that not no time soon cause those guys are a lifetime of skill but I

1460
01:21:38.011 --> 01:21:40.980
wouldn't,
I wouldn't take it off.

1461
01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:44.460
You know like I'd love to ski one of those crazy mountains that are just fucking

1462
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.530
super duper steep and just rip it.

1463
01:21:46.531 --> 01:21:49.920
You know one thing about skiing is you could do it when you're old.
Yeah.

1464
01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:52.560
Cause this lady who was teaching my daughter,

1465
01:21:52.561 --> 01:21:54.900
she was giving my daughter lessons at the ski place.

1466
01:21:54.901 --> 01:21:58.080
She was like deep into her sixties and she's skiing great.

1467
01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:01.050
Was they got technique technique.
You know they probably grew up in the snow.

1468
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:02.850
I started skiing when I was like 30 you know,

1469
01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:06.510
so I got a lot of catching up to do.
Yeah,
it's a,

1470
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.330
I just don't to Ari,
my friend Ari,

1471
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:13.830
he broke his wrist last year and he broke his ankle two years ago.

1472
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:18.720
He's always fucking himself up.
He's that guy.
Balls to the wall.
I don't know.

1473
01:22:18.721 --> 01:22:21.930
He probably is on mushrooms when it does.
That's a good time to ski,
man.

1474
01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.070
Fucking that's a best time.

1475
01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:26.640
That's why I know a couple people that have done it on mushrooms.

1476
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.160
They say you ski.
Really?
Yeah.
You like it.
Oh,

1477
01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:31.980
what's the best thing about skiing that mushrooms?
Well,

1478
01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:36.010
it could go both ways because it fucks up your depth perception.
You know,
like,

1479
01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:38.330
I don't know where the trees are.
So the,

1480
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.690
the first time I did it I was like super grandma.
You know,

1481
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:44.700
like everybody's like,
what's wrong with him?
Like,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1482
01:22:44.701 --> 01:22:48.630
Just leave me the fuck alone because the snow is all the same too.
Right.

1483
01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:51.540
So now it just fluctuate you depth perception so bad.

1484
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:54.130
You could see the divots in the snow and

1485
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.640
everything gets pixelated.
And you are really tripping hard then.
Oh man,

1486
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.360
everything is the same and I can't really see the bumps and then I don't see the

1487
01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:07.090
bumps.
I just feed them and at Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
all right,

1488
01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:09.160
I'm going to need to tough this one out and let's do it,
you know?

1489
01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:13.450
And then the next time I did it,
the ladder literal.
Less of a dosage had a blast,

1490
01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:16.350
you know?
Yeah.
They say it's a,
it's a micro dose thing.
Yes.

1491
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:20.470
It's like don't take like three grams.
Take like a half a gram.
Yeah,

1492
01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.890
something like that.
Well the first time I was a Zune,

1493
01:23:22.891 --> 01:23:26.020
the bro Science and it was like,
Oh yeah,
I think it's like for grabs is cool man,

1494
01:23:26.021 --> 01:23:30.040
let's go on a fat and like a slight fast,
you know,

1495
01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:32.920
he's the problem with that,
the vision thing when things,

1496
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:36.430
when you do the mushrooms and things get pixelated where you see like almost

1497
01:23:36.431 --> 01:23:39.280
like a matrix around you that yeah,

1498
01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:41.290
I would imagine that that would fuck you up skin.

1499
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:43.900
You wouldn't be able to see all the creases in the snow and shit.

1500
01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:46.430
And then you just feel it all of a sudden,
you know what the fuck out.

1501
01:23:46.431 --> 01:23:50.560
You have a snowboard.
I did it for like half a day.
I was pretty cool.
But I uh,

1502
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:54.910
I used to ski like inline,
like in parks,
you know,
like on ramps on halfpipes.

1503
01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:59.320
Rollerblade yeah.
So I could like jump on rails and halfpipes and uh,

1504
01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:02.340
I could even do like a front flip on,
on my skates.
But this was,

1505
01:24:02.341 --> 01:24:04.460
and I was like 13,
14.
Yeah.

1506
01:24:04.810 --> 01:24:07.870
So skiing came very easy to meet and snowboarding that so much.

1507
01:24:07.871 --> 01:24:11.260
Cause I didn't skateboard when I was a kid.
I skateboarded as a kid,

1508
01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:14.770
but I've never snowboarded but uh,
the people that do it,

1509
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:18.070
they say it's easier to get better at snowboarding than it is to get better at

1510
01:24:18.071 --> 01:24:22.210
skiing.
I said it's like,
it's hard in the beginning,
but once you get it,

1511
01:24:22.211 --> 01:24:26.050
it's easy to get better at.
Oh,
okay.
But when you fall a lot,

1512
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:29.230
a lot of dudes fall this,
the snowboard goes up in the air.

1513
01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:31.480
You're feet are stuck on it and he landed right on your fucking head.

1514
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.020
A lot of people get knocked the fuck out because you can't move your legs

1515
01:24:35.021 --> 01:24:38.710
individually like you can if your skin and you land on the tailbone a lot to a

1516
01:24:38.711 --> 01:24:42.250
lot of people telling me.
Yeah.
And if you're skiing and you land funky,

1517
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:46.470
the ski snap loose and you can move your legs around.
Board is shot.
Yeah.

1518
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:48.620
He's trapped in a snowboard.

1519
01:24:48.630 --> 01:24:51.640
Is this shit too that people go through to the trees like fucking silver shirt

1520
01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:55.270
for?
That's fun man.
Yeah,
but that's not rush.

1521
01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:58.360
This low one down part with those seems different.

1522
01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.990
Like less options to slow down.
Oh,
I love all that shit.

1523
01:25:01.991 --> 01:25:03.330
Anything he gets my heart pumping.
Right.

1524
01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.620
Do a skydive or anything crazy like that.

1525
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.290
I haven't done the skydiving because I'm afraid of the law.

1526
01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:11.020
I've heard bad stories about the lighting,
how you are with the skiing.

1527
01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:12.420
He got a couple buddies.
He gotten hurt.

1528
01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:15.740
I got a couple of buddies had gotten hurt on the landing of skydiving.
I'm like,

1529
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:20.300
I can't do that.
I'm fighting.
So fighting.
Whoo.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1530
01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:23.740
Have you had any knee problems?
Numerous knee problems.

1531
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:27.220
I've turned them in this case or a couple times on both knees.

1532
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.150
From wrestling practice hall.
From wrestling practice.
Sure.
Yeah.
Do you,

1533
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:34.150
did you get him scoped or what'd you do about it and then just rehab.

1534
01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:39.040
I got a big fear of going to sleep by uh,
anesthesia.

1535
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:40.410
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

1536
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.390
Got To love supreme fear that I don't want that in my life right now.

1537
01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:45.760
I'm not ready for that.
That's a sucky way to die.

1538
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:50.500
Go to sleep to get your knee fixed.
And that's a wrap.
See in heaven,
tweet.
Tweet.

1539
01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:55.270
Yeah.
Not yet.
Not so you just basically whatever meniscus tears you value.

1540
01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:58.300
You just dealt with that.
Just Rehab.
And then I also heard from doctors,

1541
01:25:58.301 --> 01:26:00.490
you don't really need them in this cause is just going to fucking hurt.

1542
01:26:00.491 --> 01:26:04.100
Like fuck.
So you don't really need meniscus.
That's what they told me like a lot

1543
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.920
<v 3>of times instead of scoping it,
they cut it.
You know,
like I know that athletes,</v>

1544
01:26:06.921 --> 01:26:09.360
you just cut it,
you know,
it got pieces of it.
Yeah.

1545
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:11.430
Especially depending on illiquid paid.

1546
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:15.920
It's a bucket handled tear or how bad the tear is.
Yeah.
Nice.
Uh,

1547
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:19.430
Mike Brown has annoy his meniscus cut and he was the one who was sending me last

1548
01:26:19.431 --> 01:26:20.500
time I fucked up my meniscus.

1549
01:26:20.501 --> 01:26:23.390
He said do not get a scope because then you're going to reinjury and you're

1550
01:26:23.391 --> 01:26:26.510
going to be again through the whole thing.
Get it snipped out,
getting caught,

1551
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:31.460
you know,
and just,
he just got it cut out all of it.
Yeah.
Joe Ramiro,

1552
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:35.210
same thing.
I don't think Joel Irma has a meniscus.
Sure.
Yeah.
Cause I have,

1553
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:39.440
I've had numerous problems with my meniscus and I was about to go in and get the

1554
01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:43.820
surgery and I was asking,
everybody's had the same problem and I was like,

1555
01:26:43.821 --> 01:26:46.130
fuck it,
I'm just going to rehab it out.
Just do rehab.

1556
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:49.130
And I did Rehab for like four,
five months and it got better.
Oh Wow.

1557
01:26:49.150 --> 01:26:50.150
Four or five months,
Huh?

1558
01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:55.070
Well that was our last year in 2018 that's what of did to a larger part of the

1559
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:56.600
year.
Just he loved injuries that I had,
you know,

1560
01:26:56.601 --> 01:26:59.230
just get better and better and better.
So when you say like Rehab at what,

1561
01:26:59.231 --> 01:27:01.100
what kind of rehab are you doing for your meniscus?

1562
01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.440
We'll be doing like where they,

1563
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:05.240
you go to the place and the guy tells you like you're holding the towel.

1564
01:27:06.410 --> 01:27:10.910
Things like this.
Okay.
Different than the foam mat.
Yeah,
physical therapy,

1565
01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:14.510
you know,
that's what I did.
And what are the,
what is it,
what's your diet like?

1566
01:27:15.190 --> 01:27:19.970
Ah Man,
I got many of diets.
Like when you're in training,

1567
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.070
when you're trading that when you,
when you're not,

1568
01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:26.750
when you knock out there until,
I'm sure you ate like a wild animal fat.

1569
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:30.980
I got many of diets at all times.
So I just Kinda,

1570
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.550
I 55 I used to have to die so hard.

1571
01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:39.320
Eight to 10 weeks I would have to die to bring my body to like one 73 one 74

1572
01:27:39.321 --> 01:27:42.500
especially the last three,
four years of my career mixed with a lot of running.

1573
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.190
You know,
at 70 I don't have to do that.
So I'm still kind of strict.

1574
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:49.820
I just stopped eating after like a certain time,
like 7:00 PM I shop eating,

1575
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.510
you know,
wake up nine last training session.
Uh,
it depends.

1576
01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:58.000
It could be sometimes I got,
I'll finish at around 10,
10 39 nudges drink.
Yeah.

1577
01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:59.930
I'll just don't need anything after you train.
No,

1578
01:27:59.931 --> 01:28:02.090
I just drink a shit ton of water.
You know,
this one I'm like,

1579
01:28:02.091 --> 01:28:04.280
I'm training training that I'm used to it,
you know,
cause I,

1580
01:28:04.281 --> 01:28:07.700
you should do it at 55.
She couldn't gain weight.
So I just,

1581
01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:11.990
let's say I went for a run at like 10 o'clock at night,
finished at 12.

1582
01:28:11.991 --> 01:28:15.380
I just get back,
drink a shit ton of water,
wake up and then have my meal.

1583
01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:19.010
You know,
I don't eat when I'm in training camp.
One thing that I notice,
um,

1584
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:23.570
I don't like to,
uh,
have a big breakfast before I go train.
It fucks me up,

1585
01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:27.020
really slows me down.
Nobody's processing all that shit.

1586
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:28.310
I just don't feel as accurate.

1587
01:28:28.311 --> 01:28:31.580
I could just wake up and go to the gym and do fine.
If I wake up,

1588
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:36.860
eat till all that stuff,
then go to a gym.
It's not the same,
you know?
Lazy.
Yeah.

1589
01:28:36.861 --> 01:28:39.410
Gee.
It takes your body to digest it.
That's legit.
Yeah.

1590
01:28:39.411 --> 01:28:41.690
I always feel the same way.
I think you're better off.

1591
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:45.440
Just eat a little bit of fruit.
Yeah,
a little bit of pineapple.

1592
01:28:45.441 --> 01:28:48.530
Anything with sugar,
some coughing goals,
light.
I don't want my,

1593
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.590
my system actually didn't having to dissolve things as I'm already drained.

1594
01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:54.740
That's why I'm surprised that you're running late at night and then you're not

1595
01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:57.920
eating something and then you go on through the entire night with no food and

1596
01:28:57.921 --> 01:29:02.310
then a light breakfast and I'll burn right through it.
Like I'm,

1597
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:04.320
<v 4>I'm burning through fat in my seat.</v>

1598
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:07.290
Do you have a nutritionist that you consult or do you have numerous ones that

1599
01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:12.291
add 155 I had numerous ones and I took what each one gave me that was like,

1600
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:13.141
wow,

1601
01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:17.640
this actually helped me for this or for this and I've jot those down on my book

1602
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:21.150
and I use those things still to this day to some things that I use and then

1603
01:29:21.151 --> 01:29:23.310
mixing what with the stuff that I know works for me.
You know,

1604
01:29:23.311 --> 01:29:27.000
like I know for a fact somebody,
numerous nutrition told me no,
but that's wrong.

1605
01:29:27.001 --> 01:29:29.010
You should just wake up at six in the morning,

1606
01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.160
get a me on an eight in the morning,
get another meal,

1607
01:29:32.161 --> 01:29:34.320
and then by 10 o'clock you're good to go.
Not Buddy,

1608
01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.140
I'm just going to go to the gym and I'm going to fucking feel amazing.

1609
01:29:37.141 --> 01:29:38.940
I don't need all those extra fucking meals.

1610
01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:43.170
And then after that I pig out and when I eat I like,

1611
01:29:43.230 --> 01:29:46.110
it's almost a religious experience for me.
I like to be very happy.

1612
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:49.080
So if we go to a place to eat and I've never been in,

1613
01:29:49.081 --> 01:29:51.000
you're telling me this is the place right here,
this is,

1614
01:29:51.001 --> 01:29:54.510
where were you want to eat at?
I'm getting everything on the fucking menu.

1615
01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.010
It looks,

1616
01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:59.160
I'll feel this fucking table up and I'm going to try everything and I'm going to

1617
01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:01.830
know what's good at this place.
I don't like to put restrictions when I eat,

1618
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.130
but I'll eat like that all day long,
you know?
So my one or two meals that I eat,

1619
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:09.930
they're powerful,
you know,
so you real light,
but when you eat a big meal,

1620
01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:14.130
you just go hog and then nothing,
nothing after 7:00 PM at night.
Yeah.

1621
01:30:14.131 --> 01:30:17.070
None after 7:00 PM basically like intermittent fasting.

1622
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:21.170
Really some naval mimicking that.
And then I,
I saw that the innovating fashion,

1623
01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:23.340
it started breaking down like the details of it,
you know,

1624
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.310
because where I got it from is that,
uh,
when I was at 55,

1625
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:29.850
let's sad finish my workout at American top team.

1626
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:34.620
I finished at 178 pounds.
Fuck three weeks ago.
Okay.
I get back home,

1627
01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:37.850
I'd eat it a little sump cause I just finished on a two hour workout and I'll

1628
01:30:37.851 --> 01:30:41.760
put my sweats on and go run and I got to run 10 11 o'clock at night and everyone

1629
01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:43.680
for like an hour I'd get back.

1630
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:48.920
I'd touched down like to one 72 maybe one 74 I couldn't eat.

1631
01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:51.600
I just drink water.
So I got used to that,

1632
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:54.990
that regimen of not eating after my workouts,
you know,
I'm feeling fine.

1633
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:59.010
The next stage is a shit ton of water.
Your body just got used to it.
Yeah.

1634
01:30:59.011 --> 01:31:01.510
Maybe electrolytes or whatever.
And then when those,
the,

1635
01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.660
the intermittent fasting diet or the,

1636
01:31:03.661 --> 01:31:06.690
or the fast thing came up and they put the science behind it,
I'm like,

1637
01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.500
oh no wonder it makes sense to me.
You know,
it's not that I'm a special Mulan is,

1638
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.470
there's a science behind this,
you know?
Yeah.

1639
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.810
It's actually healthy for your body needs.
Brakes.
Yeah.

1640
01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:20.730
Now when you're doing strength and conditioning and things on those lines,

1641
01:31:20.731 --> 01:31:24.450
how often are you doing that?
A week?
Um,
it depends where,

1642
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:26.370
what stage I'm at in the fight.

1643
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:29.250
If I'm like three weeks out obviously or like 12 weeks out,

1644
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:33.800
like right now I'll lift weights,
running,
swimming,
anything.

1645
01:31:33.801 --> 01:31:37.580
We just get my heart going and I do a lot of kettle bells.
I liked that it's a,

1646
01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.190
it's like a full body work out and it's kind of like almost rustling,
you know,

1647
01:31:41.191 --> 01:31:43.590
when you're,
when you're getting in there and the reps and it's heavy.

1648
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:47.010
If your techniques off,
he just fucked up that rep,

1649
01:31:47.011 --> 01:31:48.210
you're wasting too much energy.

1650
01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:50.310
You're not going to get to those projections you want to get.

1651
01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.340
And I got lucky down at the gym that I trained,
uh,

1652
01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:56.850
one of the Kettlebell champion.
She's a world champion,
he's at the gym,

1653
01:31:56.851 --> 01:32:00.670
so he's showing me like a lot of technique and a lot of the,
the grit behind it.

1654
01:32:00.671 --> 01:32:05.260
And it's amazing.
I mean,
this guy doesn't incredible things,
you know,
so it's uh,

1655
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:07.620
it's huge for me to kettlebells I liked him,
you know,
my,

1656
01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:10.240
a lot of strength and conditioning too with my coach.
Ah,
he sues guy.

1657
01:32:10.241 --> 01:32:12.190
We've been together for like 12 years,
you know.

1658
01:32:13.210 --> 01:32:16.480
<v 2>Yeah.
I'm a big fan of kettlebells as well.
It's my favorite exercise tool.</v>

1659
01:32:16.481 --> 01:32:18.700
If I'd pick one thing that I would say,

1660
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:22.450
give me a chin up bar and kettlebells and I'm good,
a grip back.

1661
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:25.960
And then the sheer coordination,
pop them up in the air,

1662
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:28.270
making the whole body work as one whole unit

1663
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:30.370
<v 4>when you're tired and you can,</v>

1664
01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:34.190
you can't fucking not concentrate because every one of those techniques,

1665
01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:37.930
every one of those,
those lives has a severe technique behind the,

1666
01:32:37.931 --> 01:32:40.670
and if you fuck up man,
fuck up your back,
your shoulder,

1667
01:32:40.671 --> 01:32:41.810
you just throw your whole shit off.

1668
01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:47.280
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
Now,
um,
what,
what do you alter when you get closer to a fight?</v>

1669
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:50.370
Like what do you eliminate?
Do you eliminate the weightlifting?
Do you

1670
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:53.470
<v 4>the,
the length of the training session,
you know,</v>

1671
01:32:53.471 --> 01:32:56.950
as in when we're more out from the firewall train for longer periods to three

1672
01:32:56.951 --> 01:33:01.720
hours,
you know,
three hours,
always the Max and maybe I'll do that twice in a day.

1673
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:06.850
You know,
when I'm closer to the fight,
may be an hour and a half tops,
tops,

1674
01:33:06.851 --> 01:33:10.900
two hours and maybe two of those in a day,
you know,
and then that's it.
You know,

1675
01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:13.330
Marshall 34.
So I don't like,
uh,

1676
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:17.050
not when I was like 26 that I could fucking train 10 hours in one day and wake

1677
01:33:17.051 --> 01:33:20.430
up the next day like nothing happened,
you know?
So now I just,
I,

1678
01:33:20.431 --> 01:33:23.350
I also listen to my body like,
man,
that last session beat me up.

1679
01:33:23.351 --> 01:33:25.630
I'm going to do on one hour session now,
you know.

1680
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:27.310
<v 2>Do you take your heart rate?</v>

1681
01:33:27.311 --> 01:33:30.780
Do you use heart rate variability monitors or anything like that?
No,

1682
01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.370
nothing that I didn't even know what she's just said.
Old School,
you know,

1683
01:33:36.371 --> 01:33:39.130
people are doing that to see what their heart rate is when they wake up.

1684
01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.760
And I'll see if,
uh,
like if your heart rate's inconsistent,

1685
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:44.920
say if you have a resting heart rate of a,
you know,
40 beats per minute,

1686
01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:45.971
then you wake up one day,

1687
01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:50.971
it's 47 48 that might indicate that you're overtrained 52 53 would be a real

1688
01:33:51.071 --> 01:33:55.360
good indication and you would probably want to either do active recovery that

1689
01:33:55.361 --> 01:33:56.650
day or just take the day off,

1690
01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:59.350
maybe even go for a light hike or something like that.

1691
01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:01.480
And my mission investments and stuff.

1692
01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:05.080
There's a lot of thought behind that because sometimes people are getting sick

1693
01:34:05.081 --> 01:34:07.600
and they don't realize it.
That just too tough and they just push through it.

1694
01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:08.920
I feel flat today.

1695
01:34:08.921 --> 01:34:11.350
But what's really going on is your body is fighting something off.
Yeah,

1696
01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:15.910
it makes perfect sense.
Yeah.
How much sleep you're making.
Sure you get a night

1697
01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:20.250
<v 4>for the larger part of my career because um,</v>

1698
01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.620
I have a sleeping problems.
It really bad.

1699
01:34:22.621 --> 01:34:26.940
I would seem like four or five hours and be fucking perfect man.
Yeah,
be perfect.

1700
01:34:26.941 --> 01:34:29.160
Never,
never have a problem.
You know,

1701
01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.650
as it started getting to know them and trying to force myself to see,

1702
01:34:31.651 --> 01:34:33.720
that's one big thing when my coaches and my management,

1703
01:34:33.721 --> 01:34:36.150
cause they know I sleep in a like on fight week,

1704
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:39.760
I'd be up in the lobby 30 in the morning and then you go to seep,

1705
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:42.750
wake up at eight in the morning and no,
we've got to change this,
you know.

1706
01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:46.110
So I've been trying to change that ally and I just try to put myself in bed

1707
01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.100
early and then I just stay in the United.
Do Nothing.
The phone's already off.

1708
01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:53.250
There's no TV in my room.
I'm just chiming in.
But this isn't a fight camp.

1709
01:34:53.251 --> 01:34:56.640
This is not like year round.
You know?
And I'm just trying to go to seat,
you know,

1710
01:34:56.641 --> 01:34:58.010
however long takes,
does

1711
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.130
<v 2>American top team have a float float tank?
No,
not yet.</v>

1712
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:04.640
But then did you just hear Joe Rogan?

1713
01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:08.060
They need to fucking float broke.
Get the float man.
I think they did.

1714
01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.040
What are they thinking about it at one point in time?

1715
01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:13.090
Was that what was going on the shore and now Dan,
get the fucking float.

1716
01:35:13.091 --> 01:35:17.330
Jan needs to float.
You know we love you Dan.
Get that fucking tank in there baby.

1717
01:35:17.331 --> 01:35:19.550
I'll hook you up.
I'll get you to the right people.

1718
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:25.040
Float lab from Jonah float lab advantage.
Shout out to the float lab.
Yeah,

1719
01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:27.590
the guy put my tank in here.
They're the best tank.
Smell.

1720
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:30.950
Show it to you afterwards.
The there are so ridiculously over engineered.

1721
01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:34.590
But when you get in the man,
you relax like it changes your world sings.

1722
01:35:34.591 --> 01:35:37.630
You're fucking awesome.
I've done it like a two or three times your fucking mind.

1723
01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:41.660
But is there a good spot near you?
No.
Near me.
Remember like on the road,

1724
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:47.450
two hours up north that socks?
Yeah.
Dan should open up a spot down there.

1725
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.991
I mean it's,

1726
01:35:48.991 --> 01:35:51.800
it'd be great for fighters as long as you keep them from jacking off in there.

1727
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:54.800
That's a problem.
You get a little too relaxed.

1728
01:35:57.770 --> 01:36:01.230
Certain guys that are already flagging now so and so can come in as Roger Smith

1729
01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:07.030
got evacuated.
My brother,
you got to have a passport for these waters are,

1730
01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:10.370
yeah.
There's certain dudes that are just freaks.
You gotta be careful with them.

1731
01:36:11.490 --> 01:36:15.960
<v 4>Athletic freaks ain't fucking freak.
Freak's double freaks.
Yeah.</v>

1732
01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:16.800
Well you,

1733
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.740
<v 2>well you guys have,
how many people at your gym?
Me,</v>

1734
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:22.050
Bobby at one of the freakiest Jim's ever.
In terms of talent,
overall talent,

1735
01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:23.630
how family fighters there?

1736
01:36:24.450 --> 01:36:28.620
<v 4>I Dunno man.
Sometimes I get to the pro classes and there's like 50 pro fighters,</v>

1737
01:36:29.010 --> 01:36:29.520
you know,

1738
01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.810
raising 40 pro fighters in the map because the main Matt and the other main

1739
01:36:33.811 --> 01:36:35.440
matter covered in the cages cover.

1740
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:37.630
Then the square cage where I'm always trained in it,

1741
01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:39.480
which fits like another 10 people.

1742
01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:44.280
It's completely covered with with pro athletes,
you know,
and that that we have,

1743
01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:49.610
we have the 11 o'clock to like 1245 session and then different session for like

1744
01:36:50.341 --> 01:36:52.950
either the lighter or the bigger guys will come in at a different session,

1745
01:36:52.951 --> 01:36:53.370
you know?

1746
01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:57.210
And then we've got guys throughout the day doing their individuals rainy.
So

1747
01:36:57.650 --> 01:37:01.820
<v 2>it's just crazy how much your time is spent doing group classes versus how much</v>

1748
01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:05.540
of it is time.
It's individual specialized stuff like say working on something,

1749
01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:09.380
a combination of land on till or you know what you're planning for ass grin

1750
01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:15.680
<v 4>group classes will be more like a,
well I won't really learn.</v>

1751
01:37:15.681 --> 01:37:20.090
It's not that I can't learn too much,
but I'm not like my Mike Brown for example,

1752
01:37:20.091 --> 01:37:24.560
which,
which is the guy that runs my camp loving and Thompson,
Gosh Frey guy.

1753
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:27.020
Not only is he a great guy,
but his brain is,

1754
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:32.110
he's the like Elon Musk of like fighting and shit man is his ideas are fucking

1755
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.390
dope solid and like way ahead of their time always.

1756
01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:36.740
You know a lot of stuff that we're seeing now.

1757
01:37:36.741 --> 01:37:40.550
Mike Brown has been preaching to us for like a while,
so he knows me pretty well.

1758
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.030
He knows man,
mass general can only do about two moves a day.

1759
01:37:44.031 --> 01:37:45.440
So if he's going to show me something,

1760
01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:49.190
he showed me one to two moves tops and I just,
I'm a driller.

1761
01:37:49.191 --> 01:37:53.480
I'll just drill those moves as many times as it takes me for me to get them in

1762
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:56.100
that,
that's like my group,
you know,
that's like,

1763
01:37:56.220 --> 01:38:00.330
okay go just drill this and he knows that I need at least an hour of drilling

1764
01:38:00.331 --> 01:38:02.850
with a brand new move for me to get it,
you know?

1765
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:05.680
And then after that just go live with whoever's in the class,
you know,

1766
01:38:05.681 --> 01:38:10.010
whoever they they brought for me.
Now what,
when you say you,

1767
01:38:10.011 --> 01:38:13.770
you drill a lot.
Like are you drilling a lot striking drills,
MMA drills,

1768
01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.920
mark where wrestling drills basically everything.
You just constantly driller.

1769
01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:19.920
I drill,
I drew a ton and I go live button.

1770
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:25.310
But I like to compliment it with a lot of driven and I just feel that I'm always

1771
01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:28.410
on my best game when a drill and that sometimes I take away from drilling

1772
01:38:28.411 --> 01:38:30.990
complete because I feel drilled down.
Like,
man,
I've been journey so much,

1773
01:38:31.190 --> 01:38:35.460
just want to go live now.
You know?
But,
um,
usually every day that I'm in a gym,

1774
01:38:35.461 --> 01:38:39.390
I'm drilling a particular technique.
You know?
I think that's so important.
Oh,

1775
01:38:39.391 --> 01:38:43.190
super important for every,
every up,
martial arts,
Jujitsu,
anything more.
Sure.

1776
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.860
Large drill or you know,
you're draining your free throws or,
or whatever it is.

1777
01:38:46.861 --> 01:38:48.540
You have to just drill it to your body,

1778
01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:50.700
knows how to do it without thinking about it.
Yeah.

1779
01:38:50.701 --> 01:38:53.550
That's why when you see guys that just spar too much and all they want to do a

1780
01:38:53.551 --> 01:38:56.220
spar,
like,
man,
you know,
cure.
You're,
you're,

1781
01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:59.560
you're decreasing your chances of success and to think you're,

1782
01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.910
you're enjoying because you're just not spending enough time focusing on the

1783
01:39:02.911 --> 01:39:07.000
fundamentals and techniques kind of sharpens who keep those tools,
you know,

1784
01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:10.170
like keep moving him around like you keep adding to them.
Of course.

1785
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:15.590
Driving Guy's fucking nuts when you just drill and eventually you hit that 1000

1786
01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:19.780
mark.
It's not the same when you were doing it five or six times,
you know?

1787
01:39:19.781 --> 01:39:21.390
I'm not giving her too much wisdom though.
He's,

1788
01:39:21.391 --> 01:39:24.870
people are going to know what's up,
but that's really is true straining.

1789
01:39:25.190 --> 01:39:27.840
It's boring so people don't enjoy it as much.

1790
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:31.400
It's not like I'm the only sociopath and then you could ask him.

1791
01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:36.270
I enjoy drilling,
you know,
had a good pace,
good speed where we're just going in.

1792
01:39:36.271 --> 01:39:37.380
It's almost like a live warm,

1793
01:39:37.381 --> 01:39:41.430
just drilling that move when I'm giving all my energy into it.
I love it man.

1794
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.910
Well you also wear that.
That's going to bring you success.
Yeah.
Oh,
of course.

1795
01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.590
But I just,
I just love it.
You know,

1796
01:39:46.591 --> 01:39:50.070
the sheer making sure that my penetration steppers right.

1797
01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:53.880
Or my left hand was up when I throw my right hand and my coach goes,
hey,

1798
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:57.510
good job.
Do it again.
Okay Pam.
That I fucking love it man.
Now you,

1799
01:39:57.511 --> 01:39:59.550
when you have a fight coming up,
like say with aspirin,

1800
01:39:59.551 --> 01:40:03.690
are you watching footage on him?
I don't watch footage.
My uh,
Mike Brown,

1801
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.770
Bollinger none.
This guy,
although the watch footage on and tell me what to do,

1802
01:40:07.771 --> 01:40:10.050
what not to do,
you know,
like for the tow fight,
same thing,
you know,

1803
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.780
or maybe they'll send me like a clip that they wanted to see me like when a

1804
01:40:12.781 --> 01:40:16.750
Woodley FOBT till they're like,
look how Woodley a,

1805
01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:20.150
counter them with this on or look what till did there,

1806
01:40:20.151 --> 01:40:22.740
there's so many like little clips in,
I'll watch him.
But to watch fights,

1807
01:40:22.741 --> 01:40:27.660
nine any watch like my opponents fight.
Now what about recovery?
You guys,
uh,

1808
01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:32.420
did the get a lot of massage?
Do you do ice baths to any shit like that?
I do.
Uh,

1809
01:40:33.010 --> 01:40:35.970
I,
I've always done ice baths.
She in there throughout my career,

1810
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:39.660
but thanks to man,
my good friend Michael Miller,
I tried to do a lot more,

1811
01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.610
which I still need to do more.
You know,
a good two,

1812
01:40:41.611 --> 01:40:45.870
three times a week is when I feel like at my best sauna I use you for recovery,

1813
01:40:45.871 --> 01:40:48.780
you know,
especially after like a lot of the guests that you've had in your show.

1814
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:53.350
I've always done the Sanada to cut weight and knew that it had great benefits

1815
01:40:53.351 --> 01:40:55.840
and training in the sauna,
but it didn't know the science behind them.

1816
01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:58.120
Then you have like odd doctor Ron,
they'll go,

1817
01:40:58.121 --> 01:41:02.710
Patrick will come in and it's like mind blowing.
Yeah.
This all makes sense.

1818
01:41:03.130 --> 01:41:07.690
Why the Saunas so amazing.
Why I feel great after I use a Sana,

1819
01:41:07.691 --> 01:41:10.990
maybe not immediately because I have the two hour wrestling practice or striking

1820
01:41:10.991 --> 01:41:13.090
practices and then you go in the sauna cause you're like heavy.

1821
01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.240
They want you to work out in that you feel like shit afterwards.
Yeah.

1822
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:20.230
But surprisingly the next day I don't feel that bad or that they have to and I

1823
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:24.550
just thought nothing of it,
you know,
just fucking whatever man.
It's just,

1824
01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.890
I feel good today.
I had a great breakfast I guess,

1825
01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:31.780
but I started thinking about times that I was implementing the Sauna law in my

1826
01:41:31.781 --> 01:41:34.990
training regimen to times I wasn't.
And I was like,
wow,

1827
01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:37.060
the sauna things amazing for everything,
you know?

1828
01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:40.540
<v 5>Yeah,
no,
it's huge.
It says giant for reduction of inflammation.</v>

1829
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:44.490
And there was that study that they did and was it Norway or Sweden or somewhere

1830
01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:49.270
where they said there's a 40% decrease in mortality amongst all causes,

1831
01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.950
stroke,
heart attack,
cancer,
everything for people that,
yeah,

1832
01:41:53.951 --> 01:41:56.680
40% decrease in mortality for people that use the sauna.

1833
01:41:56.681 --> 01:42:01.240
I think it was four times a week for 20 minutes at a time at 180 degrees.

1834
01:42:01.241 --> 01:42:04.540
I think that was the study that they ran and they just showed an 80 degrees.

1835
01:42:04.770 --> 01:42:06.850
So they just,
they,
which is,
you know,

1836
01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.540
normal temperature anywhere between one 70 and 190 [inaudible] where a lot of

1837
01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:13.170
people have their,
a sauna set.
Uh,

1838
01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:17.050
but they said that in that hot range for 20 minutes,

1839
01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:22.120
your body produces so many heat shock proteins that it just helps with so many

1840
01:42:22.121 --> 01:42:22.960
different health problems.

1841
01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:27.840
<v 4>Yeah.
When I heard,
uh,
Ms. Patrick go sales things,</v>

1842
01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.450
my fucking mind blew up.
Yeah.
It's crazy,
right?

1843
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:33.210
I'll never have to take pharmaceutical drugs.

1844
01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:36.700
Nobody's ever going to take tell me you need these pillars.
Right.

1845
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:39.090
And then people that hear this,
do they doubted,
you know,

1846
01:42:39.091 --> 01:42:40.510
they have one profile attorney,

1847
01:42:40.770 --> 01:42:44.190
Joe Rogan tenny and they had a doctor telling you,
you want to cure problems.

1848
01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:47.010
Just coin the sauna.
Yeah,
man.
People with arthritis,

1849
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:49.310
<v 5>you know,
another thing that's great is cryotherapy.</v>

1850
01:42:49.311 --> 01:42:51.580
Cryotherapy is great for people with,
uh,

1851
01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:55.430
inflammation issues to anything where you can get your body freaking out about

1852
01:42:55.431 --> 01:42:57.830
temperature.
Your body freaks out about temperature,

1853
01:42:57.831 --> 01:42:59.030
whether it's cold or hot and heat.

1854
01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:02.330
Your body produces cold shock or heat shock proteins.

1855
01:43:02.331 --> 01:43:04.850
And then that really helps your body reduce inflammation.

1856
01:43:05.210 --> 01:43:08.390
<v 4>That's fucking insane.
He just feel better too,
right?
You get how they like,
ah,</v>

1857
01:43:08.391 --> 01:43:12.650
I just feel better even when I'd be sucked down like Manafort fucking shit.

1858
01:43:12.651 --> 01:43:16.930
I just lost fucking four or five pounds of water after a practice in the Sani

1859
01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:20.420
feel like shit.
But then I'd take a bath and then go to sleep,

1860
01:43:20.421 --> 01:43:21.980
wake up the next day feeling good.
You know,

1861
01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.900
I put the water back in the system obviously,

1862
01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:29.030
but I would just feel good and I didn't quite know why this is happening.

1863
01:43:29.031 --> 01:43:31.850
You know,
like let's say I got kicked in my elbow,

1864
01:43:31.851 --> 01:43:36.530
my elbow would blow up and then for some reason that day I had fucking 45

1865
01:43:36.531 --> 01:43:38.870
minutes of in the sauna cause that's what my coaches thought I needed.

1866
01:43:39.230 --> 01:43:40.580
The sweating would dramatically go down,

1867
01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:42.650
but I wouldn't attribute to that just to be like,
oh shit,

1868
01:43:42.651 --> 01:43:44.480
that's crazy fucking wolverine.
You know,

1869
01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:48.620
<v 5>marine had something to do with it,</v>

1870
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:53.180
but at the sauna had something to do with it too.
Now,
um,
you,
as you getting,

1871
01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:53.511
you know,

1872
01:43:53.511 --> 01:43:56.810
you're one of the top contenders in the division now and as things kind of heat

1873
01:43:56.811 --> 01:44:00.290
up,
are you having to do more media obligations before your big fights now?

1874
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:05.320
<v 3>No.
No.
That's just fucking say no to you,
man.</v>

1875
01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:07.820
I'm fucking only what if you get a fight for the title?

1876
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:11.100
They would probably gonna make you do all that shit,
won't they?
You,

1877
01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:15.350
you want this circus show?
This is how it comes,
buddy.

1878
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:18.040
You know,
cause I,
I can't watch,

1879
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:21.860
am I gonna fucking flight air lay flat in New York.
Fly here.
Racks.
You're right.

1880
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:25.700
I won't pay it now.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm a fucking soldier for the money.

1881
01:44:25.701 --> 01:44:28.700
You're going to pay me for these fucking numerous TV outlet stores.

1882
01:44:28.701 --> 01:44:32.000
You got me going to him selling products.
I'll do it,
man.
You know,

1883
01:44:32.001 --> 01:44:33.590
and I don't want to sound like I'm at a company man,

1884
01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:35.780
but I'd like to get paid for my services.

1885
01:44:35.781 --> 01:44:38.410
If I got to be talking to numerous people,
that's not what I signed up for.

1886
01:44:38.411 --> 01:44:41.390
I signed up to punch people in the face.
Let's get that right.

1887
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:45.470
And if I got a green speeches out,
giving out my secrets of wisdom,

1888
01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:50.150
pay me some money for that core.
I'll do whatever you want them.
Yeah,

1889
01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:53.530
well it definitely takes away from me too.

1890
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:58.610
He's done so much energy.
You have and this definitely takes away.
Yeah,

1891
01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.400
definitely takes away.
And I feel also like,

1892
01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:05.600
like the guys that are constantly putting stuff out there,
right?
Shit,
man,

1893
01:45:05.601 --> 01:45:08.030
people get bored.
He'd be fucking just putting shit out there.
You know?

1894
01:45:08.610 --> 01:45:11.390
And certain people are putting certain things out there,
they fucking,

1895
01:45:11.391 --> 01:45:14.630
they gravitate to the things.
This guy's not on a lot of talk shows or whatever.

1896
01:45:14.631 --> 01:45:16.330
I want to hear what he had.
The sand,
this particular,

1897
01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:20.490
if you're constantly like this goes international and this gives an answer,
they,

1898
01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:24.980
everybody,
the notification comes in,
they're already fucking put you on mute.

1899
01:45:24.981 --> 01:45:28.970
You know,
and you did that to yourself.
You got nobody to blame but yourself,

1900
01:45:28.971 --> 01:45:32.240
your little Instagram whore and I'm not talking about to the ladies.

1901
01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.740
I would never talk to a lady like that.

1902
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:37.490
I'm talking about to the dudes that are fucking straight sluts to my ladies.

1903
01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.720
I love you long time Niladri

1904
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:43.740
<v 5>when you have been in the game,</v>

1905
01:45:43.741 --> 01:45:46.980
as long as you have and have been as successful as you have,

1906
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:50.910
you have information that is very valuable to young fighters.

1907
01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:55.020
They can learn shit from you without having to experience a lot of the negative

1908
01:45:55.021 --> 01:45:58.180
things that you've experienced a lot without having some of the mistakes that

1909
01:45:58.181 --> 01:46:01.290
you've made.
You know,
some of the things you learned that were positive,

1910
01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:03.030
you could teach people and,

1911
01:46:03.031 --> 01:46:07.110
but oftentimes as fighters get older then retire,

1912
01:46:07.170 --> 01:46:09.570
that all that knowledge just goes away.

1913
01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.930
It just gets lost because the fighters either don't become a coach or don't ever

1914
01:46:12.931 --> 01:46:17.010
write it down or don't do interviews.
I think a guy like you in particular,

1915
01:46:17.190 --> 01:46:18.900
because you're a very crafty fighter,

1916
01:46:19.230 --> 01:46:22.590
you have a lot of valuable information for young people,

1917
01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:23.760
for young guys coming up.

1918
01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:28.570
<v 3>Oh I do.
I know it.
You know,
and you know how I got that information,</v>

1919
01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.240
putting myself in uncomfortable spots.
You know,

1920
01:46:31.241 --> 01:46:34.330
I went to the University of Wyoming,
which I loved that experience.

1921
01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:36.190
It's higher than Colorado.

1922
01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:41.380
And I'm with the [inaudible] national program ran by Mark Branch.

1923
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.823
Um,

1924
01:46:43.090 --> 01:46:47.920
I mean David Branch was r and Chris Pendleton and these guys are fucking studs

1925
01:46:47.921 --> 01:46:50.010
and they'd let me come in there and just some me fucking

1926
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.750
<v 4>fighter man,
you know,
and they let me come in there,</v>

1927
01:46:52.751 --> 01:46:56.820
stay with them for about a month and just Russell and be a part of the program.

1928
01:46:57.090 --> 01:47:00.030
So I learned what worked at the high level or not,

1929
01:47:00.031 --> 01:47:03.540
because I might think when you get a single leg,
I could back to the battery,

1930
01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:07.110
I might think.
And I go over here to this university,

1931
01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:09.840
I'm going to find that if it works in up and there's a saint,

1932
01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:14.730
Dan went to the state,
uh,
University of Oregon got to wrestle over there.
Um,

1933
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.410
I've done a lot of high level boxing camp,
put good boxes,
just being around them.

1934
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:22.500
Amateur will,
champion's gold medalist,
you know,
in Miami,

1935
01:47:22.501 --> 01:47:26.910
we're a hub for the Cuban crime wave of great boxers.
You know what I mean?

1936
01:47:26.911 --> 01:47:28.830
All these guys that are Olympians,
they come in there and,

1937
01:47:28.890 --> 01:47:31.620
and I'd be at the gym with them picking their brain,

1938
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:34.290
get beat up by them learning since I was young.
So I,
I,

1939
01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:36.810
for the boxing fundamentals,
I got very,
very lucky.

1940
01:47:36.811 --> 01:47:39.810
I didn't even know what I had at to me at that access was that I'd be working

1941
01:47:39.811 --> 01:47:42.840
out with gold medalists,
world champions.
It was insane.
You know,

1942
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:45.090
should I sing one thing?
I would tell any young fight,

1943
01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:48.430
if you want to learn something,
submerge any,
you know,
if you,

1944
01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:51.210
if I want to learn Jujitsu,
I'm not going to go to rex Quando.

1945
01:47:51.211 --> 01:47:55.050
I'm going to fucking go find the dopest Jujitsu guy and get humbled.
You know,

1946
01:47:55.051 --> 01:47:57.480
a lot of people don't like to get home.
I don't want to go with that guys.

1947
01:47:57.490 --> 01:48:00.720
You would good at wrestling.
No Man,
shut the fuck up.

1948
01:48:00.721 --> 01:48:03.150
Put the ego aside and go get humbled.

1949
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:07.560
Learn because the more time you put into that craft,
eventually whatever's bad,

1950
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:09.960
we'll get good if you put the time into it.
You know?

1951
01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:11.250
And a lot of people don't like to do that.

1952
01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:16.560
And I think even more nowadays that I see on the mat now with the eagles and the

1953
01:48:16.561 --> 01:48:18.960
social media and like people filming and Shit,

1954
01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:21.300
there's a lot of profiles that I see sitting out.

1955
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:24.990
The don't want to do the rest in class because a couple of wrestling suds just

1956
01:48:24.991 --> 01:48:26.040
walked in through the door.

1957
01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:29.350
So there's like two types of guys that when I see these all American and

1958
01:48:29.351 --> 01:48:32.400
national champions,
I'm like,
Whoa,
and he's going to be a good practice.

1959
01:48:32.401 --> 01:48:36.510
These guys are my weight.
I better be on my a game.
Um,
put some good music on.

1960
01:48:36.511 --> 01:48:39.650
This shit's going to get crazy.
Or there's the guys that when they walk in,

1961
01:48:39.651 --> 01:48:42.590
they're like,
Eh,
I don't need it.
You know?
Anyways,

1962
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.720
I'm the fight in the restaurant and the,
I'm always hyped for the challenge,

1963
01:48:45.721 --> 01:48:45.901
you know,

1964
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:49.800
to push myself to the fucking sheer limit and see what comes out of that.

1965
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:50.300
You know?

1966
01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.540
<v 2>So you think a lot of it is just a mentality to embrace,</v>

1967
01:48:53.541 --> 01:48:56.280
struggle and embrace difficult moments and,

1968
01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:58.640
and embrace the opportunity to learn and grow.

1969
01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:01.210
<v 4>Yes.
And unfortunately in this sport,</v>

1970
01:49:01.211 --> 01:49:03.400
you don't have to get a concussion because in boxing you don't,

1971
01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:06.520
don't take me wrong,
you don't have to spa hard to be a good striker,
you don't.

1972
01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:09.100
But there's certain things like wrestling,
you gotta wrestle hard.

1973
01:49:09.101 --> 01:49:11.550
You got to draw hard Jujitsu.
Same thing.
You got to draw her,

1974
01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:13.450
you got to get you going with Marcello Garcia,

1975
01:49:13.451 --> 01:49:17.410
you're going to get fucking tapped a bunch of times.
Guess what buddy?
Who Cares?

1976
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:20.530
Well learned that humbling experience,
joy that you know,

1977
01:49:20.531 --> 01:49:23.770
if you get a chance to roll with a guy like that,
take full advantage of it.

1978
01:49:24.130 --> 01:49:27.910
And nowadays it seems like,
uh,
a lot of sometimes futile want to do that.

1979
01:49:27.911 --> 01:49:28.061
You know,

1980
01:49:28.061 --> 01:49:31.870
like I'm in the mix alarm in one of the biggest gyms and I see sometimes guys

1981
01:49:31.871 --> 01:49:35.710
don't want to take those challenges in,
you know,
like a top notch MMA fighter.

1982
01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:39.160
Go straight wrestling with some college rest or some high school kids.

1983
01:49:39.161 --> 01:49:41.200
It's just a stud at Russell.
You do that.

1984
01:49:41.201 --> 01:49:44.650
Put yourself in that uncomfortable position.
See what happens bro.
You know.

1985
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:47.980
Do you think you'll ever be a coach?
I could

1986
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.300
<v 3>be.
You know,
I got a couple images and a guy got my boy Charlie decker.</v>

1987
01:49:52.301 --> 01:49:56.410
That's that day.
He's also like a friend in the amateur and uh,
he's uh,

1988
01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:00.400
he's doing good things in amateur night.
He's going to go approach gonna fucking,

1989
01:50:00.401 --> 01:50:02.860
he's going to tear it up,
man.
One day I,
hopefully he'll be in your show.

1990
01:50:02.861 --> 01:50:06.670
Me Get an interview,
guys.
Got a lot of tonic.
But um,
I dunno.

1991
01:50:06.970 --> 01:50:09.130
I Dunno if I'll be a coach.
It's a full time job.

1992
01:50:09.131 --> 01:50:12.040
It's a full time job and you gotta be committed to somebody.
Right.

1993
01:50:12.041 --> 01:50:14.770
And if they don't have the same mentality that you had,

1994
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:18.760
you're going to get frustrated and I am.
Sometimes fighters don't like to pay me.

1995
01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.010
What are you going to do now?
You've got to collect from a fighter.

1996
01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:25.480
She's going to get crazy man.
Don't like to pay.
I don't even like to paint.

1997
01:50:25.481 --> 01:50:27.490
And you know something about me,
Joe.
I like money,
man.

1998
01:50:27.491 --> 01:50:30.970
If I work I better get paid man.
Cause if I don't get paid,

1999
01:50:30.971 --> 01:50:34.630
it's going to be a fucking problem and it's going to be a fucking problem.

2000
01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:37.120
But there's a lot of fighters that do pain that are,

2001
01:50:37.121 --> 01:50:41.980
I'm fucking amazing in that are the most straight edge.
Do you know?
Yeah.

2002
01:50:41.981 --> 01:50:43.900
I mean certainly a guy like you,

2003
01:50:43.901 --> 01:50:47.920
if you ever did decide to be a coach you would have a lot of choices.
Yeah.

2004
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:53.470
But what I'm getting at is that the very least you should write some of that

2005
01:50:53.471 --> 01:50:57.010
shit down.
Like what's written down.
Yeah,

2006
01:50:57.011 --> 01:50:59.800
we got the the street survival series coming out.
Volume one,

2007
01:50:59.801 --> 01:51:03.690
two and three is going to jump very soon.
Books,
DVDs,
everything.

2008
01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:06.760
Everything's coming out here,
man.
You should know when it's coming out.

2009
01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.780
But it's coming out soon though.

2010
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:09.760
You should write a book about your experience or was it just,

2011
01:51:09.761 --> 01:51:13.450
just go on from the backyard fights that people could see on the Internet with

2012
01:51:13.451 --> 01:51:17.230
Kimball to where you are today?
It's pretty fucking incredible.
It's amazing.

2013
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:20.920
That's what an incredible rise to the top.
Yeah.
And you know what?

2014
01:51:20.921 --> 01:51:24.190
Somebody could tell all the young fighters before anybody saw this before

2015
01:51:24.191 --> 01:51:27.130
anybody telling me and youtube or anything,
I sighed up here.

2016
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:28.870
I invested in myself,

2017
01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:32.470
I believed in myself and that's why I put myself in these tough situations that

2018
01:51:32.471 --> 01:51:36.790
go with the best wrestler in the workout room,
the best striker from the world,

2019
01:51:36.791 --> 01:51:38.470
and just constantly get there.

2020
01:51:38.471 --> 01:51:42.130
Cause I knew the difference between me and them was only time I just had to put

2021
01:51:42.131 --> 01:51:46.870
in time.
Where'd you,
where'd you get,
where'd I get it?

2022
01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:50.770
Maybe God opened up my mind and just gave me the messages.
Just growing up,

2023
01:51:50.771 --> 01:51:55.090
very humble and just fucking wanting certain things that I didn't have and just

2024
01:51:55.091 --> 01:51:56.470
like,
I'm going to,
I'm going to get this.

2025
01:51:56.471 --> 01:52:00.340
But understanding that really just takes work.
She's really,
really understanding.

2026
01:52:00.341 --> 01:52:03.850
It really just takes work and it really takes work and it really takes the right

2027
01:52:03.851 --> 01:52:05.650
mindset.
You're not just the work itself,

2028
01:52:05.651 --> 01:52:10.600
but the way you're embracing difficult challenges instead of shying away from

2029
01:52:10.601 --> 01:52:15.600
them and to protect your ego,
you're doing the opposite.
Gotcha.
Why so?

2030
01:52:15.610 --> 01:52:19.900
Only way I'm in combat sports in combat sports,
tennis,
maybe there's another way.

2031
01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:24.280
I'm not coaching tennis,
but as long as combat sports is,
you're not being set up,

2032
01:52:24.281 --> 01:52:27.070
but someone's going to fucking murder when you're first starting out.
Exactly.

2033
01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.980
Striking.
That's not what you want.
You don't want to get,
yeah.
You know,

2034
01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:32.980
I've got 10 pro fights your first day here and I break your nose.

2035
01:52:32.981 --> 01:52:36.360
That doesn't do anything.
But it's just embracing those challenges,

2036
01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:41.420
whether it be running a mile in six minutes or drilling for twice as long just

2037
01:52:41.741 --> 01:52:45.260
to techniques because you're kind of dumb and you fucking got to just do it over

2038
01:52:45.261 --> 01:52:46.040
and over and over and

2039
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.300
<v 4>over embracing,
you know?</v>

2040
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:49.980
<v 5>Well,
I'm glad you're going to put some of this information out.
And I think,
um,</v>

2041
01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:51.850
this is something that,
as I was saying,

2042
01:52:51.851 --> 01:52:54.700
like a guy like you that's been in the game for a long,

2043
01:52:54.701 --> 01:52:58.270
long time and you've learned a lot about what it takes to become a world class

2044
01:52:58.271 --> 01:52:59.104
fighter,

2045
01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:03.040
that that information a lot of times just goes away when that fire retires.

2046
01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.940
So many fighters have retired and you don't really know too much about the

2047
01:53:06.941 --> 01:53:08.290
process or what they learned.

2048
01:53:08.410 --> 01:53:11.440
<v 4>Well,
and uh,
we got a document,
he's been filming for about three years,</v>

2049
01:53:11.441 --> 01:53:14.920
but we've had trouble when the UFC sold it to like EHP and getting all the

2050
01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:18.970
rights and in and things that'll go associated with dropping documented like

2051
01:53:18.971 --> 01:53:20.320
that.
And then that documentary,

2052
01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.810
I told him from the star wars when we were going to do it,

2053
01:53:23.050 --> 01:53:23.681
if we're going to do it,

2054
01:53:23.681 --> 01:53:27.670
I want it done right and meaning I want a lot of control over it.
And I,

2055
01:53:27.730 --> 01:53:29.110
I want a lot of training.
You know,

2056
01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:31.930
I want a lot of the things that are doing training to get me in shape.

2057
01:53:31.931 --> 01:53:34.990
Some people find it cool,
some people won't.
So in that documentary,

2058
01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.120
there's a lot of just high,
straight a train,
you know,

2059
01:53:37.121 --> 01:53:39.520
like a lot of the Cuban mythology that goes behind it from my,

2060
01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:42.880
from my coaches that are Cuban wa what we like to do to prepare for the fight,

2061
01:53:43.090 --> 01:53:44.110
how we break it down,

2062
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:47.300
<v 5>different shit.
And then people normally say,</v>

2063
01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:51.130
<v 4>uh,
uh,
in the preparation.
Yeah.</v>

2064
01:53:51.131 --> 01:53:55.540
Actually you,
you know Joelle well,
sure.
And uh,

2065
01:53:56.170 --> 01:54:00.040
and stuff.
Joelle,
my,
my coach,

2066
01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:03.130
which she's a trained yard as well.
And in and out of the Cuban community,

2067
01:54:03.131 --> 01:54:06.760
they have a big,
uh,
especially if they grew up in Cuba,

2068
01:54:06.761 --> 01:54:09.910
they have that big conspiracy theory.
Like nobody else.
They,

2069
01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:13.630
whenever I'm hitting pads or anything like that,
I'm about to fight somebody.

2070
01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:17.680
You will never see me do a technique on the pads that I will do in the fight.

2071
01:54:17.681 --> 01:54:20.080
I shouldn't even say this because Michael was just going to slap me in the face.

2072
01:54:20.410 --> 01:54:21.820
You will never see me do anything.

2073
01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:25.270
It might resemble anything had to do in the fight.
And he lives by that,
you know,

2074
01:54:25.271 --> 01:54:28.930
he doesn't ease another guy that just shies away from cameras,
hates cameras.

2075
01:54:29.230 --> 01:54:30.130
He's always in my corner.

2076
01:54:30.131 --> 01:54:33.070
He's got a yellow Bandana or something yelling and he's been in my corner.

2077
01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:36.100
Joel's going to numerous,
numerous guys corner and um,

2078
01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.830
they're very like secretive of the training,
you know,

2079
01:54:39.070 --> 01:54:41.760
they think that everybody's watching.
We still,
you know,

2080
01:54:41.770 --> 01:54:45.640
they think America might invade Cuba still so that I know.
Who knows.
Right.

2081
01:54:45.641 --> 01:54:49.750
So the training footage,
I don't want that leaking out,
you know.
And uh,

2082
01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:53.110
I've most of my career been late day number for the document and we opened up a

2083
01:54:53.111 --> 01:54:53.811
lot of things that I,

2084
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:58.811
that we do for training for like from reflexes to ways to recover how we spar

2085
01:54:59.921 --> 01:55:01.740
high set up the spine,
things like that.
You know,

2086
01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:06.790
what kind of shit that you do this unusual?
Uh,
not unusual I guess I would say,

2087
01:55:06.791 --> 01:55:11.470
but I dunno,
I could,
we could do like two hours of boxing ray,

2088
01:55:12.370 --> 01:55:16.690
just straight boxing and we would just break down fundamentals.
I would just,

2089
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:21.790
just tooth two hours straight basics,
which is fucking boring.

2090
01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:24.460
But it's just like endurance mixed with the technique.
You know,

2091
01:55:24.730 --> 01:55:28.090
we do also a lot of,
uh,
right from here,
from this chair will punch from here,

2092
01:55:28.091 --> 01:55:31.460
hit the patch from here,
from the chair,
from the chair,
just

2093
01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:36.620
<v 2>horrid orange with the pads.
With the gloves.
Hmm.</v>

2094
01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:43.800
<v 4>Skol five minute rounds without using your legs.
What?
Using the lakes.</v>

2095
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:46.980
<v 3>You try it out and you told me how that fusion,
it's fucking great,
you know?</v>

2096
01:55:46.981 --> 01:55:47.850
And like right now for that,

2097
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:49.770
I'm going to get kicked in the fucking leg pretty hard.

2098
01:55:49.771 --> 01:55:54.600
And now he's really wanting to tell you.
When I tell you this man is secretive,

2099
01:55:54.930 --> 01:55:56.340
how's he going to feel about the documentary?

2100
01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:01.940
He doesn't know how much he's getting into doctrine because he's very like,

2101
01:56:02.850 --> 01:56:03.810
this is for us.
You know,

2102
01:56:03.811 --> 01:56:06.240
why would you release is why you're still fighting with dcis when you're done

2103
01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:09.180
fighting type guy,
you know?
And why do you want to release it?

2104
01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:13.740
Why are you still fighting?
I mean fucking,
you can't stop the Sun from rising,

2105
01:56:13.741 --> 01:56:15.930
you know,
going to stop me if you know my techniques,
you know,

2106
01:56:17.250 --> 01:56:21.210
it's not going to change anything.
What's coming.
It's coming.
You know,

2107
01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:24.450
that's a beautiful way to look at it.
Well listen brother,

2108
01:56:24.451 --> 01:56:28.170
I'm glad we got together and did this,
man.
