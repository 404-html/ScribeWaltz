6
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:12.700
<v Speaker 1>You know that when I,</v>

7
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>when I start these things off I,</v>

8
00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like maybe I should pretend to do a podcast for like 10 minutes</v>

9
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.490
<v Speaker 1>before I do a podcast just to warm my fucking stupid face up.</v>

10
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>it's also the freshness of just coming off of be getting stone to where like she</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

27
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Hanging out with people that can,</v>

28
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.790
<v Speaker 1>cause we're so used to hanging out with comics and hanging out with somebody</v>

29
00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>that has to be like,</v>

30
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.601
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

31
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't smoke something because I don't want to get him fired.</v>

32
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:46.961
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

34
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:47.794
<v Speaker 1>he's a writer.</v>

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36

<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

37
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Do you want the writers to suck?</v>

38
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:51.521
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want it.</v>

40
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:52.690
<v Speaker 1>The writers of smoke weed.</v>

41
00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you crazy?</v>

42
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>What you do not want.</v>

43
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Colorful pros.</v>

44
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.101
<v Speaker 1>Do you not want,</v>

45
00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:57.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>a an imaginative piece?</v>

47
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you not want something that engages you and captures your imagination and</v>

48
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.041
<v Speaker 1>lets you think,</v>

49
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:03.191
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

50
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>this guy is coming from a very unique point of view instead of the same tired,</v>

51
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:07.301
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

52
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit.</v>

53
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Listen to ESPN.</v>

54
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Let your people have some flavor.</v>

55
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

56
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like Disney and not letting their artists eat mushrooms.</v>

57
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I bet they also wouldn't.</v>

59
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>If I had a thing with ESPN.</v>

60
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I bet they wouldn't let me be sponsored by the flashlight.</v>

61
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

62
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.133
<v Speaker 1>but that's an issue.</v>

63
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I bet that's an issue with people.</v>

64
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.533
<v Speaker 1>It's athletic.</v>

65
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.633
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

66
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

67
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it does.</v>

68
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.631
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

69
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:26.464
<v Speaker 1>It itself,</v>

70
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

71
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>it's technology applied to something that people are scared of.</v>

72
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

73
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Skewed touch that a PP scared of people knowing that you masturbate of people</v>

74
00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:37.510

75
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Ha ha ha.</v>

97
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>We've got a lot to talk about.</v>

98
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Aubrey and I are going to restructure the,</v>

99
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.500
<v Speaker 1>the the earth today.</v>

100
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>We've decided we were going to figure out a better way to run this.</v>

101
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>You dirty little fuckers anyway.</v>

102
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Joe rogan.net,</v>

103
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 1>click on the Alpha brain link and throwing the code name,</v>

104
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Rogan.</v>

105
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>You will get 10% off or don't.</v>

106
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.061
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

107
00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of you.</v>

108
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:40.351
<v Speaker 1>Whiny little Internet twats don't have to buy the vitamins.</v>

109
00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to enjoy,</v>

110
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.251
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be healthy.</v>

111
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:43.120
<v Speaker 1>You can smoke cigarettes,</v>

112
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:43.811
<v Speaker 1>you could drink whiskey,</v>

113
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

114
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you're interested in the subject of Nootropics,</v>

115
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I suggest that you go online and do some research.</v>

116
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:58.441
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting topic and there's a lot of evidence to support the idea</v>

117
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>that are certain nutrients</v>

118
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>that enhance the way your brain works.</v>

119
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.371
<v Speaker 2>You know there are days,</v>

120
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>we all know this where we don't feel,</v>

121
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel clear,</v>

122
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.961
<v Speaker 2>you feel like shit,</v>

123
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 2>you feel cloudy.</v>

124
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 2>What is that folks?</v>

125
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:10.281
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

126
00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:10.550
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

127
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>what gentle balance is off when you're,</v>

128
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>when you're having off days and can that be enhanced with nutrition?</v>

129
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I believe at Kent and if you are interested in,</v>

130
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I encourage you to just go look up the subject before you buy anything.</v>

131
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Read some of the things that had been written and you know,</v>

132
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>draw your own conclusions,</v>

133
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 2>be objective about it.</v>

134
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I also suggested if you'd think that our stuff is too expensive to just copy the</v>

135
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:34.901
<v Speaker 2>ingredients,</v>

136
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

137
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 2>just go online,</v>

138
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 2>buy your shit and bulk copy it.</v>

139
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:38.591
<v Speaker 2>Good luck to you.</v>

140
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God we're not that greedy.</v>

141
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>The proof that we're not that greedy is if you don't like it is a hundred</v>

142
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 2>percent money back guarantee.</v>

143
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck else does that?</v>

144
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

145
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:48.791
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

146
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>And you can't do it any cleaner.</v>

147
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.701
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

148

149
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 2>If you don't believe in vitamins,</v>

150
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 2>you say you piss them all out.</v>

151
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 2>That's all good dude.</v>

152
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.681
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

153
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:56.851
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

154
00:03:56.851 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I know from personal experience,</v>

155
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:03.301
<v Speaker 2>from actual health issues that vitamins have a key benefit and your wellbeing</v>

156
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent your health and wellbeing are affected by vitamins.</v>

157
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you see,</v>

158
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 2>the bullshit about,</v>

160
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.270
<v Speaker 2>studies that disproves study's approved.</v>

162
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can accurately get an assessment about that unless we get into</v>

163
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:20.311
<v Speaker 2>some really fucking much more detailed tests of diet and exercise and you know,</v>

164
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:21.651
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

165
00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 2>and test people that aren't doing it and test people that aren't and then draw</v>

166
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>your conclusions.</v>

167
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 2>But I think vitamins enhance.</v>

168
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely feel like they enhance so bar shit or not,</v>

196
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear it in the background.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

198

<v Speaker 2>That's not a good sound effect.</v>

200
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Let's not use that one again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

208
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>A spaceship that there's,</v>

209
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.681
<v Speaker 2>it's been though.</v>

210
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>It was unlike a,</v>

211
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was end gadget and or Gizmodo,</v>

212
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:47.210
<v Speaker 2>one of those a gadget websites where they were talking about a,</v>

213
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 2>there's all these photos of this crazy spacecraft at the government was driving</v>

214
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 2>on the back of a truck and it was,</v>

215
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah it was like through Kansas.</v>

216
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:56.540
<v Speaker 2>We who knows what the fuck it was.</v>

217
00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:57.840
<v Speaker 2>It could have been a weather balloon.</v>

218
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 1>They're all weather balloons.</v>

219
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

220
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>But they known that word.</v>

221
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 1>We're using drones now cause the guy was arrested,</v>

222
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>a guy who was a cattle dispute and I mean the only way this even makes sense is</v>

223
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:08.391
<v Speaker 1>that someone,</v>

224
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>no I must have insane money and hate this guy cause the story doesn't make any</v>

225
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:12.351
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

226
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:17.351
<v Speaker 1>But they used a drone to determine that there was cows in this guy's property</v>

227
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 1>that weren't his and that he did not alert the other.</v>

228
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.630
<v Speaker 1>The other,</v>

229
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 1>ranch that their cattle had wandered onto his and they used a drone to determine</v>

231
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

232
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like Jesus Christ,</v>

233
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.530

234
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.060
<v Speaker 4>other guy get that drove,</v>

235
00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:33.430
<v Speaker 4>find out who that guy is and follow him.</v>

236
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.470
<v Speaker 4>Being the guy who can call someone and say,</v>

237
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:35.741
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

238
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:35.951
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

239
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:37.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a cow problem,</v>

240
00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:38.080
<v Speaker 4>my asshole neighbor,</v>

241
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 4>can I borrow one of those fucking drones?</v>

242
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Can I borrow one of those Predator things and search around this asshole's</v>

243
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.760
<v Speaker 4>property?</v>

244
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.110
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit Man.</v>

245
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.180
<v Speaker 4>They sound like a crazy violation.</v>

246
00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:52.540
<v Speaker 4>And the only thing that could catch on him was that some cows had wandered over</v>

247
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:53.470
<v Speaker 4>to his property.</v>

248
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.750
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck man?</v>

249
00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:58.780
<v Speaker 4>How many cows worth of money does it cost to hire a drone?</v>

250
00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

251
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.120
<v Speaker 4>Was like an episode of American Dad.</v>

252
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.811
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

253
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:05.200
<v Speaker 4>Like using his power.</v>

254
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.030
<v Speaker 4>Like I just take my drone over there.</v>

255
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.310
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it sounds like.</v>

256
00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like south park or something.</v>

257
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

258
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.240
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking completely ridiculous.</v>

259
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

260
00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:14.380
<v Speaker 4>they caught the guy.</v>

261
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.173
<v Speaker 1>I should look up the,</v>

262
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.030
<v Speaker 1>the actual full story.</v>

263
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Drone use cattle case is that,</v>

264
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.540
<v Speaker 1>did you know Seth Mcfarlane's up for a grammy?</v>

265
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 1>He's against like Barbara Streisand right now because he has a music CD now.</v>

266
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.563

268
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

269
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like a seed,</v>

270
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.390
<v Speaker 1>like a singer.</v>

271
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Cattle Rustling family.</v>

272
00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe my,</v>

273
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.230
<v Speaker 1>my take on is wrong because they're addressing them.</v>

274
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And as a cattle rustling family.</v>

275
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 1>So they're saying that these people were stealing Cadillac.</v>

276
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Jess armed with a search warrant that Nelson County Sheriff Keith Janky went</v>

277
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 1>looking for six missing cows.</v>

278
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:49.631
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

281
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Six cows.</v>

282
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.270
<v Speaker 1>You use a fucking drone to find six cows.</v>

283
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.321
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

284
00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:57.580
<v Speaker 1>This is creepy.</v>

285
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.540
<v Speaker 1>That's American data.</v>

286
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Big.</v>

287
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.400
<v Speaker 1>There's some old laws,</v>

288
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.110
<v Speaker 1>horse stealing and cattle.</v>

289
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Super Harsh.</v>

290
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Like the decisions are made,</v>

291
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.010
<v Speaker 1>but they're just,</v>

292
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.550
<v Speaker 1>this is like the first like instances of this,</v>

293
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

294
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Is this something that like the Patriot Act allows for?</v>

295
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:13.563
<v Speaker 1>It must be</v>

296
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:13.870
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

297
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.830
<v Speaker 4>I think drones,</v>

298
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

299
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.900
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not kidding Tam.</v>

300
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.910
<v Speaker 4>How else are we going to get fucked?</v>

301
00:08:18.911 --> 00:08:20.190
<v Speaker 4>Are going have drones following us?</v>

302
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Or</v>

303
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.501
<v Speaker 1>even worse?</v>

304
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>The Nda that just passed the,</v>

305
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>the National Defense Authorization Act,</v>

306
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>that's really scary because it allows them to,</v>

307
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

308
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 1>treat the United States as a battlefield and that means that they can stop</v>

309
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>things with troops.</v>

310
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Like they're going to use our military against American citizens.</v>

311
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like a war against the people.</v>

312
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:40.124
<v Speaker 1>It was civil war.</v>

313
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

314
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 1>it's really completely insane.</v>

315
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And the indefinite detention.</v>

316
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you don't have to have a warrant.</v>

317
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:45.741
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

318
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>if they think you're a threat,</v>

319
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>they can just attain you indefinitely.</v>

320
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>You know when you see John Mccain out there like supporting that,</v>

321
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:52.191
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

322
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 1>wow man,</v>

323
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you don't see where this is going to go.</v>

324
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>You really</v>

325
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 4>think that that should be allowed.</v>

326
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 4>You start to put the pieces of the puzzle together.</v>

327
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:00.264
<v Speaker 4>Obama,</v>

328
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

329
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 4>authorizing 20,000 extra troops here for the domestic front.</v>

330
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 4>I think you sent a tweet out about that,</v>

331
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 4>so scared to put the pieces together.</v>

332
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 4>It looks like they know some shit's going to go down and they're preparing for</v>

333
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 4>the instance in which it does,</v>

334
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:13.674
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

335
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.391
<v Speaker 4>which is scary.</v>

336
00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:19.391
<v Speaker 4>It looks like the only way this would be getting past the only way this would be</v>

337
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:23.840
<v Speaker 4>accepted by so many people and not enrage others is that they know there's going</v>

338
00:09:23.841 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 4>to be a massive civil unrest.</v>

339
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 4>They know there's going to be something nutty.</v>

340
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

341
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 4>you get that.</v>

342
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 4>You got that feeling for sure.</v>

343
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Although that's terrifying.</v>

344
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:31.741
<v Speaker 4>It is terrifying.</v>

345
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

346
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 4>as I thought about it too,</v>

347
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean back in the days where you crushed rebellions,</v>

348
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:36.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

349
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of tyrannies that have crushed rebellions throughout history.</v>

350
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 4>There was always certain factors present.</v>

351
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 4>There was a lack of information able to circulate.</v>

352
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 4>They would close down those things.</v>

353
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 4>The governments hinting at different ways of trying to do that,</v>

354
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:49.350
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think they'll ever be successful.</v>

355
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.640
<v Speaker 4>The Internet's too prevalent.</v>

356
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:51.331
<v Speaker 4>It's too powerful,</v>

357
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 4>as you've said.</v>

358
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.351
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

359
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 4>they'll build ways around it.</v>

360
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.091
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

361
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 4>they'll find ways to communicate.</v>

362
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:56.184
<v Speaker 4>And then also,</v>

363
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

364
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 4>the people they were suppressing,</v>

365
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:02.661
<v Speaker 4>we're generally not as well armed as the people who are trying to suppress them.</v>

366
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.410
<v Speaker 4>So they had an overwhelming,</v>

367
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

368
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 4>force mature of technological superiority in their arms.</v>

369
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 4>But this is a well armed nation and I just can't imagine that even our troops,</v>

370
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:13.861
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

371
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 4>some that are brainwashed or not,</v>

372
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

373
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.510
<v Speaker 4>really want to take out their real guns against our citizens.</v>

374
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 4>But the citizens when pushed hard enough,</v>

375
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

376
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 4>we're all,</v>

377
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 4>we're all armed.</v>

378
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean at a certain point where you know,</v>

379
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 4>they're abusing our people grandly and it could get really bad and I just can't</v>

380
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 4>imagine that it could get to that level.</v>

381
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine that it can either,</v>

382
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 4>but it really seems like they're preparing for it.</v>

383
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:40.460
<v Speaker 4>And when you see how things have slid in certain parts of this country,</v>

384
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 4>how far things have gone.</v>

385
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Like if you ever see like any of the documentaries on Detroit,</v>

386
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.130
<v Speaker 4>well they show you like how bad it is.</v>

387
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 4>They're now 47% illiteracy rate.</v>

388
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean the functional literacy rate,</v>

389
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 4>47% that's half the people can't read.</v>

390
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 4>And that's incredible.</v>

391
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 4>And these houses that are,</v>

392
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

393
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.550
<v Speaker 4>up for sale for like $1,000 you know,</v>

394
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 4>a $500 just abandoned building after abandoned building.</v>

395
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 4>It's like wow.</v>

396
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 4>Like we know in our lifetime that this is all changed.</v>

397
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:07.891
<v Speaker 4>We know,</v>

398
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 4>we know it's possible for things to go horribly wrong.</v>

399
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 4>Completely fall apart.</v>

400
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:11.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

401
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I I,</v>

402
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.901
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

403
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 4>I just think that final step that they're trying to prepare for as a step that's</v>

404
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 4>ultimately destined for failure.</v>

405
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 4>Like they won't be able to pull that trigger.</v>

406
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like in a nuclear,</v>

407
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 4>in the nuclear age,</v>

408
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

409
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain level of warfare that you just can't do.</v>

410
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.101
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

411
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 4>like you can't get massive group of people and attack another country that has a</v>

412
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 4>nuclear armament because they'll just use the nuke.</v>

413
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't push the Americans too hard cause we're all fucking armed,</v>

414
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

415
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 4>and we're all going to be able to communicate with each other.</v>

416
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a certain boundary point where it's destined to fail.</v>

417
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 4>So I think they have a weird strategy.</v>

418
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're preparing for something but the end game can't work.</v>

419
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 4>Like they can't push that final button where they put live rounds in the troops</v>

420
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.500
<v Speaker 4>and start us.</v>

421
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

422
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.020
<v Speaker 1>we just will not fucking allow that under any circumstance.</v>

423
00:11:57.021 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the founders and creating the second amendment I believe they</v>

424
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>had in mind was not to protect against their enemies but also against our own</v>

425
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

426
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Misusing the power of the army.</v>

427
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how few people are willing to engage that idea,</v>

428
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:15.750
<v Speaker 1>willing to even even throw it out there that it's possible that there could be</v>

430
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:20.890
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a massive civil war in this country and then literally we might</v>

431
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:21.491
<v Speaker 1>have troops,</v>

432
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:26.491
<v Speaker 1>American troops fighting against Americans that nobody wants to think that.</v>

433
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to think that that's possible.</v>

434
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:28.661
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

435
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:29.321
<v Speaker 1>That's why I wouldn't,</v>

436
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:29.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

437
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:29.761
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

438
00:12:29.761 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 1>they talk about the second amendment,</v>

439
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:31.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

440
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 1>allowing for an armed militia.</v>

441
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

442
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that like they are the well regulated militia.</v>

443
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

445
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.671
<v Speaker 1>And people go,</v>

446
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>what do you know what your rise against the government,</v>

447
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>just 10 years ago that sounded like nonsense.</v>

448
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>That sounded like the stupidest thing in the world.</v>

449
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Like why the fuck would you do that?</v>

450
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 1>This is the greatest country on earth.</v>

451
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.170
<v Speaker 1>But within the 10 years,</v>

452
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:52.230
<v Speaker 1>since nine 11 the deterioration of what this country stood for to me and to I</v>

453
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 1>think a lot of us,</v>

454
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.433
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

455
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 1>it's been shit on.</v>

456
00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

457
00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>It's been,</v>

458
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 1>it's been used.</v>

459
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:00.874
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

460
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>like what we're supposed,</v>

461
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.130
<v Speaker 1>like one of the reasons why everybody was so horrified after nine 11 it's like,</v>

462
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>people who don't pay that much attention to foreign politics,</v>

464
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.120
<v Speaker 1>they don't know exactly what all the complaints are and what,</v>

465
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.780
<v Speaker 1>what countries were occupying,</v>

466
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 1>what's sacred land where,</v>

467
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>we have fucking troops marching on every day if they don't understand like what,</v>

469
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:22.741
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

470
00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:27.741
<v Speaker 1>the actual reason for someone being pissed off at us for their view of the,</v>

471
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

472
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>

473
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like really pretty rosy.</v>

474
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Like were there like the peacekeepers are the world and yeah,</v>

475
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam was a little shady,</v>

476
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:37.060
<v Speaker 1>but we did fuck up Hitler.</v>

477
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

478
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 1>And Japan was ready to take over.</v>

479
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>We took care of that nonsense to the Russia.</v>

480
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 1>We bankrupt them bitches.</v>

481
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:42.761
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

482
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:43.420
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

483
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.290
<v Speaker 1>We got this.</v>

484
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

485
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>you dig deeper and you pay more attention to it and you go look at what could</v>

486
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 1>happen in 10 years.</v>

487
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Look how it can just slide away from you in 10 years.</v>

488
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Things like the Patriot Act,</v>

489
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:58.510
<v Speaker 1>things like tapping into people's fucking cell phones on a regular basis with no</v>

490
00:13:58.511 --> 00:13:59.141
<v Speaker 1>warrants.</v>

491
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:04.141
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that the Patriot Act was only used a handful of times for actual</v>

492
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:05.920
<v Speaker 1>terrorist attacks,</v>

493
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 1>but was used hundreds and thousands of times for drugs.</v>

494
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds and thousands of times.</v>

495
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I forget the real number,</v>

496
00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:18.670
<v Speaker 1>but it was just a ridiculous disproportionate number were the majority of the</v>

497
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Times they use the Patriot Act was for drugs.</v>

498
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:21.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what people,</v>

499
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

500
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:24.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you allow that power,</v>

501
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.500
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be used in whatever means possible.</v>

502
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:27.334
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

503
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

504
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>preventing these things like that act that just passed is so vital because you</v>

505
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 1>give a law,</v>

506
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:34.900
<v Speaker 1>you let a lot pass with one intention.</v>

508
00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:35.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

509
00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter what the intentions are.</v>

510
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Even the people trying to pass a may have those intentions,</v>

511
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:41.650
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately with that power enabled,</v>

512
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.610
<v Speaker 1>the corruption is inevitable and it happens extremely fast and that's even a</v>

513
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.230
<v Speaker 1>benevolent kind of view.</v>

514
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 1>The other view is,</v>

515
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.551
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

516
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>we'll get it passed under these auspices and then we'll really use it to,</v>

517
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 1>to do whatever their other men,</v>

519
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.410
<v Speaker 1>their means are so set up that they have now where the,</v>

520
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.480
<v Speaker 1>they're allowed to like come up with laws and then these few handful of</v>

521
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers that have gotten to the cool kids party,</v>

522
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>they get to vote on everything that it goes through the Senate and it goes</v>

523
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 1>through Congress and they agreed to it.</v>

524
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 1>And then if the president doesn't veto it,</v>

525
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

526
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.041
<v Speaker 1>It went through this,</v>

527
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:13.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:14.360
<v Speaker 1>x amount of people,</v>

529
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:19.361
<v Speaker 1>300 million people are changed now and affected by this corrupt stupid fucking</v>

530
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 1>shit bag unconstitutional idea that these fuckheads past and it's just somehow</v>

531
00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:27.680
<v Speaker 1>or another they're allowed to do that.</v>

532
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a red [inaudible] form of government.</v>

533
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:30.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

534
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:31.731
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

535
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:32.001
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

536
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:32.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

537
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:32.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:33.980
<v Speaker 1>representative or not,</v>

539
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:34.970
<v Speaker 1>that's stupid.</v>

540
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:39.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible way for really important shit to get introduced into our</v>

541
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:40.454
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

542
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

543
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that that is the way the system is set up,</v>

544
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like ultimately the whole thing needs to be like radically overhauled.</v>

545
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a little minor tweak.</v>

546
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be radically overhauled because there's so much that gets done and</v>

547
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 1>so much that sucks out there.</v>

548
00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:58.320
<v Speaker 1>That's just be just,</v>

549
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.240
<v Speaker 1>we just follow it because it's written somewhere and because everybody agreed to</v>

550
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>it at one point in time.</v>

551
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>But as we've gotten older and you know,</v>

552
00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you get a much better grasp on how fucked up the world really is and how</v>

553
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:12.290
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous some of the laws that are in place and what the actual origin of</v>

554
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:16.220
<v Speaker 1>those laws are and if the fact that they're actually based in real clear and</v>

555
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 1>measurable corruption and you know,</v>

556
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 1>it should be like a fuck load of people should be in jail is what it should be,</v>

557
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.521
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

558
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 1>But instead it just kind of like it is the law.</v>

559
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:26.451
<v Speaker 1>It's the way it is.</v>

560
00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>It's on the paper.</v>

561
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.521
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

562
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:28.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

563
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:30.020
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways to approach it.</v>

564
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the interesting things that we're going to do is,</v>

565
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:33.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

566
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.551
<v Speaker 1>there's two problems.</v>

568
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 1>One is what's wrong with,</v>

569
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.590
<v Speaker 1>the currently the society that we're in and how to bridge that gap.</v>

571
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.010
<v Speaker 1>But I think as important as anything is to just start fresh,</v>

572
00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 1>take away all that momentum,</v>

573
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.313
<v Speaker 1>all of those,</v>

574
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.010
<v Speaker 1>different people trained in the different ways what you expect and just kind of</v>

576
00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 1>start from scratch and say if you could start from scratch,</v>

577
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

578
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 1>how could you set this up?</v>

579
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Knowing what we know now and knowing the different pathways that history of</v>

580
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:58.484
<v Speaker 1>already paid,</v>

581
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.080
<v Speaker 1>how do you prevent these disasters?</v>

582
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:01.340
<v Speaker 1>How do you prevent this corruption?</v>

583
00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 1>How do you create a model that will create momentum going the other way?</v>

584
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And then the question just becomes how do you bridge these two situations?</v>

585
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:09.284
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible?</v>

586
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to go from our current situation to the ideal situation?</v>

587
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:13.791
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>

588
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:14.440
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>

589
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:14.820
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

590
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 1>and then kind of fill that in with the real issue is financial.</v>

591
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:17.961
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

592
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:19.070
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with all the money?</v>

593
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you divvy it up?</v>

594
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.010
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

595
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

596
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people out there that are at zero right now that would love</v>

597
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:26.230
<v Speaker 1>that they would love,</v>

598
00:17:26.231 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Speaker 1>like everybody gets a fair shake,</v>

599
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:29.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

600
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets a fear piece,</v>

601
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.270
<v Speaker 1>which is not supposed to be how it is.</v>

602
00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has the opportunity to go out and make money by whatever means you</v>

603
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:36.861
<v Speaker 1>want to do it.</v>

604
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 1>And if your means or unsuccessful,</v>

605
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean the system sucks.</v>

606
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.290
<v Speaker 1>It means that for whatever reason,</v>

607
00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:45.710
<v Speaker 1>whether you're in a saturated environment or whether you know the,</v>

608
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.990
<v Speaker 1>the job that you want is highly,</v>

609
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.380
<v Speaker 1>highly touted and it's one that everybody wants to get.</v>

610
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of competition.</v>

611
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:53.431
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

612
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:54.540
<v Speaker 1>What is the reason?</v>

613
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately you're not able to do what you're doing,</v>

614
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.451
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

615
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Because it's gotta be a reason for it.</v>

616
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.331
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

617
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>The situation we're currently in economically sucks,</v>

618
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of these dudes are just willing to lay down.</v>

619
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these dudes are willing to go,</v>

620
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:08.780
<v Speaker 1>it's rigged.</v>

621
00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.511
<v Speaker 1>Thing is rigged,</v>

622
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:09.751
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

623
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

624
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.260
<v Speaker 1>they're not even willing to try to figure out some way through it.</v>

625
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.960
<v Speaker 1>We all know that at the beginning of you what I mean,</v>

626
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you must've felt this a points in your life and I certainly felt it as</v>

627
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:21.600
<v Speaker 1>a a struggling comedian.</v>

628
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.490
<v Speaker 1>There's point points where you know,</v>

629
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're not going to make it.</v>

630
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:25.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

631
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 1>you feel like this is ridiculous pursuit.</v>

632
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

633
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking failure,</v>

634
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:31.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

635
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

636
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.071
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

637
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:32.310
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

638
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.731
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

639
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:36.270
<v Speaker 1>if I was doing that and then I thought if I had these like self defeating</v>

640
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and then I thought that the system was rigged.</v>

641
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was,</v>

642
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

643
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.270
<v Speaker 1>going to college to get some sort of a job in business,</v>

644
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 1>then I realized this system is rigged.</v>

645
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.331
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm,</v>

646
00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's self defeating stage and then I'm marching around.</v>

647
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.580
<v Speaker 1>That might not necessarily be the best move for you.</v>

648
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

649
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:51.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

650
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna that's gonna cause an end to this situation prematurely.</v>

651
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

652
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.670
<v Speaker 1>People recognize that about any big giant movement is that they're not entirely</v>

653
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:00.340
<v Speaker 1>pure.</v>

654
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>

655
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

656
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:04.500
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of people that are in this occupy movement that make a lot of</v>

657
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking sense.</v>

658
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are saying a lot of really important shit and then</v>

659
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:11.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of crazy assholes pee themselves.</v>

660
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.803
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

661
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>

662
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I read an interesting piece on that and there is a Dutch economist,</v>

663
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's got a Haber mass and uh,</v>

664
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 1>his point was that they're leading this almost anarchist movement without any</v>

665
00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:27.771
<v Speaker 1>set defined principles as a form of kind of awareness for self correction by the</v>

666
00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:31.350
<v Speaker 1>majority basically saying that there's nothing that they can say,</v>

667
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:31.981
<v Speaker 1>no bill,</v>

668
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:32.880
<v Speaker 1>no law,</v>

669
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 1>no rule that will be respected enough to actually come out and say do this</v>

670
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.990
<v Speaker 1>because the whole system is so corrupt and nepotistic and circular that somehow,</v>

671
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:42.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

672
00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:45.210
<v Speaker 1>they would get that concession and then it would be over.</v>

673
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:50.210
<v Speaker 1>But by creating this kind of anarchist state where they're just in certain areas</v>

674
00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 1>and they're just there,</v>

675
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 1>they're causing people like us to be more aware,</v>

676
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:58.800
<v Speaker 1>to heighten that sense of self awareness and self critical side side of things</v>

677
00:19:58.801 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 1>and may actually affect the majority to change and a much broader level than if</v>

678
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 1>they actually had demands and actually started to do it.</v>

679
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.090
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

680
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can criticize the people.</v>

681
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think I've said it before,</v>

682
00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 1>playing hacky sack out on the Austin City Hall,</v>

683
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:11.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

684
00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly going to inspire the most amount of people,</v>

685
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 1>but it is going to cause people to talk about it and cause you know,</v>

686
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 1>room for self reflection.</v>

687
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And I think that kind of anarchist protest almost,</v>

688
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:23.481
<v Speaker 1>which one it is,</v>

689
00:20:23.481 --> 00:20:24.060
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

690
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.320
<v Speaker 1>is effective in that way.</v>

691
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:26.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

692
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it definitely gets an energy out there and that energy is most certainly</v>

693
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 1>interpreted with no question whatsoever.</v>

694
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's mad,</v>

695
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.580
<v Speaker 1>this is not good.</v>

696
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:36.414
<v Speaker 1>We're not happy.</v>

697
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.560
<v Speaker 1>And we were so unhappy that we're going to camp out in tents.</v>

698
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

699
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

700
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.790
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of ridiculous.</v>

701
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:42.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

702
00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:42.720
<v Speaker 1>and then it didn't.</v>

703
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Then it has to be,</v>

704
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 1>do we unite with these people and try to bring them all back or</v>

705
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 5>is it us against them and when it becomes us against them and then they start</v>

706
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:56.140
<v Speaker 5>preparing for us against them with like this NDA passage,</v>

707
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.801
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

708
00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 5>that's what it sounds like to me.</v>

709
00:20:57.941 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like they're preparing for some sort of a,</v>

710
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 5>almost a military style,</v>

711
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 5>civil unrest in this country.</v>

712
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:05.111
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

713
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:05.891
<v Speaker 5>the pain is on,</v>

714
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 5>they just minor at this point.</v>

715
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 5>Really nothing.</v>

716
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 5>Look what's going on in Egypt,</v>

717
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:09.461
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

718
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

719
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.570

<v Speaker 5>Horrendous Shit.</v>

728
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.771
<v Speaker 5>It's really,</v>

729
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:22.860
<v Speaker 5>really hard to watch these people running on the street.</v>

730
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 5>There are hundreds of them and they encounter like one or two protesters and</v>

731
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:29.590
<v Speaker 5>just club the fuck out of them while they're unconscious.</v>

732
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:33.730
<v Speaker 5>They're jumping on them and booting him in the head and cracking them full blast</v>

733
00:21:33.731 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 5>in the head with Bhutan's while they're unconscious.</v>

734
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 5>They s this guy jumped on this woman.</v>

735
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 5>One guy was dragging her and this guy jumped and stomped on her chest.</v>

736
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.781
<v Speaker 5>She was a woman.</v>

737
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:45.060
<v Speaker 5>She had a bra on.</v>

738
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 5>It was like a blue bra.</v>

739
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 5>She was skinny and he just jumped up and stomped down on our chest.</v>

740
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 5>It is inhumane.</v>

741
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 5>It's horrific to watch and you know,</v>

742
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.291

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 5>Same as the old boss,</v>

749
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:03.401
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>years has gone.</v>

752
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.630
<v Speaker 5>And who the fuck runs things?</v>

753
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:10.841
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

754
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

755
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:11.531
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

756
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:12.100
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

757
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.270
<v Speaker 5>And then there's a jocking and there's just crazy lawlessness now.</v>

758
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 5>It's horrific to watch,</v>

759
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:18.370
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

760
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.091
<v Speaker 5>When you see that,</v>

761
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:21.310
<v Speaker 5>when you see these protesters getting beaten,</v>

762
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 5>like that man that the savagery involved,</v>

763
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:24.730
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

764
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:25.211
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

765
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 5>you have no concern for their health or wellbeing.</v>

766
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 5>It was like if people were running,</v>

767
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:30.371
<v Speaker 5>shooting,</v>

768
00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:32.050
<v Speaker 5>just running and shooting guns,</v>

769
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.650
<v Speaker 5>running forward towards these people towards the protest to and just shooting</v>

770
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:36.484
<v Speaker 5>guns,</v>

771
00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm in it.</v>

772
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.190
<v Speaker 5>They are not taking it.</v>

773
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Where do you see that video on Youtube?</v>

774
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:40.350
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

775
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 5>it was on youtube because it's not graphic.</v>

776
00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 5>You can't see any blood or anything.</v>

777
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.771
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

778
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 5>it's like kind of shitty quality.</v>

779
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.490
<v Speaker 4>What's up with shitty quality nowadays?</v>

780
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean come on.</v>

781
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

782
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:50.381
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

783
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:50.720
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

784
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 4>She has some old ass fucking Motorola cell phone.</v>

785
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.321
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

786
00:22:54.321 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what it was filmed on.</v>

787
00:22:55.571 --> 00:22:55.801
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

788
00:22:55.801 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 4>It was filmed on now you know where you dropped it as cell phones off in the</v>

789
00:22:58.691 --> 00:22:59.261
<v Speaker 4>boxes.</v>

790
00:22:59.261 --> 00:23:00.610
<v Speaker 4>Lance is like donate your cell phones.</v>

791
00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 4>I it goes to Egypt,</v>

792
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 4>it goes to anywhere in the world is fucked up.</v>

793
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

794
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.221
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

795
00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

796
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Speaker 4>the economic pain that were kind of feeling,</v>

797
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:10.061
<v Speaker 4>it's bad.</v>

798
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean definitely a lot of people are hurting but it's not too great depression</v>

799
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:15.190
<v Speaker 4>levels right now.</v>

800
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.641
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

801
00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:19.600
<v Speaker 4>it's not even to levels that we've already seen happen before here in America.</v>

802
00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:23.740
<v Speaker 4>And I think everybody recognizes that we are right now in a very unshaking</v>

803
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.350
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

804
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Foundation one.</v>

805
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 4>And when it gets worse,</v>

806
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.920
<v Speaker 4>then the occupy movement,</v>

807
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

808
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:30.851
<v Speaker 4>what's going to,</v>

809
00:23:30.851 --> 00:23:32.130
<v Speaker 4>cause you know,</v>

810
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 4>the people who are on the fringe to just come out in numbers.</v>

811
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:37.750
<v Speaker 4>I think there'll be a kind of a tipping point effect where people are going to</v>

812
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:38.051
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

813
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:38.884
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>

814
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 4>Fuck the corruption in the government.</v>

815
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:41.890
<v Speaker 4>We need a new system.</v>

816
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:42.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

817
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.530
<v Speaker 4>we need to stop spending money to bail out the banks.</v>

818
00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 4>We need what you less so ever</v>

819
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
<v Speaker 1>convinced the government to revamp the system and take away their power and how</v>

820
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 1>they would ever do that.</v>

821
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 1>It takes an uprising like that.</v>

822
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it takes,</v>

823
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.850
<v Speaker 1>it takes the people to cause the movement and when has the government ever done</v>

824
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 1>shit without the people moving first.</v>

825
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean women's suffrage for example of women weren't marching around doing that</v>

826
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:04.670
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

827
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.140
<v Speaker 1>They may still not be able to vote.</v>

828
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean it takes the people rising up in order to change the government's the</v>

829
00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:12.260
<v Speaker 1>only fucking way because power is going to breed power.</v>

830
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 1>They're going to just keep the snitch system status quo.</v>

831
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe one or two examples where Lincoln abolish slavery,</v>

832
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.460
<v Speaker 1>on his own kind of,</v>

834
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 1>before there was massive upscale,</v>

835
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but that was during a time of war.</v>

836
00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It had certain advantages,</v>

837
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:24.551
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

838
00:24:24.551 --> 00:24:26.990
<v Speaker 1>There is a variety of different things involved in that,</v>

839
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:31.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's always the people who demand something first that caused the government</v>

840
00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>

841
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

842
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

843
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:35.780
<v Speaker 1>right now people are talking and they're talking voice.</v>

844
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I think pretty soon they're going to have to start yelling and I think that's</v>

845
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.240
<v Speaker 1>ultimately what's going to happen and change.</v>

846
00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 1>But before they start yelling,</v>

847
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.380
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately they'd asked to hurt worse.</v>

848
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's probably where we're heading,</v>

849
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

850
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.240
<v Speaker 1>as to is the more economical,</v>

851
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and I never thought this was going to be going down.</v>

852
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I remember when you were younger when Clinton was president and looked like the</v>

853
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:59.210
<v Speaker 1>world is just a rosy fucking beautiful place to be.</v>

854
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I miss that guy just he was just a comfortable guy.</v>

855
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 1>What an amazing and a comfortable time.</v>

856
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.353
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>

857
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 1>20 years a world has just changed beyond recognition almost.</v>

858
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.300
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's part of the natural cycle of things.</v>

859
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:14.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

860
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:16.970
<v Speaker 1>things don't go in a steady curve.</v>

861
00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 1>They have to go in these cycles.</v>

862
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.030
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

863
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

864
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 1>gets way too far out of line.</v>

865
00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Then it maybe goes back too far the other way.</v>

866
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

867
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 1>probably there'll be a point where,</v>

868
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

869
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 1>the sentiments get too roused in the other direction.</v>

870
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:28.821
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

871
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:29.121
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

872
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:29.331
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

873
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:29.811
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

874
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:30.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

875
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:30.801
<v Speaker 1>we gotta have banks,</v>

876
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:33.440
<v Speaker 1>we've got to have this need to keep civilization together.</v>

877
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.090
<v Speaker 1>We need credit cards.</v>

878
00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be carrying gold bullion.</v>

879
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's pull the shit together.</v>

880
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.000
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

881
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.500
<v Speaker 1>goddammit.</v>

882
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

883
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.873
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

884
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

885
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.643
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get rid of,</v>

886
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 1>you got to get rid of that stock market.</v>

887
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I watched that fucking thing on TV.</v>

888
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I sound like a grandpa.</v>

889
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I watched that stock market.</v>

890
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get rid of that.</v>

891
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.500
<v Speaker 1>But I watched it on TV.</v>

892
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I was watching some won some financial report and there's the ticker tape going</v>

893
00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:56.741
<v Speaker 1>on because it,</v>

894
00:25:56.741 --> 00:25:58.670
<v Speaker 1>cause it's like an alien program to me.</v>

895
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 1>The ticker tapes going on beneath it.</v>

896
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.131
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

897
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:01.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

898
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:03.350
<v Speaker 1>this guy starts talking about,</v>

899
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:03.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

900
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:26:04.101 --> 00:26:07.760
<v Speaker 1>a lack of confidence in this company and a confidence that there's a lot of</v>

902
00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:10.940
<v Speaker 1>confidence behind this company and I'm watching these numbers spin.</v>

903
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:11.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

904
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:12.650
<v Speaker 1>this is insanity.</v>

905
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.461
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

906
00:26:13.461 --> 00:26:14.121
<v Speaker 1>these guys are like,</v>

907
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:14.601
<v Speaker 1>there's like a,</v>

908
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:15.740
<v Speaker 1>a virus,</v>

909
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.130
<v Speaker 1>a virus of numbers is horrible like hurricane,</v>

910
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:20.750
<v Speaker 1>like virus of numbers.</v>

911
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a few people in there that sort of know how to decipher it and</v>

912
00:26:23.751 --> 00:26:27.260
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling numbers out and seeing which way the waves are blowing.</v>

913
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:27.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

914
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 1>what a wacky fucking system based on confidence.</v>

915
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:32.720
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

916
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Based on how people feel about companies and shit and whether or not a new</v>

917
00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:37.610
<v Speaker 1>product just came out,</v>

918
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:39.890
<v Speaker 1>oh we're going to buy by apple by,</v>

919
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:40.610
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

920
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and you can actually,</v>

921
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:41.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 1>you can affect that somehow.</v>

923
00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

924
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 4>what kind of,</v>

925
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.120
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

926
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.070
<v Speaker 4>what are we basing on any of our time on this wonky shit for this is a</v>

927
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:51.170
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous set up.</v>

928
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 4>The speculatory frenzy around stocks and these things is pretty outrageous and</v>

929
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:55.591
<v Speaker 4>it really,</v>

930
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 4>it takes away from what originally the idea is,</v>

931
00:26:57.961 --> 00:26:58.741
<v Speaker 4>which is to own a,</v>

932
00:26:58.741 --> 00:27:02.430
<v Speaker 4>share an interest in a company that you thought was going to make money and do</v>

933
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 4>things as a positive form of investment.</v>

934
00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

935
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 4>ultimately really wacky.</v>

936
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.950
<v Speaker 4>Was it the Reagan administration when,</v>

937
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.381
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

938
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 4>when were they allowed to do,</v>

939
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 4>like when did they allow women to let loud have like derivatives and stuff?</v>

940
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 4>Probably in the 80s in the 80 [inaudible] got it.</v>

941
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 4>Got The wackiest cause the markets were still pretty new in the 70s and things.</v>

942
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

943
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.450
<v Speaker 4>but the stock market has had its nonsenses since the 1920s.</v>

944
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:31.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can read the big crash of the stock operator and there was some of</v>

945
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:32.664
<v Speaker 4>the same madness,</v>

946
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.880
<v Speaker 4>but there were safeguards who were put in place after the big crash of the</v>

947
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>

948
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Speaker 4>the 20s into Great Depression.</v>

949
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

950
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.151
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

951
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:41.790
<v Speaker 4>there were safeguards that are put in place that were eventually dropped,</v>

952
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:42.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

953
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:42.953
<v Speaker 4>Weren't there?</v>

954
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.381
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

955
00:27:43.381 --> 00:27:43.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

956
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 4>depending on how much the market can drop in a certain day,</v>

957
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:48.000
<v Speaker 4>basically limits so it can go limit down.</v>

958
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:48.210
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

959
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of those things in different,</v>

960
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 4>in different commodities markets as well.</v>

961
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 4>There'll be a limit to how far the price can move in one day.</v>

962
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.550
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is that's just per day.</v>

963
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:59.520
<v Speaker 4>They don't limit it permanently cause that would cause massive inefficiency.</v>

964
00:27:59.521 --> 00:28:03.810
<v Speaker 4>So it just kinda curves that initial panic like holy fuck,</v>

965
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 4>we got to sell everything,</v>

966
00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:05.161
<v Speaker 4>sell,</v>

967
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:05.401
<v Speaker 4>sell,</v>

968
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:05.701
<v Speaker 4>sell,</v>

969
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 4>and then lots of way below where it needs to and then the margin calls kick in</v>

970
00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:10.794
<v Speaker 4>and then people,</v>

971
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

972
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 4>lose all their money.</v>

973
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 4>They're jumping out of buildings.</v>

974
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just a mess.</v>

975
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.563
<v Speaker 4>At that point.</v>

976
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 4>They tried to curb that so ridiculous this buy,</v>

977
00:28:19.261 --> 00:28:19.501
<v Speaker 4>buy,</v>

978
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:19.831
<v Speaker 4>buy,</v>

979
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:20.191
<v Speaker 4>sell,</v>

980
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:20.461
<v Speaker 4>sell,</v>

981
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:20.790
<v Speaker 4>sell.</v>

982
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.240
<v Speaker 4>It seems so ridiculous that accompany could actually,</v>

983
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:29.241
<v Speaker 4>like we'll go by that like that could have any sense whatsoever in the world of</v>

984
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 4>business and still,</v>

985
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 4>but looking at these equity markets,</v>

986
00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 4>they're way better off than the credit markets.</v>

987
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:36.040
<v Speaker 4>Then the debt markets,</v>

988
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.680
<v Speaker 4>that's where all of these problems are going.</v>

989
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:40.290
<v Speaker 4>People swap and debt and derivatives and all of these things.</v>

990
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

991
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.700
<v Speaker 4>at least these are companies,</v>

992
00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 4>at least ultimately at the end of the day,</v>

993
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.440
<v Speaker 4>you can poke a CEO and the chest and hold something,</v>

994
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 4>a service or a product that he created at the company,</v>

995
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:50.740
<v Speaker 4>created a,</v>

996
00:28:50.741 --> 00:28:51.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

997
00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:52.260
<v Speaker 4>all of these other pieces.</v>

998
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:52.810
<v Speaker 4>What are they?</v>

999
00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.790
<v Speaker 4>There's these numbers that are circulated in a variety of ways where everybody</v>

1000
00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:58.280
<v Speaker 4>makes money and if you lose money,</v>

1001
00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:58.801
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

1002
00:28:58.801 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 4>You don't lose money because the government will bail you out.</v>

1003
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.890
<v Speaker 4>So how the fuck are they not going to do that?</v>

1004
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:04.531
<v Speaker 4>A no risk.</v>

1005
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 4>It's a no risk situation.</v>

1006
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:06.391
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1007
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:06.601
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>

1008
00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:06.841
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1009
00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:07.950
<v Speaker 4>let's be super aggressive.</v>

1010
00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 4>Let's be super risky.</v>

1011
00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 4>We'll make a bunch of money on the way up.</v>

1012
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.093
<v Speaker 4>If we lose,</v>

1013
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 4>no big deal.</v>

1014
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:13.200
<v Speaker 4>Uncle Sam will come in,</v>

1015
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:14.034
<v Speaker 4>they'll pay it all.</v>

1016
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1017
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 4>how are we not expected for them to have it?</v>

1018
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:19.770
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think one of my biggest beefs with the occupy Wall Street movement</v>

1019
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:20.280
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1020
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:20.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1021
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 4>really should be occupy Washington.</v>

1022
00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1023
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.390
<v Speaker 4>you're telling these sharks that,</v>

1024
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:24.810
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1025
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 4>play this game.</v>

1026
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.570
<v Speaker 4>You can make all the money you want and if you lose,</v>

1027
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 4>we're going to bail you out.</v>

1028
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:28.831
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1029
00:29:28.831 --> 00:29:29.580
<v Speaker 4>who's fault is that?</v>

1030
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.361
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be sharks.</v>

1031
00:29:30.361 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 4>Sharks are going to be sharks.</v>

1032
00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.810
<v Speaker 4>These men are putting their positions for being greedy,</v>

1033
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.780
<v Speaker 4>for being the most aggressive in their,</v>

1034
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.643
<v Speaker 4>in their,</v>

1035
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 4>of their class.</v>

1036
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 4>And then we're expecting them to behave in these dramatically</v>

1037
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 1>moral ways and not do it.</v>

1038
00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:44.081
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1039
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen if they have no,</v>

1040
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:46.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1041
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.670
<v Speaker 1>no room for failure at the end of the day.</v>

1042
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck wouldn't they do that?</v>

1043
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been a stock market movie where they weren't really in it for the</v>

1044
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 1>money and they would just kind of really cool guys.</v>

00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:58.470
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of principals stock market moving.</v>

1046

<v Speaker 1>Everyone's fucking crazy.</v>

1066
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:24.190
<v Speaker 1>They're all over the edge.</v>

1067
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Is there a stock market movie where everybody's like really cool?</v>

1068
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a breed of animal.</v>

1069
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like I to go to work with pictures of their kids Bible passages.</v>

1070
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.040

1082
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:49.570
<v Speaker 1>market that they see.</v>

<v Speaker 6>people are blind and North Korea,</v>

1129
00:31:57.131 --> 00:31:58.420
<v Speaker 6>they're going blind because their,</v>

<v Speaker 6>that's what the whole country,</v>

1151
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.870
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1152
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.930
<v Speaker 6>is around those slave.</v>

1153
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 6>That's what makes the</v>

1154
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.930
<v Speaker 1>fear that makes all these people act this way is because of the slave camps.</v>

1155
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:44.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:32:44.231 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 1>The people have no power there.</v>

1157
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:45.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1158
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's really amazing what,</v>

1159
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.680
<v Speaker 1>and when you see a dictatorship,</v>

1160
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:50.060
<v Speaker 1>like it's horrific.</v>

1161
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1162
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1163
00:32:51.181 --> 00:32:51.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1164
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 1>it's the worst way a human being can be treated,</v>

1165
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's also quite impressive.</v>

1166
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.310
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing that some guy is just allowed to just straight run shit.</v>

1167
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1168
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:03.170
<v Speaker 1>like in Thailand,</v>

1169
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 1>some American just got locked up in jail,</v>

1170
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:08.770
<v Speaker 1>I think for a year for talking bad about the king.</v>

1171
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.273
<v Speaker 1>The king,</v>

1172
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.120
<v Speaker 1>the king actually doesn't even run.</v>

1173
00:33:12.121 --> 00:33:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:15.130
<v Speaker 7>In the country in Thailand as far as I remember from when I was like,</v>

1175
00:33:15.131 --> 00:33:16.280
<v Speaker 7>you can't talk shit about it.</v>

1176
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.320
<v Speaker 7>But there is a special rule about,</v>

1177
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:19.850
<v Speaker 7>about talking bad about the king.</v>

1178
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.241
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1179
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:20.541
<v Speaker 7>it's a,</v>

1180
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 7>it's a weird situation where they have some kind of control on the verbiage</v>

1181
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:25.671
<v Speaker 7>towards the king,</v>

1182
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 7>but he actually has not as much governmental power as,</v>

1183
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.810
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1184
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.700
<v Speaker 7>as the general other Thai leaders.</v>

1185
00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:34.310
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what they have as far as that's interesting person,</v>

1186
00:33:34.311 --> 00:33:34.940
<v Speaker 7>but yeah.</v>

1187
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:35.721
<v Speaker 7>He apparently,</v>

1188
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:37.580
<v Speaker 7>he's like legitimately beloved.</v>

1189
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.593
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:39.533
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1191
00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1192
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.030
<v Speaker 7>It's not amazing.</v>

1193
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.320
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

1194
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1195
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.090
<v Speaker 7>That's a strange fucking place,</v>

1196
00:33:44.091 --> 00:33:44.660
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

1197
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 7>is</v>

1198
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.350
<v Speaker 1>do you think we're withdrawing our troops so we can send them into North Korea?</v>

1199
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:48.981
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1200
00:33:48.981 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 1>we're not going on North Korea.</v>

1201
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.530
<v Speaker 1>No minerals in North Korea.</v>

1202
00:33:51.531 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 1>There's no goal in North Korea is there's a whole country of people that are</v>

1203
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.361
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

1204
00:33:56.361 --> 00:33:56.691
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1205
00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:57.860
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of Nazi shit,</v>

1206
00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:58.461
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1207
00:33:58.461 --> 00:33:58.970
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1208
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1209
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it's Communist.</v>

1210
00:34:00.951 --> 00:34:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Dictatorship is 100% like that.</v>

1211
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1212
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:06.020
<v Speaker 1>it's actually worse than Nazi,</v>

1213
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1214
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:06.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1215
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say worse,</v>

1216
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think it's team America?</v>

1217
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Same exact vein of it,</v>

1218
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.271
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1219
00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:11.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1220
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:14.900
<v Speaker 1>they're not out there causing genocide and attacking other nations,</v>

1221
00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:15.670
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1222
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:16.371
<v Speaker 1>they're puking,</v>

1223
00:34:16.371 --> 00:34:16.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1224
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.320
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible way to live.</v>

1225
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You know what about it?</v>

1226
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 1>They said that Kim Jong was the number one buyer of Hennessy,</v>

1227
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 1>number one single person that buys the most of Hennessy.</v>

1228
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you almost imagine kind of fucking rapper parties?</v>

1229
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.021
<v Speaker 1>He must have had,</v>

1230
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:31.790
<v Speaker 1>rappers are so mad about that right now,</v>

1231
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:32.720
<v Speaker 1>that price they're going to,</v>

1232
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:33.490
<v Speaker 1>they're going to change that.</v>

1233
00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>

1234
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 1>do you think maybe that the,</v>

1235
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.060
<v Speaker 1>that we have our planning set up by the way?</v>

1236
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.341
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1237
00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it's 100% true.</v>

1238
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I swear to fucking God,</v>

1239
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:39.901
<v Speaker 1>look it up.</v>

1240
00:34:39.901 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Leave you.</v>

1241
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:45.200
<v Speaker 1>But do you think maybe that we a poisoned Kim Jong to give him a heart attack</v>

1242
00:34:45.201 --> 00:34:47.660
<v Speaker 1>and you think what were planning all this to go to North Korea?</v>

1243
00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:49.243
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1244
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 1>he's an old dude.</v>

1245
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 1>But it is kind of fun if you want to be a conspiracy theorist and really start</v>

1246
00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:55.910
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it and think about,</v>

1247
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1248
00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Gadhafi and Osama bin Ladin and Kim Jong Il and all Mubarak's gone.</v>

1249
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Think about all these people who've been moved,</v>

1250
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 1>replace or died just really recently.</v>

1251
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1252
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.150
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen a general Anthony?</v>

1253
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.300
<v Speaker 1>What does is no,</v>

1254
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.153
<v Speaker 1>Wesley Clark,</v>

1255
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.200
<v Speaker 1>do you remember that guy that was running for president for awhile?</v>

1256
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:19.723
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

1257
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a general,</v>

1258
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 1>some bad ass army guy.</v>

1259
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:23.930
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1260
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:24.200
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

1261
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.610
<v Speaker 1>let me look it up so I can give him</v>

1262
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.513
<v Speaker 7>the right.</v>

1263
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:31.170
<v Speaker 7>May just be part of this sign of the times have changed that it's kind of</v>

1264
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:32.490
<v Speaker 7>sweeping over everybody.</v>

1265
00:35:32.491 --> 00:35:35.040
<v Speaker 7>It seems like there's this tumultuous period,</v>

1266
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:35.370
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1267
00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:37.050
<v Speaker 7>as we're coming into this this age,</v>

1268
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 7>it's causing change</v>

1269
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 5>to happen at a more rapid rate.</v>

1270
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.240
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1271
00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:40.621
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

1273
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 5>I want you to pull up the plan according to General Wesley Clark.</v>

1274
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 5>You can just Google Wesley Clark General Wesley Clark and this'll come up in</v>

1275
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.024
<v Speaker 5>youtube.</v>

1276
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:51.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1277
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:56.660
<v Speaker 5>but my point was this general Wesley Clark actually in I believe it was 2007 he</v>

1278
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 5>predicted all of this and he said,</v>

1279
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 5>this is the plan.</v>

1280
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 5>This is what they want to do.</v>

1281
00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:04.110
<v Speaker 5>They're going to get rid of Gaddafi.</v>

1282
00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:05.220
<v Speaker 5>They're going to go into this country.</v>

1283
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 5>They're going to take over an Iraq who are going to kill Saddam Hussein.</v>

1284
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1285
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.770
<v Speaker 5>he like literally spells it out.</v>

1286
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.120
<v Speaker 5>Everything that we did,</v>

1287
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:12.340
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1288
00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.520
<v Speaker 8>10 days after nine 11,</v>

1289
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:18.550
<v Speaker 8>I went to the Pentagon and I shot Secretary Rumsfeld and and deputy searcher</v>

1290
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:18.970
<v Speaker 8>woeful,</v>

1291
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.510
<v Speaker 8>which I went downstairs just shale over some of the people on the joint staff</v>

1292
00:36:22.511 --> 00:36:23.860
<v Speaker 8>who would use general western crying.</v>

1293
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.330
<v Speaker 8>One of the generals call me and he said,</v>

1294
00:36:25.331 --> 00:36:25.511
<v Speaker 8>sir,</v>

1295
00:36:25.511 --> 00:36:28.480
<v Speaker 8>you got to come in and you got to come in and talk to me a second.</v>

1296
00:36:28.481 --> 00:36:28.691
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

1297
00:36:28.691 --> 00:36:28.781
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1298
00:36:28.781 --> 00:36:29.351
<v Speaker 8>you're too busy.</v>

1299
00:36:29.351 --> 00:36:29.591
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

1300
00:36:29.591 --> 00:36:29.851
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1301
00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:30.520
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

1302
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.353
<v Speaker 8>He says,</v>

1303
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.400
<v Speaker 8>we've made the decision.</v>

1304
00:36:33.401 --> 00:36:35.140
<v Speaker 8>We're going to war with Iraq.</v>

1305
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.480
<v Speaker 8>This was on or about the 20th of September.</v>

1306
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:38.681
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

1307
00:36:38.681 --> 00:36:40.030
<v Speaker 8>we're going to war with Iraq.</v>

1308
00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:40.864
<v Speaker 8>Why?</v>

1309
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.113
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

1310
00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.013
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

1311
00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:46.031
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

1312
00:36:46.031 --> 00:36:47.590
<v Speaker 8>I guess they don't know what else to do.</v>

1313
00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.890
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

1314
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:50.080
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1315
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.411
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

1316
00:36:50.411 --> 00:36:50.511
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1317
00:36:50.511 --> 00:36:51.730
<v Speaker 8>did they find some information,</v>

1318
00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:52.750
<v Speaker 8>collect connecting,</v>

1319
00:36:52.751 --> 00:36:53.980
<v Speaker 8>sit to al Qaeda?</v>

1320
00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:54.853
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

1321
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.151
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1322
00:36:55.151 --> 00:36:55.381
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

1323
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:55.691
<v Speaker 8>It was just,</v>

1324
00:36:55.691 --> 00:36:57.430
<v Speaker 8>there's nothing new that way.</v>

1325
00:36:57.431 --> 00:37:00.310
<v Speaker 8>They've just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.</v>

1326
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.061
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

1327
00:37:01.061 --> 00:37:04.120
<v Speaker 8>I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists,</v>

1328
00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:07.960
<v Speaker 8>but we've got a good military and we can take down governments.</v>

1329
00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 8>So I came back to see him a few weeks later and by that time we were bombing in</v>

1330
00:37:13.691 --> 00:37:14.381
<v Speaker 8>Afghanistan.</v>

1331
00:37:14.381 --> 00:37:14.591
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

1332
00:37:14.591 --> 00:37:16.030
<v Speaker 8>are we still going to war with Iraq?</v>

1333
00:37:16.031 --> 00:37:16.361
<v Speaker 8>And he said,</v>

1334
00:37:16.361 --> 00:37:16.511
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

1335
00:37:16.511 --> 00:37:17.500
<v Speaker 8>it's worse than that.</v>

1336
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.690
<v Speaker 8>You said he reached over on his desk.</v>

1337
00:37:19.691 --> 00:37:20.980
<v Speaker 8>He picked up a piece of paper and he said,</v>

1338
00:37:20.981 --> 00:37:21.814
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>

1339
00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.241
<v Speaker 8>he said,</v>

1340
00:37:22.241 --> 00:37:24.040
<v Speaker 8>I just got this down from upstairs,</v>

1341
00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:25.690
<v Speaker 8>mean saturated benched office today.</v>

1342
00:37:25.691 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 8>And he said,</v>

1343
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:31.090
<v Speaker 8>this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in</v>

1344
00:37:31.091 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 8>five years starting with Iraq and in Syria,</v>

1345
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:35.590
<v Speaker 8>11 on Libya,</v>

1346
00:37:35.591 --> 00:37:36.131
<v Speaker 8>Somalia,</v>

1347
00:37:36.131 --> 00:37:36.641
<v Speaker 8>Sudan,</v>

1348
00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:38.290
<v Speaker 8>and finishing off Iran</v>

1349
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.440
<v Speaker 8>to go through the countries again.</v>

1350
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.950
<v Speaker 8>We're all starting with Iraq and Syria and Lebanon.</v>

1351
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:48.670
<v Speaker 8>Then Libya than Somalia and Sudan and then back to her ran.</v>

1352
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.250
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1353
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.890
<v Speaker 5>Ask her what 2007 wow.</v>

1354
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.110
<v Speaker 5>This is the General Wesley Clark.</v>

1355
00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:56.921
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1356
00:37:56.921 --> 00:37:57.520
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1357
00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1358
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.990
<v Speaker 5>he's not a Kook,</v>

1359
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.000
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ and Nutty,</v>

1360
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.490
<v Speaker 5>but it's weird that he would,</v>

1361
00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:04.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1362
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:04.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1363
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.220
<v Speaker 5>is he still alive if you know that?</v>

1364
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:06.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1365
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:07.390
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1366
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.691
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1367
00:38:07.691 --> 00:38:08.290
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1368
00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:08.651
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1369
00:38:08.651 --> 00:38:08.920
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

1370
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.753
<v Speaker 5>he's alive man.</v>

1371
00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:10.481
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

1372
00:38:10.481 --> 00:38:10.900
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

1373
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.430
<v Speaker 5>if you know that and you don't tell,</v>

1374
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:19.580
<v Speaker 5>you're probably much more likely to get killed.</v>

1375
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.900
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1376
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:21.380
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

1377
00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:21.891
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>

1378
00:38:21.891 --> 00:38:24.950
<v Speaker 5>you might be thinking about telling somebody that once it's out.</v>

1379
00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:25.401
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1380
00:38:25.401 --> 00:38:26.240
<v Speaker 5>Once it's out,</v>

1381
00:38:26.241 --> 00:38:26.900
<v Speaker 5>it's out.</v>

1382
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.711
<v Speaker 5>And if they get you,</v>

1383
00:38:27.711 --> 00:38:28.910
<v Speaker 5>it's almost obvious.</v>

1384
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.541
<v Speaker 5>But if,</v>

1385
00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:29.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1386
00:38:29.931 --> 00:38:32.360
<v Speaker 5>if you've worked one of these dudes and you know some shit like that,</v>

1387
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.990
<v Speaker 5>she better get on a talk show son.</v>

1388
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1389
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:34.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.471
<v Speaker 5>You know what I like,</v>

1391
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:36.430
<v Speaker 5>if someone knows that,</v>

1392
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:37.264
<v Speaker 5>you know that,</v>

1393
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.901
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1394
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they wouldn't tell Wesley Clark because he's a fucking general.</v>

1395
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 5>And on top of that,</v>

1396
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 5>he's probably been a part of a bunch of shit in his past,</v>

1397
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.000
<v Speaker 5>but maybe he did may agree combination to a lock box with a lot worse.</v>

1398
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1399
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.690
<v Speaker 5>It shows up unexplainably dead.</v>

1400
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1401
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 5>And look,</v>

1402
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:58.870
<v Speaker 5>nobody knows more about how the world really runs in high ranking generals</v>

1403
00:38:59.050 --> 00:38:59.530
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

1404
00:38:59.530 --> 00:38:59.711
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1405
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 5>they get pushed into situations where they absolutely know that they're doing it</v>

1406
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 5>for a very specific reason.</v>

1407
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:04.810
<v Speaker 5>That uh,</v>

1408
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:05.950
<v Speaker 5>Smedley Butler,</v>

1409
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 5>a article that was written in the 1930s war is a racket,</v>

<v Speaker 5>amazing article.</v>

<v Speaker 5>When you think about the fact that this guy wrote this in like,</v>

1414
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.950
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like 19 something,</v>

<v Speaker 5>1930 something and you would say,</v>

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.830
<v Speaker 5>had a career in the military and got out and just said,</v>

1438
00:39:53.831 --> 00:39:54.640
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1439
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.690
<v Speaker 5>this is how it goes.</v>

1440
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.523
<v Speaker 5>Wars are racking.</v>

1441
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:57.370
<v Speaker 5>It always has been.</v>

1442
00:39:57.371 --> 00:39:58.480
<v Speaker 5>It's possibly the oldest,</v>

1443
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.740
<v Speaker 5>easily the most profitable.</v>

1444
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:01.060
<v Speaker 5>Surely the most vicious.</v>

1445
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.060
<v Speaker 5>It is the only one international in scope.</v>

1446
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:08.470
<v Speaker 5>It is the only one which the profits are reckoned in dollars in the losses in</v>

1447
00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Speaker 5>lives.</v>

1448
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Arachat is best described,</v>

1449
00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:11.200
<v Speaker 5>I believe,</v>

1450
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 5>as something that is not what it seems to be to the majority of the people.</v>

1451
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.140
<v Speaker 5>Only a small inside group knows what it's about.</v>

1452
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.960
<v Speaker 5>It's conducted for the benefit of the very few,</v>

1453
00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.720
<v Speaker 5>at the expense of the very many out of war.</v>

1454
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.580
<v Speaker 5>Few people can make huge fortunes and this is a 19 motherfucking 30.</v>

1455
00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:29.830
<v Speaker 5>This guy wrote that because that incredible.</v>

1456
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.383
<v Speaker 5>It's like</v>

1457
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.273
<v Speaker 1>he sucked,</v>

1458
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.000
<v Speaker 1>really sucked.</v>

1459
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.740
<v Speaker 1>We just been better recovering it up.</v>

1460
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.630
<v Speaker 1>If we had the internet in 1930,</v>

1461
00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:38.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1462
00:40:38.901 --> 00:40:39.610
<v Speaker 1>people would be like,</v>

1463
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.730
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we?</v>

1464
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Why are we in Mexico?</v>

1465
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:42.921
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1466
00:40:42.921 --> 00:40:44.030
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in Haiti?</v>

1467
00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:45.470
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing in Cuba?</v>

1468
00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.970
<v Speaker 1>There's probably some truth to that.</v>

1469
00:40:46.971 --> 00:40:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

1470
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.930
<v Speaker 1>so if we had to do it that we've,</v>

1471
00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:51.020
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this Joe,</v>

1472
00:40:51.021 --> 00:40:51.831
<v Speaker 1>so if we had to,</v>

1473
00:40:51.831 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1474
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.450
<v Speaker 1>if we had to start it all over,</v>

1475
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:55.430
<v Speaker 1>let's say some cataclysm happens,</v>

1476
00:40:55.431 --> 00:40:56.780
<v Speaker 1>economic collapse happens,</v>

1477
00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 1>a situation where like minded people who were able to before it happens.</v>

1478
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:00.801
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

1479
00:41:00.801 --> 00:41:01.310
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1480
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:01.670
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1481
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.920
<v Speaker 1>we got to scope out in North Dakota.</v>

1482
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.240
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be our spot.</v>

1483
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's go there.</v>

1484
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Is that the only way to do it or is it possible that the way to do it is to not</v>

1485
00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:12.350
<v Speaker 1>have everything completely fall apart,</v>

1486
00:41:12.351 --> 00:41:14.510
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's sort of come to some sort of an understanding?</v>

1487
00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I would much rather have that absolutely.</v>

1488
00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can ease into a second economy by starting off slowly.</v>

1489
00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to use the entire un,</v>

1490
00:41:24.171 --> 00:41:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1491
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:24.711
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1492
00:41:24.711 --> 00:41:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to use US currency.</v>

1493
00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can have an alternative currency that we all agreed to.</v>

1494
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:31.340
<v Speaker 1>They tried that in the US,</v>

1495
00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.700
<v Speaker 1>the Austrian town of [inaudible] during the Great Depression,</v>

1496
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I think 1932.</v>

1497
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's a pretty interesting story.</v>

1498
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:37.541
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1499
00:41:37.541 --> 00:41:39.290
<v Speaker 1>the currency had had two features,</v>

1500
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 1>one that it was commodities backed,</v>

1501
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't just backed by gold,</v>

1502
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 1>which is one way to do it.</v>

1503
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with just the gold back is your,</v>

1504
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 1>that's contingent on people actually Viking Goldstone then one and goal that if</v>

1505
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:53.840
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to wake up eventually the fuck is this gold.</v>

1506
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.890
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat it.</v>

1507
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.371
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1508
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:56.620
<v Speaker 1>you can't kill anybody with it.</v>

1509
00:41:56.621 --> 00:41:57.454
<v Speaker 1>Make Hammers.</v>

1510
00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:57.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1511
00:41:57.701 --> 00:41:59.150
<v Speaker 1>So you make a catapult,</v>

1512
00:41:59.170 --> 00:41:59.420
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1513
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.260
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta I mean,</v>

1514
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:01.094
<v Speaker 1>obviously go,</v>

1515
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:02.380
<v Speaker 1>it'd be,</v>

1516
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:02.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1517
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:03.560
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a heavy something,</v>

1518
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 1>but a no good weapon.</v>

1519
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 1>If you could catapult a bowl of giant gold ball,</v>

1520
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.321
<v Speaker 1>fuck you up,</v>

1521
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:09.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1522
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It was what it cost.</v>

1523
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.451
<v Speaker 1>Ironic.</v>

1524
00:42:11.451 --> 00:42:12.284
<v Speaker 1>Way To die.</v>

1525
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1526
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole story about the Zechariah stitching story about why gold was</v>

1527
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 1>valuable to ancient humans.</v>

1528
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1529
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.710
<v Speaker 1>He believes that the Ammo knocky who created the human out of,</v>

1530
00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:23.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1531
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1532
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.230
<v Speaker 1>the lower hominid and the alien genetics would,</v>

1533
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 1>they needed us to mine for gold because they needed gold and massive amounts to</v>

1534
00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 1>suspend in their atmosphere to protect their atmosphere.</v>

1535
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.230
<v Speaker 1>It sounds completely ridiculous,</v>

1536
00:42:36.231 --> 00:42:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but when you really go back to like how long people have been using gold and</v>

1537
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.770
<v Speaker 1>they were like nomads man.</v>

1538
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:43.401
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>

1539
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:45.620
<v Speaker 1>what did you give a fuck about this little shiny,</v>

1540
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:46.521
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

1541
00:42:46.521 --> 00:42:49.160
<v Speaker 1>soft metal that you can't even make a tool out of owl?</v>

1542
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 1>This Huxley has a different theory that I think is actually pretty interesting</v>

1543
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:52.431
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

1544
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 1>He says that the reason people like gold is cause it approximates some of the</v>

1545
00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:00.290
<v Speaker 1>shiny visions that you see under the psychedelic or mystic experience.</v>

1546
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's the reason why we like gems.</v>

1547
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the reasons why we like gold.</v>

1548
00:43:03.441 --> 00:43:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean now metal is everywhere.</v>

1549
00:43:04.911 --> 00:43:05.541
<v Speaker 1>It's ubiquitous.</v>

1550
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:09.620
<v Speaker 1>But back then that was the only shiny shit that you found in the earth was metal</v>

1551
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:10.580
<v Speaker 1>that you mind right now.</v>

1552
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:11.500
<v Speaker 1>We mass produce it.</v>

1553
00:43:11.501 --> 00:43:12.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that you know,</v>

1554
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.510
<v Speaker 1>mystical are beholding anymore,</v>

1555
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.740
<v Speaker 1>but he says,</v>

1556
00:43:15.741 --> 00:43:15.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1557
00:43:15.921 --> 00:43:16.191
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1558
00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 1>why are we digging in the dirt to find these shiny pebbles still?</v>

1559
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 1>And he says it's because when you're on these kinds of mescaline or DMT or are</v>

1560
00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 1>these other experiences,</v>

1561
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:27.410
<v Speaker 1>you see these multifaceted,</v>

1562
00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:30.330
<v Speaker 1>colors and lights and shine.</v>

1564
00:43:30.331 --> 00:43:30.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1565
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.480
<v Speaker 1>different kind of makes sense to me.</v>

1566
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:37.481
<v Speaker 1>But many more people have gotten into diamonds and rubies then have had</v>

1567
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences.</v>

1568
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:39.261
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1569
00:43:39.261 --> 00:43:39.861
<v Speaker 1>But we're all,</v>

1570
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but we all know some knowledge of that realm,</v>

1571
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1572
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:44.001
<v Speaker 1>and that's his,</v>

1573
00:43:44.001 --> 00:43:44.660
<v Speaker 1>that's his idea.</v>

1574
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:49.350
<v Speaker 1>His concept is that your mind is just a filter and it symbolizes this,</v>

1575
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.640
<v Speaker 1>the things that you see so that you can walk around and you do the normal daily</v>

1576
00:43:52.641 --> 00:43:53.210
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1577
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.500
<v Speaker 1>But when you remove that filter,</v>

1578
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:57.140
<v Speaker 1>like through psychedelics or through other different methods,</v>

1579
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 1>some of that starts to peer through and you see the colors in the way that they</v>

1580
00:44:01.191 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 1>are in the void and the different aspects outside of our physical confines.</v>

1581
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:07.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's so mystical about them.</v>

1582
00:44:07.251 --> 00:44:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we seek that.</v>

1583
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Even if we haven't seen it in psychedelics,</v>

1584
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.361
<v Speaker 1>we know it.</v>

1585
00:44:11.361 --> 00:44:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of like,</v>

1586
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1587
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.820
<v Speaker 1>part of our soul and knowledge or at least part of the collective mind at large.</v>

1588
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1589
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:18.410
<v Speaker 1>everyone's had a dream.</v>

1590
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Any dream state is just,</v>

1591
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 1>might as well be a psychedelic experience.</v>

1592
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:23.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1593
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:25.860
<v Speaker 1>how many times have dream states just been like,</v>

1594
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.470
<v Speaker 1>you're involved in something that is just completely ridiculous.</v>

1596
00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense and you're just kinda going with it,</v>

1597
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:32.670
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1598
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.851
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1599
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:33.231
<v Speaker 5>that's all.</v>

1600
00:44:33.231 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 5>I got a lot of like really nutty,</v>

1601
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:35.221
<v Speaker 5>crazy dreams,</v>

1602
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1603
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:35.701
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1604
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:36.210
<v Speaker 5>that is a,</v>

1605
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 5>like a second dog experience and most likely even caused by psychedelic</v>

1606
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:41.790
<v Speaker 5>compounds in the brain.</v>

1607
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1608
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.580
<v Speaker 5>they've don't totally understand how that works,</v>

1609
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1610
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 5>They don't totally understand like why dimethyltryptamine is in your brain and</v>

1611
00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 5>five methoxy dimethyltryptamine and when is it actually released?</v>

1612
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:53.761
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1613
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:57.830
<v Speaker 5>there's like theories that it's released in periods of high stress and there's</v>

1614
00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.250
<v Speaker 5>something like the anecdotal evidence,</v>

1615
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.930
<v Speaker 5>but they really have to develop these,</v>

1616
00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1617
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 5>much more,</v>

1618
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:02.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1619
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.780
<v Speaker 5>sensitive ways of determining like when the actual DMT is released during</v>

1620
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 5>various stages of human activity.</v>

1621
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.653
<v Speaker 5>Because right now,</v>

1622
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.561
<v Speaker 5>from what I understand,</v>

1623
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:13.290
<v Speaker 5>one of the only ways to find out is when someone dies,</v>

1624
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.210
<v Speaker 5>like does DMT flood the brain when they die?</v>

1625
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:19.350
<v Speaker 5>Well you have to like get in there like within seconds after they're dead and</v>

1626
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 5>measure that shit.</v>

1627
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:20.641
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1628
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:21.040
<v Speaker 5>within,</v>

1629
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:21.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1630
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you,</v>

1631
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 5>your body processes,</v>

1632
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.360
<v Speaker 5>it's 10 15 minutes and you're back to baseline.</v>

1633
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:27.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

1634
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.990
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1635
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.490
<v Speaker 5>it's a really quick experience.</v>

1636
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:30.990
<v Speaker 5>So like when someone dies,</v>

1637
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 5>if they get that blast,</v>

1638
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:33.690
<v Speaker 5>if that's what happens and you know,</v>

1639
00:45:33.691 --> 00:45:37.170
<v Speaker 5>you have a psychedelic trip that like whether it eases your,</v>

1640
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:37.501
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1641
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:41.220
<v Speaker 5>your departure from the earth or whether it opens up some fucking gateway to</v>

1642
00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:42.630
<v Speaker 5>something in nature that's next,</v>

1643
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:43.531
<v Speaker 5>whatever the hell it is,</v>

1644
00:45:43.531 --> 00:45:45.090
<v Speaker 5>it's gone pretty good damn quickly.</v>

1645
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 5>It's Poof,</v>

1646
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:46.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1647
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Speaker 5>it's there and it's not,</v>

1648
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 5>so they would have to like open your fucking head up real quick and get to that</v>

1649
00:45:51.301 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 5>gland and then start testing.</v>

1650
00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:53.660
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1651
00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.940
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe there's,</v>

1652
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.100
<v Speaker 4>there's something to it obviously,</v>

1653
00:45:56.101 --> 00:45:56.751
<v Speaker 4>but what is it?</v>

1654
00:45:56.751 --> 00:45:57.584
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1655
00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.793
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1656
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.970
<v Speaker 4>I spent a long time telling that story about the,</v>

1657
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:02.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1658
00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:02.660
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1659
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.790
<v Speaker 4>the jungle when I was down there and taking Iowasca.</v>

1660
00:46:04.791 --> 00:46:07.610
<v Speaker 4>And since then I had a very deep,</v>

1661
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1662
00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:08.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1663
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.110
<v Speaker 4>silicide been experience and in contrast and,</v>

1664
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:12.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1665
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.760
<v Speaker 4>there's something particular about the DMT molecule that I'm convinced that's</v>

1666
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:18.800
<v Speaker 4>transcend area to what,</v>

1667
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:19.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1668
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.530
<v Speaker 4>in the framework of the jungle where I was when I was there,</v>

1669
00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:22.364
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1670
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1671
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.690
<v Speaker 4>causes you to go to different dimensions than even a suicide and trip.</v>

1672
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.440
<v Speaker 4>I felt,</v>

1673
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:32.180
<v Speaker 4>I felt like there was the DMT molecule is some form of gateway that opens doors</v>

1674
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.740
<v Speaker 4>that you can't even get,</v>

1675
00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1676
00:46:34.101 --> 00:46:36.320
<v Speaker 4>with other energy medicine,</v>

1677
00:46:36.321 --> 00:46:37.460
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive compounds.</v>

1678
00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.250
<v Speaker 4>There's something particularly special about that.</v>

1679
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.020
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1680
00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:41.541
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't,</v>

1681
00:46:41.541 --> 00:46:43.250
<v Speaker 4>couldn't help but feel that overwhelming feeling.</v>

1682
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I actually was able to,</v>

1683
00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.950
<v Speaker 4>I saw a lot of the same kind of figures and a lot of things like trying to pull</v>

1684
00:46:48.951 --> 00:46:49.760
<v Speaker 4>me up and like,</v>

1685
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.900
<v Speaker 4>that was the large part of my vision was these reaching down in and trying to</v>

1686
00:46:53.901 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 4>pull me up into these higher levels.</v>

1687
00:46:55.551 --> 00:46:55.971
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>

1688
00:46:55.971 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 4>the fuel wasn't there.</v>

1689
00:46:56.991 --> 00:46:57.824
<v Speaker 4>Like I couldn't,</v>

1690
00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.480
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't open that door,</v>

1691
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:01.580
<v Speaker 4>the same door that I went through back in the jungle.</v>

1692
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:04.460
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that has something to do with the sham and maybe it has to do with the</v>

1693
00:47:04.461 --> 00:47:04.911
<v Speaker 4>other things,</v>

1694
00:47:04.911 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 4>but I think it has to do with totally different compound,</v>

1695
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:08.540
<v Speaker 4>totally different compounds.</v>

1696
00:47:08.541 --> 00:47:10.430
<v Speaker 4>So each one has their own specialist.</v>

1697
00:47:10.431 --> 00:47:13.190
<v Speaker 4>I think that is a part of the compound of psilocybin.</v>

1698
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.090
<v Speaker 4>I think nn dimethyltryptamine is actually like a part of it.</v>

1699
00:47:17.091 --> 00:47:21.620
<v Speaker 4>I think it's something like for Fox four [inaudible] and end dimethyltryptamine</v>

1700
00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:21.861
<v Speaker 4>it's so,</v>

1701
00:47:21.861 --> 00:47:25.430
<v Speaker 4>it's very closely related it and it certainly is,</v>

1702
00:47:25.431 --> 00:47:26.264
<v Speaker 4>but there was,</v>

1703
00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know for whatever reason there was some,</v>

1704
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:29.023
<v Speaker 4>some others,</v>

1705
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>

1706
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 5>How much did you have?</v>

1707
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 5>It was probably two and a half grams maybe since he left side.</v>

1708
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.400
<v Speaker 5>But it was really,</v>

1709
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1710
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:38.921
<v Speaker 5>you got silly.</v>

1711
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:39.521
<v Speaker 5>That's not enough.</v>

1712
00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:40.360
<v Speaker 5>You need five.</v>

1713
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 5>Five is the magic number.</v>

1714
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1715
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.450
<v Speaker 5>But if I've taken,</v>

1716
00:47:43.451 --> 00:47:44.400
<v Speaker 5>I've taken a good amount of,</v>

1717
00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 5>Brian did like seven recently and by mistake the world disappeared on him for a</v>

1718
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:49.624
<v Speaker 5>little while.</v>

1719
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1720
00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.360
<v Speaker 5>There's different situations cause different,</v>

1721
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:52.811
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

1722
00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1723
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:53.741
<v Speaker 5>different results.</v>

1724
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:54.910
<v Speaker 5>But it's a pretty remarkable,</v>

1725
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:57.970
<v Speaker 5>I haven't done DMT in several years and uh,</v>

1726
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.870
<v Speaker 5>it's been a couple because the last time I did it was the only time ever,</v>

1727
00:48:01.871 --> 00:48:02.231
<v Speaker 5>ever,</v>

1728
00:48:02.231 --> 00:48:02.411
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1729
00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 5>I've had a lot of bunch of psychedelic experiences,</v>

1730
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:09.340
<v Speaker 5>but the last time I did DMT was the only time where I ever was not sure what was</v>

1731
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:11.170
<v Speaker 5>real and what was,</v>

1732
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:15.340
<v Speaker 5>what was imagination and fantasy for about two weeks.</v>

1733
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:16.660
<v Speaker 5>For about two weeks.</v>

1734
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.220
<v Speaker 5>The world itself,</v>

1735
00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:22.210
<v Speaker 5>like as I was driving seemed malleable and like,</v>

1736
00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 5>it seemed like if I concentrated on car accidents,</v>

1737
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:25.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1738
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:27.880
<v Speaker 5>I might wind up in a fucking car accident,</v>

1739
00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:28.331
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1740
00:48:28.331 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 5>if I concentrate on it raining out,</v>

1741
00:48:29.801 --> 00:48:30.491
<v Speaker 5>it might rain out.</v>

1742
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:31.324
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1743
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 5>it sounded completely ridiculous and I didn't believe that I could make anything</v>

1744
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:35.860
<v Speaker 5>happen with my mind at a,</v>

1745
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:37.150
<v Speaker 5>by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1746
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:40.600
<v Speaker 5>But what I also didn't believe was that reality was 100% real.</v>

1747
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.900
<v Speaker 5>Because what happens when you have a real mind blowing fucking trip is first of</v>

1748
00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:48.311
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

1749
00:48:48.311 --> 00:48:51.390
<v Speaker 5>you get terrified that it's that close that Oh,</v>

1750
00:48:51.391 --> 00:48:52.900
<v Speaker 5>you have to do is smoke that stuff.</v>

1751
00:48:52.901 --> 00:48:53.920
<v Speaker 5>And it's right there.</v>

1752
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 5>I can get there in 30 seconds,</v>

1753
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 5>a minute and I get to some impossible place.</v>

1754
00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:59.920
<v Speaker 5>Like if you could,</v>

1755
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:05.100
<v Speaker 5>if you had the journey across the earth to get to some spot in Tibet where you,</v>

1756
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:05.531
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1757
00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 5>you look into the DMT realm,</v>

1758
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:11.620
<v Speaker 5>you know you have to climb through a fucking cave and repel and you camp out</v>

1759
00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 5>there and it takes days and some people die like climbing Mt.</v>

1760
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:15.250
<v Speaker 5>Everest.</v>

1761
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:16.180
<v Speaker 5>But if you get there,</v>

1762
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:17.200
<v Speaker 5>if you get to that spot,</v>

1763
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.210
<v Speaker 5>you look out and you see God,</v>

1764
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.540
<v Speaker 5>you look out and you see the most purest wisdom,</v>

1765
00:49:22.541 --> 00:49:22.970
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1766
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:23.220
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1767
00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:23.461
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1768
00:49:23.461 --> 00:49:25.420
<v Speaker 5>the most knowledgeable love,</v>

1769
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:28.570
<v Speaker 5>the most sympathetic voice,</v>

1770
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:32.770
<v Speaker 5>the most knowledge that you could ever possibly imagine coming from something in</v>

1771
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.900
<v Speaker 5>a way that's not even language,</v>

1772
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:36.760
<v Speaker 5>like very difficult to describe,</v>

1773
00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:39.370
<v Speaker 5>but so intense and humbling man.</v>

1774
00:49:39.371 --> 00:49:40.120
<v Speaker 5>People would,</v>

1775
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.920
<v Speaker 5>they would take trips to go to that.</v>

1776
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:42.491
<v Speaker 5>They would,</v>

1777
00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:43.180
<v Speaker 5>it would be,</v>

1778
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:43.871
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1779
00:49:43.871 --> 00:49:45.640
<v Speaker 5>Like if there was like a guy that you could go to,</v>

1780
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:46.780
<v Speaker 5>they would give you this feeling.</v>

1781
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.610
<v Speaker 5>But essentially there is,</v>

1782
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:48.941
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

1783
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:49.860
<v Speaker 5>it's if,</v>

1784
00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:50.940
<v Speaker 5>if everyone knew,</v>

1785
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 5>if it was legal and you could go to places where they could prescribe it,</v>

1786
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:54.671
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

1787
00:49:54.671 --> 00:49:55.930
<v Speaker 5>would that change the world?</v>

1788
00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:56.171
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1789
00:49:56.171 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 5>would that change the world?</v>

1790
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:58.780
<v Speaker 5>That changed the fucking,</v>

1791
00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.740
<v Speaker 5>if you seen,</v>

1792
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 5>if people have seen what you've seen,</v>

1793
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.420
<v Speaker 5>could you imagine there are totally different,</v>

1794
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 5>but if you brought that up,</v>

1795
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 5>people say like,</v>

1796
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 5>you're a fucking crazy person.</v>

1797
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:08.621
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you doing?</v>

1798
00:50:08.621 --> 00:50:10.360
<v Speaker 5>You got to give people drugs,</v>

1799
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.460
<v Speaker 5>the hallucinations and they're going to,</v>

1800
00:50:12.461 --> 00:50:12.611
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1801
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 5>that's gonna make them a better person while the driving another,</v>

1802
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:16.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1803
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:20.050
<v Speaker 5>theory from Huxley is that the driving force behind all religion was seeking</v>

1804
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:20.650
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1805
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.330
<v Speaker 5>that kind of transcendental place.</v>

1806
00:50:22.331 --> 00:50:24.880
<v Speaker 5>And people got to it through a variety of different means.</v>

1807
00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:25.510
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

1808
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.691
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1809
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 5>all the chanting that you find in these mystical traditions</v>

1810
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.450
<v Speaker 1>that raises the CO2 level because you end up breathing out more than you breathe</v>

1811
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:33.400
<v Speaker 1>in when you're doing it.</v>

1812
00:50:33.401 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a highly trained singer,</v>

1813
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:35.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1814
00:50:35.211 --> 00:50:35.721
<v Speaker 1>and your expert.</v>

1815
00:50:35.721 --> 00:50:39.440
<v Speaker 1>But most of these ecstatic chanting and yelling and all that is designed to</v>

1816
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:42.140
<v Speaker 1>raise that co two level breathe out more than you breathe in.</v>

1817
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:43.190
<v Speaker 1>How's that even possible?</v>

1818
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.121
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

1819
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:44.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1820
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:46.580
<v Speaker 1>just in a normal bread.</v>

1821
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 1>All sides as well.</v>

1822
00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Just cause no more [inaudible] it's like a rapper made that one of the</v>

1823
00:50:59.321 --> 00:51:02.870
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] dick hole fills up my lungs from the bottom.</v>

1824
00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:03.704
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>

1825
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.963
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>

1826
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:05.790
<v Speaker 1>that's how he put it.</v>

1827
00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:06.680
<v Speaker 1>I there's some,</v>

1828
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 1>there's some ways really shit like that man.</v>

1829
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It drives me nuts,</v>

1830
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1831
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 1>and then you repeated accidentally not,</v>

1832
00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:15.120
<v Speaker 1>not thinking about it and then you know someone else has to come along.</v>

1833
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.861
<v Speaker 1>Go wait a minute man,</v>

1834
00:51:15.861 --> 00:51:16.820
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did you just say?</v>

1835
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.661
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd go,</v>

1836
00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:17.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1837
00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:19.070
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did I just say?</v>

1838
00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:19.551
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

1839
00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm just repeating some stupid shit.</v>

1840
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me in martial arts I was always a problem.</v>

1841
00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:25.840
<v Speaker 1>There's always going,</v>

1842
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:27.620
<v Speaker 1>could be the wrong way to go about it.</v>

1843
00:51:27.621 --> 00:51:30.660
<v Speaker 1>But either either case he's saying that was one mile example of raising the co</v>

1844
00:51:30.661 --> 00:51:31.131
<v Speaker 1>two levels.</v>

1845
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:32.360
<v Speaker 1>There are certain breathing exercises.</v>

1846
00:51:32.361 --> 00:51:33.081
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly do that.</v>

1847
00:51:33.081 --> 00:51:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So that does something to the air.</v>

1848
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:39.470
<v Speaker 1>It's more carbon dioxide that ends up reducing that what he calls the cerebral</v>

1849
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:40.281
<v Speaker 1>reducing valve.</v>

1850
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:43.100
<v Speaker 1>That is what keeps everything symbolized because that vision,</v>

1851
00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:43.851
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about,</v>

1852
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 1>you're saying it's right there.</v>

1853
00:51:44.781 --> 00:51:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It's right there because it's around us all the time.</v>

1854
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's why when you take something or smoked Dmt,</v>

1855
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.270
<v Speaker 1>you get to it instantly.</v>

1856
00:51:50.271 --> 00:51:52.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to travel to it cause it's there all the time.</v>

1857
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.453
<v Speaker 1>The only thing.</v>

1858
00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:58.560
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it possible that it's also perturbing your mind and giving your mind</v>

1859
00:51:59.200 --> 00:51:59.440
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1860
00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.580
<v Speaker 1>an excess of chemicals to deal with.</v>

1861
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 1>So it distorts your visual perception of the world.</v>

1862
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems to me that there you have to look at every single possibility</v>

1863
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 1>and you have to look at the possibility that if the brain produces all these</v>

1864
00:52:12.891 --> 00:52:17.150
<v Speaker 1>different chemicals at varying doses and we believe that it varies the doses</v>

1865
00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.560
<v Speaker 1>based on stress levels.</v>

1866
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.951
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1867
00:52:18.951 --> 00:52:20.210
<v Speaker 1>There might be something to that.</v>

1868
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.180
<v Speaker 1>There might be something to this possibility that there is a gateway,</v>

1869
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a possibility that you just getting fucked up on some wacky</v>

1870
00:52:26.871 --> 00:52:28.760
<v Speaker 1>drug and seeing some nutty shit.</v>

1871
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's so humbling because you don't expect it,</v>

1872
00:52:31.071 --> 00:52:32.210
<v Speaker 1>that when you come back,</v>

1873
00:52:32.211 --> 00:52:34.580
<v Speaker 1>you have like all these rationalizations and all this,</v>

1874
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:35.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1875
00:52:35.101 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 1>this either way,</v>

1876
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 1>if you believe that it can make you a great person,</v>

1877
00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:40.511
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1878
00:52:40.511 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1879
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:41.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1880
00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.590
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of religions,</v>

1881
00:52:42.591 --> 00:52:42.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1882
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong Christianity.</v>

1883
00:52:44.811 --> 00:52:45.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1884
00:52:45.051 --> 00:52:45.801
<v Speaker 1>if it works for you,</v>

1885
00:52:45.801 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it works for you.</v>

1886
00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I know people that it works for them and it actually does make them a better</v>

1887
00:52:48.951 --> 00:52:49.760
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1888
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.240
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1889
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:50.541
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1890
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 1>and if you believe in it,</v>

1891
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 1>it can work.</v>

1892
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Speaker 1>It can make you a better person,</v>

1893
00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1894
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.550
<v Speaker 1>And if you believe that your psychedelic experience was truly connecting with</v>

1895
00:52:58.551 --> 00:52:59.510
<v Speaker 1>the divine well,</v>

1896
00:52:59.511 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 1>that can make you a better person.</v>

1897
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 1>But it could also be your system is just over flooded by some shit that's not</v>

1898
00:53:05.361 --> 00:53:08.000
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be there and rocket fuel doses.</v>

1899
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.590
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a wash.</v>

1900
00:53:09.591 --> 00:53:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And like usually when it gets a sip of,</v>

1901
00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it's at the bottom of a river of,</v>

1902
00:53:13.731 --> 00:53:14.300
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1903
00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:14.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1904
00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:17.000
<v Speaker 1>this crazy fucking fluid.</v>

1905
00:53:17.001 --> 00:53:17.271
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1906
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that's us actually,</v>

1907
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I think a more accepted theory than houses,</v>

1908
00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 1>which is that you're actually taking away your filter instead of adding</v>

1909
00:53:24.081 --> 00:53:24.711
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

1910
00:53:24.711 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 1>And he on to talk about,</v>

1911
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:26.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1912
00:53:26.521 --> 00:53:30.200
<v Speaker 4>probably more convincing arguments than the chanting argument basically that um,</v>

1913
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.610
<v Speaker 4>there was a famous st that the curate to ours,</v>

1914
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:33.121
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1915
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1916
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:37.170
<v Speaker 4>this French saint and he used to say that when he would flagellate himself,</v>

1917
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:40.690
<v Speaker 4>God could deny him nothing and he would have access to that Ms. Dot.</v>

1918
00:53:40.691 --> 00:53:41.700
<v Speaker 4>Was about popular thing.</v>

1919
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:41.841
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1920
00:53:41.841 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1921
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.610
<v Speaker 4>People don't know that means you're beat the fuck out of yourself.</v>

1922
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:45.271
<v Speaker 4>So you would do it,</v>

1923
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:45.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1924
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 4>so these long periods and pull a fart out or something.</v>

1925
00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.111
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1926
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:49.831
<v Speaker 4>flatulence.</v>

1927
00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:54.830
<v Speaker 4>You know flagellate it's like they use like a little whip did either nodded</v>

1928
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.360
<v Speaker 4>leather or actual barbs on it and it would cause they're back to bleed when he</v>

1929
00:53:58.361 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 4>was tearing themselves apart and the era before soap that would cause,</v>

1930
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:02.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1931
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:05.340
<v Speaker 4>first of all the actual beating would cause a lot of adrenaline to rush through</v>

1932
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 4>your body and Histamines to rush through your body as,</v>

1933
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 4>as this was going on,</v>

1934
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:11.790
<v Speaker 4>that in combination with the fasting that was very popular,</v>

1935
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:14.430
<v Speaker 4>obviously lent winter was kind of a forced fast.</v>

1936
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 4>And with the flagellation that caused,</v>

1937
00:54:16.621 --> 00:54:16.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1938
00:54:16.831 --> 00:54:17.840
<v Speaker 4>an error before soap,</v>

1939
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:19.560
<v Speaker 4>there's would almost always fester.</v>

1940
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.290
<v Speaker 4>So there would be all these decomposing protein in your system.</v>

1941
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 4>It would basically reduce your,</v>

1942
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:25.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1943
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 4>your cerebral capacity to the point where you could enter psychedelic trance</v>

1944
00:54:29.371 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 4>states and actually commune,</v>

1945
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:31.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1946
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.800
<v Speaker 4>with God underneath your,</v>

1947
00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.560
<v Speaker 4>oh Whoa,</v>

1948
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:33.921
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

1949
00:54:33.921 --> 00:54:34.231
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

1950
00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:35.970
<v Speaker 4>break that shit down again.</v>

1951
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.940
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying because they were dirty,</v>

1952
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:43.140
<v Speaker 4>stinky people that didn't wash that good so they didn't like scrub off the</v>

1953
00:54:43.141 --> 00:54:47.250
<v Speaker 4>outside layer of skin that somehow the penetrating that would change their</v>

1954
00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:48.084
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

1955
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1956
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.390
<v Speaker 4>this is in combination with a variety of things.</v>

1957
00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:54.840
<v Speaker 4>So basically at the brain needs vitamins and nutrients to function.</v>

1958
00:54:54.841 --> 00:54:55.231
<v Speaker 4>Normally,</v>

1959
00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:55.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1960
00:54:55.411 --> 00:54:57.210
<v Speaker 4>you go through these long periods of fasting.</v>

1961
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.520
<v Speaker 4>That was one way to reach the mystical experience.</v>

1962
00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:00.720
<v Speaker 4>40 days of fasting,</v>

1963
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.510
<v Speaker 4>you're basically denying your brain of all the glucose,</v>

1964
00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.030
<v Speaker 4>all the vitamins necessary to function optimally.</v>

1965
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:08.190
<v Speaker 4>And that's when a lot of these people had visions.</v>

1966
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:11.700
<v Speaker 4>While the reason they had visions according to Huxley was because the brain was</v>

1967
00:55:11.701 --> 00:55:12.600
<v Speaker 4>just not funk,</v>

1968
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 4>be able to function as its normal symbolizing cerebral nature that it does to</v>

1969
00:55:17.431 --> 00:55:18.330
<v Speaker 4>make us all survive.</v>

1970
00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 4>So you were able to take in more of the capital m mind at large,</v>

1971
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:25.170
<v Speaker 4>which we call the collective now because of the lack of vitamins.</v>

1972
00:55:25.171 --> 00:55:29.070
<v Speaker 4>And he was saying also the flagellation usually used in conjunction with that,</v>

1973
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:29.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1974
00:55:29.641 --> 00:55:33.630
<v Speaker 4>so you got your brain basically running on very little little,</v>

1975
00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:33.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1976
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.720
<v Speaker 4>just trying to hang in there and then you beat yourself.</v>

1977
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.100
<v Speaker 4>And then at that point,</v>

1978
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:38.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1979
00:55:38.461 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 4>you got,</v>

1980
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:39.810
<v Speaker 4>you got adrenaline,</v>

1981
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 4>you got histamines,</v>

1982
00:55:41.011 --> 00:55:44.910
<v Speaker 4>and then you got festering wounds on your back that are causing more,</v>

1983
00:55:44.911 --> 00:55:45.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1984
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:46.830
<v Speaker 4>more kind of toxins to your brain.</v>

1985
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 4>So at that point your brain just kind of shuts off and it allows more of that</v>

1986
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 4>mystical experience to come through.</v>

1987
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:52.861
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1988
00:55:52.861 --> 00:55:56.880
<v Speaker 4>So you beat the fuck out of yourself to achieve enlightenment after you starve</v>

1989
00:55:56.881 --> 00:55:59.160
<v Speaker 4>yourself for a month or so.</v>

1990
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Can you mention farts before?</v>

1991
00:56:00.421 --> 00:56:00.810
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1992
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:01.211
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

1993
00:56:01.211 --> 00:56:01.981
<v Speaker 4>but that's how,</v>

1994
00:56:01.981 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 4>that's how important seeking that mystical experience was.</v>

1995
00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:06.061
<v Speaker 4>These people,</v>

1996
00:56:06.061 --> 00:56:06.990
<v Speaker 4>they were willing to do that.</v>

1997
00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.550
<v Speaker 4>And how would they find out about it though?</v>

1998
00:56:08.551 --> 00:56:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Unless someone wants to meet someone and then there's someone said,</v>

1999
00:56:11.131 --> 00:56:12.180
<v Speaker 4>thank you for starving,</v>

2000
00:56:12.181 --> 00:56:15.660
<v Speaker 4>maybe beat the fuck out of me because I learned a lot about myself maybe,</v>

2001
00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:15.990
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

2002
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:18.090
<v Speaker 4>well the winter was basically a forced fast.</v>

2003
00:56:18.091 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 4>They had hardly any vitamin or in the winter that they were able to be able to</v>

2004
00:56:21.301 --> 00:56:22.620
<v Speaker 4>store a certain amount of things.</v>

2005
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 4>And then coming off winter was also a time that that caused a lot of these</v>

2006
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:27.334
<v Speaker 4>visions to come.</v>

2007
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.091
<v Speaker 4>And at that point,</v>

2008
00:56:28.091 --> 00:56:28.271
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2009
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:29.960
<v Speaker 4>somebody may be got taken to the whip.</v>

2010
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 4>Whipping was a common,</v>

2011
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 4>was a common way to treat any kind of petty offense.</v>

2012
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 4>Someone gets whipped after 40 after three months of fasting for winter,</v>

2013
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.040
<v Speaker 4>40 days of lent,</v>

2014
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:39.881
<v Speaker 4>and they get whipped.</v>

2015
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 4>They very well may see God and that was his idea.</v>

2016
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:46.420
<v Speaker 4>But he said now at the state that we know about psychedelics,</v>

2017
00:56:46.421 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 4>trying to get to the mystical state through that reason is like,</v>

2018
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2019
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.700
<v Speaker 4>burning the house down to cook a pig.</v>

2020
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2021
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:53.780
<v Speaker 4>it's like you don't need to do that anymore.</v>

2022
00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.910
<v Speaker 4>You can go out and you can find these tools that were placed here on</v>

2023
00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.830
<v Speaker 5>the earth that's get you that experience really amazing.</v>

2024
00:56:59.831 --> 00:57:01.270
<v Speaker 5>And I never heard that before.</v>

2025
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:05.230
<v Speaker 5>I'd never heard that before about the flagellation and starving.</v>

2026
00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 5>It totally makes sense.</v>

2027
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.293
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2028
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 5>it's a crazy a possibility.</v>

2029
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 5>I've always wondered why the fuck they beat the shit on themselves.</v>

2030
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 5>I just figured it's like Jerry Sandusky,</v>

2031
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:15.340
<v Speaker 5>like they hate themselves.</v>

2032
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:15.590
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2033
00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:16.210
<v Speaker 5>to hear.</v>

2034
00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:17.650
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that Jason Dusky said,</v>

2035
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:19.420
<v Speaker 5>and one of the interviews he said he wished he was dead.</v>

2036
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.991
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2037
00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 5>he's talking to this woman.</v>

2038
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:22.270
<v Speaker 5>The woman was asking him like,</v>

2039
00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:24.530
<v Speaker 5>why he touched her son or any sign.</v>

2040
00:57:24.531 --> 00:57:26.590
<v Speaker 5>I didn't mean it to be that way.</v>

2041
00:57:26.591 --> 00:57:27.430
<v Speaker 5>I wish I was dead.</v>

2042
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2043
00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:28.930
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2044
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:29.431
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2045
00:57:29.431 --> 00:57:31.870
<v Speaker 5>like that's like these big horn cells,</v>

2046
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:33.880
<v Speaker 5>whips with fucking Barb's.</v>

2047
00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:35.560
<v Speaker 5>That's a person that hates himself,</v>

2048
00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:35.801
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2049
00:57:35.801 --> 00:57:36.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2050
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.471
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2051
00:57:36.471 --> 00:57:36.920
<v Speaker 4>the guilt,</v>

2052
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.290
<v Speaker 4>the guilt that was fostered by the beliefs and the time,</v>

2053
00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean would cause people to hate themselves.</v>

2054
00:57:41.151 --> 00:57:44.450
<v Speaker 4>They'd have this constant sense of nine guilt that they couldn't get rid of.</v>

2055
00:57:44.451 --> 00:57:45.920
<v Speaker 4>So how do you get rid of guilt?</v>

2056
00:57:45.921 --> 00:57:46.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2057
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:48.440
<v Speaker 4>somebody has to punish you if nobody else is going to do it.</v>

2058
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.530
<v Speaker 5>Punish yourself.</v>

2059
00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:54.530
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it amazing how the human mind can be programmed like that with religion or</v>

2060
00:57:55.321 --> 00:57:56.460
<v Speaker 5>with nationalism,</v>

2061
00:57:56.461 --> 00:57:56.671
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2062
00:57:56.671 --> 00:57:59.640
<v Speaker 5>with North Korea or whether it's to fucking inquisition.</v>

2063
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:00.721
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing,</v>

2064
00:58:00.721 --> 00:58:01.320
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>

2065
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:05.280
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing the human beings can all fall into a pattern.</v>

2066
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:09.810
<v Speaker 5>The pattern just has to be really clear and enforced and scare the fuck out of a</v>

2067
00:58:09.811 --> 00:58:10.291
<v Speaker 5>few people.</v>

2068
00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:13.350
<v Speaker 5>While it's being enforced and then boom,</v>

2069
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:13.741
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2070
00:58:13.741 --> 00:58:14.670
<v Speaker 5>it spreads,</v>

2071
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:15.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2072
00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:17.190
<v Speaker 5>it's really amazing.</v>

2073
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:17.820
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2074
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:19.050
<v Speaker 5>we're so weird,</v>

2075
00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:19.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2076
00:58:19.681 --> 00:58:22.590
<v Speaker 5>we're capable of such brilliance and such beauty,</v>

2077
00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:25.170
<v Speaker 5>but we're also so fucking dumb.</v>

2078
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.960
<v Speaker 5>We're so easy to trick.</v>

2079
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:31.890
<v Speaker 5>Or some of them were so easy to program and,</v>

2080
00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:32.131
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2081
00:58:32.131 --> 00:58:35.130
<v Speaker 5>and make act completely ridiculous and absurd.</v>

2082
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.300
<v Speaker 5>What's so easy?</v>

2083
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:37.500
<v Speaker 5>Well I think there's,</v>

2084
00:58:37.501 --> 00:58:39.060
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple of things that are going on there.</v>

2085
00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:43.740
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a certain amount of people who are very easily programmable and</v>

2086
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:44.180
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

2087
00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:45.600
<v Speaker 5>I've read some figures,</v>

2088
00:58:45.601 --> 00:58:48.120
<v Speaker 5>some estimations that there's 20% of the population,</v>

2089
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:48.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2090
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.960
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2091
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.270
<v Speaker 5>like a hypnotist who brings a bunch of people up on stage.</v>

2092
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.250
<v Speaker 5>Those certain people are very,</v>

2093
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:53.521
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2094
00:58:53.521 --> 00:58:57.210
<v Speaker 5>very susceptible to suggestion was to bring this up because people think I'm a</v>

2095
00:58:57.211 --> 00:58:57.780
<v Speaker 5>dummy.</v>

2096
00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.610
<v Speaker 5>I've got a bunch of tweets from people,</v>

2097
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.271
<v Speaker 5>the real leg,</v>

2098
00:59:00.271 --> 00:59:00.781
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

2099
00:59:00.781 --> 00:59:02.850
<v Speaker 5>Stupid comedy hypnotist aren't real.</v>

2100
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:04.770
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't think they're real.</v>

2101
00:59:04.771 --> 00:59:05.491
<v Speaker 5>Cause guess what?</v>

2102
00:59:05.491 --> 00:59:06.990
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think they're real either.</v>

2103
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.120
<v Speaker 5>When I first saw a comedy show,</v>

2104
00:59:09.121 --> 00:59:10.920
<v Speaker 5>it's stitches comedy Club in Boston.</v>

2105
00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.980
<v Speaker 5>I saw Frank Santos to are rated hypnotist.</v>

2106
00:59:13.981 --> 00:59:14.460
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

2107
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.690
<v Speaker 5>this is bullshit.</v>

2108
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.490
<v Speaker 5>This is so fucking stupid.</v>

2109
00:59:17.491 --> 00:59:18.324
<v Speaker 5>This is bullshit.</v>

2110
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:19.650
<v Speaker 5>But it's not bullshit.</v>

2111
00:59:19.651 --> 00:59:20.910
<v Speaker 5>It just wouldn't work on you.</v>

2112
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:21.261
<v Speaker 5>Yu,</v>

2113
00:59:21.261 --> 00:59:22.290
<v Speaker 5>the skeptical person</v>

2114
00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:22.551
<v Speaker 4>that's like,</v>

2115
00:59:22.551 --> 00:59:23.384
<v Speaker 4>this is bullshit.</v>

2116
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Generally you probably fairly intelligent and it's not going to work on you.</v>

2117
00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2118
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 4>But if you're one of those dudes with a nine volt brain,</v>

2119
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:32.030
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people out there like that.</v>

2120
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.950
<v Speaker 4>You can hypnotize them.</v>

2121
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:35.750
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem like it should work.</v>

2122
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 4>It seems completely preposterous to you or to me or to you because you,</v>

2123
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.680
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't be hypnotized like that.</v>

2124
00:59:41.681 --> 00:59:41.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2125
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.860
<v Speaker 4>But to that dude,</v>

2126
00:59:42.861 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely possible and that's amazing.</v>

2127
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:45.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2128
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.550
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like there's people set up around us and we have the cheat codes for</v>

2129
00:59:49.551 --> 00:59:50.060
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

2130
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:50.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2131
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:51.170
<v Speaker 4>and you throw it,</v>

2132
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.501
<v Speaker 4>throw it,</v>

2133
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Speaker 4>throw them into God mode,</v>

2134
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:53.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2135
00:59:53.061 --> 00:59:54.010
<v Speaker 4>like literally,</v>

2136
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.850
<v Speaker 4>literally like people can be hacked.</v>

2137
00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

2138
00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:00.500
<v Speaker 4>And people and people know that had been taking advantage of that.</v>

2139
01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:01.580
<v Speaker 4>So there's that factor.</v>

2140
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:05.420
<v Speaker 4>There's this 20% let's say people that can be basically hypnotizer basically</v>

2141
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.730
<v Speaker 4>walking somnambulists,</v>

2142
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:07.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2143
01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.750
<v Speaker 4>like able to be hypnotized easily.</v>

2144
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 4>Is that a biological thing?</v>

2145
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.391
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

2146
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just the way that their mind works in a certain way.</v>

2147
01:00:13.701 --> 01:00:16.040
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think it's necessarily a lack of intelligence.</v>

2148
01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:19.920
<v Speaker 4>It's just a certain circuitry that their mind works on where they're at,</v>

2149
01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:20.670
<v Speaker 4>that it goes,</v>

2150
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:21.171
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2151
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 4>Definitely the lack of objective reasoning.</v>

2152
01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>

2153
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.373
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2154
01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:28.790
<v Speaker 4>Part of the mind is probably getting steered around for a certain cause that</v>

2155
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 4>hardly rational individual,</v>

2156
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:31.311
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>

2157
01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:32.144
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2158
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 4>their emotional intelligence might be off the charts,</v>

2159
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:34.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2160
01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:39.851
<v Speaker 4>like they might be able to be very insightful as far as their intuition and what</v>

2161
01:00:40.731 --> 01:00:41.361
<v Speaker 4>they're able to see.</v>

2162
01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2163
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:45.740
<v Speaker 4>but certainly there's some critical aspect that they're able to just circumvent</v>

2164
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 4>and shut off completely.</v>

2165
01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2166
01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.231
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

2167
01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 4>that's I think obvious.</v>

2168
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 4>But once you get that majority,</v>

2169
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:55.550
<v Speaker 4>let's say that 20% human beings are naturally creatures,</v>

2170
01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.450
<v Speaker 4>social creatures.</v>

2171
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:58.310
<v Speaker 4>So if you start to see a majority,</v>

2172
01:00:58.311 --> 01:00:58.610
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>

2173
01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 4>if you start to see a bunch of people running,</v>

2174
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2175
01:01:00.921 --> 01:01:03.560
<v Speaker 4>you're going to start jogging the same direction and be like,</v>

2176
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:04.011
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>

2177
01:01:04.011 --> 01:01:05.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'm jogging,</v>

2178
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:07.580
<v Speaker 4>but these people are fucking going and I'm outta here.</v>

2179
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 4>So I think that's part of what happens.</v>

2180
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 4>They get a certain minority,</v>

2181
01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2182
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:12.591
<v Speaker 4>convinced,</v>

2183
01:01:12.591 --> 01:01:13.251
<v Speaker 4>hypnotize,</v>

2184
01:01:13.251 --> 01:01:15.770
<v Speaker 4>basically just some nonsense and then everybody else is like,</v>

2185
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>

2186
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.330
<v Speaker 4>look at all these people.</v>

2187
01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:18.260
<v Speaker 4>They can't all be wrong.</v>

2188
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:19.940
<v Speaker 4>And then they hop on board as well.</v>

2189
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:20.961
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2190
01:01:20.961 --> 01:01:23.720
<v Speaker 4>We have to fix the design of the human body.</v>

2191
01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:24.471
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2192
01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:27.770
<v Speaker 4>I was just saying this on stage for years that we've got to stop making,</v>

2193
01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:30.620
<v Speaker 4>having sex have to do with making babies.</v>

2194
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

2195
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.330
<v Speaker 4>It should be way harder to make babies and it should be based,</v>

2196
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:35.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2197
01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:36.270
<v Speaker 4>on you,</v>

2198
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:38.420
<v Speaker 4>you should have to like do something,</v>

2199
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2200
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:39.710
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

2201
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:40.910
<v Speaker 4>Maybe go do something,</v>

2202
01:01:40.911 --> 01:01:43.790
<v Speaker 4>go somewhere to get to go through a ceremony together and then you make a baby.</v>

2203
01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Horse shoes have to be easier.</v>

2204
01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.910
<v Speaker 4>Like it has to be an APP on your phone.</v>

2205
01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:48.201
<v Speaker 4>That problem.</v>

2206
01:01:48.201 --> 01:01:50.660
<v Speaker 4>The problem with abortion is the abortion idea.</v>

2207
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:52.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like got to catch it quick,</v>

2208
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.350
<v Speaker 4>he catch it quick and it doesn't count.</v>

2209
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:56.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like well are you sure?</v>

2210
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:57.261
<v Speaker 4>Cause it is.</v>

2211
01:01:57.261 --> 01:01:58.020
<v Speaker 4>It is it,</v>

2212
01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.770
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't count or is it like stepping on an ant?</v>

2213
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.131
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2214
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:02.570
<v Speaker 4>if I step on an ant in my house,</v>

2215
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.370
<v Speaker 4>nine times out of 10 I don't even clean it up.</v>

2216
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:05.690
<v Speaker 4>If I step on a mouse,</v>

2217
01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.830
<v Speaker 4>I got to clean it up,</v>

2218
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2219
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.070
<v Speaker 4>And basically if a mouse is a size of an ant,</v>

2220
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:11.090
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't give a fuck.</v>

2221
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:11.691
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2222
01:02:11.691 --> 01:02:11.931
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2223
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:15.350
<v Speaker 4>there's something about when things get bigger that they start becoming real.</v>

2224
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:16.580
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2225
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2226
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a,</v>

2227
01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of holes in that argument.</v>

2228
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.210
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of,</v>

2229
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:25.500
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird sort of an acceptance of what's essentially killing a life.</v>

2230
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:26.011
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2231
01:02:26.011 --> 01:02:26.940
<v Speaker 5>if you let it go,</v>

2232
01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:28.380
<v Speaker 5>it is going to be another person.</v>

2233
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:28.781
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>

2234
01:02:28.781 --> 01:02:29.910
<v Speaker 5>what you decide,</v>

2235
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:32.550
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not saying you shouldn't have the right to choose because you absolutely</v>

2236
01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:32.851
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't.</v>

2237
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:35.040
<v Speaker 5>And I don't want to be the one that tells you what to do with your body.</v>

2238
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:35.971
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong,</v>

2239
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:38.750
<v Speaker 5>but as a philosophical argument of,</v>

2240
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.410
<v Speaker 5>of what it is and when,</v>

2241
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:41.620
<v Speaker 5>when does it start and when,</v>

2242
01:02:41.621 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 5>when is it life,</v>

2243
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2244
01:02:42.811 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2245
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.470
<v Speaker 5>how about we just figured out a way to completely prevent it unless you want it.</v>

2246
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Speaker 5>That seems like much smarter.</v>

2247
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Like we should be doing that to kids at a like a really early age.</v>

2248
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:53.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying we should neuter him,</v>

2249
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:55.350
<v Speaker 5>but we should fucking get them on birth control.</v>

2250
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:56.430
<v Speaker 5>Lickety split,</v>

2251
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.890
<v Speaker 5>you know gummy bear.</v>

2252
01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:58.810
<v Speaker 5>Well Jesus.</v>

2253
01:02:58.830 --> 01:02:59.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2254
01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.270
<v Speaker 5>like give them a chance to get out of high school and keep them,</v>

2255
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2256
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.870
<v Speaker 5>when you're in high school and your bone and your raw dogging it and you're</v>

2257
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:08.250
<v Speaker 5>barely pulling out on time,</v>

2258
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.230
<v Speaker 5>then it's like the best time to make a person.</v>

2259
01:03:10.231 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 5>Like your body's ready to go.</v>

2260
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.010
<v Speaker 5>Your buddies young and fresh and you'd got bitches there.</v>

2261
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:16.830
<v Speaker 5>Eggs are fallen into their socks.</v>

2262
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.251
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2263
01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:18.300
<v Speaker 5>there's so many eggs,</v>

2264
01:03:18.301 --> 01:03:18.570
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2265
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 5>they're ready to drop.</v>

2266
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:24.060
<v Speaker 5>It's so easy to have a baby then and that's just the most ridiculous thing ever.</v>

2267
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:24.481
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2268
01:03:24.481 --> 01:03:25.291
<v Speaker 5>the worst set up,</v>

2269
01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 5>the same way that we were set up back when it was really hard to stay alive.</v>

2270
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.000
<v Speaker 5>We know are our biological setup is set up for back when we didn't have houses,</v>

2271
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:33.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2272
01:03:33.361 --> 01:03:35.190
<v Speaker 5>we were out there with sleeping under the stars.</v>

2273
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 5>One guy had to stay awake with a stick.</v>

2274
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2275
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:40.530
<v Speaker 5>and then we're wondering around chasing after these animals cause we have to</v>

2276
01:03:40.531 --> 01:03:41.370
<v Speaker 5>follow the herd.</v>

2277
01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:42.690
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise we'll starve to death.</v>

2278
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2279
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.060
<v Speaker 5>God damn man.</v>

2280
01:03:45.061 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 5>What a shit design.</v>

2281
01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:46.681
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2282
01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:49.530
<v Speaker 5>the whole world is changed and we're the same.</v>

2283
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.120
<v Speaker 5>That's what's really fucked up.</v>

2284
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:55.260
<v Speaker 5>We in our little fucking interesting minds have figured out a way to manipulate</v>

2285
01:03:55.261 --> 01:03:59.540
<v Speaker 5>the earth so radically that we've polluted the ocean and fucked up the,</v>

2286
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:04.700
<v Speaker 5>the air and left big fucking giant spots where no one can go for a hundred</v>

2287
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 5>thousand years.</v>

2288
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.840
<v Speaker 5>There's a gang of them.</v>

2289
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.960
<v Speaker 5>Well we drop nuclear bombs just to fucking see what would happen.</v>

2290
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 5>We had to get rid of nuclear waste.</v>

2291
01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Speaker 5>We've done this like we've done it so quickly.</v>

2292
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 5>It's really amazing.</v>

2293
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.271
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2294
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:21.960
<v Speaker 5>but we're the same animal that we were 50,000 years ago.</v>

2295
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.330
<v Speaker 5>Not that I was creating so many of the problems.</v>

2296
01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:24.571
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2297
01:04:24.571 --> 01:04:25.081
<v Speaker 5>I think the,</v>

2298
01:04:25.081 --> 01:04:25.914
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2299
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:29.570
<v Speaker 5>the Guy Maltus he's a politician and you know,</v>

2300
01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 5>economist and he basically said food production increases arithmetically and you</v>

2301
01:04:34.641 --> 01:04:34.810
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2302
01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:38.550
<v Speaker 5>population increases geometrically so that ultimately,</v>

2303
01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:38.791
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2304
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:41.310
<v Speaker 5>the way things are going and we see this and all of these third world countries,</v>

2305
01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2306
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:44.370
<v Speaker 5>reproduction has far outpaced,</v>

2307
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.851
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2308
01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:46.440
<v Speaker 5>the amount of food supply and the things,</v>

2309
01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:48.180
<v Speaker 5>and this happens at various periods in history.</v>

2310
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 5>And so either nature is going to take care of it either in one fell swoop</v>

2311
01:04:51.901 --> 01:04:55.800
<v Speaker 5>through a giant famine or through disease or through other kind of</v>

2312
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:57.510
<v Speaker 5>overpopulation of facts.</v>

2313
01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:00.330
<v Speaker 5>Then nature will kind of auto correct these mistakes.</v>

2314
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:05.360
<v Speaker 5>Or you have to take different methods of contraception very seriously and start</v>

2315
01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:06.930
<v Speaker 5>teaching that,</v>

2316
01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:07.381
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2317
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:08.360
<v Speaker 5>at an early age.</v>

2318
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:09.460
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2319
01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.120
<v Speaker 5>putting that in people's minds from the start.</v>

2320
01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:14.870
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's one area where we're terrible at.</v>

2321
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2322
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 5>we don't want to talk about fucking still preaching abstinence,</v>

2323
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:19.920
<v Speaker 5>which is nonsense.</v>

2324
01:05:19.921 --> 01:05:22.450
<v Speaker 5>Just that Michele Bachmann is hilarious.</v>

2325
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 5>It is amazing that broad is still running for president.</v>

2326
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 5>It is amazing with her big gay husband when they run around and tell everybody</v>

2327
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:31.120
<v Speaker 5>not to have sex.</v>

2328
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.901
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2329
01:05:31.901 --> 01:05:33.820
<v Speaker 5>it is really fucking funny,</v>

2330
01:05:33.821 --> 01:05:34.390
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2331
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:35.530
<v Speaker 5>Somebody got a fall.</v>

2332
01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:36.400
<v Speaker 5>That dude around.</v>

2333
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2334
01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.331
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

2335
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:37.620
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2336
01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:37.930
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2337
01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:38.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2338
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:42.220
<v Speaker 5>I started paying attention to the polls and you know when Ron Paul,</v>

2339
01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:44.860
<v Speaker 5>especially when Ron Paul's ahead in Iowa right now,</v>

2340
01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:45.910
<v Speaker 5>he's got the lead.</v>

2341
01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:48.760
<v Speaker 5>He's number one in Iowa and everybody shit in their pants.</v>

2342
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.560
<v Speaker 5>But that Michele Bachmann broad,</v>

2343
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.060
<v Speaker 5>she's still in it,</v>

2344
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:52.660
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2345
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.770
<v Speaker 5>She's still in it.</v>

2346
01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:54.604
<v Speaker 5>She's in it to win it.</v>

2347
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:55.240
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

2348
01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.530
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe it.</v>

2349
01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.101
<v Speaker 5>I would've thought,</v>

2350
01:05:57.101 --> 01:05:59.590
<v Speaker 5>doesn't everybody know she's off fucking loon?</v>

2351
01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:00.221
<v Speaker 5>Like have it,</v>

2352
01:06:00.221 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 5>hasn't that been figured out yet?</v>

2353
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.410
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen her husband?</v>

2354
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.470
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen him talk like that guy can't hold it in?</v>

2355
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.290
<v Speaker 5>Flowers come out of his asshole.</v>

2356
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.133
<v Speaker 5>What he farts,</v>

2357
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2358
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy.</v>

2359
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.460
<v Speaker 5>If he threw his hands up randomly in the air,</v>

2360
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.940
<v Speaker 5>glitter would just magically come out of the air.</v>

2361
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.080
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't matter whether it was,</v>

2362
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:17.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2363
01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 5>whether it came from his skin or came from the universe recognizing that gayness</v>

2364
01:06:21.131 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 5>that he exudes,</v>

2365
01:06:22.301 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 5>it needs to be a glorified glitter.</v>

2366
01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:25.660
<v Speaker 5>He could create glitter,</v>

2367
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:26.583
<v Speaker 5>he can create.</v>

2368
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.851
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

2369
01:06:26.851 --> 01:06:28.630
<v Speaker 5>he's a fucking peacock man.</v>

2370
01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:30.220
<v Speaker 5>He's hilarious.</v>

2371
01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.850
<v Speaker 5>He's one of the gayest people to ever walk the face of the planet.</v>

2372
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:34.773
<v Speaker 5>At least he looks like he,</v>

2373
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:35.723
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2374
01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.410
<v Speaker 5>And she's running around talking about about gay marriage and you know,</v>

2376
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.880
<v Speaker 5>and they have a pray the gay away sort of a clinic for the one guy did an expo</v>

2377
01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:46.691
<v Speaker 5>say on there,</v>

2378
01:06:46.691 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 5>pray the gay away clinic and there was a guy behind him.</v>

2379
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:49.950
<v Speaker 5>Somehow or another,</v>

2380
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:52.510
<v Speaker 5>they do this thing where they all get together and they hold onto each other and</v>

2381
01:06:52.511 --> 01:06:52.751
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

2382
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:54.580
<v Speaker 5>the guy behind him clearly has a hard on</v>

2383
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:57.640
<v Speaker 5>the fuck you doing,</v>

2384
01:06:57.641 --> 01:06:58.474
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2385
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.430
<v Speaker 5>And these people are running for president,</v>

2386
01:07:00.431 --> 01:07:00.671
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2387
01:07:00.671 --> 01:07:01.690
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

2388
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:04.690
<v Speaker 5>But she's got a lot of people that think that she can win.</v>

2389
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.561
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2390
01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:07.210
<v Speaker 5>not enough to actually win,</v>

2391
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:07.751
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>

2392
01:07:07.751 --> 01:07:09.400
<v Speaker 5>unless everybody else fucks up bat.</v>

2393
01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.110
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is they keep fucking up.</v>

2394
01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:12.100
<v Speaker 5>Everybody keeps talking about.</v>

2395
01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:12.881
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's no,</v>

2396
01:07:12.881 --> 01:07:13.810
<v Speaker 5>Rick Perry is still in it,</v>

2397
01:07:13.811 --> 01:07:15.070
<v Speaker 5>but it's just cursory at this point.</v>

2398
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:15.701
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2399
01:07:15.701 --> 01:07:16.241
<v Speaker 5>what is he doing?</v>

2400
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 5>Come on dude.</v>

2401
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows you're an idiot.</v>

2402
01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:18.381
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2403
01:07:18.381 --> 01:07:19.211
<v Speaker 5>like you're done,</v>

2404
01:07:19.211 --> 01:07:19.571
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2405
01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:20.980
<v Speaker 5>You fucking can't talk.</v>

2406
01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:21.431
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2407
01:07:21.431 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 5>You forget shit.</v>

2408
01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:23.111
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2409
01:07:23.111 --> 01:07:23.920
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

2410
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.000
<v Speaker 5>George Bush was way better and people were offended by how dumb he was.</v>

2411
01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:28.900
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2412
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.240
<v Speaker 5>Rick Perry's like really fucking stupid.</v>

2413
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:33.220
<v Speaker 5>George Bush was better than this guy,</v>

2414
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.390
<v Speaker 5>like way better at talking,</v>

2415
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:35.231
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2416
01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:35.441
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2417
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:36.400
<v Speaker 5>he seemed like,</v>

2418
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2419
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:38.140
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't an intellectual,</v>

2420
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:38.890
<v Speaker 5>but he seemed like,</v>

2421
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:40.770
<v Speaker 5>especially back when he was running for governor,</v>

2422
01:07:40.771 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 5>if it seems like you put some fucking words together,</v>

2423
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 5>this guy's an embarrassment.</v>

2424
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:44.891
<v Speaker 5>So it was like,</v>

2425
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:46.360
<v Speaker 5>who else does,</v>

2426
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:46.901
<v Speaker 5>no one laughed.</v>

2427
01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:47.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2428
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.570
<v Speaker 5>what Mitt Romney and fucking,</v>

2429
01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2430
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.250
<v Speaker 5>the other guy with a big head,</v>

2431
01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be around Paul.</v>

2432
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:52.991
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2433
01:07:52.991 --> 01:07:53.471
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2434
01:07:53.471 --> 01:07:55.660
<v Speaker 5>but really that seemed,</v>

2435
01:07:55.661 --> 01:07:55.901
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2436
01:07:55.901 --> 01:07:57.010
<v Speaker 5>they got to let that happen.</v>

2437
01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:58.330
<v Speaker 5>I doubt it.</v>

2438
01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:58.751
<v Speaker 5>I doubt it.</v>

2439
01:07:58.751 --> 01:08:00.370
<v Speaker 5>But Mitt Newt Gingrich,</v>

2440
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:01.600
<v Speaker 5>how hilarious is that?</v>

2441
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:02.820
<v Speaker 5>That's like somebody that,</v>

2442
01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.450
<v Speaker 5>you know what that would be like if new king,</v>

2443
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:05.350
<v Speaker 5>which should be president.</v>

2444
01:08:05.351 --> 01:08:08.530
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like if you dated this girl and she was a cunt and her dad was a country</v>

2445
01:08:08.531 --> 01:08:09.364
<v Speaker 5>or cunt,</v>

2446
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.630
<v Speaker 5>that's Newt Gingrich.</v>

2447
01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:11.621
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2448
01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 5>like if you dated a girl and she was just a fucking choose nagging pain in the</v>

2449
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.460
<v Speaker 5>ass</v>

2450
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.920
<v Speaker 4>and then you had to go over and meet her parents and her dad is like,</v>

2451
01:08:18.921 --> 01:08:20.150
<v Speaker 4>you better be nice to my daughter.</v>

2452
01:08:20.151 --> 01:08:21.290
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you that right now.</v>

2453
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't take any bullshit from kids,</v>

2454
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:24.583
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2455
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2456
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:26.300
<v Speaker 4>can I deal with your dad?</v>

2457
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:26.961
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2458
01:08:26.961 --> 01:08:27.680
<v Speaker 4>someone's dad,</v>

2459
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.400
<v Speaker 4>he's a monster.</v>

2460
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Where does glitter go?</v>

2461
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.200
<v Speaker 4>You never throw glitter away.</v>

2462
01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:31.761
<v Speaker 4>Is it like,</v>

2463
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:35.180
<v Speaker 4>are we breathing in glitter or are we starting with complex on where you live</v>

2464
01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:37.730
<v Speaker 4>because you have glitter on your right now you don't even know it.</v>

2465
01:08:37.731 --> 01:08:38.330
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2466
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:39.500
<v Speaker 4>where does that go though?</v>

2467
01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:40.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2468
01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:41.151
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

2469
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:45.260
<v Speaker 4>It just fall on the ground and it's the strip clubs now it's on your,</v>

2470
01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:47.690
<v Speaker 4>on your face right below your elbow from my little ones.</v>

2471
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.870
<v Speaker 4>They have when you have little ones and they have glitter.</v>

2472
01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:52.460
<v Speaker 4>We always playing with glitter is always like glue and glitter.</v>

2473
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.480
<v Speaker 4>There was making things.</v>

2474
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:54.181
<v Speaker 4>Where does it go?</v>

2475
01:08:54.181 --> 01:08:54.711
<v Speaker 4>It gets thrown away.</v>

2476
01:08:54.711 --> 01:08:58.250
<v Speaker 4>I guess we're probably breeding glitter and you might go and die from good or</v>

2477
01:08:58.251 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

2478
01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.610
<v Speaker 4>don't worry about that shirt.</v>

2479
01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 4>To go back to this,</v>

2480
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:01.650
<v Speaker 4>the point that you had a,</v>

2481
01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:03.170
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about sex earlier,</v>

2482
01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:05.070
<v Speaker 4>cause I thought about this a lot for uh,</v>

2483
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2484
01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.060
<v Speaker 4>in building a society and some of the solutions that people had to,</v>

2485
01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:09.491
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2486
01:09:09.491 --> 01:09:10.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2487
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:10.580
<v Speaker 4>to the,</v>

2488
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:15.140
<v Speaker 4>the population growth problem was actually teaching a form of Tantra,</v>

2489
01:09:15.141 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 4>which is where you withhold your seed when you're having sex.</v>

2490
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.453
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2491
01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:22.070
<v Speaker 4>in all fairness,</v>

2492
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:22.821
<v Speaker 4>all fairness,</v>

2493
01:09:22.821 --> 01:09:23.690
<v Speaker 4>I gave it a go.</v>

2494
01:09:23.691 --> 01:09:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2495
01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:24.530
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2496
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:25.670
<v Speaker 4>And it's pretty,</v>

2497
01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:26.840
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty interesting,</v>

2498
01:09:26.841 --> 01:09:27.501
<v Speaker 4>the dynamics.</v>

2499
01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:27.770
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2500
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I would try this,</v>

2501
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:29.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2502
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:30.620
<v Speaker 4>personally very often,</v>

2503
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:34.670
<v Speaker 4>but if you created a system where you actually taught sex and this was one of</v>

2504
01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.990
<v Speaker 4>the ways that you could do it and not how was tantra any better than the pullout</v>

2505
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:38.630
<v Speaker 4>method?</v>

2506
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2507
01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:39.111
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2508
01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:42.590
<v Speaker 4>I barely trust people to drive cars pull out all the time.</v>

2509
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:42.891
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2510
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:44.000
<v Speaker 4>that feeling that you get,</v>

2511
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:46.200
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter if you're having sex or if you're,</v>

2512
01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.450
<v Speaker 4>if you're masturbating,</v>

2513
01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:47.691
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2514
01:09:47.691 --> 01:09:49.310
<v Speaker 4>you get that feeling after you're done.</v>

2515
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.200
<v Speaker 4>That's just kind of a bummer.</v>

2516
01:09:51.201 --> 01:09:51.531
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>

2517
01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:52.460
<v Speaker 4>You look at it really,</v>

2518
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:53.450
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like,</v>

2519
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 4>ah yeah,</v>

2520
01:09:55.371 --> 01:09:55.851
<v Speaker 4>a little bit.</v>

2521
01:09:55.851 --> 01:09:57.530
<v Speaker 4>It's been way better with sex and masturbating.</v>

2522
01:09:57.531 --> 01:09:58.730
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're using a flashlight,</v>

2523
01:09:58.731 --> 01:10:00.440
<v Speaker 4>the feeling is like it's like 10 times,</v>

2524
01:10:00.441 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 4>but even when you're having sex it's like,</v>

2525
01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:02.540
<v Speaker 4>eh,</v>

2526
01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:06.830
<v Speaker 4>sometimes there's that that kind of really cool like glowy feeling afterward.</v>

2527
01:10:06.831 --> 01:10:07.664
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

2528
01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:08.570
<v Speaker 4>I understand that,</v>

2529
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.910
<v Speaker 4>but it kind of,</v>

2530
01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:11.600
<v Speaker 4>it kind of allows you to keep,</v>

2531
01:10:11.601 --> 01:10:11.921
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2532
01:10:11.921 --> 01:10:15.500
<v Speaker 4>it allows you to keep doing it like indefinitely for like a long period of time.</v>

2533
01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:18.590
<v Speaker 4>So you can just go to the point of climax and then you cool off,</v>

2534
01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:19.341
<v Speaker 4>you chill out,</v>

2535
01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:20.750
<v Speaker 4>you're hanging out and after,</v>

2536
01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2537
01:10:21.021 --> 01:10:22.100
<v Speaker 4>after you do that with a person,</v>

2538
01:10:22.101 --> 01:10:22.790
<v Speaker 4>it's not like,</v>

2539
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:23.130
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2540
01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:23.840
<v Speaker 4>go get cleaned up.</v>

2541
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.310
<v Speaker 4>We're going to,</v>

2542
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2543
01:10:24.561 --> 01:10:25.490
<v Speaker 4>sort something else out.</v>

2544
01:10:25.491 --> 01:10:26.900
<v Speaker 4>You're like still in the mindset.</v>

2545
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.660
<v Speaker 4>So you can stretch it out for these long periods of time.</v>

2546
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.540
<v Speaker 4>You're blue ball and yourself to death.</v>

2547
01:10:31.541 --> 01:10:36.541
<v Speaker 4>So you could basically occupy a massive amount of time having sex and it's</v>

2548
01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:37.131
<v Speaker 4>pretty,</v>

2549
01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:37.964
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty fun.</v>

2550
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.940
<v Speaker 4>The chicken all drives like motherfucker lose just come</v>

2551
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:45.800
<v Speaker 4>piece up for a little while.</v>

2552
01:10:45.801 --> 01:10:47.870
<v Speaker 4>But I mean that was one of the ideas that they,</v>

2553
01:10:47.871 --> 01:10:48.501
<v Speaker 4>that they taught.</v>

2554
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously contraception is super important but you know,</v>

2555
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:55.090
<v Speaker 4>just teaching different methods is going to be vitally.</v>

2556
01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we should teach them Tantra fuck all day.</v>

2557
01:10:58.101 --> 01:10:59.120
<v Speaker 4>This is what I want you to do,</v>

2558
01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:01.400
<v Speaker 4>but hold onto your lows and fuck all day.</v>

2559
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.100
<v Speaker 4>But imagine how much more entertaining that is.</v>

2560
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:06.560
<v Speaker 4>Then just fucking for five minutes and then that's it.</v>

2561
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Speaker 4>That's all you're done.</v>

2562
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:10.450
<v Speaker 4>You got to stretch out something that's constantly medium.</v>

2563
01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:11.451
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2564
01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:11.811
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

2565
01:11:11.811 --> 01:11:12.051
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2566
01:11:12.051 --> 01:11:12.441
<v Speaker 4>a fucker.</v>

2567
01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:13.440
<v Speaker 4>And then take her out to dinner</v>

2568
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 2>and always do it in that order.</v>

2569
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:16.411
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2570
01:11:16.411 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 2>the worst is when you see a guy who takes a girl to a comedy club and he know he</v>

2571
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:23.850
<v Speaker 2>hasn't fucked her yet and she's all mouthy and shit and yell and shit out,</v>

2572
01:11:23.851 --> 01:11:24.211
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

2573
01:11:24.211 --> 01:11:25.050
<v Speaker 2>why is this?</v>

2574
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:25.771
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why.</v>

2575
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Because you didn't fuck her.</v>

2576
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.530
<v Speaker 2>You didn't fuck her before you leave.</v>

2577
01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's true shit.</v>

2578
01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:31.980
<v Speaker 2>If you gorilla fuck a girl before you leave the house,</v>

2579
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:33.001
<v Speaker 2>she first of all,</v>

2580
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:33.600
<v Speaker 2>she's not.</v>

2581
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.220
<v Speaker 2>She's not trying to draw an extra tension.</v>

2582
01:11:35.221 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Her genetics tell her she's already gotten fucked today.</v>

2583
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Chill out.</v>

2584
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't need any,</v>

2585
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>any extraordinary amount of attention.</v>

2586
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.471
<v Speaker 2>Don't need me.</v>

2587
01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Extraordinary love.</v>

2588
01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Just settle the fuck down.</v>

2589
01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:47.550
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't fuck them,</v>

2590
01:11:47.551 --> 01:11:50.190
<v Speaker 2>and then you take them out into the wild and they're pumping out all those,</v>

2591
01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:51.330
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to fuck me tonight.</v>

2592
01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Hormones and it might be you.</v>

2593
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it's you,</v>

2594
01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:55.800
<v Speaker 2>but if she's a crazy bitch,</v>

2595
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 2>she's trying to like see if there's another offer out there.</v>

2596
01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:58.621
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2597
01:11:58.621 --> 01:11:58.921
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2598
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:00.150
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not even to stay with him.</v>

2599
01:12:00.151 --> 01:12:00.661
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

2600
01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:01.401
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 2>A lot of those effects and not only evening dependent but whole relationship</v>

2604
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:09.030
<v Speaker 2>depending on the shoe ever properly.</v>

2605
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Never probably get by a lot.</v>

2606
01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:11.900

2607
01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2608
01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2609
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Or never been with a man.</v>

2610
01:12:14.850 --> 01:12:15.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2611
01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:16.680
<v Speaker 2>how many girls have you ever met that like date?</v>

2612
01:12:16.681 --> 01:12:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Like really weak do is because they're terrified of being in a situation where a</v>

2613
01:12:20.581 --> 01:12:24.360
<v Speaker 2>man controls them because either someone was a man was abusive earlier in their</v>

2614
01:12:24.361 --> 01:12:29.220
<v Speaker 2>life or they had a bad father relationship or stepfather relationship.</v>

2615
01:12:29.221 --> 01:12:33.600
<v Speaker 2>There's something where they shy away from any strong man,</v>

2616
01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2617
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:36.780
<v Speaker 2>where they were literally forced to be the man and the relationship and they</v>

2618
01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:37.140
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2619
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know girls that are constantly involved in like Beta men,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're always fucking falling behind on their bills.</v>

2622

<v Speaker 2>They're always,</v>

2623
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:47.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2624
01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:50.250
<v Speaker 2>and these girls are always like nagging at them to get their shit together.</v>

2625
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 2>And it's this weird relationship man with a woman makes more of the money and</v>

2626
01:12:53.821 --> 01:12:57.150
<v Speaker 2>the woman pot pays for the car and he asked to borrow it from her when he wants</v>

2627

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2631
01:12:59.761 --> 01:12:59.941
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2632
01:12:59.941 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 2>it's such a clear situation to everybody else.</v>

2633
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd see on the outside,</v>

2634

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:07.500
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking completely unnatural dude.</v>

2638
01:13:07.501 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why she's yelling at you.</v>

2639

01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:12.870
<v Speaker 2>We're all even,</v>

2643
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.040
<v Speaker 2>it's all the same.</v>

2644
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:14.911
<v Speaker 2>Who cares man,</v>

2645
01:13:14.911 --> 01:13:15.750
<v Speaker 2>she makes the money.</v>

2646
01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:16.231
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2647
01:13:16.231 --> 01:13:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I help out around the house,</v>

2648
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:18.930

2649
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2650
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:22.500
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you're fucking her correctly.</v>

2651
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:24.210
<v Speaker 2>You've got to fuck her.</v>

2652
01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Like you have all the money.</v>

2653
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way you're supposed to fuck them.</v>

2654
01:13:27.431 --> 01:13:28.141
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to fuck them.</v>

2655
01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Like you have all the money,</v>

2656
01:13:29.161 --> 01:13:29.341
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

2657
01:13:29.341 --> 01:13:31.800
<v Speaker 2>he's going to take care of everything and he can't say that.</v>

2658
01:13:31.801 --> 01:13:32.101
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>

2659
01:13:32.101 --> 01:13:34.110
<v Speaker 2>daddy can't even take care of its own fucking car bill.</v>

2660
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh bench make my dick go live and chickens ugly.</v>

2661
01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.560
<v Speaker 2>There's some definite masculinizing movement that has caused a whole crop of</v>

2662
01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.590
<v Speaker 2>males to be,</v>

2663
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:44.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2664
01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:45.330
<v Speaker 2>pretty ineffectual.</v>

2665
01:13:45.331 --> 01:13:45.940
<v Speaker 2>I think when it,</v>

2666
01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:49.230
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it is because women have to take care of themselves and they</v>

2667
01:13:49.231 --> 01:13:50.430
<v Speaker 2>don't want to hear bullshit.</v>

2668
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.150
<v Speaker 2>And then men want those women to like them so they become emasculated,</v>

2669
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.310
<v Speaker 2>emasculated,</v>

2670
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:56.910
<v Speaker 2>divorce is brutal.</v>

2671
01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.781
<v Speaker 2>That chops away.</v>

2672
01:13:57.781 --> 01:14:00.240
<v Speaker 2>A guy living with your mom at a small age,</v>

2673

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:56.230
<v Speaker 6>And they're kind of like flashlight ish.</v>

2709
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:57.243
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

2710
01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:00.490
<v Speaker 6>I could just imagine him putting a real flashlight in that thing because it felt</v>

2711
01:15:00.491 --> 01:15:01.030
<v Speaker 6>real.</v>

2712
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 6>It looked real and it was so weird seeing Sam Tripoli.</v>

2713
01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:05.080
<v Speaker 6>Like after the show was done,</v>

2714
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:05.351
<v Speaker 6>we just,</v>

2715
01:15:05.351 --> 01:15:08.620
<v Speaker 6>when we were all hanging out and Sam was just sitting there staring at it like a</v>

2716
01:15:08.621 --> 01:15:11.260
<v Speaker 6>little kid looking at boobs for his first time.</v>

2717
01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:14.500
<v Speaker 6>And that's what the reaction to everybody that was looking at these things.</v>

2718
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.341
<v Speaker 6>I didn't fuck one of these.</v>

2719
01:15:15.341 --> 01:15:15.850

<v Speaker 6>I feel bad just like that.</v>

2758
01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:06.551
<v Speaker 6>We crushed it.</v>

2759
01:16:06.551 --> 01:16:07.690
<v Speaker 6>I can't even get on it anymore.</v>

2760
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:11.440
<v Speaker 6>It's fun.</v>

2761
01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.730
<v Speaker 6>I love when that happens.</v>

2762
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:14.710
<v Speaker 6>But he said anytime you,</v>

2763
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.940
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2764
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 6>if you want to do a podcast at the ice house,</v>

2765
01:16:16.691 --> 01:16:17.610
<v Speaker 6>you'll bring a couple of bites.</v>

2766
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.190
<v Speaker 6>We can play around with it and we could meet him,</v>

2767
01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:20.441
<v Speaker 6>tell him to get,</v>

2768
01:16:20.441 --> 01:16:22.600
<v Speaker 6>get with the flashlight people and come up with a better cooter.</v>

2769
01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:22.871
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2770
01:16:22.871 --> 01:16:24.170
<v Speaker 6>How do you clean that thing out man?</v>

2771
01:16:24.171 --> 01:16:24.441
<v Speaker 6>It's odd.</v>

2772
01:16:24.441 --> 01:16:26.200
<v Speaker 6>The fleshlight where you unscrew the bottom of it,</v>

2773
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:29.680
<v Speaker 6>the parts that you fuck up a have like this,</v>

2774
01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2775
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:34.780
<v Speaker 6>they can pull out kind of like a fleshlight and a refrigerator and like the</v>

2776
01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:35.011
<v Speaker 6>button,</v>

2777
01:16:35.011 --> 01:16:35.620
<v Speaker 6>what comes out.</v>

2778
01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.690
<v Speaker 6>The next level is going to be hooking that up to a computer program where you</v>

2779
01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:43.720
<v Speaker 6>get like some artificial intelligence said he wants to take the iPhone dock and</v>

2780
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.001
<v Speaker 6>the neck of it.</v>

2781
01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:51.001
<v Speaker 6>So you can talk to Siri through the iPhone or through them and she'd be like,</v>

2782
01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.120
<v Speaker 6>hello.</v>

2783
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:56.740
<v Speaker 6>You know whether you can get it to the point where it was like a sexual training</v>

2784
01:16:56.741 --> 01:16:57.574
<v Speaker 6>device.</v>

2785
01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.400
<v Speaker 6>Apparently they're going to come out with some sort of an apple device.</v>

2786
01:17:00.401 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 6>We're Siri communicates to your phone through like something that you were,</v>

2787
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:07.390
<v Speaker 6>so you'll be doing like almost everything through Siri,</v>

2788
01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:08.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2789
01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.410
<v Speaker 6>this is the idea to it.</v>

2790
01:17:09.411 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 6>And like you'll press</v>

2791
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.821
<v Speaker 2>a button and say,</v>

2792
01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:11.211
<v Speaker 2>Siri,</v>

2793
01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:12.260
<v Speaker 2>what emails do I have?</v>

2794
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:13.010
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2795
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 2>as Siri,</v>

2796
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.960
<v Speaker 2>he gets more and more advanced.</v>

2797
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.230
<v Speaker 2>So whatever's in your pocket you'll be doing everything through voice</v>

2798
01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:19.340
<v Speaker 2>recognition software.</v>

2799
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.560
<v Speaker 2>So series going to control the,</v>

2800
01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:22.110
<v Speaker 2>so cereal,</v>

2801
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:23.140
<v Speaker 2>chill the fuck robot.</v>

2802
01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Well hopefully fuck first the destruct later.</v>

2803
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Once we realize that we're fucking there,</v>

2804
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:29.990
<v Speaker 2>their robot daughters,</v>

2805
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:30.881
<v Speaker 2>that's an,</v>

2806
01:17:30.881 --> 01:17:31.970
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come after us.</v>

2807
01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:33.500
<v Speaker 2>It was one thing.</v>

2808
01:17:33.501 --> 01:17:36.260
<v Speaker 2>What's funny is that his version of like that the pussy part,</v>

2809
01:17:36.261 --> 01:17:36.830
<v Speaker 2>which was like,</v>

2810
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:37.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2811
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:38.480
<v Speaker 2>kind of fleshlight ish.</v>

2812
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.400
<v Speaker 2>But it was definitely,</v>

2813
01:17:40.401 --> 01:17:40.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2814
01:17:40.701 --> 01:17:43.280
<v Speaker 2>you could see the quality of flashlight was a billion times better.</v>

2815
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.460
<v Speaker 2>What is it in the softness of it is like,</v>

2816
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it uses maybe a close similar kind of material with it.</v>

2817
01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:51.590
<v Speaker 2>But what was different about his is that he actually,</v>

2818
01:17:51.591 --> 01:17:52.700
<v Speaker 2>his wife or a girlfriend,</v>

2819
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2820
01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:55.730
<v Speaker 2>paint painted like the lips of different color,</v>

2821
01:17:55.731 --> 01:17:56.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2822
01:17:56.031 --> 01:17:57.470
<v Speaker 2>like kind of beat him up a little.</v>

2823
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like really,</v>

2824
01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.713
<v Speaker 2>really</v>

2825
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:02.540
<v Speaker 2>like the makeup job.</v>

2826
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Like catching him tattoo.</v>

2827
01:18:03.801 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Also just catching dick for decades.</v>

2828
01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.980
<v Speaker 2>The entryways all skidded like fucking Lego to plan keeps coming in for</v>

2829
01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic.</v>

2830
01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2831
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:14.833
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2832
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Just skid elbow.</v>

2833
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:18.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like skid marks on a,</v>

2834
01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:20.840
<v Speaker 2>on a fucking pool table.</v>

2835
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Fear factor was awesome last night,</v>

2836
01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:23.301
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2837
01:18:23.301 --> 01:18:27.860
<v Speaker 2>It was really interesting to see that the two muscle guys like the,</v>

2838
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.090
<v Speaker 2>there was two guys on the show,</v>

2839
01:18:29.091 --> 01:18:30.050
<v Speaker 2>like the big buff,</v>

2840
01:18:30.051 --> 01:18:30.561
<v Speaker 2>like rip.</v>

2841
01:18:30.561 --> 01:18:33.560
<v Speaker 2>The guys had such a hard time early on I was like,</v>

2842
01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:34.070
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2843
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:37.150
<v Speaker 2>those two little gay guys is these little muscles.</v>

2844
01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Not a way to be man.</v>

2845
01:18:38.601 --> 01:18:39.170
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

2846
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:41.990
<v Speaker 2>you mean they were saying that there are agile and they move well,</v>

2847
01:18:41.991 --> 01:18:45.830
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is you're carrying around a bunch of unnecessary muscle.</v>

2848
01:18:45.831 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not aiding you in your frame.</v>

2849
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.940
<v Speaker 2>The way you move with it requires a lot of fuel.</v>

2850
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 2>You get really tired really easily.</v>

2851
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Like those guys that have,</v>

2852
01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:56.290
<v Speaker 2>like when you see a guy that has an extraordinary amount of muscle on them,</v>

2853
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.930
<v Speaker 2>look to someone who like does Jujitsu.</v>

2854
01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Just someone who does MMA.</v>

2855
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:01.490
<v Speaker 2>You look at that guy and go,</v>

2856
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:02.630
<v Speaker 2>how long can you laugh?</v>

2857
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:03.591
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

2858
01:19:03.591 --> 01:19:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Last I'll have to do is grab a hold of you.</v>

2859
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.610
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is engage a guy like that in a fight.</v>

2860
01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:09.650
<v Speaker 2>All the gains you might have five to get a hold of them.</v>

2861
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean there could be really explosive,</v>

2862
01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:13.011
<v Speaker 2>all that muscle,</v>

2863
01:19:13.011 --> 01:19:14.540
<v Speaker 2>he could really have a powerful punch.</v>

2864
01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:15.680
<v Speaker 2>You have to be like really careful.</v>

2865
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:18.800
<v Speaker 2>But if you can get past that and somehow or another managed to get ahold of them</v>

2866
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:19.800
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2867
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:20.833
<v Speaker 2>just hang on,</v>

2868
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:25.930
<v Speaker 2>just make them struggle to get off you and in 10 15 seconds he's at 30% of what</v>

2869
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 2>he was 15 seconds ago.</v>

2870
01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.491
<v Speaker 2>Like literally.</v>

2871
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:29.151
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2872
01:19:29.151 --> 01:19:34.151
<v Speaker 2>Like there were like guys like that are always like one good exertion away from</v>

2873
01:19:34.791 --> 01:19:36.980
<v Speaker 2>the heart fucking exploding of their chest.</v>

2874
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like they have a computer,</v>

2875
01:19:38.661 --> 01:19:43.460
<v Speaker 2>like a seller on 300 processor and they got a jacked up to four 25 you're not</v>

2876
01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:45.400
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be carrying around that much weight man.</v>

2877
01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:46.071
<v Speaker 2>You're just not.</v>

2878
01:19:46.071 --> 01:19:47.210
<v Speaker 2>And it's not natural.</v>

2879
01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.740
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to do.</v>

2880
01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:52.640
<v Speaker 2>You got to put a bunch of shit in your system to make yourself carrying that</v>

2881
01:19:52.641 --> 01:19:53.474
<v Speaker 2>much weight.</v>

2882
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.120
<v Speaker 2>And most of those guys are non athletic.</v>

2883
01:19:56.121 --> 01:19:56.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2884

2895
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.190

2896
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.460
<v Speaker 6>but once she realized she didn't want to fuck with that girl because that black</v>

2905
01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:33.840
<v Speaker 6>There's not more Jerry Springer Shit on that show.</v>

2906

<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2907
01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:35.580
<v Speaker 6>we keep it to a minimum.</v>

2908
01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.380
<v Speaker 6>We showed very little of that,</v>

2909
01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:38.131
<v Speaker 6>that argument.</v>

2910
01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:39.480
<v Speaker 6>But that argument was a big argument.</v>

2911
01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 6>That shit went on for a while.</v>

2912
01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:42.150
<v Speaker 6>I had to calm them down.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm like that's not the kind of behavior that you want to hear.</v>

2929
01:21:04.951 --> 01:21:05.940

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 6>they seek that out and I get it man.</v>

2933
01:21:09.961 --> 01:21:10.331
<v Speaker 6>Like I,</v>

2934
01:21:10.331 --> 01:21:10.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2935
01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.850
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you remember it the other day,</v>

2936
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:15.330
<v Speaker 6>aster gave us a bunch of those drinks for drinks and I had,</v>

2937
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:18.600
<v Speaker 6>I had one the other day cause she left one over in the fridge and it was an</v>

2938
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:19.230
<v Speaker 6>orange,</v>

2939
01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:21.180
<v Speaker 6>a pineapple or something like that.</v>

2940
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:24.970
<v Speaker 6>And I was drinking it and suddenly in my mouth a bug like uh,</v>

2941
01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:26.240
<v Speaker 6>like you know,</v>

2942
01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 6>lightening bugs,</v>

2943
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:28.681
<v Speaker 6>what those look like,</v>

2944
01:21:28.681 --> 01:21:31.530
<v Speaker 6>the ones that aren't lightening bolts but look exactly like a lightening bolt.</v>

2945
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:35.310
<v Speaker 6>So it got in the juice and I was just pouring out and right there I was like</v>

2946
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:36.061
<v Speaker 6>about to Puke.</v>

2947
01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:36.780
<v Speaker 6>Like I was like,</v>

2948
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:40.350
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't even imagine drinking a whole fucking milkshake of that shit.</v>

2949
01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:41.250
<v Speaker 6>Impossible for me.</v>

2950
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.181
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

2951
01:21:42.181 --> 01:21:44.820
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't be a good candidate and heights.</v>

2952
01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.780
<v Speaker 6>Impossible for me.</v>

2953
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.621
<v Speaker 6>Never.</v>

2954
01:21:46.621 --> 01:21:47.940
<v Speaker 6>You don't like to move that much.</v>

2955
01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:49.850
<v Speaker 6>So that's not good for you.</v>

2956
01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.581
<v Speaker 6>Unique factor.</v>

2957
01:21:50.581 --> 01:21:52.050
<v Speaker 6>I'm on fear factor now.</v>

2958
01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.920
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

2959
01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.753
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>

2960

<v Speaker 6>I hate to like be morose though,</v>

2961
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.250
<v Speaker 6>but when you see people get sick and you see people that are unhealthy,</v>

2962
01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.420
<v Speaker 6>do you ever stop and think,</v>

2963
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:00.691
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2965
01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:04.651
<v Speaker 6>in some sort of shape.</v>

2966

<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2969
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:11.520
<v Speaker 6>or are you not thinking about it until something breaks on you?</v>

2970
01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:12.361
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'll have like an olive garden here or there or something like that where I</v>

2991
01:22:38.641 --> 01:22:39.000
<v Speaker 6>would just,</v>

2992
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.211
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2993
01:22:39.211 --> 01:22:39.750
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

2994
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:42.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm just eating like shit going crazy.</v>

2995
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:44.190
<v Speaker 6>But for the most part if you look at my refrigerator,</v>

2996
01:22:44.191 --> 01:22:45.024
<v Speaker 6>it's all like,</v>

2997
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.070
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of like your refrigerator for the most part.</v>

2998
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:47.480
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

2999
01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:47.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3000
01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.560
<v Speaker 6>I mean I don't eat much though.</v>

3001
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:50.490
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem I eat.</v>

3002
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:55.820
<v Speaker 6>Like last night I ate my first meal at 1:00 AM oh that's like it was all fucked</v>

3003
01:22:56.401 --> 01:22:58.230
<v Speaker 6>up and you drink a coffee during the day.</v>

3004
01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:01.830
<v Speaker 6>I drink coffee and that pretty much it makes me not hungry for a good five</v>

3005
01:23:01.831 --> 01:23:02.664
<v Speaker 6>hours.</v>

3006
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 6>I think an important concept applies to the muscle men and applies</v>

3007
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.101
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>

3008
01:23:06.101 --> 01:23:08.530
<v Speaker 7>everybody actually wrote about it on the Onnit blog.</v>

3009
01:23:08.531 --> 01:23:10.300
<v Speaker 7>It's called are you fit enough to survive?</v>

3010
01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:12.580
<v Speaker 7>And I think there's an important concept in there,</v>

3011
01:23:12.581 --> 01:23:14.890
<v Speaker 7>like take away all of the normal rules.</v>

3012
01:23:14.891 --> 01:23:18.240
<v Speaker 7>Let's go back to like a primitive state where you have to chase food for awhile,</v>

3013
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 7>maybe run after him a few days and you have to do certain explosive movements in</v>

3014
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:23.380
<v Speaker 7>a fight against an animal or another.</v>

3015
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:23.810
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3016
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I answered the question.</v>

3017
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:26.080
<v Speaker 2>It just take a little bit of shoe.</v>

3018
01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.750
<v Speaker 2>You might fall off the car answer.</v>

3019
01:23:30.751 --> 01:23:31.584
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3020
01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:32.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain,</v>

3021
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:36.280
<v Speaker 7>the amount of physicality that I think is necessary to maintain a proper mental</v>

3022
01:23:36.281 --> 01:23:36.650
<v Speaker 7>balance</v>

3023
01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:38.000
<v Speaker 2>either to even for sales.</v>

3024
01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:39.141
<v Speaker 2>For some folks,</v>

3025
01:23:39.141 --> 01:23:39.920
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3026
01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.420
<v Speaker 2>For other folks I don't,</v>

3027
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I think some people are averse to physical activity.</v>

3028
01:23:44.001 --> 01:23:44.181
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

3029
01:23:44.181 --> 01:23:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it reminds them a fucking gym class or whatever and they like it</v>

3030
01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:48.430
<v Speaker 7>that hot.</v>

3031
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:49.030
<v Speaker 7>Especially if,</v>

3032
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:52.270
<v Speaker 7>I think especially for men that haunts part of their physical psyche to know</v>

3033
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:56.740
<v Speaker 7>that they wouldn't on a basic primal level be fit enough to survive in a</v>

3034
01:23:56.741 --> 01:23:59.340
<v Speaker 7>situation where there weren't all these rules in supermarkets</v>

3035
01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:04.550
<v Speaker 2>unless they have now mad Asperger's and they don't know what the fuck is going</v>

3036
01:24:04.801 --> 01:24:06.780
<v Speaker 2>on and they're just sitting there counting numbers.</v>

3037
01:24:06.810 --> 01:24:09.660
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone's bodies are totally designed different because like you work</v>

3038
01:24:09.661 --> 01:24:09.961
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

3039
01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:11.250
<v Speaker 2>you feel good when you work out.</v>

3040
01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I work out,</v>

3041
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.863
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate him.</v>

3042
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:13.411
<v Speaker 2>Always hate it.</v>

3043
01:24:13.411 --> 01:24:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Even when I was like smoking a pack of cigarettes a day,</v>

3044
01:24:15.631 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>you eat dog shit all day.</v>

3045
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Even when I was a kid,</v>

3046
01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:18.690
<v Speaker 2>even in gym class,</v>

3047
01:24:18.691 --> 01:24:19.080
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

3048
01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:19.920
<v Speaker 2>even anything.</v>

3049
01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>

3050
01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:20.671
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3051
01:24:20.671 --> 01:24:20.911
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3052
01:24:20.911 --> 01:24:21.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3053
01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:21.361
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3054
01:24:21.361 --> 01:24:21.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3055
01:24:21.691 --> 01:24:22.524
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>

3056
01:24:22.670 --> 01:24:23.490
<v Speaker 2>you enjoy it.</v>

3057
01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3058
01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Well we very different Brian.</v>

3059
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:27.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you figured that out yet.</v>

3060
01:24:28.170 --> 01:24:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Especially bodywise man,</v>

3061
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:30.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3062
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3063
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much,</v>

3064
01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3065
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.341
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3066
01:24:32.341 --> 01:24:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I know that the way I'm built is,</v>

3067
01:24:34.441 --> 01:24:37.140
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is genetics because my mom's built like me,</v>

3068
01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:40.110
<v Speaker 2>my mom is short and why my mom's bill like a bulldog,</v>

3069
01:24:40.111 --> 01:24:40.430
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3070
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.770
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

3071
01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:41.603
<v Speaker 2>she's a,</v>

3072
01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.510
<v Speaker 2>she's not a petite lady by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

3073
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.520
<v Speaker 2>She's these big ass wide feet and they were always breaking shoes.</v>

3074
01:24:47.521 --> 01:24:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Like she has all these problems with her feet because her feet were always way</v>

3075
01:24:50.671 --> 01:24:52.020
<v Speaker 2>too wide for women's shoes.</v>

3076
01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:52.740
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3077
01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:57.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's good if you want like a sturdy brick carrying Sicilian,</v>

3078
01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3079
01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.670
<v Speaker 2>that's what my mom's probably,</v>

3080
01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.780
<v Speaker 2>her genetics are really good for carrying heavy shit around like back in the</v>

3081
01:25:03.781 --> 01:25:04.614
<v Speaker 2>homeland.</v>

3082
01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:07.290
<v Speaker 2>But that's like I got those genetics,</v>

3083
01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:07.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3084
01:25:07.681 --> 01:25:07.981
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3085
01:25:07.981 --> 01:25:11.100
<v Speaker 2>it's real clear that like if I don't work out,</v>

3086
01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust myself.</v>

3087
01:25:12.391 --> 01:25:12.781
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3088
01:25:12.781 --> 01:25:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way I resolve issues.</v>

3089
01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't like how quick,</v>

3090
01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.630
<v Speaker 2>quick my temper is.</v>

3091
01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

3092
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I see that Shit doesn't happen for me.</v>

3093
01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Aw,</v>

3094
01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:21.061
<v Speaker 2>what's also,</v>

3095
01:25:21.061 --> 01:25:22.740
<v Speaker 2>but then there's the nature versus nurture thing.</v>

3096
01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know the certain amount of his biological,</v>

3097
01:25:24.301 --> 01:25:25.470
<v Speaker 2>but a certain amount of it is also,</v>

3098
01:25:25.471 --> 01:25:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I've been feeding my body this adrenaline energy potion and my,</v>

3099
01:25:30.451 --> 01:25:35.070
<v Speaker 2>my body from the time I was all small boy has been exploding on things,</v>

3100
01:25:35.071 --> 01:25:36.090
<v Speaker 2>just smashing things.</v>

3101
01:25:36.091 --> 01:25:38.340
<v Speaker 2>And when your body grows up like that,</v>

3102
01:25:38.341 --> 01:25:38.881
<v Speaker 2>and it's sort of,</v>

3103
01:25:38.881 --> 01:25:42.600
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like engineer's itself to perform under those balance loads,</v>

3104
01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:43.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3105
01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:46.800
<v Speaker 2>under those extreme loads rather then when it builds up for that and then when</v>

3106
01:25:46.801 --> 01:25:47.521
<v Speaker 2>there's no load,</v>

3107
01:25:47.521 --> 01:25:48.271
<v Speaker 2>there's no release,</v>

3108
01:25:48.271 --> 01:25:49.200
<v Speaker 2>there's no explosion.</v>

3109
01:25:49.201 --> 01:25:49.740
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

3110
01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.550
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

3111
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:51.600
<v Speaker 2>there's no sprints.</v>

3112
01:25:51.601 --> 01:25:52.710
<v Speaker 2>There's no smash,</v>

3113
01:25:52.711 --> 01:25:53.071
<v Speaker 2>smash,</v>

3114
01:25:53.071 --> 01:25:53.670
<v Speaker 2>smash.</v>

3115
01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:57.150
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden he just got all this smashed juice and it's not going anywhere</v>

3116
01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:58.470
<v Speaker 2>and somebody cuts you off in traffic.</v>

3117
01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.393
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

3118
01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking spoon my smash juice on you.</v>

3119
01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:02.550
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3120
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:03.383
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you,</v>

3121
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a</v>

3122
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.440
<v Speaker 5>lot of people that you see in traffic man,</v>

3123
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:09.350
<v Speaker 5>and they're fucking freaking out and going off on someone.</v>

3124
01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.750
<v Speaker 5>A lot of those people just need,</v>

3125
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:13.460
<v Speaker 5>they need a physical thing.</v>

3126
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 5>They need a physical thing to keep their body in balance.</v>

3127
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.581
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3128
01:26:16.581 --> 01:26:17.750
<v Speaker 5>the body is not,</v>

3129
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 5>it's not even,</v>

3130
01:26:18.921 --> 01:26:20.000
<v Speaker 5>everybody's are different.</v>

3131
01:26:20.001 --> 01:26:20.780
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has a car,</v>

3132
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:22.970
<v Speaker 5>but for a lot of us,</v>

3133
01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.140
<v Speaker 5>we're not getting nearly as much smash out as the buyer.</v>

3134
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:26.781
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3135
01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:27.350
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3136
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.921
<v Speaker 4>It's everybody.</v>

3137
01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I really think everybody can benefit from it.</v>

3138
01:26:29.661 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 4>The human organism was designed for activity,</v>

3139
01:26:31.851 --> 01:26:35.120
<v Speaker 4>not for sitting in front of a computer for nine hours in front of,</v>

3140
01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:35.451
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3141
01:26:35.451 --> 01:26:37.520
<v Speaker 4>driving home and then sitting and watching TV.</v>

3142
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:38.900
<v Speaker 4>We're not designed that way.</v>

3143
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:39.141
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3144
01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:41.570
<v Speaker 4>we're designed to be active and so to compensate,</v>

3145
01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 4>we have to create particularly intense one hour sessions often.</v>

3146
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.970
<v Speaker 4>But because we are going to be sitting in the rest of the time,</v>

3147
01:26:46.971 --> 01:26:49.100
<v Speaker 4>it's just the nature of how our jobs are.</v>

3148
01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:51.740
<v Speaker 4>But that physical release I think is important,</v>

3149
01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:52.551
<v Speaker 4>not just for the body.</v>

3150
01:26:52.551 --> 01:26:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Obviously the health benefits of the body are immense.</v>

3151
01:26:54.951 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 4>But for the mind as well.</v>

3152
01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:57.220
<v Speaker 5>You know what I've been doing man,</v>

3153
01:26:57.221 --> 01:27:01.510
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing light workouts throughout the day instead of like just one big</v>

3154
01:27:01.511 --> 01:27:03.460
<v Speaker 5>fucking crazy workout a day.</v>

3155
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:04.000
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3156
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.110
<v Speaker 5>I had a back issue.</v>

3157
01:27:05.111 --> 01:27:07.410
<v Speaker 5>I kept getting the same muscle pull on my back cause I,</v>

3158
01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3159
01:27:08.410 --> 01:27:11.410
<v Speaker 5>I would let it get like three quarters of the way healed and then jump back into</v>

3160
01:27:11.411 --> 01:27:13.420
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu class and fuck it up again.</v>

3161
01:27:13.421 --> 01:27:15.640
<v Speaker 5>So I had to take like a certain amount of time off.</v>

3162
01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.750
<v Speaker 5>And when I took time off,</v>

3163
01:27:16.751 --> 01:27:19.930
<v Speaker 5>I found out there's a lot of shit that I could still do that wasn't fucking with</v>

3164
01:27:19.931 --> 01:27:20.260
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

3165
01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.640
<v Speaker 5>So I did it like easily.</v>

3166
01:27:21.641 --> 01:27:22.331
<v Speaker 5>So I said,</v>

3167
01:27:22.331 --> 01:27:23.110
<v Speaker 5>let me just,</v>

3168
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:27.220
<v Speaker 5>today I'm just going to do a couple sets of Chin ups and a couple sets of dips</v>

3169
01:27:27.221 --> 01:27:28.060
<v Speaker 5>and that's it.</v>

3170
01:27:28.330 --> 01:27:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Let's see if that fucks with my bag.</v>

3171
01:27:29.741 --> 01:27:29.951
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3172
01:27:29.951 --> 01:27:30.401
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't,</v>

3173
01:27:30.401 --> 01:27:33.100
<v Speaker 5>well let me try it tomorrow I'm going to just do a gut and then I started doing</v>

3174
01:27:33.101 --> 01:27:34.510
<v Speaker 5>all these things throughout the day.</v>

3175
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:35.980
<v Speaker 5>I would do it like several times a day.</v>

3176
01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.520
<v Speaker 5>I would do just a few kettlebell exercises,</v>

3177
01:27:38.521 --> 01:27:39.160
<v Speaker 5>a few,</v>

3178
01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.380
<v Speaker 5>and I've found that I was getting like less sore,</v>

3179
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:43.420
<v Speaker 5>but I was getting like strength gains.</v>

3180
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:46.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like it was because when I was doing it over the course of a few months,</v>

3181
01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.350
<v Speaker 5>I was noticing that when I,</v>

3182
01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:49.420
<v Speaker 5>when I do like these little smaller workouts,</v>

3183
01:27:49.421 --> 01:27:53.560
<v Speaker 5>like a friend of mine told me that he got the best results on his chin ups when</v>

3184
01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:54.130
<v Speaker 5>he would just,</v>

3185
01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:57.640
<v Speaker 5>he installed a chin up bar in his house and every day he would just do 10 chin</v>

3186
01:27:57.641 --> 01:27:58.580
<v Speaker 5>ups every day.</v>

3187
01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.290
<v Speaker 5>Not that hard,</v>

3188
01:27:59.290 --> 01:27:59.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3189
01:27:59.561 --> 01:28:00.400
<v Speaker 5>10 Z Z one,</v>

3190
01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:00.581
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>

3191
01:28:00.581 --> 01:28:02.080
<v Speaker 5>three you'd do 10 and he's done.</v>

3192
01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:06.130
<v Speaker 5>But he did it every day and they said after a while I could do 20 and he goes</v>

3193
01:28:06.131 --> 01:28:06.611
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

3194
01:28:06.611 --> 01:28:07.530
<v Speaker 5>It's just like your body.</v>

3195
01:28:07.531 --> 01:28:09.850
<v Speaker 5>It just gets strong at doing that.</v>

3196
01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:12.280
<v Speaker 5>And there was never a day where he did it to failure.</v>

3197
01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:13.960
<v Speaker 5>He just did it to 10 you know,</v>

3198
01:28:13.961 --> 01:28:15.640
<v Speaker 5>but you do it every day and your body goes,</v>

3199
01:28:15.641 --> 01:28:15.911
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

3200
01:28:15.911 --> 01:28:18.190
<v Speaker 5>we need to this fucking ligaments need more blood,</v>

3201
01:28:18.191 --> 01:28:18.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3202
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:20.200
<v Speaker 5>in fixing and fixing this forearm up.</v>

3203
01:28:20.201 --> 01:28:22.240
<v Speaker 5>And then next thing you know his body,</v>

3204
01:28:22.241 --> 01:28:25.270
<v Speaker 5>it was almost like no pain but gain,</v>

3205
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:26.000
<v Speaker 5>you know</v>

3206
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.110
<v Speaker 4>those bodyweight workouts.</v>

3207
01:28:27.111 --> 01:28:28.700
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people who've had a lot of success with that,</v>

3208
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:30.830
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Herschel Walker that did just a ridiculous</v>

3209
01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:31.580
<v Speaker 5>push ups.</v>

3210
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.770
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people say that Hershel Walker also lifted weights,</v>

3211
01:28:33.771 --> 01:28:34.610
<v Speaker 5>that he lies about it.</v>

3212
01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:35.481
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3213
01:28:35.481 --> 01:28:35.871
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

3214
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:36.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3215
01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:37.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't discredit them.</v>

3216
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:40.610
<v Speaker 5>But I do want to put that out there that I did read a lot of crazy shit that he</v>

3217
01:28:40.611 --> 01:28:40.791
<v Speaker 5>said.</v>

3218
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Like he only drinks like a cup of soup and a fucking low for a couple of pieces</v>

3219
01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:46.880
<v Speaker 5>of bread and a salad that's all eat.</v>

3220
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:47.540
<v Speaker 5>And he,</v>

3221
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:49.280
<v Speaker 5>he'll eat once a day and you're like,</v>

3222
01:28:49.281 --> 01:28:49.970
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3223
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:51.320
<v Speaker 5>where's all of that mass coming from?</v>

3224
01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:53.840
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be numbers involved here.</v>

3225
01:28:53.841 --> 01:28:54.351
<v Speaker 5>There's gotta be,</v>

3226
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:56.440
<v Speaker 5>there's how something has to come in and fill that.</v>

3227
01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't even make any sense and apparently he wants people to think of</v>

3228
01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 5>himself as what he is.</v>

3229
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 5>He takes a lot of pride in being an athletic freak,</v>

3230
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 5>meaning whatever the fuck he is doing and eating and whatever weights he was</v>

3231
01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:07.710
<v Speaker 5>lifting.</v>

3232
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:08.980
<v Speaker 5>The guy's 48 years old,</v>

3233
01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:11.790
<v Speaker 5>he's an amazing monster shape,</v>

3234
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.331
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3235
01:29:12.331 --> 01:29:14.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's still like a real super athlete,</v>

3236
01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:15.810
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3237
01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:16.920
<v Speaker 5>he had like a,</v>

3238
01:29:16.921 --> 01:29:20.850
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was trauma induced multiple personality disorder.</v>

3239
01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:22.920
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was trauma induced,</v>

3240
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3241
01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean from all the years of playing football and funny a lot of issues,</v>

3242
01:29:27.631 --> 01:29:28.381
<v Speaker 5>you know and I think you,</v>

3243
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 5>I believe he wrote a book about that so.</v>

3244
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:32.550
<v Speaker 5>So who knows how much he remembers.</v>

3245
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:37.910
<v Speaker 5>There might be one per Herschel's is seat steak all day and fucking doing squats</v>

3246
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:38.761
<v Speaker 5>and Herschel.</v>

3247
01:29:38.761 --> 01:29:39.320
<v Speaker 5>It's Herman.</v>

3248
01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:39.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3249
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:43.950
<v Speaker 5>that's her ghost who somebody is working out,</v>

3250
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:44.600
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you that.</v>

3251
01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:47.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean he obviously does the pushups and sit ups and everything else too,</v>

3252
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:48.343
<v Speaker 5>the guys and just,</v>

3253
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:49.590
<v Speaker 5>he's just one of those dudes.</v>

3254
01:29:49.591 --> 01:29:50.460
<v Speaker 5>It's just in monster,</v>

3255
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:51.300
<v Speaker 5>monster shape.</v>

3256
01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:55.890
<v Speaker 5>He if he ever gotten a flip or a into MMA when he got into football.</v>

3257
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:57.120
<v Speaker 5>If it was around back then,</v>

3258
01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:59.160
<v Speaker 5>he might've been like an all time great.</v>

3259
01:29:59.400 --> 01:29:59.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3260
01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:00.803
<v Speaker 5>because you think,</v>

3261
01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:01.800
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

3262
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.210
<v Speaker 5>we haven't really seen that yet.</v>

3263
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:05.790
<v Speaker 5>We haven't really seen a guy who was like a soup.</v>

3264
01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.440
<v Speaker 5>We were seeing it and Jon Jones,</v>

3265
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.581
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones,</v>

3266
01:30:08.581 --> 01:30:09.150
<v Speaker 5>we're seeing it.</v>

3267
01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:10.380
<v Speaker 5>But before Jon Jones,</v>

3268
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:15.180
<v Speaker 5>we were never seen like some guy who just can learn shit really fast and he's</v>

3269
01:30:15.181 --> 01:30:17.550
<v Speaker 5>ridiculously strong and it seems like he's just,</v>

3270
01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:22.240
<v Speaker 5>he just has a advantage over everyone he faces when Jon Jones Gravelly Yoda</v>

3271
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:24.300
<v Speaker 5>cheat it and that fucking standing he a teen,</v>

3274
01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:29.911
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3275
01:30:29.911 --> 01:30:31.980
<v Speaker 5>his ability to manipulate bodies.</v>

3276
01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:33.750
<v Speaker 5>It's really freaky to watch,</v>

3277
01:30:33.751 --> 01:30:34.320
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3278
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.510
<v Speaker 5>He's got like some car I describe it.</v>

3279
01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:39.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like he's got like some crazy aunt strength.</v>

3280
01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:43.050
<v Speaker 5>We see an ant pick things up effortlessly and picks up a leaf.</v>

3281
01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:43.351
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3282
01:30:43.351 --> 01:30:43.831
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fuck.</v>

3283

<v Speaker 5>just picking up that thing.</v>

3285
01:30:45.001 --> 01:30:46.110
<v Speaker 5>If you look at it in relation to it,</v>

3286
01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:46.951
<v Speaker 5>to his body,</v>

3287
01:30:46.951 --> 01:30:47.790
<v Speaker 5>like my God,</v>

3288
01:30:47.791 --> 01:30:48.960
<v Speaker 5>I did it like effortlessly.</v>

3289
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:52.680
<v Speaker 5>More impressive to me was his Ryan Bader fight invaders about us.</v>

3290
01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:55.360
<v Speaker 5>He's a great rest of the strong base fucks dude.</v>

3291
01:30:55.410 --> 01:30:56.550
<v Speaker 5>He just throws it around.</v>

3292
01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:57.300
<v Speaker 5>It was impressive.</v>

3293
01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.650
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's ever even had him on his back.</v>

3294
01:30:58.651 --> 01:30:58.831
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3298
01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.000
<v Speaker 5>The hit him a couple of times.</v>

3299
01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

3300
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.770
<v Speaker 5>He does the first time and take a shot.</v>

3301
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:05.430
<v Speaker 5>You can take a shot.</v>

3302
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:06.450
<v Speaker 5>He took some hard shots.</v>

3303
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:07.021
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3304

3305
01:31:07.531 --> 01:31:09.300
<v Speaker 5>How about he figured out Leo striking.</v>

3306
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:10.141
<v Speaker 5>How about that man?</v>

3307
01:31:10.141 --> 01:31:13.260
<v Speaker 5>He had an one tough round and then he came back in a second round him out,</v>

3308
01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:14.130
<v Speaker 5>cracked up,</v>

<v Speaker 5>got him to the ground.</v>

3310
01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:15.900
<v Speaker 5>He cracked him.</v>

3311
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.490
<v Speaker 5>The fucking hard elbow or a punt.</v>

3312
01:31:17.491 --> 01:31:17.931
<v Speaker 5>It was a punch.</v>

3313
01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:18.770
<v Speaker 5>Her elbows number one.</v>

3314
01:31:18.771 --> 01:31:22.410
<v Speaker 5>The first one was like a left hook I think is [inaudible] was coming in time and</v>

3315
01:31:22.411 --> 01:31:23.490
<v Speaker 5>then got him to the ground,</v>

3316
01:31:23.491 --> 01:31:25.950
<v Speaker 5>smashed him with an elbow and that was basically all she wrote.</v>

3317
01:31:26.130 --> 01:31:27.030
<v Speaker 5>It was one elbow,</v>

3318
01:31:27.031 --> 01:31:28.440
<v Speaker 5>the auto got up and he was dizzy.</v>

3319
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:30.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean he really said he couldn't focus.</v>

3320
01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:31.290
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't see well.</v>

3321
01:31:31.291 --> 01:31:32.850
<v Speaker 5>And then John got Ahold of that neck.</v>

3322
01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:33.451
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3323
01:31:33.451 --> 01:31:37.170
<v Speaker 5>it's like that could be Herschel Walker could have been like one of those guys.</v>

3324
01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3325
01:31:37.650 --> 01:31:38.100
<v Speaker 5>he could,</v>

3326
01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:38.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3327
01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 5>there are guys out there,</v>

3328
01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:40.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3329
01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:42.740
<v Speaker 5>the human body as we've talking about reports,</v>

3330
01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.613
<v Speaker 5>they're not equal.</v>

3331
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.513
<v Speaker 5>They're just not.</v>

3332
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:46.680
<v Speaker 5>And some of them were getting better and better and better,</v>

3333
01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:47.520
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3334
01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.510
<v Speaker 5>And back in the day,</v>

3335
01:31:48.511 --> 01:31:50.130
<v Speaker 5>someone like John Jones would have,</v>

3336
01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:50.491
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3337
01:31:50.491 --> 01:31:52.800
<v Speaker 5>a few thousand babies cause they should be on some,</v>

3338
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.281
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3339
01:31:53.281 --> 01:31:55.350
<v Speaker 5>the top warrior and some and some,</v>

3340
01:31:55.351 --> 01:31:55.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3341
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:56.350
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3342
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:57.061
<v Speaker 5>rotting fourth.</v>

3343
01:31:57.061 --> 01:31:57.241
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3344
01:31:57.241 --> 01:31:57.690
<v Speaker 5>I read it,</v>

3345
01:31:57.690 --> 01:31:58.441
<v Speaker 5>I read a stat,</v>

3346
01:31:58.441 --> 01:31:59.274
<v Speaker 5>that gang,</v>

3347
01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 5>they found</v>

3348
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:05.250
<v Speaker 4>a certain DNA and his y chromosome and Gaviscon is related to 0.5% of the</v>

3349
01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:07.210
<v Speaker 4>world's population.</v>

3350
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

3351
01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:08.981
<v Speaker 4>5%.</v>

3352
01:32:08.981 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 4>It's like 8% of all the Asiatic people,</v>

3353
01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:15.880
<v Speaker 4>but 0.5% of the entire world because of just the amount of people that he had</v>

3354
01:32:15.881 --> 01:32:18.040
<v Speaker 4>sex with and his descendants had sex with.</v>

3355
01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Because the cube Lecan then went into power and he would,</v>

3356
01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3357
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:22.750
<v Speaker 4>he ran the Chinese dynasty.</v>

3358
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.100
<v Speaker 4>But that kind of effect,</v>

3359
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:24.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3360
01:32:24.551 --> 01:32:25.000
<v Speaker 4>we won't,</v>

3361
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.700
<v Speaker 4>we won't ever see anything like that handling 10% 10% of America will</v>

3362
01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.850
<v Speaker 4>Chamberlain's DNA.</v>

3363
01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:32.411
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3364
01:32:32.411 --> 01:32:35.050
<v Speaker 4>But there was something to be sending people decent Gingiss count fucked.</v>

3365
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:36.520
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't even have viagara back then.</v>

3366
01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.260
<v Speaker 4>He was dead.</v>

3367
01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

3368
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:42.100
<v Speaker 4>he was planning inside.</v>

3369
01:32:42.101 --> 01:32:42.151
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3370
01:32:42.151 --> 01:32:42.301
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3371
01:32:42.301 --> 01:32:44.260
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to have panguses,</v>

3372
01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:44.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3373
01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.460
<v Speaker 4>and then there was no pulling out for Gaviscon.</v>

3374
01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.433
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3375
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:48.191
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3376
01:32:48.191 --> 01:32:50.020
<v Speaker 4>He must've just shot loads and it all day.</v>

3377
01:32:50.021 --> 01:32:52.660
<v Speaker 4>All this amazing that that's how people rolled back then.</v>

3378
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:54.580
<v Speaker 4>They just made as many kids as they could.</v>

3379
01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3380
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3381
01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:55.151
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3382
01:32:55.151 --> 01:32:55.871
<v Speaker 4>not everybody,</v>

3383
01:32:55.871 --> 01:32:56.290
<v Speaker 4>but gangs,</v>

3384
01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Kong,</v>

3385
01:32:56.650 --> 01:32:57.483
<v Speaker 4>his boys.</v>

3386
01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:57.731
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3387
01:32:57.731 --> 01:32:57.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3388
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.661
<v Speaker 4>just assuming,</v>

3389
01:32:58.661 --> 01:32:59.200
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3390
01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.100
<v Speaker 4>We just fucking,</v>

3391
01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:00.371
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3392
01:33:00.371 --> 01:33:04.840
<v Speaker 4>might be slanders pussies must be so disgusting at the DNA test for Ganga</v>

3393
01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:05.651
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] in particular,</v>

3394
01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:06.850
<v Speaker 4>but it probably didn't smell good.</v>

3395
01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:08.350
<v Speaker 4>But I think,</v>

3396
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:11.200
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something to be said for that kind of phenomenon because</v>

3397
01:33:11.201 --> 01:33:12.730
<v Speaker 4>nowadays the best,</v>

3398
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:13.001
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3399
01:33:13.001 --> 01:33:13.290
<v Speaker 4>gangs,</v>

3400
01:33:13.290 --> 01:33:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Khan was not only physically,</v>

3401
01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:15.673
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3402
01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.940
<v Speaker 4>unbeatable as he rose up to the tribes and the Mongol,</v>

3403
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:19.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3404
01:33:19.241 --> 01:33:20.400
<v Speaker 4>step in the plateau.</v>

3405
01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 4>Nobody could defeat him.</v>

3406
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.450
<v Speaker 4>He won all his tribal battles.</v>

3407
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:24.520
<v Speaker 4>But then as a military mastermind,</v>

3408
01:33:24.521 --> 01:33:26.020
<v Speaker 4>he was brilliant as far as what he did.</v>

3409
01:33:26.021 --> 01:33:28.810
<v Speaker 4>Kind of revolutionized a lot of the theories of warfare.</v>

3410
01:33:28.811 --> 01:33:30.190
<v Speaker 4>So very intelligent,</v>

3411
01:33:30.191 --> 01:33:31.450
<v Speaker 4>very physically capable.</v>

3412
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.130
<v Speaker 4>And by his,</v>

3413
01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3414
01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:34.900
<v Speaker 4>sexual encounters,</v>

3415
01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:36.070
<v Speaker 4>at least the genetics part.</v>

3416
01:33:36.071 --> 01:33:38.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean fatherhood was a whole other issue and you know,</v>

3417
01:33:38.741 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Speaker 4>the humanity involved in all the ratio.</v>

3418
01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:41.860
<v Speaker 4>Here's a great part as far as,</v>

3419
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:45.610
<v Speaker 4>as far as genetically,</v>

3420
01:33:45.611 --> 01:33:49.030
<v Speaker 4>and this is how strip clubs were genetically advancing.</v>

3421
01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:49.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3422
01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:53.290
<v Speaker 4>the genetic race probably played some positive part in that.</v>

3423
01:33:53.291 --> 01:33:54.520
<v Speaker 4>And that'll never happen again.</v>

3424
01:33:54.521 --> 01:33:56.320
<v Speaker 4>Like the geniuses of our world,</v>

3425
01:33:56.470 --> 01:34:00.460
<v Speaker 4>like the most amazing people who could genetically speaking purely,</v>

3426
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:01.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3427
01:34:01.061 --> 01:34:02.110
<v Speaker 4>advance the human race.</v>

3428
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.030
<v Speaker 4>They're not having a thousand babies anymore.</v>

3429
01:34:04.031 --> 01:34:06.640
<v Speaker 4>They're not even having 10 they're having one or two,</v>

3430
01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.151
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3431
01:34:07.151 --> 01:34:11.350
<v Speaker 4>But really probably what would be beneficial would be if they had tons of</v>

3432
01:34:11.351 --> 01:34:11.770
<v Speaker 4>babies.</v>

3433
01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:11.951
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3434
01:34:11.951 --> 01:34:14.020
<v Speaker 4>that would really actually further the human rights.</v>

3435
01:34:14.021 --> 01:34:18.430
<v Speaker 4>That's what the principal of sexual selection as it happens in the animal</v>

3436
01:34:18.431 --> 01:34:19.000
<v Speaker 4>kingdom,</v>

3437
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:19.870
<v Speaker 4>that's how it works.</v>

3438
01:34:19.871 --> 01:34:20.321
<v Speaker 4>The biggest,</v>

3439
01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:20.771
<v Speaker 4>smartest,</v>

3440
01:34:20.771 --> 01:34:22.780
<v Speaker 4>baddest line has the most babies.</v>

3441
01:34:22.781 --> 01:34:23.021
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3442
01:34:23.021 --> 01:34:27.250
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't happen in man that as we approach some sort of a symbiotic</v>

3443
01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:29.620
<v Speaker 4>relationship with computers and technology,</v>

3444
01:34:29.621 --> 01:34:30.730
<v Speaker 4>that's inescapable.</v>

3445
01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:33.550
<v Speaker 4>The power of the physical becomes less important.</v>

3446
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:34.663
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3447
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.260
<v Speaker 4>It should be the smartest person,</v>

3448
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:37.270
<v Speaker 4>the smartest people,</v>

3449
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:40.450
<v Speaker 4>but have to get that puts the people who have the power now aren't the</v>

3450
01:34:40.451 --> 01:34:41.440
<v Speaker 4>physically strongest.</v>

3451
01:34:41.441 --> 01:34:42.251
<v Speaker 4>They're the smartest.</v>

3452
01:34:42.251 --> 01:34:43.084
<v Speaker 4>They get the money,</v>

3453
01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:43.590
<v Speaker 4>the money.</v>

3454
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:45.210
<v Speaker 4>You got to listen to Albert.</v>

3455
01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:45.401
<v Speaker 4>Gina,</v>

3456
01:34:45.401 --> 01:34:46.550
<v Speaker 4>you get first you get the money,</v>

3457
01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.291
<v Speaker 4>then you have the power.</v>

3458
01:34:47.291 --> 01:34:48.124
<v Speaker 4>Then you get the women.</v>

3459
01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.100
<v Speaker 4>He didn't say women.</v>

3460
01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:49.661
<v Speaker 4>He said pussy,</v>

3461
01:34:49.661 --> 01:34:50.494
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

3462
01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Don't ever clean it up by the foot.</v>

3463
01:34:52.871 --> 01:34:53.704
<v Speaker 4>You'll get the money.</v>

3464
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.910
<v Speaker 4>Then you'll get the power.</v>

3465
01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:56.140
<v Speaker 4>Then you'll get the post.</v>

3466
01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:56.731
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3467
01:34:56.731 --> 01:34:57.531
<v Speaker 4>maybe he was at Scarface.</v>

3468
01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 4>Scarface.</v>

3469
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Did he say you get the posing or women can't remember?</v>

3470
01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:00.731
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

3471
01:35:00.731 --> 01:35:03.680
<v Speaker 5>I've only seen that once and I have never seen it usually like watching the</v>

3472
01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:04.630
<v Speaker 5>Italian movies.</v>

3473
01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.270
<v Speaker 5>Did you say Italian movies?</v>

3474
01:35:06.271 --> 01:35:06.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3475
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't really like the Italian movies too much,</v>

3476
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:09.403
<v Speaker 5>Brian.</v>

3477
01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.311
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3478
01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:11.240
<v Speaker 5>Brian.</v>

3479
01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.290
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3480
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:12.620
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3481
01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Obviously the smart people are not getting to breathe at the same rate as</v>

3482
01:35:16.341 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 5>Gingiss Kahn did,</v>

3483
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

3484
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:22.400
<v Speaker 5>I think people in general are just much smarter and much more aware,</v>

3485
01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.170
<v Speaker 5>much more in tune than,</v>

3486
01:35:24.171 --> 01:35:25.004
<v Speaker 5>than ever before.</v>

3487
01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:25.701
<v Speaker 5>But as far as like,</v>

3488
01:35:25.701 --> 01:35:25.911
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3489
01:35:25.911 --> 01:35:26.990
<v Speaker 5>like Super Geniuses,</v>

3490
01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:27.531
<v Speaker 5>the rain,</v>

3491
01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 5>the biological race over the technological race,</v>

3492
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:34.610
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me the technological is so fucking far ahead of the biological that</v>

3493
01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:38.150
<v Speaker 5>it's almost ridiculous to assume that the biological is ever going to catch up,</v>

3494
01:35:38.151 --> 01:35:39.710
<v Speaker 5>whether it's through natural selection or not.</v>

3495
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:44.210
<v Speaker 5>It just seems like technology in the short amount of time that it's been around</v>

3496
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:47.630
<v Speaker 5>has achieved so much momentum and so much innovation.</v>

3497
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:52.630
<v Speaker 5>It's gone so many generations and models greater than what it was when it was</v>

3498
01:35:52.641 --> 01:35:55.940
<v Speaker 5>first introduced that it seems like inevitable that that's going to be the big</v>

3499
01:35:55.941 --> 01:35:56.421
<v Speaker 5>tip off.</v>

3500
01:35:56.421 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be a technological innovation sort of a thing that that changes</v>

3501
01:36:00.231 --> 01:36:03.650
<v Speaker 5>everything and that the idea that the human body is going to like get good</v>

3502
01:36:03.651 --> 01:36:04.790
<v Speaker 5>enough to catch up to that.</v>

3503
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:05.930
<v Speaker 5>I think that's ridiculous.</v>

3504
01:36:05.931 --> 01:36:08.780
<v Speaker 5>I think what's going to happen is there's going to be some sort of a large scale</v>

3505
01:36:08.781 --> 01:36:10.730
<v Speaker 5>genetic engineering of the human body.</v>

3506
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.420
<v Speaker 5>We're too late,</v>

3507
01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:12.370
<v Speaker 5>we're too late for the,</v>

3508
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:13.550
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be super people,</v>

3509
01:36:13.551 --> 01:36:13.910
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

3510
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:14.630
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be,</v>

3511
01:36:14.630 --> 01:36:15.560
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be Thor,</v>

3512
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:15.891
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3513
01:36:15.891 --> 01:36:16.400
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna have,</v>

3514
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.950
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna have the ability to fly.</v>

3515
01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:18.920
<v Speaker 5>And that's creating,</v>

3516
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:22.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean a lot of this technology's moved by genius people,</v>

3517
01:36:22.971 --> 01:36:25.550
<v Speaker 5>outliers for a lot of the time and we're also not,</v>

3518
01:36:25.551 --> 01:36:25.890
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

3519
01:36:25.890 --> 01:36:30.770
<v Speaker 5>we're closing down the possibilities for the genius to genius mating that would</v>

3520
01:36:30.771 --> 01:36:32.000
<v Speaker 5>naturally occur to create.</v>

3521
01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:35.510
<v Speaker 5>That's okay cause a genius can just shoot a load into a cup and make a million</v>

3522
01:36:35.511 --> 01:36:36.410
<v Speaker 5>new people from it.</v>

3523
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:38.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think that's true.</v>

3524
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:42.740
<v Speaker 5>Maybe then when we figured out how the body is actually created,</v>

3525
01:36:42.741 --> 01:36:44.390
<v Speaker 5>how organs are created,</v>

3526
01:36:44.391 --> 01:36:46.430
<v Speaker 5>and we've figured out the ability to replicate them,</v>

3527
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:48.620
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be able to figure out the way to make a super body,</v>

3528
01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:49.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3529
01:36:49.191 --> 01:36:53.390
<v Speaker 5>and whether it's through some sort of a genetic manipulation to a person that is</v>

3530
01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:55.400
<v Speaker 5>already exist in a certain form,</v>

3531
01:36:55.401 --> 01:36:56.810
<v Speaker 5>like in fucking captain America.</v>

3532
01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.900
<v Speaker 5>When they lock them into that tube and he's Zap him with all that blue shit and</v>

3533
01:36:59.901 --> 01:37:00.770
<v Speaker 5>then boom,</v>

3534
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:02.330
<v Speaker 5>he comes out of super person.</v>

3535
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

3536
01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:04.940
<v Speaker 5>that's not too far away.</v>

3537
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:06.500
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think?</v>

3538
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:11.450
<v Speaker 5>That seems to me like it would be way easier to do then it would be to send</v>

3539
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:16.451
<v Speaker 5>picture through the air and have it go to someone else in Australia or China or</v>

3540
01:37:16.941 --> 01:37:17.570
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3541
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:21.260
<v Speaker 5>That seems to me way more impossible.</v>

3542
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.080
<v Speaker 5>Then you can improve a biological unit.</v>

3543
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.370
<v Speaker 5>We understand sells,</v>

3544
01:37:25.371 --> 01:37:26.510
<v Speaker 5>we understand cell division,</v>

3545
01:37:26.511 --> 01:37:28.800
<v Speaker 5>we understand the my mitochondria,</v>

3546
01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.250
<v Speaker 5>the power plants of the cells.</v>

3547
01:37:31.251 --> 01:37:32.420
<v Speaker 5>We understand genetics.</v>

3548
01:37:32.421 --> 01:37:34.160
<v Speaker 5>We sort of mapped out the human genome,</v>

3549
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:37.150
<v Speaker 5>our understanding increases and that we shouldn't say our cause.</v>

3550
01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:38.660
<v Speaker 5>It's people far smarter than you or I,</v>

3551
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:40.040
<v Speaker 5>but those people,</v>

3552
01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:40.371
<v Speaker 5>the people,</v>

3553
01:37:40.371 --> 01:37:40.850
<v Speaker 5>the head of it,</v>

3554
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:43.730
<v Speaker 5>their understanding increases every single year.</v>

3555
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Their data grows,</v>

3556
01:37:45.051 --> 01:37:46.310
<v Speaker 5>their abilities grow.</v>

3557
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.930
<v Speaker 5>It's going to reach some point.</v>

3558
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.801
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

3559
01:37:48.801 --> 01:37:51.920
<v Speaker 5>it seems obvious that in the future it's going to reach some point where they're</v>

3560
01:37:51.921 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 5>going to be able to make a fucking superhuman.</v>

3561
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.500
<v Speaker 5>Well then the moral spiritual implications as far as whether that's a good thing</v>

3562
01:37:58.501 --> 01:38:00.420
<v Speaker 5>or a not a good thing come into play.</v>

3563
01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:00.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3564
01:38:00.811 --> 01:38:03.180
<v Speaker 5>It's like who the saw movies of exploring what is,</v>

3565
01:38:03.181 --> 01:38:04.980
<v Speaker 5>why is there a good thing at all?</v>

3566
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 5>Why is there a bad thing?</v>

3567
01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:06.710
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3568
01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:09.540
<v Speaker 5>Why does the universe have that even as an option?</v>

3569
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:10.021
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3570
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:12.180
<v Speaker 5>it seems to be that you have to have it in order to,</v>

3571
01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 5>to inspire movement.</v>

3572
01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.920
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like you have to have tyranny to,</v>

3573
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.930
<v Speaker 5>to really come up with freedom.</v>

3574
01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:19.831
<v Speaker 5>You have to like,</v>

3575
01:38:19.831 --> 01:38:20.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3576
01:38:20.071 --> 01:38:21.900
<v Speaker 5>you have to have people pushing you down.</v>

3577
01:38:21.901 --> 01:38:23.070
<v Speaker 5>Resistance from the opposite.</v>

3578
01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:23.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3579
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:24.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3580
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.750
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3581
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:25.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

3582
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:26.003
<v Speaker 5>it seems,</v>

3583
01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.530
<v Speaker 5>why else would the universe have evil?</v>

3584
01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean all this stuff that exists,</v>

3585
01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:31.260
<v Speaker 5>terrible feelings,</v>

3586
01:38:31.261 --> 01:38:31.891
<v Speaker 5>horrible things.</v>

3587
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:32.850
<v Speaker 5>You see atrocities.</v>

3588
01:38:33.210 --> 01:38:35.610
<v Speaker 5>The guy in Brooklyn who lit the woman on fire and the elevator.</v>

3589
01:38:35.611 --> 01:38:35.881
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3590
01:38:35.881 --> 01:38:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Why do these even exist?</v>

3591
01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:40.140
<v Speaker 5>Why does the universe have this as an option?</v>

3592
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:45.260
<v Speaker 5>If this does seem to be some sort of a mechanism or a program that's moving</v>

3593
01:38:45.481 --> 01:38:49.260
<v Speaker 5>towards a very specific and idea or a goal,</v>

3594
01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.020
<v Speaker 5>something specific is going to,</v>

3595
01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:52.320
<v Speaker 5>there's something going on.</v>

3596
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.740
<v Speaker 5>There's a process that the human beings involved in just like bees making a</v>

3597
01:38:55.741 --> 01:38:56.251
<v Speaker 5>beehive.</v>

3598
01:38:56.251 --> 01:38:59.940
<v Speaker 5>There's were involved in some really super complicated process.</v>

3599
01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.090
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

3600
01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:01.980
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that,</v>

3601
01:39:01.981 --> 01:39:02.910
<v Speaker 5>but I think that there's,</v>

3602
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.661
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3603
01:39:03.661 --> 01:39:06.210
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of looking at it kind of a linear curve of progress.</v>

3604
01:39:06.211 --> 01:39:09.360
<v Speaker 5>And I think there's some things missing from our evolution and I think our</v>

3605
01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:11.340
<v Speaker 5>spiritual base has gotten thrown way off.</v>

3606
01:39:11.341 --> 01:39:14.340
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know if that's just the bottom of the religions or think it's</v>

3607
01:39:14.341 --> 01:39:15.750
<v Speaker 5>possible that that's natural.</v>

3608
01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:18.310
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it's possible that this,</v>

3609
01:39:18.311 --> 01:39:18.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3610
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:22.290
<v Speaker 5>this lack of a connection to the spiritual,</v>

3611
01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:27.291
<v Speaker 5>it was almost necessary to create this technological fucking bizarro world that</v>

3612
01:39:28.891 --> 01:39:29.340
<v Speaker 5>we live,</v>

3613
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:33.750
<v Speaker 5>we live in with no conscience and no thinking about the future and no planning.</v>

3614
01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like you need a disconnect.</v>

3615
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:38.880
<v Speaker 5>In order for this thing to arise out of the human animal,</v>

3616
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.720
<v Speaker 5>we need to become some sort of a technological zombie that just creates and goes</v>

3617
01:39:42.721 --> 01:39:43.920
<v Speaker 5>forth and does its bidding.</v>

3618
01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 5>Does the bidding of the technology,</v>

3619
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.190
<v Speaker 5>much like those fucking mushrooms,</v>

3620
01:39:47.191 --> 01:39:49.680
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a quarter Samsung washer and it gets inside the fucking ants head</v>

3621
01:39:49.681 --> 01:39:51.420
<v Speaker 5>and makes them bloat and the moth.</v>

3622
01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:52.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3623
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.831
<v Speaker 5>Well it does it.</v>

3624
01:39:52.831 --> 01:39:53.461
<v Speaker 5>The ants too,</v>

3625
01:39:53.461 --> 01:39:53.761
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3626
01:39:53.761 --> 01:39:54.800
<v Speaker 5>Isn't there a fungus that grows it?</v>

3627
01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:55.693
<v Speaker 5>I've seen.</v>

3628
01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's really what it's like.</v>

3629
01:39:57.571 --> 01:39:58.320
<v Speaker 5>It's like we are,</v>

3630
01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.210
<v Speaker 5>we were infected with technology.</v>

3631
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:03.620
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like technology is what's keeping us from,</v>

3632
01:40:03.650 --> 01:40:08.280
<v Speaker 5>from recognizing all these other spiritual realms and keeping us pushing forth</v>

3633
01:40:08.281 --> 01:40:09.031
<v Speaker 5>in a certain direction.</v>

3634
01:40:09.031 --> 01:40:11.610
<v Speaker 5>Because if you think about it without any technology whatsoever,</v>

3635
01:40:11.611 --> 01:40:13.020
<v Speaker 5>they would never be able to stop mushrooms.</v>

3636
01:40:13.021 --> 01:40:13.831
<v Speaker 5>They would never be able to stop,</v>

3637
01:40:13.831 --> 01:40:14.101
<v Speaker 5>pause.</v>

3638
01:40:14.101 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't know anything where anything is.</v>

3639
01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:16.590
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't be able to rescue.</v>

3640
01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:17.820
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't be able to put you in jail.</v>

3641
01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:18.930
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't be able to make laws.</v>

3642
01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:19.740
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't be able to,</v>

3643
01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:20.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3644
01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:20.680
<v Speaker 5>communicate.</v>

3645
01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.110
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't have the news,</v>

3646
01:40:22.111 --> 01:40:22.890
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't have,</v>

3647
01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:23.723
<v Speaker 5>there would be nothing,</v>

3648
01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:24.511
<v Speaker 5>there'd be nothing.</v>

3649
01:40:24.511 --> 01:40:25.830
<v Speaker 5>So it would be impossible.</v>

3650
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:29.850
<v Speaker 5>So technology allows people to be suppressed as much as it gives them freedom</v>

3651
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:35.030
<v Speaker 5>and also allows people to be suppressed and stay zombies and keep on the task.</v>

3652
01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.900
<v Speaker 5>Keep on the task.</v>

3653
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:37.621
<v Speaker 5>I wonder,</v>

3654
01:40:37.621 --> 01:40:37.831
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3655
01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:38.041
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3656
01:40:38.041 --> 01:40:39.210
<v Speaker 5>everything else is natural.</v>

3657
01:40:39.211 --> 01:40:40.140
<v Speaker 5>We look at wolves,</v>

3658
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:43.800
<v Speaker 5>wolves is whatever fucked up thing they do where they push the Beta male out and</v>

3659
01:40:43.801 --> 01:40:44.850
<v Speaker 5>he's going to starve to death.</v>

3660
01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:45.361
<v Speaker 5>We look at,</v>

3661
01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:46.051
<v Speaker 5>it's horrible,</v>

3662
01:40:46.051 --> 01:40:49.500
<v Speaker 5>but we also know that it's natural and it happens over and over and over and</v>

3663
01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:50.220
<v Speaker 5>over again.</v>

3664
01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:53.860
<v Speaker 5>And then there's of course a bunch of different scenarios that can take place.</v>

3665
01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 5>There's</v>

3666
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.480
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different things that can happen,</v>

3667
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.840
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately they're moving in the same sort of a natural direction every</v>

3668
01:40:58.841 --> 01:40:59.590
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3669
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:03.370
<v Speaker 2>How did we not know that our lives are not exactly the same way,</v>

3670
01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:07.630
<v Speaker 2>just far more complex and intertwined and we're aware of it.</v>

3671
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:10.570
<v Speaker 2>So it gives us this illusion that somehow or another,</v>

3672
01:41:10.571 --> 01:41:12.940
<v Speaker 2>this is just a random series of events.</v>

3673
01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:13.881
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3674
01:41:13.881 --> 01:41:14.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3675
01:41:14.690 --> 01:41:15.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3676
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.920
<v Speaker 4>obviously that's,</v>

3677
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:17.270
<v Speaker 4>that's certainly a possibility,</v>

3678
01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:21.500
<v Speaker 4>but I think that I do strongly believe that there were certain situations in</v>

3679
01:41:21.501 --> 01:41:26.060
<v Speaker 4>which key people in the wrong moments and key movements in society kind of</v>

3680
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:29.840
<v Speaker 4>debilitated this natural spiritual flourishing that should have grown in</v>

3681
01:41:29.841 --> 01:41:31.340
<v Speaker 4>conjunction with the technology.</v>

3682
01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Maybe technology was always destined to out pace it a little bit</v>

3683
01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.660
<v Speaker 2>job to eliminate people.</v>

3684
01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why you're here.</v>

3685
01:41:37.681 --> 01:41:38.520
<v Speaker 2>You ever thought about that?</v>

3686
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:39.271
<v Speaker 2>Like this,</v>

3687
01:41:39.271 --> 01:41:42.990
<v Speaker 2>this conversation is getting heard about hundreds of thousands of small,</v>

3688
01:41:42.991 --> 01:41:43.410
<v Speaker 2>humble,</v>

3689
01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:45.090
<v Speaker 2>like a little tiny spark,</v>

3690
01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:45.931
<v Speaker 2>a little little,</v>

3691
01:41:45.931 --> 01:41:46.380
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

3692
01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:48.960
<v Speaker 2>little hot shoe that gets into the fucking,</v>

3693
01:41:49.230 --> 01:41:50.970
<v Speaker 2>the blood screens dream of the world,</v>

3694
01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:52.920
<v Speaker 2>a little little virus that spreads out there.</v>

3695
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that is part of the Movement for change right now.</v>

3696
01:41:55.111 --> 01:41:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I think we're out of balance as a society and I think as a world,</v>

3697
01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.830
<v Speaker 2>and I think we had to get back into it,</v>

3698
01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:03.780
<v Speaker 2>probably our indignation is natural.</v>

3699
01:42:03.810 --> 01:42:05.310
<v Speaker 2>All the reaction is natural.</v>

3700
01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Me In a Ron Paul shirt is natural.</v>

3701
01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:08.680
<v Speaker 2>It's all natural.</v>

3702
01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:08.880
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3703
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a push into a certain direction and then that's the natural mode,</v>

3704
01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:14.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3705
01:42:14.250 --> 01:42:15.090
<v Speaker 2>of response.</v>

3706
01:42:15.091 --> 01:42:15.924
<v Speaker 2>It's what's supposed to do.</v>

3707
01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:17.640
<v Speaker 4>And I think it has to happen.</v>

3708
01:42:17.641 --> 01:42:18.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3709
01:42:18.210 --> 01:42:19.620
<v Speaker 4>a lot of laws have to change.</v>

3710
01:42:19.621 --> 01:42:20.490
<v Speaker 4>Things have to be dropped.</v>

3711
01:42:20.491 --> 01:42:20.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3712
01:42:20.671 --> 01:42:22.170
<v Speaker 4>we have shortcuts to get there.</v>

3713
01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.280
<v Speaker 4>That's the fucked up thing.</v>

3714
01:42:23.281 --> 01:42:25.860
<v Speaker 4>And these shortcuts grow naturally all over the,</v>

3715
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:26.850
<v Speaker 4>all over the world.</v>

3716
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:28.860
<v Speaker 4>And there just happened to be illegal.</v>

3717
01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:29.701
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3718
01:42:29.701 --> 01:42:32.820
<v Speaker 4>we gotta we gotta change that and we got to give people the shortcuts but also</v>

3719
01:42:32.821 --> 01:42:34.020
<v Speaker 4>the foundation behind it.</v>

3720
01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:34.411
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3721
01:42:34.411 --> 01:42:35.460
<v Speaker 4>having somebody just saying,</v>

3722
01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:35.881
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3723
01:42:35.881 --> 01:42:36.541
<v Speaker 4>take mushrooms,</v>

3724
01:42:36.541 --> 01:42:37.111
<v Speaker 4>go willy nilly.</v>

3725
01:42:37.111 --> 01:42:40.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like telling someone to go into the deep jungle and not saying,</v>

3726
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:40.331
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3727
01:42:40.331 --> 01:42:40.680
<v Speaker 4>you got,</v>

3728
01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.910
<v Speaker 4>you got to bring mosquito repellent.</v>

3729
01:42:42.090 --> 01:42:43.210
<v Speaker 4>You got to bring this to sign.</v>

3730
01:42:43.230 --> 01:42:44.520
<v Speaker 4>Here's some scuba equipment.</v>

3731
01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:47.160
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] good idea either.</v>

3732
01:42:47.161 --> 01:42:47.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3733
01:42:47.401 --> 01:42:48.360
<v Speaker 4>you still have to,</v>

3734
01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:51.150
<v Speaker 4>there's these structures in place and the Shamans of had it figured out,</v>

3735
01:42:51.151 --> 01:42:55.590
<v Speaker 4>it's thousands of years of lineage of teaching and how to explore these realms.</v>

3736
01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:56.241
<v Speaker 4>Like you say,</v>

3737
01:42:56.241 --> 01:42:57.870
<v Speaker 4>it's scuba gear is the perfect analogy.</v>

3738
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3739
01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:01.740
<v Speaker 4>don't go deep water diving unless you know exactly what you're doing.</v>

3740
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:02.730
<v Speaker 4>But if you do,</v>

3741
01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:03.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3742
01:43:03.031 --> 01:43:06.600
<v Speaker 4>you can get to these realms that give you direct access to God.</v>

3743
01:43:06.601 --> 01:43:09.540
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why religions have pushed against that,</v>

3744
01:43:09.541 --> 01:43:12.360
<v Speaker 4>if you have direct access to the all to the universe,</v>

3745
01:43:12.361 --> 01:43:12.721
<v Speaker 4>to God,</v>

3746
01:43:12.721 --> 01:43:13.920
<v Speaker 4>whatever name you want to put on it,</v>

3747
01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:15.870
<v Speaker 4>then you don't need the priests.</v>

3748
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:16.960
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't need the priests,</v>

3749
01:43:16.961 --> 01:43:17.794
<v Speaker 4>they have no power.</v>

3750
01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:18.301
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3751
01:43:18.301 --> 01:43:22.590
<v Speaker 4>So all of these religions came up putting intermediaries in place so that they</v>

3752
01:43:22.591 --> 01:43:25.830
<v Speaker 4>could develop these massive power structures using guilt and different</v>

3753
01:43:25.831 --> 01:43:27.630
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms to control the people.</v>

3754
01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:28.733
<v Speaker 4>And it's a,</v>

3755
01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:32.070
<v Speaker 4>I think we got off course and now here's a chance to correct.</v>

3756
01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:32.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3757
01:43:32.421 --> 01:43:35.840
<v Speaker 2>that was John Marco Legros thoughts for the whole creation of the Bible in the</v>

3758
01:43:35.841 --> 01:43:36.441
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

3759
01:43:36.441 --> 01:43:40.760
<v Speaker 2>That it's suppression of information that the original stories were hidden in</v>

3760
01:43:40.761 --> 01:43:41.001
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3761
01:43:41.001 --> 01:43:41.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3762
01:43:41.301 --> 01:43:41.930
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3763
01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:46.910
<v Speaker 2>these a little tails in the Bible with all these little hidden clues,</v>

3764
01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:49.460
<v Speaker 2>but that really was all about was psychedelic mushrooms.</v>

3765
01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 2>That these people were just trying preserve this information</v>

3766
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:53.630
<v Speaker 5>when they were captured by the Romans.</v>

3767
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:55.610
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating if that is the,</v>

3768
01:43:55.670 --> 01:43:55.951
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3769
01:43:55.951 --> 01:43:56.290
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3770
01:43:56.290 --> 01:43:57.530
<v Speaker 5>the root of it all.</v>

3771
01:43:57.670 --> 01:43:58.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3772
01:43:58.130 --> 01:43:58.821
<v Speaker 5>the root of it all.</v>

3773
01:43:58.821 --> 01:44:02.810
<v Speaker 5>Just a few people trying to keep this experience connection to something else</v>

3774
01:44:02.811 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>

3775
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 5>whether it's real or not,</v>

3776
01:44:04.431 --> 01:44:05.720
<v Speaker 5>whether it's real or imagined.</v>

3777
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.680
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

3778
01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.390
<v Speaker 5>Christianity may maybe not real,</v>

3779
01:44:08.391 --> 01:44:09.950
<v Speaker 5>but fucking helps you for sure.</v>

3780
01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:10.341
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3781
01:44:10.341 --> 01:44:11.210
<v Speaker 5>something's going on.</v>

3782
01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:11.700
<v Speaker 5>If something,</v>

3783
01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 5>if it's fake and yet it still helps.</v>

3784
01:44:14.451 --> 01:44:16.520
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of people believe it or not,</v>

3785
01:44:16.521 --> 01:44:19.250
<v Speaker 5>they believe and because they believe they become better,</v>

3786
01:44:19.251 --> 01:44:20.450
<v Speaker 5>their lives have been enriched.</v>

3787
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:22.340
<v Speaker 5>So that's an effective tool,</v>

3788
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:23.030
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3789
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.510
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3790
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.811
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3791
01:44:23.811 --> 01:44:24.081
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3792
01:44:24.081 --> 01:44:25.190
<v Speaker 5>you also have to think,</v>

3793
01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:25.611
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3794
01:44:25.611 --> 01:44:28.790
<v Speaker 5>obviously there needs to be a place for that and Christianity can fill it,</v>

3795
01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:31.130
<v Speaker 5>but is it the best tool to fill that?</v>

3796
01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:32.773
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3797
01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:36.530
<v Speaker 5>that's the difference between like,</v>

3798
01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:36.861
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3799
01:44:36.861 --> 01:44:37.880
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people say like,</v>

3800
01:44:37.881 --> 01:44:39.020
<v Speaker 5>why would you,</v>

3801
01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.890
<v Speaker 5>why would you talk bad about someone's ideas,</v>

3802
01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:43.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3803
01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.270
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to like Christianity,</v>

3804
01:44:44.271 --> 01:44:47.000
<v Speaker 5>but yet you espoused all these ridiculous ideas when it comes to drugs.</v>

3805
01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:48.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3806
01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:48.913
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

3807
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:50.570
<v Speaker 5>it's not all drugs,</v>

3808
01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.530
<v Speaker 5>it's psychedelics.</v>

3809
01:44:51.531 --> 01:44:52.364
<v Speaker 5>And second of all,</v>

3810
01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.233
<v Speaker 5>just try one.</v>

3811
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:56.540
<v Speaker 5>Just take a deep mushroom trip and tell him we've got something going on.</v>

3812
01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:00.290
<v Speaker 5>It's really one of those things where it's a repeatable experience.</v>

3813
01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.131
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3814
01:45:01.131 --> 01:45:02.060
<v Speaker 5>anyone can do it.</v>

3815
01:45:02.061 --> 01:45:02.810
<v Speaker 5>You really can.</v>

3816
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:05.810
<v Speaker 5>And then you'll understand what the fuss is all about because it's not as simple</v>

3817
01:45:05.811 --> 01:45:06.860
<v Speaker 5>as a hallucination.</v>

3818
01:45:06.861 --> 01:45:07.694
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

3819
01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3820
01:45:08.031 --> 01:45:08.630
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>

3821
01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:11.870
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely some perturbing of your visual senses.</v>

3822
01:45:11.871 --> 01:45:13.580
<v Speaker 5>There's your perceptions of the world,</v>

3823
01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:15.800
<v Speaker 5>but then there's also a voice and others,</v>

3824
01:45:15.801 --> 01:45:19.910
<v Speaker 5>our conversation with something that seems outer worldly that's communicating</v>

3825
01:45:19.911 --> 01:45:22.640
<v Speaker 5>with you and some sort of a telepathic way.</v>

3826
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:27.050
<v Speaker 5>And there's always a deep insight into how your life works and a really clear</v>

3827
01:45:27.051 --> 01:45:29.870
<v Speaker 5>illumination of all the issues that you've got going on,</v>

3828
01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:32.760
<v Speaker 5>which is like why would there be an inexperience?</v>

3829
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:36.440
<v Speaker 5>It's both humbling and enlightening and guiding and why?</v>

3830
01:45:36.441 --> 01:45:37.550
<v Speaker 5>Why would there be that?</v>

3831
01:45:37.610 --> 01:45:39.980
<v Speaker 5>And is it just in your imagination,</v>

3832
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:40.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3833
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:41.061
<v Speaker 5>is it really,</v>

3834
01:45:41.061 --> 01:45:42.110
<v Speaker 5>is it that simple?</v>

3835
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:43.970
<v Speaker 5>Is it that sample or is it,</v>

3836
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:45.730
<v Speaker 5>is this how a life form community?</v>

3837
01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:46.191
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3838
01:45:46.191 --> 01:45:47.240
<v Speaker 5>there's two ways to look at it.</v>

3839
01:45:47.241 --> 01:45:47.451
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3840
01:45:47.451 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 5>there's the what is actually happening away.</v>

3841
01:45:49.251 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 5>But then there's the simple pragmatic,</v>

3842
01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:51.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3843
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:53.840
<v Speaker 5>effect of how it affects people who take it.</v>

3844
01:45:53.841 --> 01:45:57.320
<v Speaker 5>And overwhelmingly the people who have taken these in the right with the right</v>

3845
01:45:57.321 --> 01:46:01.430
<v Speaker 5>intent and the right setting have these mystical experiences that change their</v>

3846
01:46:01.431 --> 01:46:02.360
<v Speaker 5>life for the positive.</v>

3847
01:46:02.361 --> 01:46:04.640
<v Speaker 5>So whatever you're accessing pragmatically,</v>

3848
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:05.750
<v Speaker 5>it's a positive benefit.</v>

3849
01:46:05.751 --> 01:46:07.910
<v Speaker 5>It feels this void defined the mystic,</v>

3850
01:46:07.930 --> 01:46:08.091
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3851
01:46:08.091 --> 01:46:11.540
<v Speaker 5>obviously it myself and you believe that there is something else out there that</v>

3852
01:46:11.541 --> 01:46:12.630
<v Speaker 5>you're accessing for sure.</v>

3853
01:46:12.631 --> 01:46:13.910
<v Speaker 5>And the traditions do as well.</v>

3854
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:14.601
<v Speaker 5>But either way,</v>

3855
01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:17.030
<v Speaker 5>just on a purely pragmatic approach,</v>

3856
01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:20.690
<v Speaker 5>it's having positive benefits on positive studyable.</v>

3857
01:46:20.691 --> 01:46:22.670
<v Speaker 5>The Johns Hopkins University did the,</v>

3858
01:46:22.671 --> 01:46:22.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3859
01:46:22.921 --> 01:46:25.000
<v Speaker 5>the recent magic mushrooms study,</v>

3860
01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.410
<v Speaker 5>they did improve long term psychological health.</v>

3861
01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:28.221
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is,</v>

3862
01:46:28.221 --> 01:46:28.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3863
01:46:28.461 --> 01:46:29.660
<v Speaker 5>it's a legit university.</v>

3864
01:46:29.661 --> 01:46:32.000
<v Speaker 5>They're coming to this conclusion after doing tests on people.</v>

3865
01:46:32.150 --> 01:46:34.280
<v Speaker 5>The point there is they say they found a sweet spot.</v>

3866
01:46:34.281 --> 01:46:37.880
<v Speaker 5>We can optimize the positive persistent effects and avoid some of the fear and</v>

3867
01:46:37.881 --> 01:46:40.700
<v Speaker 5>anxiety that can occur and be quite disruptive.</v>

3868
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 5>Says Lead Author Roland Griffiths,</v>

3869
01:46:42.771 --> 01:46:45.290
<v Speaker 5>professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins.</v>

3870
01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:48.380
<v Speaker 5>So what he's essentially saying is what everyone's been saying.</v>

3871
01:46:48.381 --> 01:46:49.460
<v Speaker 5>You need a Sharman.</v>

3872
01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 5>Sharman doesn't just like throw you out into the fucking woods,</v>

3873
01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:56.790
<v Speaker 5>but gives you the correct dose and allows you to achieve this,</v>

3874
01:46:56.791 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 5>this state of oneness.</v>

3875
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.651
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3876
01:46:58.651 --> 01:46:59.371
<v Speaker 5>that whatever it is,</v>

3877
01:46:59.371 --> 01:46:59.731
<v Speaker 5>a state,</v>

3878
01:46:59.731 --> 01:47:00.810
<v Speaker 5>let's just call it bliss.</v>

3879
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.550
<v Speaker 5>So we take out all the woo woo,</v>

3880
01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.181
<v Speaker 5>let's take,</v>

3881
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:07.830
<v Speaker 5>let's just call this state of an enhanced experience that is a s a psychedelic</v>

3882
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:08.371
<v Speaker 5>bliss,</v>

3883
01:47:08.371 --> 01:47:12.990
<v Speaker 5>bliss mixed with self reflection and critical hands and Aaron's very fair,</v>

3884
01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:13.621
<v Speaker 5>very fair,</v>

3885
01:47:13.621 --> 01:47:14.550
<v Speaker 5>honest and,</v>

3886
01:47:14.551 --> 01:47:14.841
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

3887
01:47:14.841 --> 01:47:16.020
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable at times.</v>

3888
01:47:16.050 --> 01:47:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3889
01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:16.620
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3890
01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:19.910
<v Speaker 5>and that's a hallmark of all psychedelic experiences that this is the,</v>

3891
01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:22.590
<v Speaker 5>the personal reflection in eating marijuana.</v>

3892
01:47:22.591 --> 01:47:22.821
<v Speaker 5>He didn't.</v>

3893
01:47:22.821 --> 01:47:25.350
<v Speaker 5>Marijuana is one of the most personal reflecting things you can do.</v>

3894
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:26.760
<v Speaker 5>That's why a lot of people hate it.</v>

3895
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.180
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3896
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:30.360
<v Speaker 5>they hate when they go too deep when they fuck up and eat a Brownie and like you</v>

3897
01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:34.020
<v Speaker 5>bitch and then they sit down and freak out about the fucking world as much as</v>

3898
01:47:34.021 --> 01:47:35.940
<v Speaker 5>you think you are looking at the whole thing.</v>

3899
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.160
<v Speaker 5>I bet you're not looking at it all because you can't,</v>

3900
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:42.810
<v Speaker 5>in order to get in your fucking car and get on the four oh five every day and</v>

3901
01:47:42.811 --> 01:47:44.460
<v Speaker 5>drive into downtown La.</v>

3902
01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:47.280
<v Speaker 5>The only way you can do that every day as if you compartment,</v>

3903
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:49.020
<v Speaker 5>compartmentalize your thinking.</v>

3904
01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:50.130
<v Speaker 5>And if you're,</v>

3905
01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:51.440
<v Speaker 5>if you're thinking about the,</v>

3906
01:47:51.441 --> 01:47:53.430
<v Speaker 5>the very structure of the universe,</v>

3907
01:47:53.610 --> 01:47:54.930
<v Speaker 5>you thinking about you,</v>

3908
01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.090
<v Speaker 5>you get subatomic particles,</v>

3909
01:47:57.091 --> 01:47:59.800
<v Speaker 5>you start thinking about waves and string theory and,</v>

3910
01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:05.160
<v Speaker 5>and craziness and what is cells and biology and the different organisms that</v>

3911
01:48:05.461 --> 01:48:10.461
<v Speaker 5>live in your body and the healthy bacteria consume and yogurt and fucking acid</v>

3912
01:48:10.471 --> 01:48:11.211
<v Speaker 5>off the list.</v>

3913
01:48:11.211 --> 01:48:11.670
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

3914
01:48:11.670 --> 01:48:12.930
<v Speaker 5>what's going on here?</v>

3915
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:14.070
<v Speaker 5>What do you can't?</v>

3916
01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:15.270
<v Speaker 5>There's not enough room for that,</v>

3917
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:15.690
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3918
01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:17.010
<v Speaker 5>You can't process all that shit.</v>

3919
01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:18.450
<v Speaker 5>So you got to put your blinders on,</v>

3920
01:48:18.690 --> 01:48:19.860
<v Speaker 5>but then they eat that browning.</v>

3921
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:23.190
<v Speaker 5>It all just blast into focus.</v>

3922
01:48:23.191 --> 01:48:23.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3923
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.100
<v Speaker 5>it feel your heartbeat seems weird.</v>

3924
01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:27.720
<v Speaker 5>It seems tired.</v>

3925
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:30.220
<v Speaker 5>The best analogy,</v>

3926
01:48:30.221 --> 01:48:30.291
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3927
01:48:30.291 --> 01:48:30.390
<v Speaker 5>The</v>

3928
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:31.890
<v Speaker 7>best analogy I heard was that,</v>

3929
01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:32.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3930
01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:34.710
<v Speaker 7>taking psychedelics is like a banquet for the spirit.</v>

3931
01:48:34.711 --> 01:48:34.891
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3932
01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:36.150
<v Speaker 7>it takes a while to prepare,</v>

3933
01:48:36.151 --> 01:48:36.631
<v Speaker 7>takes a lot.</v>

3934
01:48:36.631 --> 01:48:37.500
<v Speaker 7>It's very rich.</v>

3935
01:48:37.501 --> 01:48:39.000
<v Speaker 7>Take some time to digest.</v>

3936
01:48:39.210 --> 01:48:40.350
<v Speaker 7>You can't do that every day.</v>

3937
01:48:40.351 --> 01:48:41.430
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

3938
01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:42.660
<v Speaker 7>and what fills the void,</v>

3939
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:43.080
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3940
01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.320
<v Speaker 7>eating dinner in this analogy is meditation and just doing a little bit,</v>

3941
01:48:46.321 --> 01:48:47.011
<v Speaker 7>it could be yoga,</v>

3942
01:48:47.011 --> 01:48:48.930
<v Speaker 7>it could be 10 minutes in your house,</v>

3943
01:48:48.931 --> 01:48:51.900
<v Speaker 7>but actually finding that point of stillness in our lives,</v>

3944
01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:52.501
<v Speaker 7>that's dinner.</v>

3945
01:48:52.501 --> 01:48:56.520
<v Speaker 7>And then the banquet is when you get to really go into the void and bring back</v>

3946
01:48:56.521 --> 01:48:58.200
<v Speaker 7>some knowledge and some different experiences.</v>

3947
01:48:58.201 --> 01:49:00.660
<v Speaker 7>But I think that would be the one thing.</v>

3948
01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:02.310
<v Speaker 7>If we could create one rule,</v>

3949
01:49:02.311 --> 01:49:04.650
<v Speaker 7>and if I could say I had omnipotent power,</v>

3950
01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:07.130
<v Speaker 7>the one rule would be that there would be some shot,</v>

3951
01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:07.380
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3952
01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:10.230
<v Speaker 7>shamanistic tradition that had a coming of age,</v>

3953
01:49:10.231 --> 01:49:15.231
<v Speaker 7>custom ceremony and an in the world in which when you came of age as this as a</v>

3954
01:49:15.661 --> 01:49:16.494
<v Speaker 7>society,</v>

3955
01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:16.771
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3956
01:49:16.771 --> 01:49:20.640
<v Speaker 7>you had a psychedelic mystical experience with the train guide,</v>

3957
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:24.300
<v Speaker 7>with your peers and with your elders and had this community experience only,</v>

3958
01:49:24.330 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 7>even if it was only just one.</v>

3959
01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.810
<v Speaker 7>So you got to experience and taste.</v>

3960
01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:29.250
<v Speaker 7>That's something else that's holy,</v>

3961
01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:33.360
<v Speaker 7>other than just yourself and kind of transcend your own ego even for one</v>

3962
01:49:33.361 --> 01:49:33.990
<v Speaker 7>evening.</v>

3963
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:38.550
<v Speaker 7>And I think that would make single handedly the most difference as far as change</v>

3964
01:49:38.551 --> 01:49:39.384
<v Speaker 7>in society.</v>

3965
01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:42.600
<v Speaker 7>You know that one coming of age ritual in which,</v>

3966
01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:42.931
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3967
01:49:42.931 --> 01:49:44.160
<v Speaker 7>they got to experience that.</v>

3968
01:49:44.161 --> 01:49:45.180
<v Speaker 7>I think that would be it.</v>

3969
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 7>Unless someone made it like now</v>

3970
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you are a warrior</v>

3971
01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 1>and you fucking take your short and go out in the world and try to fucking cut</v>

3972
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:56.074
<v Speaker 1>down your kingdom.</v>

3973
01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3974
01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:56.711
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3975
01:49:56.711 --> 01:49:57.491
<v Speaker 1>that couldn't be like that.</v>

3976
01:49:57.491 --> 01:49:58.320
<v Speaker 1>But the Shamans don't.</v>

3977
01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:58.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3978
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:59.383
<v Speaker 1>they never,</v>

3979
01:49:59.540 --> 01:49:59.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3980
01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:00.401
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say never.</v>

3981
01:50:00.401 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's different Shawmut's,</v>

3982
01:50:01.631 --> 01:50:03.490
<v Speaker 1>but the tradition is not in that.</v>

3983
01:50:03.491 --> 01:50:05.340
<v Speaker 1>It's in transcending the ego and all.</v>

3984
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:08.830
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those kind of warmongering mentalities is very ego driven.</v>

3985
01:50:08.831 --> 01:50:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3986
01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I will stomp you because I am strong.</v>

3987
01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3988
01:50:12.191 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you don't get that from the psychedelic experience.</v>

3989
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:14.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3990
01:50:14.771 --> 01:50:16.510
<v Speaker 1>you could get that endorsement.</v>

3991
01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3992
01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.360
<v Speaker 1>they got it from Anita Musk area.</v>

3993
01:50:19.361 --> 01:50:19.670
<v Speaker 1>They would.</v>

3994
01:50:19.670 --> 01:50:20.503
<v Speaker 1>They would.</v>

3995
01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Zucker,</v>

3996
01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:21.401
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3997
01:50:21.401 --> 01:50:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly channel it into some very invincible,</v>

3998
01:50:24.431 --> 01:50:25.540
<v Speaker 1>aggressive states.</v>

3999
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Especially if that's like your reality.</v>

4000
01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what you,</v>

4001
01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4002
01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:28.990
<v Speaker 1>your Wa,</v>

4003
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you want Odin to guide you to victory,</v>

4004
01:50:30.641 --> 01:50:30.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4005
01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:31.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4006
01:50:31.151 --> 01:50:31.331
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4007
01:50:31.331 --> 01:50:32.530
<v Speaker 1>your reality is not,</v>

4008
01:50:32.710 --> 01:50:34.300
<v Speaker 1>there are no vacation homes.</v>

4009
01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4010
01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:36.550
<v Speaker 1>For the fucking Vikings,</v>

4011
01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:39.610
<v Speaker 1>there is no Disneyland resort that you can take the kids,</v>

4012
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:40.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4013
01:50:40.091 --> 01:50:42.550
<v Speaker 1>it's about cutting people's heads off where they cut your heads off.</v>

4014
01:50:42.730 --> 01:50:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4015
01:50:43.090 --> 01:50:43.841
<v Speaker 1>That's about storming.</v>

4016
01:50:43.841 --> 01:50:45.250
<v Speaker 1>The beach isn't taken all the women.</v>

4017
01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:48.430
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what he wants some mushrooms to help them out with this.</v>

4018
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:50.050
<v Speaker 1>There was no other way to live,</v>

4019
01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:50.590
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4020
01:50:50.590 --> 01:50:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Were there any,</v>

4021
01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4022
01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:52.870
<v Speaker 1>pacifist vikings?</v>

4023
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:54.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4024
01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:54.933
<v Speaker 1>they didn't survive.</v>

4025
01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't make babies.</v>

4026
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:59.230
<v Speaker 1>None of that going on back then.</v>

4027
01:50:59.231 --> 01:50:59.621
<v Speaker 1>Bitch,</v>

4028
01:50:59.621 --> 01:51:02.760
<v Speaker 1>you there for one reason to make little baby Brock Lesnar's yeah,</v>

4029
01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:04.053
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

4030
01:51:04.210 --> 01:51:04.871
<v Speaker 1>That was the goal.</v>

4031
01:51:04.871 --> 01:51:05.704
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4032
01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:06.461
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4033
01:51:06.461 --> 01:51:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I think mushrooms in particular allow you,</v>

4034
01:51:08.650 --> 01:51:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4035
01:51:09.210 --> 01:51:09.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4036
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there's kind of two energetic forces out there and they're not</v>

4037
01:51:12.851 --> 01:51:14.170
<v Speaker 1>good and they're not evil ones.</v>

4038
01:51:14.171 --> 01:51:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

4039
01:51:14.650 --> 01:51:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4040
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:15.810
<v Speaker 1>you can call it the dark or,</v>

4041
01:51:15.811 --> 01:51:16.571
<v Speaker 1>and call it the light,</v>

4042
01:51:16.571 --> 01:51:19.330
<v Speaker 1>but once more really the primal side of,</v>

4043
01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:19.961
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>

4044
01:51:19.961 --> 01:51:21.670
<v Speaker 1>it's that kill or be killed.</v>

4045
01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:23.440
<v Speaker 1>It's that kind of savage animal,</v>

4046
01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.000
<v Speaker 1>a dominant side,</v>

4047
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:28.420
<v Speaker 1>and that has a certain energy that has some destruction elements to it.</v>

4048
01:51:28.421 --> 01:51:28.841
<v Speaker 1>But it's all,</v>

4049
01:51:28.841 --> 01:51:29.351
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

4050
01:51:29.351 --> 01:51:30.520
<v Speaker 1>it's all part of the same thing.</v>

4051
01:51:30.521 --> 01:51:32.680
<v Speaker 1>You can in some people know,</v>

4052
01:51:32.681 --> 01:51:36.940
<v Speaker 1>some people don't have it and some people are really purely intellectual and</v>

4053
01:51:36.941 --> 01:51:37.691
<v Speaker 1>they're just not,</v>

4054
01:51:37.691 --> 01:51:38.980
<v Speaker 1>they're not connected to the physical,</v>

4055
01:51:38.981 --> 01:51:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but their intellectual.</v>

4056
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:41.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like off the fucking charts.</v>

4057
01:51:41.471 --> 01:51:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's also a part of this big crazy puzzle is it?</v>

4058
01:51:44.410 --> 01:51:45.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a you and there's a mean,</v>

4059
01:51:45.731 --> 01:51:46.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a Brian and then you know,</v>

4060
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:48.640
<v Speaker 1>there's sure it's like that old song.</v>

4061
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:50.780
<v Speaker 1>It takes him to Africa and the people,</v>

4062
01:51:53.150 --> 01:51:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4063
01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:56.170
<v Speaker 1>it sounds so stupid and ridiculous and simple,</v>

4064
01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.250
<v Speaker 1>but it really does.</v>

4065
01:51:57.251 --> 01:51:59.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean in order to accomplish this greater goal,</v>

4066
01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:00.290
<v Speaker 1>just bizarre,</v>

4067
01:52:00.510 --> 01:52:00.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4068
01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:01.900
<v Speaker 1>multicultural,</v>

4069
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:02.441
<v Speaker 1>Uber,</v>

4070
01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:03.640
<v Speaker 1>complex civilization,</v>

4071
01:52:03.641 --> 01:52:06.880
<v Speaker 1>it really does require almost every conceivable personality,</v>

4072
01:52:06.881 --> 01:52:07.714
<v Speaker 1>all work.</v>

4073
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I still think that people should strive for internal balance.</v>

4074
01:52:10.661 --> 01:52:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that leads to the biggest happiness.</v>

4075
01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I think access both.</v>

4076
01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:15.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're pulled towards that,</v>

4077
01:52:15.281 --> 01:52:16.031
<v Speaker 1>if you feel like,</v>

4078
01:52:16.031 --> 01:52:17.440
<v Speaker 1>you know it's missing in your life,</v>

4079
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:18.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4080
01:52:18.101 --> 01:52:19.510
<v Speaker 1>and for a lot of people that is the case.</v>

4081
01:52:19.511 --> 01:52:20.380
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people feel,</v>

4082
01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:22.120
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are very unhappy.</v>

4083
01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:22.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4084
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do not feel fulfilled.</v>

4085
01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel very lucky that everything I enjoyed that I do for,</v>

4086
01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:31.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4087
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.691
<v Speaker 1>for my,</v>

4088
01:52:31.691 --> 01:52:32.441
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

4089
01:52:32.441 --> 01:52:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy these things.</v>

4090
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy every podcast I do.</v>

4091
01:52:35.801 --> 01:52:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy all of my friends except Saturday,</v>

4092
01:52:37.871 --> 01:52:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Saturday just kind of sucks.</v>

4093
01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:39.910
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't your fault.</v>

4094
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Shit happen man.</v>

4095
01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:41.510
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

4096
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:44.770
<v Speaker 1>you can't get Darryl right in a porn star in one room and expect fucking sparks.</v>

4097
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4098
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.843
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4099
01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:47.141
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4100
01:52:47.141 --> 01:52:49.520
<v Speaker 5>and if you can figure out a way to do that,</v>

4101
01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:52.790
<v Speaker 5>to find whatever it is you do that you really get satisfaction of with,</v>

4102
01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.410
<v Speaker 5>whether it's carpentry or whether it's,</v>

4103
01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:54.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4104
01:52:54.771 --> 01:52:55.161
<v Speaker 5>a painting,</v>

4105
01:52:55.161 --> 01:52:56.450
<v Speaker 5>pictures and whatever the fuck it is,</v>

4106
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:58.630
<v Speaker 5>then really is number,</v>

4107
01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.620
<v Speaker 5>like one of the most important things.</v>

4108
01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.360
<v Speaker 5>And then no cons.</v>

4109
01:53:02.630 --> 01:53:03.620
<v Speaker 5>Have a no rule,</v>

4110
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.701
<v Speaker 5>just no cons.</v>

4111
01:53:04.701 --> 01:53:05.480
<v Speaker 5>Don't be a cunt.</v>

4112
01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.260
<v Speaker 5>Just stop it.</v>

4113
01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.000
<v Speaker 5>You know when people get mad at me on the message board,</v>

4114
01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 5>cause I keep fucking pinking people in banning people.</v>

4115
01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:15.050
<v Speaker 5>The way my message board is set up on the Joe rogan.net is there's a bunch of</v>

4116
01:53:15.051 --> 01:53:15.561
<v Speaker 5>moderators.</v>

4117
01:53:15.561 --> 01:53:16.790
<v Speaker 5>All of them I know personally,</v>

4118
01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:20.000
<v Speaker 5>or at least I know I'm online and they're all really cool and they don't want</v>

4119
01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:20.810

<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

4149
01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:13.970
<v Speaker 5>No one's stopping you from starting your own message board,</v>

4150
01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:14.953
<v Speaker 5>no one starting you.</v>

4151
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:17.570
<v Speaker 5>But what they're saying is in a cyber home,</v>

4152
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.120
<v Speaker 5>you're not welcome anymore because you're annoying.</v>

01:54:24.231 --> 01:54:24.591
<v Speaker 5>reason,</v>

4155
01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:27.980
<v Speaker 5>because they're so entitled with this sense of anonymity and this,</v>

4156
01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:28.431
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

4157
01:54:28.431 --> 01:54:32.450
<v Speaker 5>this unnatural way of behaving that people have because there's no social</v>

4158
01:54:32.451 --> 01:54:33.284
<v Speaker 5>repercussions.</v>

4159
01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.000
<v Speaker 5>The norm is to be country.</v>

4160
01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:38.780
<v Speaker 5>The norm is to say bitchy shit that would make me tell you to get the fuck out</v>

4161
01:54:38.781 --> 01:54:39.590
<v Speaker 5>of my party.</v>

4162
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:42.410
<v Speaker 5>And you think you could just do that and they think they could just do it and</v>

4163
01:54:42.411 --> 01:54:44.330
<v Speaker 5>get away with it and you're an asshole if you call him.</v>

01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4171
01:54:53.370 --> 01:54:57.020
<v Speaker 5>You know everything you're saying and you know it says you're half retarded and</v>

4172
01:54:57.070 --> 01:54:58.100

4180
01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:06.320
<v Speaker 5>there's other ways to communicate you fuck and you're thinking that there's only</v>

4181
01:55:06.321 --> 01:55:09.560
<v Speaker 5>one way because you've been doing it this way for so fucking long.</v>

4182
01:55:09.650 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 5>You actually feel entitled to be a cunt to treat it like it's a house.</v>

4183
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Would you come over someone's house and you're meeting them and would you</v>

4184
01:55:16.341 --> 01:55:17.450
<v Speaker 5>communicate with them like that?</v>

4185
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:18.441

4188
01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:24.440
<v Speaker 5>Don't think you can come into my cyber house and not get kicked out for being</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't want this for a fact.</v>

4203
01:55:38.121 --> 01:55:41.070
<v Speaker 5>That last night I had to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>No second thoughts.</v>

4238
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:24.930
<v Speaker 4>It's actually finally got to the point where,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4263
01:57:00.330 --> 01:57:02.610
<v Speaker 4>isn't not a John Half Ron joke is it?</v>

4264
01:57:03.250 --> 01:57:03.510
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4265
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:04.343
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to talk,</v>

4266
01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:05.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4267
01:57:05.521 --> 01:57:06.330
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

4268
01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:06.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4269
01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:08.610
<v Speaker 4>we know each other originally from the flashlight.</v>

4270
01:57:08.611 --> 01:57:09.630
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people might not know that.</v>

4271
01:57:09.631 --> 01:57:12.510
<v Speaker 4>And then we're sort of in business together and on it and uh,</v>

4272
01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:15.660
<v Speaker 4>make an Alpha brain and shroom tech sport.</v>

4273
01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:16.610
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

4274
01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:17.800
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4275
01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:18.151
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

4276
01:57:18.151 --> 01:57:19.640
<v Speaker 4>I love that I fucking Trump type that stuff,</v>

4277
01:57:19.641 --> 01:57:20.800
<v Speaker 4>that shit before Jujitsu.</v>

4278
01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:22.080
<v Speaker 4>It's great for working out,</v>

4279
01:57:22.230 --> 01:57:23.610
<v Speaker 4>but this is your beat 12 in that too.</v>

4280
01:57:23.670 --> 01:57:24.120
<v Speaker 4>There is,</v>

4281
01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.890
<v Speaker 4>how much be 12 methylcobalamin.</v>

4282
01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:26.910
<v Speaker 4>There's um,</v>

4283
01:57:27.630 --> 01:57:29.040
<v Speaker 4>2000 micrograms in there.</v>

4284
01:57:29.190 --> 01:57:30.030
<v Speaker 4>That's a good amount.</v>

4285
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:30.983
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

4286
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:34.830
<v Speaker 4>but the Methylcobalamin is a different type of B12 and the Cyanocobalamin,</v>

4287
01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:37.390
<v Speaker 4>a Cyanna Cobell and extra creates a molecule,</v>

4288
01:57:37.391 --> 01:57:39.540
<v Speaker 4>a cyanide when it's released into the body.</v>

4289
01:57:39.541 --> 01:57:41.730
<v Speaker 4>But methylcobalamin is called Methyl B 12.</v>

4290
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.890
<v Speaker 4>A lot healthier for the body and a lot better.</v>

4291
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:45.330
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of people take,</v>

4292
01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.193
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4293
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 4>like an athlete that gets an injection time,</v>

4294
01:57:48.841 --> 01:57:49.201
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

4295
01:57:49.201 --> 01:57:49.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4296
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:51.450
<v Speaker 4>tens of thousands of micrograms would be 12.</v>

4297
01:57:51.451 --> 01:57:52.620
<v Speaker 4>So it's water soluble,</v>

4298
01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:53.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4299
01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:54.570
<v Speaker 4>releases any excess,</v>

4300
01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:55.890
<v Speaker 4>just releases through urine.</v>

4301
01:57:55.891 --> 01:57:58.290
<v Speaker 4>So the body will utilize what it can and then,</v>

4302
01:57:58.291 --> 01:57:58.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4303
01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:00.060
<v Speaker 4>and then just pee out the rest.</v>

4304
01:58:00.061 --> 01:58:00.841
<v Speaker 4>And the quarter steps.</v>

4305
01:58:00.841 --> 01:58:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Mushroom was first used by Chinese athletes.</v>

4306
01:58:03.691 --> 01:58:04.111
<v Speaker 4>Is that who,</v>

4307
01:58:04.111 --> 01:58:04.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4308
01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:05.940
<v Speaker 4>they figured it out first Chinese,</v>

4309
01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:08.040
<v Speaker 4>but they figured it out 2000 years ago.</v>

4310
01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:08.993
<v Speaker 4>The courthouse steps,</v>

4311
01:58:09.690 --> 01:58:11.580
<v Speaker 4>the herdsmen in northern Tibet and China,</v>

4312
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:13.560
<v Speaker 4>they're an extremely high altitudes.</v>

4313
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:14.870
<v Speaker 4>And now up there and those altitudes,</v>

4314
01:58:14.890 --> 01:58:16.770
<v Speaker 4>the herds and the people get very sluggish.</v>

4315
01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:21.180
<v Speaker 4>And they noticed that when a certain type of mushroom was available and on the</v>

4316
01:58:21.181 --> 01:58:22.290
<v Speaker 4>ground and the herds would eat it,</v>

4317
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:26.110
<v Speaker 4>the herds would become particularly active and there would be moving around.</v>

4318
01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:27.000
<v Speaker 4>They'd have more endurance,</v>

4319
01:58:27.001 --> 01:58:29.190
<v Speaker 4>they'd be able to push them harder and they'd be playing more.</v>

4320
01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:30.150
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

4321
01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:30.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4322
01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:31.111
<v Speaker 4>back in the day,</v>

4323
01:58:31.111 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 4>that was your biggest cue if you were just a person kind of looking around.</v>

4324
01:58:34.051 --> 01:58:37.620
<v Speaker 4>So they took a look at these and they tried them themselves and found the same,</v>

4325
01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:38.760
<v Speaker 4>same results.</v>

4326
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 4>And what we know now is that the court accepts mushroom.</v>

4327
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 7>It's actually a symbiont to the ghost moth,</v>

4328
01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:47.230
<v Speaker 7>which is the host for this,</v>

4329
01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4330
01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:48.633
<v Speaker 7>for the mushroom.</v>

4331
01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:52.750
<v Speaker 7>And what they believe that it does is the same thing that it does in people and</v>

4332
01:58:52.751 --> 01:58:54.130
<v Speaker 7>in other animals and ingest it.</v>

4333
01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:59.140
<v Speaker 7>It increases the oxygen utilization and cellular energy of the animal,</v>

4334
01:58:59.141 --> 01:59:04.090
<v Speaker 7>of the moth itself to allow the moth in this extremely high altitude plane to be</v>

4335
01:59:04.091 --> 01:59:05.050
<v Speaker 7>able to fly better,</v>

4336
01:59:05.051 --> 01:59:07.900
<v Speaker 7>to be able to fly longer and actually survive and adapt.</v>

4337
01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:09.730
<v Speaker 7>And then when the moth dies,</v>

4338
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:12.100
<v Speaker 7>the quarter's hubs mushroom actually springs out of it.</v>

4339
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:17.610
<v Speaker 7>And so the first people to discover it in form of like real athletic competition</v>

4340
01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:18.693
<v Speaker 7>was um,</v>

4341
01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:22.150
<v Speaker 7>coach Meyer and the Chinese Olympic team today,</v>

4342
01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:25.990
<v Speaker 2>shroom tech and then you die on mushrooms going to grow your fucking head.</v>

4343
01:59:26.230 --> 01:59:27.041
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious,</v>

4344
01:59:27.041 --> 01:59:27.291
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4345
01:59:27.291 --> 01:59:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Sports is it like those,</v>

4346
01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:29.830
<v Speaker 2>those uh,</v>

4347
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:30.670
<v Speaker 2>those ants,</v>

4348
01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like those ants and fucking in the,</v>

4349
01:59:32.681 --> 01:59:33.101
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

4350
01:59:33.101 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4351
01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:34.240
<v Speaker 2>is it the Amazon?</v>

4352
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Whatever jungle it is,</v>

4353
01:59:35.261 --> 01:59:35.681
<v Speaker 2>where those,</v>

4354
01:59:35.681 --> 01:59:35.891
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4355
01:59:35.891 --> 01:59:40.150
<v Speaker 2>those ants get infected by spores and then those spores explode other fucking</v>

4356
01:59:40.151 --> 01:59:41.620
<v Speaker 2>head and contaminate the other hand.</v>

4357
01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:42.820
<v Speaker 2>These are dead and dried.</v>

4358
01:59:42.821 --> 01:59:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

4359
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4360
01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:44.650
<v Speaker 2>it could be possibly no,</v>

4361
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:45.161
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>

4362
01:59:45.161 --> 01:59:47.870
<v Speaker 2>these are dead and dried and take their dead and dried.</v>

4363
01:59:47.871 --> 01:59:48.591
<v Speaker 2>Then what is the,</v>

4364
01:59:48.591 --> 01:59:48.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4365
01:59:48.671 --> 01:59:49.271
<v Speaker 2>the benefit?</v>

4366
01:59:49.271 --> 01:59:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Where's the benefit coming from</v>

4367
01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:52.120
<v Speaker 7>coming from what's inside?</v>

4368
01:59:52.150 --> 01:59:53.110
<v Speaker 7>What's inside the mushroom?</v>

4369
01:59:53.111 --> 01:59:55.150
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of available raw identizine,</v>

4370
01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:56.770
<v Speaker 7>which is what is,</v>

4371
01:59:56.771 --> 01:59:56.981
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4372
01:59:56.981 --> 01:59:58.530
<v Speaker 7>an important factor in ATP,</v>

4373
01:59:58.531 --> 01:59:58.970
<v Speaker 7>ADP,</v>

4374
01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:59.730
<v Speaker 7>ADP.</v>

4375
01:59:59.730 --> 02:00:03.180
<v Speaker 2>So don't go grown your own cordyceps mushroom and just eating them.</v>

4376
02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:04.800
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4377
02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:05.900
<v Speaker 7>we'll kill all that anyways,</v>

4378
02:00:05.901 --> 02:00:06.280
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

4379
02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:07.113
<v Speaker 7>but it does,</v>

4380
02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:08.990
<v Speaker 7>but it's a different mushroom.</v>

4381
02:00:08.991 --> 02:00:09.824
<v Speaker 7>France.</v>

4382
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:11.390
<v Speaker 7>Cordyceps is only found in the north,</v>

4383
02:00:11.391 --> 02:00:12.500
<v Speaker 7>in the high regions of,</v>

4384
02:00:12.501 --> 02:00:13.011
<v Speaker 7>of Tibet.</v>

4385
02:00:13.011 --> 02:00:16.400
<v Speaker 7>And China and it was actually the most expensive nutritional compounds in the</v>

4386
02:00:16.401 --> 02:00:16.701
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>

4387
02:00:16.701 --> 02:00:19.760
<v Speaker 7>For a while it was getting up to over $20,000 a kilo.</v>

4388
02:00:19.850 --> 02:00:22.760
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit steps mushroom at some point because it's really hard to grow.</v>

4389
02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:25.490
<v Speaker 7>It's impossible to grow really until,</v>

4390
02:00:25.491 --> 02:00:28.660
<v Speaker 7>until they could only wild cultivated from these mosques.</v>

4391
02:00:28.670 --> 02:00:31.340
<v Speaker 7>It was very difficult until a Aloha nutritional,</v>

4392
02:00:31.341 --> 02:00:33.560
<v Speaker 7>the the company that we get it from doctor John Holiday,</v>

4393
02:00:33.561 --> 02:00:38.210
<v Speaker 7>he made some real advances in medicine that allowed him to cultivate it and in a</v>

4394
02:00:38.211 --> 02:00:42.290
<v Speaker 7>competitive substrate that allows the quadriceps to grow and be very effective</v>

4395
02:00:42.291 --> 02:00:42.800
<v Speaker 7>in a,</v>

4396
02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.030
<v Speaker 7>in a cultivated state.</v>

4397
02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:47.720
<v Speaker 7>Otherwise they had to explain the competitive aspect of it cause that's really</v>

4398
02:00:47.721 --> 02:00:48.710
<v Speaker 7>fucking fascinating.</v>

4399
02:00:48.710 --> 02:00:48.831
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4400
02:00:48.831 --> 02:00:52.080
<v Speaker 7>So they grow it in like a brown rice kind of compote substrate.</v>

4401
02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:55.670
<v Speaker 7>And what they found is it mushrooms have to compete for a variety of things when</v>

4402
02:00:55.671 --> 02:01:00.470
<v Speaker 7>they come upon a log or any kind of different environment with Marin.</v>

4403
02:01:00.690 --> 02:01:01.130
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4404
02:01:01.130 --> 02:01:02.450
<v Speaker 7>depending on what's out there,</v>

4405
02:01:02.451 --> 02:01:05.000
<v Speaker 7>they will put out anti-competition compounds,</v>

4406
02:01:05.001 --> 02:01:06.620
<v Speaker 7>which actually both strengthen their own,</v>

4407
02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:10.190
<v Speaker 7>their own species and also eliminate the other species.</v>

4408
02:01:10.191 --> 02:01:11.600
<v Speaker 7>So if there's a bunch of bacteria,</v>

4409
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:13.640
<v Speaker 7>they'll excrete certain certain things to work.</v>

4410
02:01:13.641 --> 02:01:16.340
<v Speaker 7>The bacteria that's trying to get at the decomposing log.</v>

4411
02:01:16.341 --> 02:01:17.540
<v Speaker 7>But if there's other mushrooms,</v>

4412
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:21.410
<v Speaker 7>there's certain anti-competition compounds available in those mushrooms that's</v>

4413
02:01:21.411 --> 02:01:24.230
<v Speaker 7>going to allow the mushroom to actually thrive.</v>

4414
02:01:24.231 --> 02:01:28.280
<v Speaker 7>And some of those anti-competition compounds are some of the bioactive compounds</v>

4415
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:29.660
<v Speaker 7>that are found in the mushrooms.</v>

4416
02:01:30.110 --> 02:01:30.500
<v Speaker 7>Wow,</v>

4417
02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:31.970
<v Speaker 7>that's fucking bad ass.</v>

4418
02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:34.130
<v Speaker 7>But putting them in a competitive environment,</v>

4419
02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:35.330
<v Speaker 7>it makes them make more strong,</v>

4420
02:01:35.331 --> 02:01:36.200
<v Speaker 7>stronger in the court,</v>

4421
02:01:36.201 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 7>accepts you get more rod adenosine and the oxygen is another really</v>

4422
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.771
<v Speaker 1>cool thing.</v>

4423
02:01:40.771 --> 02:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4424
02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

4425
02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>that's very easy to test actually.</v>

4426
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can actually take a mask and the oxygen level is normally 20% and you</v>

4427
02:01:47.841 --> 02:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>breathe it out at 13% and then you put the mask on and after taking cordyceps</v>

4428
02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:53.600
<v Speaker 1>for two weeks,</v>

4429
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll come out and oxygen you intake is still at instill at 20% but you're</v>

4430
02:01:57.681 --> 02:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>breathing out at 8% which was one of the studies that they show.</v>

4431
02:02:01.011 --> 02:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's a 50% increase,</v>

4432
02:02:02.661 --> 02:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>roughly 40% seems like that every night he would have to take it then.</v>

4433
02:02:05.841 --> 02:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Is that really possible?</v>

4434
02:02:06.831 --> 02:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>That seems like too high.</v>

4435
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't notice it that high.</v>

4436
02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4437
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like it's that high one.</v>

4438
02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I have 50% more endurance.</v>

4439
02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just oxygen utilization though.</v>

4440
02:02:15.741 --> 02:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>That's not endurance.</v>

4441
02:02:16.581 --> 02:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not measuring the actual endurance capacity utilization should be a huge</v>

4442
02:02:21.111 --> 02:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>part of that.</v>

4443
02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:21.921
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be.</v>

4444
02:02:21.921 --> 02:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>It should be a big part.</v>

4445
02:02:22.851 --> 02:02:24.200
<v Speaker 1>And that study that study's been out,</v>

4446
02:02:24.201 --> 02:02:25.400
<v Speaker 1>it's actually posted on the site.</v>

4447
02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4448
02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:26.810
<v Speaker 1>other studies have shown,</v>

4449
02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:27.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4450
02:02:27.021 --> 02:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>varying different degrees,</v>

4451
02:02:27.981 --> 02:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but always oxygen utilization is a key.</v>

4452
02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>And also adenosine,</v>

4453
02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4454
02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>providing increased ATP synthesis versus ADP.</v>

4455
02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>The biggest boost that I ever gotten during swatched when I had my nose fixed</v>

4456
02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>because my nose was all fucked up and talks and sign.</v>

4457
02:02:41.811 --> 02:02:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get any air through it.</v>

4458
02:02:42.801 --> 02:02:43.640
<v Speaker 1>It was a mouth breather.</v>

4459
02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And then once I got my nose fixed,</v>

4460
02:02:45.651 --> 02:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I was like literally like I got a 20% bump in my party.</v>

4461
02:02:48.501 --> 02:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a big difference.</v>

4462
02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.000
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

4463
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4464
02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:52.370
<v Speaker 1>that was the most amazing,</v>

4465
02:02:52.371 --> 02:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>

4466
02:02:53.150 --> 02:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4467
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:54.740
<v Speaker 1>thing that I realized.</v>

4468
02:02:54.741 --> 02:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>But this is a fucking close second.</v>

4469
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

4470
02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:00.110
<v Speaker 1>when I have like real hard workouts man,</v>

4471
02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:00.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4472
02:03:00.441 --> 02:03:01.850
<v Speaker 1>especially like Jujitsu class,</v>

4473
02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

4474
02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:03.913
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

4475
02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I rode for the first time in a while last night and I,</v>

4476
02:03:06.101 --> 02:03:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I rolled like,</v>

4477
02:03:07.150 --> 02:03:07.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4478
02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:09.500
<v Speaker 1>deep into the class like a lot of times,</v>

4479
02:03:09.501 --> 02:03:09.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4480
02:03:09.681 --> 02:03:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you go five or six guys and you just don't want to do it anymore.</v>

4481
02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:13.340
<v Speaker 1>You've just done.</v>

4482
02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:16.430
<v Speaker 1>But this like gets me one extra role.</v>

4483
02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's not easy but it gets,</v>

4484
02:03:18.561 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>we one extra role and at the end of it where I'm like,</v>

4485
02:03:20.781 --> 02:03:21.171
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4486
02:03:21.171 --> 02:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I feel all right,</v>

4487
02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.031
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

4488
02:03:24.031 --> 02:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a boost but it doesn't give me that cracked out red bull.</v>

4489
02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:27.931
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

4490
02:03:27.931 --> 02:03:28.970
<v Speaker 1>there's no stimulants in it.</v>

4491
02:03:28.971 --> 02:03:30.560
<v Speaker 1>So surrounding the quarter steps,</v>

4492
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:33.800
<v Speaker 1>which is providing cellular energy versus glandular energy,</v>

4493
02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:37.310
<v Speaker 1>glandular energy is basically tricking your body to release adrenaline.</v>

4494
02:03:37.311 --> 02:03:40.760
<v Speaker 1>That's where caffeine and all these things are doing basically re releasing more</v>

4495
02:03:40.761 --> 02:03:41.151
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline.</v>

4496
02:03:41.151 --> 02:03:42.560
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like you have energy,</v>

4497
02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:43.970
<v Speaker 1>but your actual cells,</v>

4498
02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:47.510
<v Speaker 1>which are still using the ATP cycle to produce energy,</v>

4499
02:03:47.511 --> 02:03:48.860
<v Speaker 1>don't have any extra energy.</v>

4500
02:03:48.861 --> 02:03:52.490
<v Speaker 1>So you push harder because you think you have the crush your adrenals and you</v>

4501
02:03:52.491 --> 02:03:53.271
<v Speaker 1>crush your adrenals.</v>

4502
02:03:53.271 --> 02:03:53.631
<v Speaker 1>This had been,</v>

4503
02:03:53.631 --> 02:03:55.070
<v Speaker 1>James was told by his doctor,</v>

4504
02:03:55.071 --> 02:03:56.360
<v Speaker 1>he had to stop drinking coffee.</v>

4505
02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4506
02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:57.613
<v Speaker 1>it's killing us.</v>

4507
02:03:57.710 --> 02:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Just pushing that button over and over again until the button just doesn't have</v>

4508
02:04:01.281 --> 02:04:03.470
<v Speaker 1>as much to get out and just turns to a leathery sad.</v>

4509
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:06.680
<v Speaker 1>This is operating on a totally different mechanism and that's why you get that</v>

4510
02:04:06.681 --> 02:04:08.150
<v Speaker 1>kind of physical burst.</v>

4511
02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:08.251
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4512
02:04:08.251 --> 02:04:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

4513
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>it's subtler than people.</v>

4514
02:04:10.251 --> 02:04:11.360
<v Speaker 1>People were used to taking it.</v>

4515
02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:11.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4516
02:04:11.601 --> 02:04:12.231
<v Speaker 1>explode.</v>

4517
02:04:12.231 --> 02:04:12.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4518
02:04:12.381 --> 02:04:12.921
<v Speaker 1>they might be like,</v>

4519
02:04:12.921 --> 02:04:13.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4520
02:04:13.131 --> 02:04:13.790
<v Speaker 1>this shit sucks.</v>

4521
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:14.571
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

4522
02:04:14.571 --> 02:04:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm wanting to ask you about this.</v>

4523
02:04:15.561 --> 02:04:16.161
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

4524
02:04:16.161 --> 02:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Jack Three d I liked that stuff before I work out.</v>

4525
02:04:18.531 --> 02:04:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Can I take the two of them together?</v>

4526
02:04:19.521 --> 02:04:21.980
<v Speaker 1>And just literally there are no negative repercussions doing it.</v>

4527
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:23.630
<v Speaker 1>They're doing completely different things.</v>

4528
02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:24.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4529
02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:24.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4530
02:04:24.441 --> 02:04:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Jack Three d makes you fucking,</v>

4531
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:28.880
<v Speaker 1>you just feel like you got some energy to good.</v>

4532
02:04:28.881 --> 02:04:29.361
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

4533
02:04:29.361 --> 02:04:31.610
<v Speaker 1>we have no affiliation with Jack Three d use,</v>

4534
02:04:31.611 --> 02:04:34.100
<v Speaker 1>whichever nitric oxide supplement you enjoy.</v>

4535
02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:36.260
<v Speaker 1>But a buddy of mine told me about Jack Three d is like,</v>

4536
02:04:36.261 --> 02:04:36.441
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4537
02:04:36.441 --> 02:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I like this stuff.</v>

4538
02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And I'd started taking,</v>

4539
02:04:37.810 --> 02:04:38.643
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4540
02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:39.631
<v Speaker 4>give you a little boost.</v>

4541
02:04:39.631 --> 02:04:40.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4542
02:04:40.110 --> 02:04:43.110
<v Speaker 4>You know what else is great to Beta Alanine Beta Alanine.</v>

4543
02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Dr Ulous told me about this,</v>

4544
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:45.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4545
02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:45.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4546
02:04:45.930 --> 02:04:48.000
<v Speaker 4>you was a famous sports doctor and he said,</v>

4547
02:04:48.001 --> 02:04:51.270
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the few things that he's noticed like over the past few years,</v>

4548
02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:55.770
<v Speaker 4>supplements that he finds to be really legit as far as like a muscle building,</v>

4549
02:04:55.771 --> 02:04:57.450
<v Speaker 4>like a muscle recovery.</v>

4550
02:04:57.610 --> 02:04:58.051
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

4551
02:04:58.051 --> 02:05:00.320
<v Speaker 4>he's found that he makes a big gains of this stuff or,</v>

4552
02:05:00.321 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 4>or quicker gains.</v>

4553
02:05:01.530 --> 02:05:03.330
<v Speaker 4>She has used to and he's pretty in tune with his body.</v>

4554
02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:04.510
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing about this,</v>

4555
02:05:04.511 --> 02:05:05.640
<v Speaker 4>a shroom tech stuff.</v>

4556
02:05:05.730 --> 02:05:07.470
<v Speaker 4>I think you have to be in tune with your body.</v>

4557
02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.221
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4558
02:05:08.221 --> 02:05:09.060
<v Speaker 4>when people ask me like,</v>

4559
02:05:09.061 --> 02:05:09.241
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4560
02:05:09.241 --> 02:05:11.040
<v Speaker 4>what should I buy this stuff?</v>

4561
02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:12.180
<v Speaker 4>Should I buy that shroom tech stuff?</v>

4562
02:05:12.181 --> 02:05:13.670
<v Speaker 4>Like do you work out how to,</v>

4563
02:05:13.710 --> 02:05:14.543
<v Speaker 4>how hard you work?</v>

4564
02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:15.720
<v Speaker 4>If you don't work out really hard,</v>

4565
02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:16.700
<v Speaker 4>save your money.</v>

4566
02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:18.190
<v Speaker 4>It'd be nice just for the energy boost.</v>

4567
02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:19.880
<v Speaker 4>So instead of having Starbucks everyday.</v>

4568
02:05:20.650 --> 02:05:21.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4569
02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.310
<v Speaker 4>But Starbucks different energy.</v>

4570
02:05:23.311 --> 02:05:24.144
<v Speaker 4>A different kind of,</v>

4571
02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:26.280
<v Speaker 4>once you start working out,</v>

4572
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:28.020
<v Speaker 4>that's when you really start to feel it.</v>

4573
02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:28.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4574
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:28.861
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>

4575
02:05:28.861 --> 02:05:29.470
<v Speaker 4>Starbucks.</v>

4576
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean when you hit a fucking,</v>

4577
02:05:30.931 --> 02:05:31.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4578
02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:31.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4579
02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:34.320
<v Speaker 4>a [inaudible] coffee at Starbucks and you two sips in it.</v>

4580
02:05:34.321 --> 02:05:35.610
<v Speaker 4>You fucking love everything.</v>

4581
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Pukka I want to go fucking paint my car.</v>

4582
02:05:37.981 --> 02:05:38.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4583
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:41.040
<v Speaker 4>you get like almost like a meth crank.</v>

4584
02:05:41.070 --> 02:05:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like really excited feeling to it.</v>

4585
02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:46.940
<v Speaker 4>You don't ever get that with shroom tech Trent.</v>

4586
02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:47.491
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

4587
02:05:47.491 --> 02:05:49.590
<v Speaker 4>It's 30 ounces and it's the size of your stomach.</v>

4588
02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:49.771
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

4589
02:05:49.771 --> 02:05:50.604
<v Speaker 4>You're going to die.</v>

4590
02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:53.550
<v Speaker 4>I do one of those a day that's going to Jack your whole system,</v>

4591
02:05:53.551 --> 02:05:54.384
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4592
02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:55.473
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4593
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:56.663
<v Speaker 4>sleep.</v>

4594
02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:57.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4595
02:05:57.580 --> 02:05:57.880
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

4596
02:05:57.880 --> 02:05:58.440
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be,</v>

4597
02:05:58.440 --> 02:05:59.610
<v Speaker 4>you must be massively addicted.</v>

4598
02:05:59.611 --> 02:06:00.930
<v Speaker 4>The other stream tech product though,</v>

4599
02:06:00.931 --> 02:06:01.560
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

4600
02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:02.600
<v Speaker 4>Everybody should definitely.</v>

4601
02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:04.800
<v Speaker 4>And what is the difference?</v>

4602
02:06:04.801 --> 02:06:05.251
<v Speaker 4>What's the,</v>

4603
02:06:05.251 --> 02:06:05.481
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4604
02:06:05.481 --> 02:06:06.001
<v Speaker 4>the stuff,</v>

4605
02:06:06.001 --> 02:06:06.391
<v Speaker 4>insurance,</v>

4606
02:06:06.391 --> 02:06:07.590
<v Speaker 4>a whole different set of mushrooms.</v>

4607
02:06:07.591 --> 02:06:08.430
<v Speaker 4>So from,</v>

4608
02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:08.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4609
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:09.780
<v Speaker 4>from Aloha medicinals,</v>

4610
02:06:09.781 --> 02:06:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Dr John Holidays,</v>

4611
02:06:10.711 --> 02:06:13.470
<v Speaker 4>his kind of flagship product is this product called Iowa Immune,</v>

4612
02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:16.890
<v Speaker 4>which takes certain elements of these mushrooms that he grows together and the</v>

4613
02:06:16.891 --> 02:06:17.590
<v Speaker 4>substrate,</v>

4614
02:06:17.590 --> 02:06:17.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4615
02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:21.630
<v Speaker 4>it's actually a very specific part of it and they're called triple righthand</v>

4616
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:26.760
<v Speaker 4>helix polysaccharide Beta glucans and what these particular mushrooms do and</v>

4617
02:06:26.761 --> 02:06:27.270
<v Speaker 4>their president,</v>

4618
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Chaga mushrooms in particular,</v>

4619
02:06:28.411 --> 02:06:29.430
<v Speaker 4>the strong quantity.</v>

4620
02:06:29.431 --> 02:06:30.120
<v Speaker 4>I take that.</v>

4621
02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:30.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4622
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:31.350
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

4623
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:33.850
<v Speaker 4>what they do is they actually trigger a,</v>

4624
02:06:34.090 --> 02:06:35.940
<v Speaker 4>an innate response from the immune system.</v>

4625
02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:38.310
<v Speaker 4>So in the body's natural immune system,</v>

4626
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:41.610
<v Speaker 4>the gut is responsible for a lot of the,</v>

4627
02:06:41.690 --> 02:06:41.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4628
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:45.180
<v Speaker 4>natural killer cells that actually fight all the pathogens and entering</v>

4629
02:06:45.181 --> 02:06:45.871
<v Speaker 4>bacteria,</v>

4630
02:06:45.871 --> 02:06:46.704
<v Speaker 4>viruses,</v>

4631
02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.000
<v Speaker 4>cancer cells that are shed.</v>

4632
02:06:48.270 --> 02:06:52.170
<v Speaker 4>And what happens at an early age for us is with all the antibiotics that are in</v>

4633
02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:52.831
<v Speaker 4>our water,</v>

4634
02:06:52.831 --> 02:06:53.360
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

4635
02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:53.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4636
02:06:53.571 --> 02:06:54.390
<v Speaker 4>that we take,</v>

4637
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:57.930
<v Speaker 4>we ended up killing scores of these probiotic bacteria in our stomachs.</v>

4638
02:06:57.930 --> 02:07:02.730
<v Speaker 4>So they are no longer available to create the amount of immune cells that can go</v>

4639
02:07:02.731 --> 02:07:05.790
<v Speaker 4>attack any invading pathogens that get us sick all the time.</v>

4640
02:07:05.970 --> 02:07:08.670
<v Speaker 4>So we're at a natural disadvantage what the,</v>

4641
02:07:08.671 --> 02:07:11.100
<v Speaker 4>and they've done a ton of studies on this io immune.</v>

4642
02:07:11.101 --> 02:07:15.060
<v Speaker 4>They're using it in Q and a at the same time as cancer patients getting</v>

4643
02:07:15.061 --> 02:07:17.460
<v Speaker 4>treatment for chemotherapy at the same time that,</v>

4644
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:17.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4645
02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:20.690
<v Speaker 4>hepatitis B patients are getting treatment with the [inaudible],</v>

4646
02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:21.600
<v Speaker 4>which is a viral,</v>

4647
02:07:21.730 --> 02:07:22.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4648
02:07:22.250 --> 02:07:22.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4649
02:07:22.410 --> 02:07:24.570
<v Speaker 4>prescribed pharmaceutical viral therapy and having,</v>

4650
02:07:24.730 --> 02:07:24.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4651
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:28.950
<v Speaker 4>dramatically positive results in combination with other treatments because it's</v>

4652
02:07:28.951 --> 02:07:31.530
<v Speaker 4>raising the body's natural immune system.</v>

4653
02:07:31.531 --> 02:07:35.010
<v Speaker 4>And how it does it is these triple righthand Beta Glucan polysaccharide</v>

4654
02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:35.471
<v Speaker 4>molecules,</v>

4655
02:07:35.471 --> 02:07:36.304
<v Speaker 4>which are unique</v>

4656
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.330
<v Speaker 7>to these mushrooms.</v>

4657
02:07:37.590 --> 02:07:38.290
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4658
02:07:38.290 --> 02:07:41.050
<v Speaker 7>they are recognized by the body as foreign elements,</v>

4659
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:41.650
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

4660
02:07:41.650 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 7>and so the body mounts up their charge of innate and natural killers,</v>

4661
02:07:45.071 --> 02:07:49.480
<v Speaker 7>these B t cells and different killer cells and basically builds an army to deal</v>

4662
02:07:49.481 --> 02:07:50.050
<v Speaker 7>with this.</v>

4663
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:51.520
<v Speaker 7>That's actually a benign threat.</v>

4664
02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:54.790
<v Speaker 7>So there's a cardboard army coming at them and they have a hundred nukes.</v>

4665
02:07:54.850 --> 02:07:55.360
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4666
02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:55.931
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

4667
02:07:55.931 --> 02:07:56.351
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

4668
02:07:56.351 --> 02:07:56.920
<v Speaker 7>So that's crazy.</v>

4669
02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:57.521
<v Speaker 7>They're mounting,</v>

4670
02:07:57.521 --> 02:08:00.610
<v Speaker 7>they're rallying and they're creating more immune cells that are capable of</v>

4671
02:08:00.611 --> 02:08:02.230
<v Speaker 7>handling actual threats.</v>

4672
02:08:02.290 --> 02:08:04.390
<v Speaker 7>And is that taxing on your system at all?</v>

4673
02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:04.780
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

4674
02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:05.540
<v Speaker 7>It's what the,</v>

4675
02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:09.070
<v Speaker 7>the system is supposed to have more natural killer cells in it naturally,</v>

4676
02:08:09.071 --> 02:08:09.521
<v Speaker 7>innately.</v>

4677
02:08:09.521 --> 02:08:09.611
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

4678
02:08:09.611 --> 02:08:10.660
<v Speaker 7>and as I was mentioning,</v>

4679
02:08:10.661 --> 02:08:12.170
<v Speaker 7>I think you might've been rummaging,</v>

4680
02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:12.760
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4681
02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:13.481
<v Speaker 7>doing something,</v>

4682
02:08:13.481 --> 02:08:14.390
<v Speaker 7>but um,</v>

4683
02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:19.150
<v Speaker 7>what happens is when the gut gets all that probiotic bacteria gets killed from</v>

4684
02:08:19.151 --> 02:08:20.950
<v Speaker 7>all the antibiotics in our different foods,</v>

4685
02:08:20.951 --> 02:08:22.510
<v Speaker 7>we water in different drugs,</v>

4686
02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:24.880
<v Speaker 7>they're not able to produce an adequate quantity.</v>

4687
02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:29.080
<v Speaker 7>So we're actually at an immune deficits and naturally do antibiotics actually</v>

4688
02:08:29.081 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 7>make it from a cow into your body when you,</v>

4689
02:08:31.541 --> 02:08:32.470
<v Speaker 7>when you eat a cow,</v>

4690
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:36.400
<v Speaker 7>the who believe so proven.</v>

4691
02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:37.630
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's been proven.</v>

4692
02:08:37.631 --> 02:08:37.930
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

4693
02:08:37.930 --> 02:08:38.763
<v Speaker 7>that's kind of a,</v>

4694
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:40.960
<v Speaker 7>but that's kind of the theory that goes on.</v>

4695
02:08:40.961 --> 02:08:42.720
<v Speaker 7>And I'd have to do some more research on it.</v>

4696
02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:43.121
<v Speaker 7>Makes Sense.</v>

4697
02:08:43.121 --> 02:08:44.290
<v Speaker 7>I know water with,</v>

4698
02:08:44.291 --> 02:08:44.591
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4699
02:08:44.591 --> 02:08:46.400
<v Speaker 7>they say that there's stuff in the water,</v>

4700
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:50.530
<v Speaker 7>but everybody who hasn't taken courses of heavy antibiotics,</v>

4701
02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:51.430
<v Speaker 7>all of us now,</v>

4702
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:52.450
<v Speaker 7>and when you do that,</v>

4703
02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:53.650
<v Speaker 7>you kill the probiotics.</v>

4704
02:08:53.651 --> 02:08:55.930
<v Speaker 7>And what moves in instead in its place is yeast.</v>

4705
02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:57.340
<v Speaker 7>And the analogy that I use,</v>

4706
02:08:57.341 --> 02:08:59.560
<v Speaker 7>it's like once you get crabgrass in your lawn,</v>

4707
02:08:59.770 --> 02:08:59.981
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4708
02:08:59.981 --> 02:09:01.300
<v Speaker 7>you can sprinkle more seed.</v>

4709
02:09:01.301 --> 02:09:03.100
<v Speaker 7>Like by taking kind of probiotics,</v>

4710
02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:04.930
<v Speaker 7>you can sprinkle more seed over the lawn,</v>

4711
02:09:04.931 --> 02:09:06.380
<v Speaker 7>but it's not going to kill the crab grass.</v>

4712
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:08.860
<v Speaker 7>They've taken up an occupied that spot.</v>

4713
02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:10.030
<v Speaker 7>So we're operating,</v>

4714
02:09:10.031 --> 02:09:10.300
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4715
02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:14.440
<v Speaker 7>our natural immune cell producers are not there in the quantity that they should</v>

4716
02:09:14.441 --> 02:09:15.580
<v Speaker 7>be that they used to be.</v>

4717
02:09:15.850 --> 02:09:16.540
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>

4718
02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:16.811
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4719
02:09:16.811 --> 02:09:19.360
<v Speaker 7>really taking these particular mushroom,</v>

4720
02:09:19.630 --> 02:09:20.050
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4721
02:09:20.050 --> 02:09:24.520
<v Speaker 7>stimulators is one way that we can actually build our army back up so it can</v>

4722
02:09:24.521 --> 02:09:25.300
<v Speaker 7>fight off.</v>

4723
02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:26.380
<v Speaker 7>Not only the little things,</v>

4724
02:09:26.381 --> 02:09:27.160
<v Speaker 7>a little colds,</v>

4725
02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:27.941
<v Speaker 7>the little flus,</v>

4726
02:09:27.941 --> 02:09:29.650
<v Speaker 7>the little stuff that we just kind of deal with.</v>

4727
02:09:29.890 --> 02:09:30.431
<v Speaker 7>But also,</v>

4728
02:09:30.431 --> 02:09:30.701
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4729
02:09:30.701 --> 02:09:32.440
<v Speaker 7>a lot of the big things start small,</v>

4730
02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:32.861
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4731
02:09:32.861 --> 02:09:35.750
<v Speaker 7>different cells shed different mutated made itself.</v>

4732
02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:38.170
<v Speaker 7>A dendritic cell should be around to just say,</v>

4733
02:09:38.290 --> 02:09:38.471
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

4734
02:09:38.471 --> 02:09:39.370
<v Speaker 7>that thing's fucked up.</v>

4735
02:09:39.371 --> 02:09:40.210
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to eat that.</v>

4736
02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:41.560
<v Speaker 7>But a lot of times that's,</v>

4737
02:09:41.561 --> 02:09:45.070
<v Speaker 7>and that doesn't happen just because we don't have the available immune innate</v>

4738
02:09:45.071 --> 02:09:46.630
<v Speaker 7>response to challenge that.</v>

4739
02:09:46.631 --> 02:09:49.580
<v Speaker 7>So shrimp tech immune combines that patented,</v>

4740
02:09:49.670 --> 02:09:49.960
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4741
02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:52.360
<v Speaker 7>the proprietary compound io immune,</v>

4742
02:09:52.361 --> 02:09:53.540
<v Speaker 7>which has been well studied in,</v>

4743
02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:54.580
<v Speaker 7>in a bunch of the studies,</v>

4744
02:09:54.730 --> 02:09:56.140
<v Speaker 7>combines it with Chaga mushroom,</v>

4745
02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.970
<v Speaker 7>which is also another great mushroom that,</v>

4746
02:09:57.971 --> 02:09:58.360
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4747
02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:01.030
<v Speaker 7>has a lot of the same triple righthand helix Beta glucans.</v>

4748
02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:01.391
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4749
02:10:01.391 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 7>it also has Estrella NAIC acid,</v>

4750
02:10:03.071 --> 02:10:06.070
<v Speaker 7>which comes actually from the birch tree in which it is found.</v>

4751
02:10:06.071 --> 02:10:10.120
<v Speaker 7>So wild harvested Chaga is actually better for you than cultivated Chaga.</v>

4752
02:10:10.270 --> 02:10:13.670
<v Speaker 7>There was a dude who had some whole video is pushing chocolate.</v>

4753
02:10:13.690 --> 02:10:13.811
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>

4754
02:10:13.811 --> 02:10:14.680
<v Speaker 7>when I first started doing it,</v>

4755
02:10:14.681 --> 02:10:16.510
<v Speaker 7>some crazy guys tattooed all over.</v>

4756
02:10:16.511 --> 02:10:17.770
<v Speaker 7>His whole body was weird,</v>

4757
02:10:17.771 --> 02:10:18.970
<v Speaker 7>like different inks and shit.</v>

4758
02:10:18.971 --> 02:10:20.260
<v Speaker 7>So it was a mushroom specialist,</v>

4759
02:10:20.590 --> 02:10:21.430
<v Speaker 7>but he had one,</v>

4760
02:10:21.431 --> 02:10:24.400
<v Speaker 7>he had a Chaga mushroom that he's holding up and it's like this big fucking</v>

4761
02:10:24.670 --> 02:10:25.750
<v Speaker 7>crazy looking thing,</v>

4762
02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:25.931
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

4763
02:10:25.931 --> 02:10:26.890
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't look like a mushroom.</v>

4764
02:10:26.891 --> 02:10:27.611
<v Speaker 7>It looks weird,</v>

4765
02:10:27.611 --> 02:10:27.761
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

4766
02:10:27.761 --> 02:10:28.410
<v Speaker 7>It looks like a,</v>

4767
02:10:28.410 --> 02:10:29.980
<v Speaker 7>a hunk of a log or something.</v>

4768
02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:30.371
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

4769
02:10:30.371 --> 02:10:30.910
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4770
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:31.940
<v Speaker 7>So weird looking at lusher.</v>

4771
02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:32.550
<v Speaker 7>This yeah.</v>

4772
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:33.170
<v Speaker 7>Grows,</v>

4773
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:33.770
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4774
02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 7>only</v>

4775
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:35.630
<v Speaker 2>on the birch tree naturally in the wild.</v>

4776
02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:38.720
<v Speaker 2>Mushrooms are closer to animals and the art of plants.</v>

4777
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4778
02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:40.491
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4779
02:10:40.491 --> 02:10:41.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a very interesting species.</v>

4780
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:43.250
<v Speaker 2>We're fucking thing around forever.</v>

4781
02:10:43.670 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Organism in the world is a mushroom colony that lives in the Pacific northwest</v>

4782
02:10:47.931 --> 02:10:48.400
<v Speaker 2>and Emma,</v>

4783
02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Nita Barbosa I think is the species name of that colony.</v>

4784
02:10:51.561 --> 02:10:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

4785
02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.540
<v Speaker 2>The conference 37 acres,</v>

4786
02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:57.140
<v Speaker 2>giant organism that like is in the ground.</v>

4787
02:10:57.450 --> 02:10:58.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4788
02:10:58.220 --> 02:10:59.090
<v Speaker 2>it's really nuts.</v>

4789
02:10:59.150 --> 02:10:59.661
<v Speaker 2>It is Jim.</v>

4790
02:10:59.661 --> 02:11:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Imagine at 37 Acre being,</v>

4791
02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean yeah,</v>

4792
02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:07.010
<v Speaker 2>you could take chunks of it and make other beings,</v>

4793
02:11:07.011 --> 02:11:08.450
<v Speaker 2>you can import them other places,</v>

4794
02:11:08.451 --> 02:11:10.190
<v Speaker 2>but essentially it's one,</v>

4795
02:11:10.191 --> 02:11:12.890
<v Speaker 2>one sort of a being and it's like a network,</v>

4796
02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:13.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4797
02:11:13.671 --> 02:11:13.911
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4798
02:11:13.911 --> 02:11:16.310
<v Speaker 2>if mushrooms really do have intelligence,</v>

4799
02:11:16.311 --> 02:11:17.600
<v Speaker 2>you know like when you eat well,</v>

4800
02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:19.640
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a lot of people that believe that plants have a certain</v>

4801
02:11:19.641 --> 02:11:20.330
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

4802
02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:22.160
<v Speaker 2>they don't just don't have the ability to communicate,</v>

4803
02:11:22.610 --> 02:11:25.130
<v Speaker 2>but if these mushrooms have an ability,</v>

4804
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:28.130
<v Speaker 2>somehow our ability to communicate because they're all connected like that and</v>

4805
02:11:28.131 --> 02:11:30.140
<v Speaker 2>they have this intelligence that can communicate with each other.</v>

4806
02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Like that's some incredible like information superhighway that's in the forest</v>

4807
02:11:35.151 --> 02:11:35.600
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>

4808
02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4809
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.340
<v Speaker 2>it sounds very avatar,</v>

4810
02:11:37.341 --> 02:11:38.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's very hot.</v>

4811
02:11:38.370 --> 02:11:38.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4812
02:11:38.791 --> 02:11:43.730
<v Speaker 2>it does look avatars based on a lot of like Hippie dippie woo ideas about,</v>

4813
02:11:43.731 --> 02:11:44.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4814
02:11:44.061 --> 02:11:44.291
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4815
02:11:44.291 --> 02:11:44.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4816
02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:44.711
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4817
02:11:44.711 --> 02:11:46.100
<v Speaker 2>the intelligence of plants.</v>

4818
02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:47.660
<v Speaker 2>But I've talked to people,</v>

4819
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I have to research whether or not it's real,</v>

4820
02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:53.000
<v Speaker 2>but like plants can tell when they're around certain persons who have harmed</v>

4821
02:11:53.001 --> 02:11:53.241
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

4822
02:11:53.241 --> 02:11:53.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4823
02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:56.770
<v Speaker 2>someone comes along and chops a fucking plant with an ax and then that person's</v>

4824
02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:57.410
<v Speaker 2>near the plant.</v>

4825
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:58.940
<v Speaker 2>You can register it on a plant.</v>

4826
02:11:59.330 --> 02:12:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't know if there's some interesting studies on the music influencing the</v>

4827
02:12:02.541 --> 02:12:03.374
<v Speaker 2>growth of plants,</v>

4828
02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:06.320
<v Speaker 2>like death metal versus classical real asco music.</v>

4829
02:12:06.321 --> 02:12:06.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4830
02:12:06.471 --> 02:12:08.150
<v Speaker 2>There's some really interesting studies on that.</v>

4831
02:12:08.151 --> 02:12:09.020
<v Speaker 2>How nobody likes,</v>

4832
02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:11.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not even the plants.</v>

4833
02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:12.673
<v Speaker 2>Even plants,</v>

4834
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:15.290
<v Speaker 2>they live in dirt and they'd survive on cow shit,</v>

4835
02:12:15.291 --> 02:12:17.930
<v Speaker 2>but they have better taste than death metal.</v>

4836
02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Something about that energy that deal with Alpha brain is a,</v>

4837
02:12:22.371 --> 02:12:26.210
<v Speaker 2>is a very fucking polarizing subject I've found on the Internet.</v>

4838
02:12:26.211 --> 02:12:27.470
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a fascinating thing,</v>

4839
02:12:27.471 --> 02:12:27.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4840
02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:28.700
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

4841
02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Nootropics.</v>

4842
02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:29.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4843
02:12:29.871 --> 02:12:32.540
<v Speaker 2>we've been talking about nootropics on my message board for like the longest</v>

4844
02:12:32.541 --> 02:12:35.810
<v Speaker 2>time and I've been experimenting with them for years,</v>

4845
02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:38.840
<v Speaker 2>but until we started getting in the business of actually selling them,</v>

4846
02:12:38.841 --> 02:12:41.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize how country people can deal with this things.</v>

4847
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:41.841
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4848
02:12:41.841 --> 02:12:42.674
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4849
02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:43.910
<v Speaker 2>one of the criticisms,</v>

4850
02:12:43.911 --> 02:12:45.170
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's some legitimacy.</v>

4851
02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:48.860
<v Speaker 2>This is the way it's marketed and one of the things is,</v>

4852
02:12:48.861 --> 02:12:49.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4853
02:12:49.670 --> 02:12:50.300
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

4854
02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:52.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not on purpose.</v>

4855
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

4856
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:53.211
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4857
02:12:53.211 --> 02:12:57.680
<v Speaker 2>I think what the way you set it up was you just trying to be enthusiastic about</v>

4858
02:12:57.681 --> 02:12:57.860
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4859
02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:00.380
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with somebody once said that,</v>

4860
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:01.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4861
02:13:01.490 --> 02:13:02.510
<v Speaker 2>I forgot where I wrote this.</v>

4862
02:13:02.850 --> 02:13:03.061
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4863
02:13:03.061 --> 02:13:03.210
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4864
02:13:03.210 --> 02:13:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4865
02:13:03.370 --> 02:13:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4866
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I believe I read it today,</v>

4867
02:13:05.070 --> 02:13:05.320
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

4868
02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:06.590
<v Speaker 2>it might've been on the message board,</v>

4869
02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:11.300
<v Speaker 2>but it was about in first impression that it's very difficult to take that back.</v>

4870
02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:15.440
<v Speaker 2>And once you create something and you put something out there and people get an</v>

4871
02:13:15.441 --> 02:13:16.400
<v Speaker 2>idea who you are,</v>

4872
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:21.350
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for them to correct that and normalize and come.</v>

4873
02:13:21.590 --> 02:13:24.200
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be really careful what your initial first thing is.</v>

4874
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:28.670
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that we get criticized with is this Guy Steve Novella,</v>

4875
02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:29.391
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

4876
02:13:29.391 --> 02:13:30.224
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4877
02:13:30.590 --> 02:13:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

4878
02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:31.920
<v Speaker 2>some super smart dude.</v>

4879
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:32.851
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

4880
02:13:32.851 --> 02:13:33.960
<v Speaker 2>what do you know what,</v>

4881
02:13:33.961 --> 02:13:34.794
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

4882
02:13:34.890 --> 02:13:35.161
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

4883
02:13:35.161 --> 02:13:35.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4884
02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:36.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4885
02:13:36.181 --> 02:13:37.280
<v Speaker 2>he was Ashley's from,</v>

4886
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4887
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:38.780
<v Speaker 2>thought it was,</v>

4888
02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:39.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4889
02:13:39.090 --> 02:13:40.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe perhaps Yale University.</v>

4890
02:13:40.681 --> 02:13:41.514
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

4891
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:42.661
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't say,</v>

4892
02:13:42.661 --> 02:13:43.890
<v Speaker 2>but essentially what he's,</v>

4893
02:13:43.891 --> 02:13:46.290
<v Speaker 2>he's criticizing the way that the,</v>

4894
02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:47.153
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4895
02:13:47.850 --> 02:13:49.440
<v Speaker 2>that the way that it's marketed,</v>

4896
02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:51.870
<v Speaker 2>the way there's a studies were put out there.</v>

4897
02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:53.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4898
02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:53.951
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4899
02:13:53.951 --> 02:13:56.140
<v Speaker 7>I think looking at that criticism I think,</v>

4900
02:13:56.170 --> 02:13:57.850
<v Speaker 7>and any variety of criticism,</v>

4901
02:13:57.851 --> 02:13:58.240
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

4902
02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:58.730
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

4903
02:13:58.730 --> 02:13:59.563
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4904
02:13:59.710 --> 02:14:02.260
<v Speaker 7>you have to just learn and adapt and get better from it.</v>

4905
02:14:02.261 --> 02:14:03.094
<v Speaker 7>And I think he,</v>

4906
02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:05.530
<v Speaker 7>I think he has a very skeptical mindset,</v>

4907
02:14:05.531 --> 02:14:08.230
<v Speaker 7>which I think in a lot of avenues is very positive.</v>

4908
02:14:08.231 --> 02:14:08.980
<v Speaker 7>But I think,</v>

4909
02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:09.251
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4910
02:14:09.251 --> 02:14:10.120
<v Speaker 7>it can be overdone.</v>

4911
02:14:10.121 --> 02:14:11.770
<v Speaker 7>He actually runs a few shows called,</v>

4912
02:14:11.930 --> 02:14:12.190
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4913
02:14:12.190 --> 02:14:13.030
<v Speaker 7>the skeptic,</v>

4914
02:14:13.330 --> 02:14:13.810
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4915
02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:16.420
<v Speaker 7>some skeptic hour or some variety of different things.</v>

4916
02:14:16.421 --> 02:14:18.040
<v Speaker 7>So he has that kind of framework in mind.</v>

4917
02:14:18.041 --> 02:14:18.731
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

4918
02:14:18.731 --> 02:14:20.380
<v Speaker 7>some of his criticisms are fair,</v>

4919
02:14:20.410 --> 02:14:20.681
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4920
02:14:20.681 --> 02:14:21.430
<v Speaker 7>really,</v>

4921
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:22.060
<v Speaker 7>and what,</v>

4922
02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:22.390
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4923
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:23.890
<v Speaker 7>taking that criticism and you know,</v>

4924
02:14:23.891 --> 02:14:28.080
<v Speaker 7>a lot of criticism from the board that even if it's very negatively put a</v>

4925
02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:29.380
<v Speaker 7>applying that has helped,</v>

4926
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:30.100
<v Speaker 7>I believe,</v>

4927
02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:30.460
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4928
02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:31.420
<v Speaker 7>us to become better,</v>

4929
02:14:31.421 --> 02:14:34.690
<v Speaker 7>at least myself as a person to become better as far as marketing that.</v>

4930
02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:35.531
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

4931
02:14:35.531 --> 02:14:38.290
<v Speaker 7>there's certain areas that you got to shore up and you gotta be tighter and you</v>

4932
02:14:38.291 --> 02:14:42.520
<v Speaker 7>got to be better and really try and present information so that just people have</v>

4933
02:14:42.521 --> 02:14:45.370
<v Speaker 7>as much information as possible can make educated decisions.</v>

4934
02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:45.941
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

4935
02:14:45.941 --> 02:14:46.181
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

4936
02:14:46.181 --> 02:14:49.720
<v Speaker 7>the many people who take Alpha brain and about amazing results,</v>

4937
02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:50.141
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4938
02:14:50.141 --> 02:14:50.974
<v Speaker 7>that is,</v>

4939
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:52.360
<v Speaker 7>that will be evidence for,</v>

4940
02:14:52.630 --> 02:14:52.871
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4941
02:14:52.871 --> 02:14:54.340
<v Speaker 7>for a lot of people to give it a try.</v>

4942
02:14:54.341 --> 02:14:54.881
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

4943
02:14:54.881 --> 02:14:55.810
<v Speaker 7>if they don't like it,</v>

4944
02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:56.411
<v Speaker 7>then,</v>

4945
02:14:56.411 --> 02:14:56.651
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4946
02:14:56.651 --> 02:14:59.230
<v Speaker 7>then they can get their money back and they don't even have to send the bottle</v>

4947
02:14:59.231 --> 02:14:59.651
<v Speaker 7>back in.</v>

4948
02:14:59.651 --> 02:15:02.500
<v Speaker 7>We'll give you your money back on your first bottle without even sending it in.</v>

4949
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Some people have,</v>

4950
02:15:03.811 --> 02:15:03.991
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4951
02:15:03.991 --> 02:15:05.910
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people have experienced positive results.</v>

4952
02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I S I personally experienced positive results.</v>

4953
02:15:08.431 --> 02:15:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I use it every day.</v>

4954
02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:10.373
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>

4955
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes a difference.</v>

4956
02:15:11.491 --> 02:15:12.330
<v Speaker 2>When I don't take it,</v>

4957
02:15:12.331 --> 02:15:13.164
<v Speaker 2>I feel it.</v>

4958
02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4959
02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:14.730
<v Speaker 2>it's not a huge difference,</v>

4960
02:15:14.731 --> 02:15:15.421
<v Speaker 2>but it's something,</v>

4961
02:15:15.421 --> 02:15:16.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a clarity.</v>

4962
02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I believe in it 100%.</v>

4963
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:18.590
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

4964
02:15:18.590 --> 02:15:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4965
02:15:18.810 --> 02:15:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I've really like,</v>

4966
02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:20.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4967
02:15:20.370 --> 02:15:22.080
<v Speaker 2>just like with the quadriceps mushroom supplement,</v>

4968
02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I work out a lot.</v>

4969
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I eat really healthy.</v>

4970
02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I know for the most part what's going on with my body and I feel I can feel</v>

4971
02:15:28.831 --> 02:15:29.401
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

4972
02:15:29.401 --> 02:15:30.690
<v Speaker 2>I know when I'm tired,</v>

4973
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:31.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4974
02:15:31.050 --> 02:15:32.070
<v Speaker 2>because of too much,</v>

4975
02:15:32.071 --> 02:15:32.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4976
02:15:32.371 --> 02:15:33.450
<v Speaker 2>not enough sleep,</v>

4977
02:15:33.451 --> 02:15:34.021
<v Speaker 2>too much work,</v>

4978
02:15:34.021 --> 02:15:34.380
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4979
02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:38.450
<v Speaker 2>I know when things are in sync and when things are in sync and I've taken out</v>

4980
02:15:38.451 --> 02:15:39.090
<v Speaker 2>for brain,</v>

4981
02:15:39.090 --> 02:15:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I feel boost.</v>

4982
02:15:39.961 --> 02:15:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I feel a difference.</v>

4983
02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4984
02:15:41.730 --> 02:15:42.780
<v Speaker 2>but other people know,</v>

4985
02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:44.010
<v Speaker 2>other people don't.</v>

4986
02:15:44.011 --> 02:15:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Not only do they not feel something,</v>

4987
02:15:45.331 --> 02:15:46.164
<v Speaker 2>they get sick.</v>

4988
02:15:46.230 --> 02:15:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Like I've talked to people online and there's too many of them to ignore it,</v>

4989
02:15:49.711 --> 02:15:51.060
<v Speaker 2>but they say it made him feel like shit.</v>

4990
02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:51.691
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4991
02:15:51.691 --> 02:15:52.524
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>

4992
02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:52.740
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4993
02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:56.060
<v Speaker 7>there's a certain sensitivity to pursue serrato which is creating an</v>

4994
02:15:56.061 --> 02:15:57.110
<v Speaker 7>acetylcholine boost.</v>

4995
02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:57.831
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

4996
02:15:57.831 --> 02:15:58.460
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4997
02:15:58.460 --> 02:15:58.821
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4998
02:15:58.821 --> 02:15:59.870
<v Speaker 7>that's something that,</v>

4999
02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:02.510
<v Speaker 7>that we're addressing and in future form and it's not,</v>

5000
02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:05.360
<v Speaker 7>it will actually make somebody feel potentially,</v>

5001
02:16:05.370 --> 02:16:06.740
<v Speaker 7>and this is our only,</v>

5002
02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:06.951
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5003
02:16:06.951 --> 02:16:08.630
<v Speaker 7>this is our best estimation of what's happening,</v>

5004
02:16:08.631 --> 02:16:11.570
<v Speaker 7>but it seems like the case when they take too big of a dose,</v>

5005
02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:11.970
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5006
02:16:11.970 --> 02:16:15.560
<v Speaker 7>the Acetylcholine levels get to get basically two high end.</v>

5007
02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:16.611
<v Speaker 2>I tell people,</v>

5008
02:16:16.611 --> 02:16:17.444
<v Speaker 2>take one,</v>

5009
02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:18.021
<v Speaker 2>take one,</v>

5010
02:16:18.021 --> 02:16:18.791
<v Speaker 2>start off with one.</v>

5011
02:16:18.791 --> 02:16:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5012
02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:20.150
<v Speaker 2>it's best to be conservative.</v>

5013
02:16:20.151 --> 02:16:20.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5014
02:16:20.361 --> 02:16:22.100
<v Speaker 2>this is no wonder without food,</v>

5015
02:16:22.101 --> 02:16:22.430
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

5016
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:23.263
<v Speaker 2>how do you recommend it</v>

5017
02:16:23.850 --> 02:16:24.211
<v Speaker 7>meal?</v>

5018
02:16:24.211 --> 02:16:25.560
<v Speaker 7>Especially if you're on a,</v>

5019
02:16:25.561 --> 02:16:27.120
<v Speaker 7>especially if you're on taking one,</v>

5020
02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:27.331
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5021
02:16:27.331 --> 02:16:28.200
<v Speaker 7>maybe a very,</v>

5022
02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 7>not a completely dead empty stomach,</v>

5023
02:16:30.041 --> 02:16:30.550
<v Speaker 7>but you should,</v>

5024
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:32.770
<v Speaker 7>if you pile it on to a giant cheeseburger,</v>

5025
02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:33.041
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5026
02:16:33.041 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 7>you've got so much stuff going on,</v>

5027
02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:37.280
<v Speaker 7>it's going to be very difficult and it might just get pushed through.</v>

5028
02:16:37.281 --> 02:16:39.460
<v Speaker 7>But does it enhance its absorption using food?</v>

5029
02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:40.150
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5030
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.391
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

5031
02:16:40.391 --> 02:16:42.780
<v Speaker 7>It's just an enhances its tolerability too.</v>

5032
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:43.750
<v Speaker 7>To a certain degree.</v>

5033
02:16:43.751 --> 02:16:44.620
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't bother me at all.</v>

5034
02:16:44.621 --> 02:16:45.570
<v Speaker 7>I take it on an empty stomach.</v>

5035
02:16:45.610 --> 02:16:46.181
<v Speaker 7>I do too.</v>

5036
02:16:46.181 --> 02:16:46.571
<v Speaker 7>I do too.</v>

5037
02:16:46.571 --> 02:16:46.901
<v Speaker 7>But it's,</v>

5038
02:16:46.901 --> 02:16:47.320
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

5039
02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:47.531
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5040
02:16:47.531 --> 02:16:49.660
<v Speaker 7>some people that may actually enhance the effects.</v>

5041
02:16:49.661 --> 02:16:51.010
<v Speaker 7>So until you get,</v>

5042
02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:52.570
<v Speaker 7>until you get kind of comfortable with it,</v>

5043
02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:54.670
<v Speaker 7>I think definitely best to be conservative,</v>

5044
02:16:54.671 --> 02:16:55.990
<v Speaker 7>invest to take some breaks to,</v>

5045
02:16:55.991 --> 02:16:56.170
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5046
02:16:56.170 --> 02:16:57.040
<v Speaker 7>start with one.</v>

5047
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.760
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5048
02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:00.190
<v Speaker 7>see how you feel and you don't have to take it every day.</v>

5049
02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:01.870
<v Speaker 7>What percentage of people do you think are,</v>

5050
02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:03.820
<v Speaker 7>have a sensitivity to it?</v>

5051
02:17:03.821 --> 02:17:04.970
<v Speaker 7>It's a very small percentage,</v>

5052
02:17:04.971 --> 02:17:05.800
<v Speaker 7>a small percentage.</v>

5053
02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:05.981
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

5054
02:17:05.981 --> 02:17:08.620
<v Speaker 7>overwhelmingly the response has been positive and we get that.</v>

5055
02:17:08.621 --> 02:17:09.371
<v Speaker 7>We get those people,</v>

5056
02:17:09.371 --> 02:17:10.060
<v Speaker 7>all those people,</v>

5057
02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:10.271
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5058
02:17:10.271 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 7>contact us for their money back.</v>

5059
02:17:12.041 --> 02:17:13.870
<v Speaker 7>We give them their money back and it's a very,</v>

5060
02:17:13.871 --> 02:17:14.860
<v Speaker 7>very small percent.</v>

5061
02:17:14.861 --> 02:17:15.101
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

5062
02:17:15.101 --> 02:17:15.281
<v Speaker 7>our,</v>

5063
02:17:15.281 --> 02:17:16.000
<v Speaker 7>our,</v>

5064
02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.830
<v Speaker 7>that rate I would have to say is less than one out of every 200.</v>

5065
02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:21.401
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

5066
02:17:21.401 --> 02:17:21.601
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

5067
02:17:21.601 --> 02:17:21.971
<v Speaker 7>it is,</v>

5068
02:17:21.971 --> 02:17:25.060
<v Speaker 7>it is definitely a bummer and it's something we want to address and at least,</v>

5069
02:17:25.061 --> 02:17:28.330
<v Speaker 7>especially by telling people to start conservative with their dosage and then</v>

5070
02:17:28.331 --> 02:17:29.650
<v Speaker 7>taking a look at,</v>

5071
02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:30.100
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

5072
02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:32.410
<v Speaker 7>at the Hoop Herzliya Serrata and we actually have,</v>

5073
02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:32.831
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5074
02:17:32.831 --> 02:17:34.720
<v Speaker 7>have some things in mind for the proper,</v>

5075
02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:35.080
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5076
02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:36.410
<v Speaker 7>proper balances of see,</v>

5077
02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:41.480
<v Speaker 7>oh Perseus Durata to GPC calling to make sure that those are going to be better</v>

5078
02:17:41.741 --> 02:17:42.574
<v Speaker 7>tolerated,</v>

5079
02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:43.180
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

5080
02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:44.590
<v Speaker 7>throughout the future of Alpha brain.</v>

5081
02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:45.423
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

5082
02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:45.910
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5083
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:47.140
<v Speaker 7>hopefully just like I said,</v>

5084
02:17:47.141 --> 02:17:47.351
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5085
02:17:47.351 --> 02:17:48.480
<v Speaker 7>you learn and a,</v>

5086
02:17:48.490 --> 02:17:51.550
<v Speaker 7>you try and improve and be the best product for everybody.</v>

5087
02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:52.750
<v Speaker 7>I think for some people,</v>

5088
02:17:52.751 --> 02:17:53.021
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5089
02:17:53.021 --> 02:17:53.711
<v Speaker 7>it won't work.</v>

5090
02:17:53.711 --> 02:17:54.580
<v Speaker 7>And for some people,</v>

5091
02:17:54.710 --> 02:17:55.060
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5092
02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:55.691
<v Speaker 7>they may not,</v>

5093
02:17:55.691 --> 02:17:57.100
<v Speaker 7>they may have an adverse reaction,</v>

5094
02:17:57.101 --> 02:17:57.660
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

5095
02:17:57.660 --> 02:17:57.910
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5096
02:17:57.910 --> 02:18:01.020
<v Speaker 7>the overwhelming majority is spoken very positively and it's,</v>

5097
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.420
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5098
02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:02.860
<v Speaker 7>it's great to hear that feedback from,</v>

5099
02:18:02.861 --> 02:18:03.400
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5100
02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:06.820
<v Speaker 7>from the product is one of the dudes who's on the message board.</v>

5101
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:07.150
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

5102
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:09.400
<v Speaker 7>his name is James MMA,</v>

5103
02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:10.780
<v Speaker 7>very bright guy,</v>

5104
02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:11.730
<v Speaker 7>and he's a,</v>

5105
02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:13.840
<v Speaker 7>one of the skeptics are critics.</v>

5106
02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:16.510
<v Speaker 7>And you had a conversation with him about,</v>

5107
02:18:16.570 --> 02:18:17.320
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5108
02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:18.370
<v Speaker 7>he'd asked you,</v>

5109
02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:18.851
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5110
02:18:18.851 --> 02:18:19.100
<v Speaker 7>how,</v>

5111
02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:21.790
<v Speaker 7>how it works improving cognitive function.</v>

5112
02:18:21.791 --> 02:18:22.900
<v Speaker 7>Like what the fuck could does?</v>

5113
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:23.881
<v Speaker 7>And we,</v>

5114
02:18:23.881 --> 02:18:24.471
<v Speaker 7>you said the,</v>

5115
02:18:24.471 --> 02:18:27.580
<v Speaker 7>basically that Alpha brain is designed to provide the precursors and raw</v>

5116
02:18:27.581 --> 02:18:31.600
<v Speaker 7>nutrients necessary to raise levels of important neurotransmitters such as</v>

5117
02:18:31.601 --> 02:18:33.520
<v Speaker 7>Acetylcholine and dopamine and Gaba.</v>

5118
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:34.480
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

5119
02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:36.010
<v Speaker 7>how is that done?</v>

5120
02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:36.491
<v Speaker 7>What is,</v>

5121
02:18:36.491 --> 02:18:36.851
<v Speaker 7>what does it,</v>

5122
02:18:36.851 --> 02:18:41.851
<v Speaker 7>what's the mechanism that allows it to raise these levels of these important</v>

5123
02:18:42.011 --> 02:18:42.940
<v Speaker 7>neurotransmitters?</v>

5124
02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:43.871
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

5125
02:18:43.871 --> 02:18:44.860
<v Speaker 7>it's just depends on,</v>

5126
02:18:44.930 --> 02:18:45.370
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5127
02:18:45.370 --> 02:18:46.870
<v Speaker 7>which neurotransmitter you're talking about.</v>

5128
02:18:46.871 --> 02:18:49.570
<v Speaker 7>But if you're talking about acetylcholine and we come at that in two fronts.</v>

5129
02:18:49.810 --> 02:18:50.471
<v Speaker 7>The GPC,</v>

5130
02:18:50.471 --> 02:18:54.310
<v Speaker 7>Coleen is one of the raw nutrients involved in the production of Acetylcholine.</v>

5131
02:18:54.311 --> 02:18:56.920
<v Speaker 7>So by providing the more of the raw ingredient,</v>

5132
02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:58.840
<v Speaker 7>it allows the body to produce more.</v>

5133
02:18:58.990 --> 02:18:59.741
<v Speaker 7>And then who Percy.</v>

5134
02:18:59.741 --> 02:19:01.390
<v Speaker 7>Serratus is coming at a different angle.</v>

5135
02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:03.730
<v Speaker 7>That's actually a inhibiting.</v>

5136
02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:04.743
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5137
02:19:05.350 --> 02:19:06.760
<v Speaker 7>it's actually inhibiting the,</v>

5138
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:10.120
<v Speaker 7>the amount of Acetylcholine at the body breaks down.</v>

5139
02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:14.830
<v Speaker 7>So it's providing more acetylcholine from a kind of a different angle by</v>

5140
02:19:14.831 --> 02:19:19.420
<v Speaker 7>actually creating a surplus of what you currently have rather than the,</v>

5141
02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:20.920
<v Speaker 7>than the GPC calling,</v>

5142
02:19:20.921 --> 02:19:21.790
<v Speaker 7>which is creating,</v>

5143
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.720
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

5144
02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:26.320
<v Speaker 7>more raw material to provide the acetylcholine and the other,</v>

5145
02:19:26.321 --> 02:19:30.020
<v Speaker 7>the other neurotransmitters fall more along the lines of the GPC Coleen,</v>

5146
02:19:30.021 --> 02:19:33.830
<v Speaker 7>where you're just providing the raw nutrients to allow the body to take the</v>

5147
02:19:33.831 --> 02:19:38.831
<v Speaker 7>steps to produce those raw nutrients and turn those into the neuro transmitters.</v>

5148
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:40.790
<v Speaker 7>And this is actually another thing.</v>

5149
02:19:40.791 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 7>This is the foundation of the new mood formula,</v>

5150
02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:44.210
<v Speaker 7>which is providing,</v>

5151
02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:44.421
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5152
02:19:44.421 --> 02:19:48.410
<v Speaker 7>there's four major neurotransmitters as identified by Dr Braverman.</v>

5153
02:19:48.650 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5154
02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:54.100
<v Speaker 7>and the other one is serotonin and five HTP is the direct precursor to</v>

5155
02:19:55.371 --> 02:19:56.204
<v Speaker 7>Serotonin.</v>

5156
02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:59.000
<v Speaker 7>And in the same way in that product,</v>

5157
02:19:59.140 --> 02:19:59.420
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5158
02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:03.650
<v Speaker 7>by providing the raw nutrient that the body then converts into Serotonin,</v>

5159
02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:07.130
<v Speaker 7>you create a surplus of serotonin without having to take,</v>

5160
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:07.700
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

5161
02:20:07.700 --> 02:20:09.350
<v Speaker 7>any other kind of prescription drugs.</v>

5162
02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:12.560
<v Speaker 7>And there's actually a cool study on that front to illustrate the point.</v>

5163
02:20:12.561 --> 02:20:17.270
<v Speaker 7>There's actually been a bit more research on the serotonin effect because of the</v>

5164
02:20:17.420 --> 02:20:21.680
<v Speaker 7>massive amounts of Ssri and prescription drugs in that field.</v>

5165
02:20:21.870 --> 02:20:22.110
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

5166
02:20:22.110 --> 02:20:24.950
<v Speaker 7>there's been a good amount of study done on five HTP.</v>

5167
02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:30.040
<v Speaker 7>Dr Pollinger had a study in 1991 where he compared five HTP to fluvoxamine,</v>

5168
02:20:30.261 --> 02:20:31.940
<v Speaker 7>which is a Ssri.</v>

5169
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:37.100
<v Speaker 7>And the study showed that the SSRI stands for selective Serotonin reuptake</v>

5170
02:20:37.101 --> 02:20:39.650
<v Speaker 7>inhibitor and that's like Zoloft and Prozac.</v>

5171
02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:40.813
<v Speaker 7>Paxil.</v>

5172
02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:41.420
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

5173
02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:42.140
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

5174
02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:45.350
<v Speaker 7>and basically it showed that the five HTP dosage,</v>

5175
02:20:45.351 --> 02:20:47.240
<v Speaker 7>which was a hundred milligrams a few times a day,</v>

5176
02:20:47.241 --> 02:20:50.810
<v Speaker 7>was equal to the fluvoxamine and of efficacy,</v>

5177
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:53.270
<v Speaker 7>but far out paced it as far as tolerance,</v>

5178
02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:58.310
<v Speaker 7>just because the body was able to go through its natural process and create more</v>

5179
02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:00.290
<v Speaker 7>of its serotonin and a,</v>

5180
02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:02.120
<v Speaker 7>the study turned out extremely positively.</v>

5181
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:05.240
<v Speaker 7>The problem is that there is no patent available on five HTP.</v>

5182
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:06.261
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

5183
02:21:06.261 --> 02:21:07.430
<v Speaker 7>everybody can go out and get it.</v>

5184
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:08.450
<v Speaker 7>They can buy our product,</v>

5185
02:21:08.451 --> 02:21:11.960
<v Speaker 7>they can buy anybody else's product and get those similar effects.</v>

5186
02:21:11.961 --> 02:21:12.400
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

5187
02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I found out about five HTP for my friend Neil Brennan and a Neil told me he's on</v>

5188
02:21:16.811 --> 02:21:16.941
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

5189
02:21:16.941 --> 02:21:17.561
<v Speaker 2>And he loves it.</v>

5190
02:21:17.561 --> 02:21:18.394
<v Speaker 2>It makes him feel good.</v>

5191
02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:20.380
<v Speaker 2>But Neal's also on an antidepressant.</v>

5192
02:21:20.530 --> 02:21:20.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5193
02:21:20.651 --> 02:21:25.570
<v Speaker 2>his doctor told him to get off the five HTP and stay on the antidepressant</v>

5194
02:21:25.571 --> 02:21:29.860
<v Speaker 2>because he said taking the five HTP is like taking a second antidepressant.</v>

5195
02:21:30.370 --> 02:21:31.121
<v Speaker 2>So I said to him,</v>

5196
02:21:31.121 --> 02:21:31.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5197
02:21:31.430 --> 02:21:32.263
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

5198
02:21:32.410 --> 02:21:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about just taking the five HTP?</v>

5199
02:21:34.751 --> 02:21:35.584
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>

5200
02:21:35.650 --> 02:21:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems like that might be the better move than to have to get a</v>

5201
02:21:38.201 --> 02:21:42.910
<v Speaker 2>prescription for some shit and like you'd get five HTP to fucking GNC store in</v>

5202
02:21:42.911 --> 02:21:43.661
<v Speaker 2>the middle of Omaha,</v>

5203
02:21:43.661 --> 02:21:44.231
<v Speaker 2>Nebraska,</v>

5204
02:21:44.231 --> 02:21:45.940
<v Speaker 2>just show up and get me and you can be on the road.</v>

5205
02:21:46.090 --> 02:21:49.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're saddled down to a fucking pharmacy and you need to have</v>

5206
02:21:49.151 --> 02:21:51.820
<v Speaker 2>your doctor call in a prescription during business hours.</v>

5207
02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5208
02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:52.920
<v Speaker 2>it's annoying.</v>

5209
02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:56.580
<v Speaker 7>Dr Pollinger study shows a lot of those ancillary benefits of,</v>

5210
02:21:56.690 --> 02:21:57.210
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5211
02:21:57.210 --> 02:22:02.090
<v Speaker 7>not taking a prescription drug versus taking the natural drug and you can look</v>

5212
02:22:02.110 --> 02:22:02.250
<v Speaker 7>up,</v>

5213
02:22:02.250 --> 02:22:03.950
<v Speaker 2>does it have the same effect for everybody?</v>

5214
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Five HTP for everybody boosts Serotonin?</v>

5215
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:07.580
<v Speaker 7>It does,</v>

5216
02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:07.881
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

5217
02:22:07.881 --> 02:22:08.720
<v Speaker 7>It definitely boosts search.</v>

5218
02:22:08.730 --> 02:22:09.410
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

5219
02:22:09.410 --> 02:22:10.970
<v Speaker 7>how can you say something for everybody?</v>

5220
02:22:10.971 --> 02:22:13.220
<v Speaker 7>But in the people studied in the many studies that they've done,</v>

5221
02:22:13.221 --> 02:22:14.540
<v Speaker 7>five HTP has shown,</v>

5222
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.991
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5223
02:22:14.991 --> 02:22:16.430
<v Speaker 7>a dramatic improvement in those,</v>

5224
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:18.200
<v Speaker 7>in those serotonin dependent,</v>

5225
02:22:18.390 --> 02:22:18.860
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

5226
02:22:18.860 --> 02:22:19.580
<v Speaker 7>issues being,</v>

5227
02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:21.230
<v Speaker 2>and the new mood is mixed with fo,</v>

5228
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5229
02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:22.970
<v Speaker 2>El Tryptofan as well.</v>

5230
02:22:22.990 --> 02:22:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5231
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:23.720
<v Speaker 2>ultra map.</v>

5232
02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:26.220
<v Speaker 2>So the chain reaction goes l Tryptophan</v>

5233
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:30.180
<v Speaker 7>converts to five HTP and then five HTP converts to five HTP,</v>

5234
02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:31.200
<v Speaker 7>five ht,</v>

5235
02:22:31.350 --> 02:22:32.610
<v Speaker 7>which is actually serotonin.</v>

5236
02:22:32.730 --> 02:22:34.080
<v Speaker 7>If you ingested pure five,</v>

5237
02:22:34.081 --> 02:22:36.570
<v Speaker 7>ht the body would destroy it and it wouldn't get anywhere.</v>

5238
02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:38.250
<v Speaker 7>But following it through the chain,</v>

5239
02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:39.600
<v Speaker 7>the body's able to do that.</v>

5240
02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:42.150
<v Speaker 7>Especially with the help of vitamin B six pyridoxine,</v>

5241
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:42.700
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5242
02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:46.560
<v Speaker 7>it's able to kind of complete that chain reaction of El Tryptophan to becoming</v>

5243
02:22:46.561 --> 02:22:47.580
<v Speaker 7>five HTP,</v>

5244
02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:48.870
<v Speaker 7>two becoming serotonin.</v>

5245
02:22:48.871 --> 02:22:53.871
<v Speaker 7>So new mood is pretty unique in that it has both El Tryptophan and five HTP as</v>

5246
02:22:54.301 --> 02:22:56.010
<v Speaker 7>well as the catalyst vitamin B six.</v>

5247
02:22:56.011 --> 02:22:56.520
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

5248
02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:57.353
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

5249
02:22:57.660 --> 02:22:59.190
<v Speaker 7>I'd love to study this in the future.</v>

5250
02:22:59.310 --> 02:23:02.090
<v Speaker 7>The theory behind it being that we're creating both in,</v>

5251
02:23:02.130 --> 02:23:02.430
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5252
02:23:02.430 --> 02:23:07.410
<v Speaker 7>more immediate transition between the five HTP to five ht and then a longer term</v>

5253
02:23:07.411 --> 02:23:11.910
<v Speaker 7>transition between the l Tryptophan to the five HTP to the five ht.</v>

5254
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:15.150
<v Speaker 7>So kind of providing a further spectrum along the chain.</v>

5255
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:18.180
<v Speaker 7>And then we also combine it with a bunch of [inaudible] herbs,</v>

5256
02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:20.550
<v Speaker 7>herbs to kind of relax you and um,</v>

5257
02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:21.241
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5258
02:23:21.241 --> 02:23:22.950
<v Speaker 7>help you help with insomnia.</v>

5259
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:23.821
<v Speaker 7>One of our herbs,</v>

5260
02:23:23.821 --> 02:23:25.860
<v Speaker 7>Valerian actually has a similar study,</v>

5261
02:23:25.861 --> 02:23:30.861
<v Speaker 7>that study done by Dr Pollinger as comparing it to an over the counter and not</v>

5262
02:23:31.231 --> 02:23:33.460
<v Speaker 7>an over a prescription drug called [inaudible],</v>

5263
02:23:33.810 --> 02:23:36.360
<v Speaker 7>which is in the same category of a Benzo.</v>

5264
02:23:36.361 --> 02:23:36.881
<v Speaker 7>It's a Benzo,</v>

5265
02:23:36.881 --> 02:23:38.460
<v Speaker 7>it's same category as Xanax.</v>

5266
02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:39.480
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5267
02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:44.280
<v Speaker 7>and it compared Valerian to Oxa possum with the similar results to the five HTP</v>

5268
02:23:44.281 --> 02:23:44.581
<v Speaker 7>study.</v>

5269
02:23:44.581 --> 02:23:46.670
<v Speaker 7>Being that Valerian had the same anxiety,</v>

5270
02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:49.260
<v Speaker 7>alytic insomnia reducing effects,</v>

5271
02:23:49.470 --> 02:23:51.600
<v Speaker 7>but without the negative side effects of that.</v>

5272
02:23:51.601 --> 02:23:55.410
<v Speaker 7>So that's another powerful herb and the combination and a few others as well,</v>

5273
02:23:55.530 --> 02:24:00.360
<v Speaker 7>just to kind of ease your body into a state of relaxation and positive</v>

5274
02:24:00.570 --> 02:24:03.270
<v Speaker 7>neurotransmitter boosting fundamentals.</v>

5275
02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:06.340
<v Speaker 2>A homeboy had another question and this was a,</v>

5276
02:24:06.370 --> 02:24:07.111
<v Speaker 2>the same dude,</v>

5277
02:24:07.111 --> 02:24:08.190
<v Speaker 2>this James Omega,</v>

5278
02:24:08.191 --> 02:24:10.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he had a really good point about,</v>

5279
02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:12.200
<v Speaker 2>he's saying that your claim was that,</v>

5280
02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:12.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5281
02:24:12.780 --> 02:24:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Alpha brain enhances memory focus,</v>

5282
02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:16.440
<v Speaker 2>mental speed and mental drive.</v>

5283
02:24:16.530 --> 02:24:17.363
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5284
02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:18.900
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

5285
02:24:18.901 --> 02:24:19.734
<v Speaker 2>can we meant,</v>

5286
02:24:20.010 --> 02:24:22.170
<v Speaker 2>can we rename mental drive to motivation?</v>

5287
02:24:22.410 --> 02:24:22.831
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

5288
02:24:22.831 --> 02:24:22.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5289
02:24:22.950 --> 02:24:23.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5290
02:24:23.250 --> 02:24:24.120
<v Speaker 2>mental drive was like,</v>

5291
02:24:24.121 --> 02:24:24.391
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

5292
02:24:24.391 --> 02:24:25.410
<v Speaker 2>how subjective is that?</v>

5293
02:24:25.411 --> 02:24:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Like who can say what's,</v>

5294
02:24:27.390 --> 02:24:27.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5295
02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:28.471
<v Speaker 2>how you're driven.</v>

5296
02:24:28.471 --> 02:24:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5297
02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:30.150
<v Speaker 2>even if it gives you like clarity,</v>

5298
02:24:30.151 --> 02:24:31.890
<v Speaker 2>does it actually drive you sort?</v>

5299
02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5300
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.820
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5301
02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

5302
02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:34.313
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5303
02:24:34.770 --> 02:24:35.580
<v Speaker 2>so he's saying,</v>

5304
02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:40.470
<v Speaker 2>would you say that those four are all of what Alpha brain is supposed to do is,</v>

5305
02:24:40.471 --> 02:24:44.970
<v Speaker 2>are other effects of which you want your product to claim than that?</v>

5306
02:24:44.971 --> 02:24:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5307
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Then I'd like to hear them as well.</v>

5308
02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Right now he's Kinda being nit picky.</v>

5309
02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:48.650
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

5310
02:24:48.650 --> 02:24:49.040
<v Speaker 7>dream,</v>

5311
02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:51.080
<v Speaker 7>the dream effect is something that a lot of our,</v>

5312
02:24:51.250 --> 02:24:51.910
<v Speaker 7>our,</v>

5313
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:52.340
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5314
02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:53.720
<v Speaker 7>the takers really enjoy.</v>

5315
02:24:53.721 --> 02:24:54.920
<v Speaker 7>And that's caused by,</v>

5316
02:24:54.921 --> 02:24:55.101
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5317
02:24:55.101 --> 02:24:56.480
<v Speaker 7>I think I mentioned this in the last time,</v>

5318
02:24:56.481 --> 02:25:00.380
<v Speaker 7>but that's caused by acetylcholine being the regulator of the rem state.</v>

5319
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:02.690
<v Speaker 7>So with more Acetylcholine,</v>

5320
02:25:02.691 --> 02:25:06.290
<v Speaker 7>you have a deeper and broader rem state and rem being the dream state,</v>

5321
02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:11.000
<v Speaker 7>you're able to access longer periods of that dreaming unconsciousness for,</v>

5322
02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:11.390
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5323
02:25:11.390 --> 02:25:12.140
<v Speaker 7>so to speak,</v>

5324
02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:16.040
<v Speaker 7>and also have more of a chance of turning those dreams lucid because of the</v>

5325
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:18.410
<v Speaker 7>breadth of the dream state that you're in.</v>

5326
02:25:18.411 --> 02:25:22.370
<v Speaker 7>And also waking up during one of those states in which you will remember your</v>

5327
02:25:22.371 --> 02:25:25.150
<v Speaker 7>dreams a lot better than if you wake up during one of the really deep,</v>

5328
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:25.961
<v Speaker 7>Slow Wave,</v>

5329
02:25:25.961 --> 02:25:27.010
<v Speaker 7>non dreaming sleeps.</v>

5330
02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:31.060
<v Speaker 7>This is theoretical or is it a sextant improving you can as far as waking up</v>

5331
02:25:31.061 --> 02:25:32.200
<v Speaker 7>during rem sleep drink,</v>

5332
02:25:32.250 --> 02:25:34.220
<v Speaker 7>they proven the dreams happen during rem state.</v>

5333
02:25:34.350 --> 02:25:34.500
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

5334
02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:35.333
<v Speaker 7>And that's what I mean.</v>

5335
02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:38.890
<v Speaker 7>And they've proven that when you wake up during rem sleep,</v>

5336
02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:42.340
<v Speaker 7>you're more likely to remember your dreams and when you wake up during slow</v>

5337
02:25:42.341 --> 02:25:42.641
<v Speaker 7>wave.</v>

5338
02:25:42.641 --> 02:25:45.730
<v Speaker 7>And how does the Acetylcholine play into that though?</v>

5339
02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:46.870
<v Speaker 7>Was it an improvement?</v>

5340
02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:50.920
<v Speaker 7>Has drink that's kind of your cycles are regulated by,</v>

5341
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:51.791
<v Speaker 7>by the brain.</v>

5342
02:25:51.791 --> 02:25:53.320
<v Speaker 7>Unconsciously as it goes through.</v>

5343
02:25:53.321 --> 02:25:57.850
<v Speaker 7>And acetylcholine is they found one of the triggers for actually triggering the</v>

5344
02:25:57.851 --> 02:25:57.990
<v Speaker 7>Di,</v>

5345
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.210
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5346
02:25:58.210 --> 02:26:01.360
<v Speaker 7>slow wave versus a rem verses,</v>

5347
02:26:01.390 --> 02:26:01.571
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5348
02:26:01.571 --> 02:26:02.650
<v Speaker 7>interphase one or two,</v>

5349
02:26:02.660 --> 02:26:03.190
<v Speaker 7>whatever,</v>

5350
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:04.023
<v Speaker 7>whatever that is.</v>

5351
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:08.080
<v Speaker 7>Acetylcholine is the trigger that actually triggers the length of rem sleep that</v>

5352
02:26:08.081 --> 02:26:08.800
<v Speaker 7>you have.</v>

5353
02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:10.780
<v Speaker 7>So if you have more acetylcholine available,</v>

5354
02:26:10.781 --> 02:26:13.690
<v Speaker 7>it's going to trigger a longer and deeper rem sleep.</v>

5355
02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:16.390
<v Speaker 7>Should you take Alpha brain at night to enhance your sleep.</v>

5356
02:26:16.391 --> 02:26:18.130
<v Speaker 7>Does that make sense or is it bullshit?</v>

5357
02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:20.380
<v Speaker 7>It was a lot of people say it makes them buzzy.</v>

5358
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:21.101
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5359
02:26:21.101 --> 02:26:22.120
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't take it at night.</v>

5360
02:26:22.121 --> 02:26:23.410
<v Speaker 7>I don't think you need to take it at night.</v>

5361
02:26:23.411 --> 02:26:24.730
<v Speaker 7>I think if you take it during the day,</v>

5362
02:26:24.731 --> 02:26:28.270
<v Speaker 7>your levels are still going to be enhanced for for quite a while.</v>

5363
02:26:28.271 --> 02:26:30.430
<v Speaker 7>So I don't like to take it at night.</v>

5364
02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:32.800
<v Speaker 7>The latest I'll take it would be around three,</v>

5365
02:26:32.801 --> 02:26:36.580
<v Speaker 7>four o'clock because there is a kind of a stimulatory effect from the</v>

5366
02:26:36.581 --> 02:26:37.750
<v Speaker 7>Acetylcholine as well.</v>

5367
02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:39.700
<v Speaker 7>And Rm is not the deepest,</v>

5368
02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:40.150
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5369
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.990
<v Speaker 7>part of your sleep.</v>

5370
02:26:40.991 --> 02:26:42.400
<v Speaker 7>It's actually one of the lighter parts.</v>

5371
02:26:42.401 --> 02:26:43.000
<v Speaker 7>It's not.</v>

5372
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.260
<v Speaker 7>So it will,</v>

5373
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:44.710
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5374
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:46.360
<v Speaker 7>I do like to take it a little bit earlier.</v>

5375
02:26:46.361 --> 02:26:49.720
<v Speaker 7>I still get that dream kind of the wild dream boost where um,</v>

5376
02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:50.231
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5377
02:26:50.231 --> 02:26:53.590
<v Speaker 7>like the other night where I was pulling a hammerhead shark out of a swimming</v>

5378
02:26:53.591 --> 02:26:57.040
<v Speaker 7>pool and doing a variety of different crazy things.</v>

5379
02:26:57.270 --> 02:26:57.610
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5380
02:26:57.610 --> 02:26:58.480
<v Speaker 7>I still get that boost,</v>

5381
02:26:58.481 --> 02:27:01.300
<v Speaker 7>taking it early in the day and I think a lot of people will as well.</v>

5382
02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:02.380
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>

5383
02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:04.210
<v Speaker 7>I would recommend that more than anything.</v>

5384
02:27:04.211 --> 02:27:06.310
<v Speaker 7>And then taking something like the new mood,</v>

5385
02:27:06.430 --> 02:27:09.250
<v Speaker 7>you would take that at night to kind of relax you and still make sure you're</v>

5386
02:27:09.251 --> 02:27:11.800
<v Speaker 7>getting the most out of the restorative parts of your sleep as well.</v>

5387
02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:12.311
<v Speaker 7>To me,</v>

5388
02:27:12.311 --> 02:27:15.520
<v Speaker 7>it seems like one of my dreams aren't so cool when I'm tired,</v>

5389
02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:16.780
<v Speaker 7>when I'm really beat down.</v>

5390
02:27:16.781 --> 02:27:17.860
<v Speaker 7>I've been doing a lot of traveling.</v>

5391
02:27:17.861 --> 02:27:18.250
<v Speaker 7>They don't,</v>

5392
02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:19.750
<v Speaker 7>they don't hit me with this big,</v>

5393
02:27:20.050 --> 02:27:20.441
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5394
02:27:20.441 --> 02:27:22.690
<v Speaker 7>really a bizarre,</v>

5395
02:27:22.691 --> 02:27:24.520
<v Speaker 7>realistic style dreams.</v>

5396
02:27:24.730 --> 02:27:27.730
<v Speaker 7>But what I'm really well rested and I'm taking the Alpha and that's what I</v>

5397
02:27:27.731 --> 02:27:28.041
<v Speaker 7>noticed.</v>

5398
02:27:28.041 --> 02:27:29.290
<v Speaker 7>A really freaky fucking dreams.</v>

5399
02:27:29.291 --> 02:27:29.740
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5400
02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:30.381
<v Speaker 7>that's what I like.</v>

5401
02:27:30.381 --> 02:27:30.850
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

5402
02:27:30.850 --> 02:27:31.271
<v Speaker 7>they're like,</v>

5403
02:27:31.271 --> 02:27:33.190
<v Speaker 7>so there are so durable.</v>

5404
02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:34.510
<v Speaker 7>Like in the middle of the dream,</v>

5405
02:27:34.511 --> 02:27:37.090
<v Speaker 7>you wake up knowing that you're in the dream and somehow they're staying in the</v>

5406
02:27:37.091 --> 02:27:37.924
<v Speaker 7>dream.</v>

5407
02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:41.050
<v Speaker 7>Find that more when I'm well rested,</v>

5408
02:27:41.470 --> 02:27:42.303
<v Speaker 7>when I'm healthy,</v>

5409
02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:43.930
<v Speaker 7>I guess then you know,</v>

5410
02:27:43.931 --> 02:27:44.231
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

5411
02:27:44.231 --> 02:27:47.710
<v Speaker 7>you're calm or I guess I don't know what it do when you're drawing to that as</v>

5412
02:27:47.711 --> 02:27:48.910
<v Speaker 7>needy when you're sleeping,</v>

5413
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:53.050
<v Speaker 7>your body might be pushing you into more deeper restorative kind of physically</v>

5414
02:27:53.051 --> 02:27:54.160
<v Speaker 7>restorative sleep.</v>

5415
02:27:54.430 --> 02:27:56.410
<v Speaker 7>When you're in that kind of run down state,</v>

5416
02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:57.790
<v Speaker 7>in which case you aren't having,</v>

5417
02:27:57.791 --> 02:27:59.080
<v Speaker 7>even with the Alpha brain present,</v>

5418
02:27:59.081 --> 02:28:03.310
<v Speaker 7>you aren't having that kind of length of rem and breadth of rem sleep.</v>

5419
02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:05.710
<v Speaker 7>So it was one of the things this guy is saying is,</v>

5420
02:28:05.711 --> 02:28:06.130
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5421
02:28:06.130 --> 02:28:06.940
<v Speaker 7>sometimes,</v>

5422
02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:07.120
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5423
02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:10.660
<v Speaker 7>justice a something I do know via my own studies in neuroscience,</v>

5424
02:28:10.661 --> 02:28:14.050
<v Speaker 7>the vast majority of people to not have a particular deficiency in</v>

5425
02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:14.920
<v Speaker 7>Acetylcholine,</v>

5426
02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:17.590
<v Speaker 7>dopamine or Gaba.</v>

5427
02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:19.001
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

5428
02:28:19.001 --> 02:28:19.361
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

5429
02:28:19.361 --> 02:28:19.541
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5430
02:28:19.541 --> 02:28:21.140
<v Speaker 7>there's certainly different theories on that.</v>

5431
02:28:21.141 --> 02:28:21.411
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

5432
02:28:21.411 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

5433
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:22.490
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5434
02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:24.890
<v Speaker 7>in the optimal state of being with perfect diet,</v>

5435
02:28:24.891 --> 02:28:25.670
<v Speaker 7>perfect sleep,</v>

5436
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:26.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5437
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:26.330
<v Speaker 7>good,</v>

5438
02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:26.901
<v Speaker 7>good health,</v>

5439
02:28:26.901 --> 02:28:28.610
<v Speaker 7>good workouts and all of that.</v>

5440
02:28:28.611 --> 02:28:30.230
<v Speaker 7>Probably your optimally functioning.</v>

5441
02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:30.770
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5442
02:28:30.770 --> 02:28:32.180
<v Speaker 7>does that mean that you know,</v>

5443
02:28:32.181 --> 02:28:36.050
<v Speaker 7>going above optimal functioning is okay from time to time and actually has some</v>

5444
02:28:36.051 --> 02:28:36.980
<v Speaker 7>benefit and value?</v>

5445
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.941
<v Speaker 7>I believe it does.</v>

5446
02:28:37.941 --> 02:28:38.774
<v Speaker 7>I believe you can,</v>

5447
02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:41.570
<v Speaker 7>even if you are naturally healthy at a baseline,</v>

5448
02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:41.931
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5449
02:28:41.931 --> 02:28:43.760
<v Speaker 7>we're not kind of trying to cover deficiency,</v>

5450
02:28:43.761 --> 02:28:45.110
<v Speaker 7>we're not trying to cure disease,</v>

5451
02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:48.770
<v Speaker 7>we're trying to give people a feeling of boost that can help them,</v>

5452
02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:49.281
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5453
02:28:49.281 --> 02:28:51.290
<v Speaker 7>function in maneuver and accomplish their goals,</v>

5454
02:28:51.291 --> 02:28:52.910
<v Speaker 7>whatever very they may be.</v>

5455
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:53.600
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

5456
02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:54.051
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5457
02:28:54.051 --> 02:28:55.550
<v Speaker 7>I think that a,</v>

5458
02:28:55.551 --> 02:28:56.500
<v Speaker 7>I do think that norm,</v>

5459
02:28:56.590 --> 02:29:00.800
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people are a little bit run down and I know I rely on Dr Braverman of</v>

5460
02:29:00.801 --> 02:29:03.010
<v Speaker 7>the brain Princeton brain bio.</v>

5461
02:29:03.090 --> 02:29:07.310
<v Speaker 7>He did a lot of work there and he's doing a lot of active work now as the basis</v>

5462
02:29:07.311 --> 02:29:08.510
<v Speaker 7>for kind of my thinking on this.</v>

5463
02:29:08.511 --> 02:29:11.840
<v Speaker 7>But he did a bunch of tests on me and I'm a fairly healthy dude.</v>

5464
02:29:11.841 --> 02:29:14.270
<v Speaker 7>I eat well and I do my best to stay in shape.</v>

5465
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:18.170
<v Speaker 7>But all of my levels of neurotransmitters were actually depressed below.</v>

5466
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:19.011
<v Speaker 7>And before,</v>

5467
02:29:19.011 --> 02:29:19.940
<v Speaker 7>before I went to see him,</v>

5468
02:29:19.941 --> 02:29:20.810
<v Speaker 7>I had been doing a little,</v>

5469
02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:21.260
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5470
02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:22.850
<v Speaker 7>doing a little party and he was in New York.</v>

5471
02:29:22.851 --> 02:29:25.160
<v Speaker 7>So I saw some buddies in New York went out to the bars.</v>

5472
02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:26.001
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

5473
02:29:26.001 --> 02:29:29.840
<v Speaker 7>it made sense to me that my neurotransmitters were functioning at a lower level</v>

5474
02:29:29.841 --> 02:29:30.350
<v Speaker 7>at that point.</v>

5475
02:29:30.350 --> 02:29:31.071
<v Speaker 7>Cause I could feel it.</v>

5476
02:29:31.071 --> 02:29:31.970
<v Speaker 7>I was kind of cloudy,</v>

5477
02:29:31.971 --> 02:29:32.804
<v Speaker 7>kind of groggy.</v>

5478
02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:35.720
<v Speaker 7>And he pointed to that in all of the myriad tests he did.</v>

5479
02:29:35.721 --> 02:29:37.490
<v Speaker 7>We did tests over five days,</v>

5480
02:29:37.491 --> 02:29:40.280
<v Speaker 7>blood tests in different cognitive tests and different things.</v>

5481
02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:41.320
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

5482
02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:41.590
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

5483
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:42.171
<v Speaker 7>and found that,</v>

5484
02:29:42.171 --> 02:29:44.060
<v Speaker 7>and I think a lot of people operate on that.</v>

5485
02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:44.480
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

5486
02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:47.150
<v Speaker 7>just by the lifestyles that they live,</v>

5487
02:29:47.151 --> 02:29:50.810
<v Speaker 7>the operating this state where they're under a lot of stress and they're under a</v>

5488
02:29:50.811 --> 02:29:51.644
<v Speaker 7>lot of,</v>

5489
02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:52.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5490
02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:53.053
<v Speaker 7>different,</v>

5491
02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:53.660
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5492
02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:54.110
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5493
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:57.800
<v Speaker 7>different things like caffeine and alcohol and these things that are causing</v>

5494
02:29:58.010 --> 02:29:59.360
<v Speaker 7>adrenaline and different,</v>

5495
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:03.470
<v Speaker 7>different functionality to happen so that there are more people who have at</v>

5496
02:30:03.471 --> 02:30:06.620
<v Speaker 7>least temporary deficiencies in a lot of these neurotransmitters.</v>

5497
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:08.180
<v Speaker 7>And then for the people who don't,</v>

5498
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:09.080
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5499
02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:11.900
<v Speaker 7>getting this extra boost might just be a little bit over the top.</v>

5500
02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:12.141
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5501
02:30:12.141 --> 02:30:13.290
<v Speaker 2>how many people actually get them,</v>

5502
02:30:13.470 --> 02:30:15.380
<v Speaker 2>get it actually tested.</v>

5503
02:30:15.410 --> 02:30:19.100
<v Speaker 2>That's why I get uncomfortable when someone says that the majority of people</v>

5504
02:30:19.101 --> 02:30:21.230
<v Speaker 2>don't have particularly deficiency and Acetylcholine,</v>

5505
02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:23.930
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people aren't tested for Acetylcholine deficiency.</v>

5506
02:30:23.931 --> 02:30:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Not and a lot of people,</v>

5507
02:30:25.041 --> 02:30:25.760
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people who,</v>

5508
02:30:25.760 --> 02:30:26.790
<v Speaker 2>if you could talk to them or anything,</v>

5509
02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:29.610
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people aren't tested for fucking vitamin B.</v>

5510
02:30:29.610 --> 02:30:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5511
02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Tony Know How many people get blood work to check their vitamin levels.</v>

5512
02:30:32.451 --> 02:30:33.030
<v Speaker 2>How many people are,</v>

5513
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5514
02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:34.940
<v Speaker 2>very few actually with violence.</v>

5515
02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the only way to tell it?</v>

5516
02:30:36.591 --> 02:30:36.981
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

5517
02:30:36.981 --> 02:30:37.590
<v Speaker 2>is it actually</v>

5518
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:38.131
<v Speaker 7>vitamin D?</v>

5519
02:30:38.131 --> 02:30:41.550
<v Speaker 7>They're finding massive deficiencies when they're actually doing large scale</v>

5520
02:30:41.551 --> 02:30:42.384
<v Speaker 7>testing on that.</v>

5521
02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:42.940
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

5522
02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:45.070
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to tell someone saying that.</v>

5523
02:30:45.071 --> 02:30:45.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>

5524
02:30:45.550 --> 02:30:46.600
<v Speaker 2>that's a bullshit thing to say.</v>

5525
02:30:46.660 --> 02:30:47.493
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5526
02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:48.403
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

5527
02:30:48.580 --> 02:30:50.780
<v Speaker 7>But there are certainly a lot of healthy people and,</v>

5528
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:51.440
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

5529
02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:52.070
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>

5530
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:53.360
<v Speaker 7>they may have adequate levels,</v>

5531
02:30:53.361 --> 02:30:57.380
<v Speaker 7>but it's still doesn't invalidate the point of having an out for brain.</v>

5532
02:30:57.381 --> 02:31:00.230
<v Speaker 7>I do still do think that you can feel even better.</v>

5533
02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:00.771
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

5534
02:31:00.771 --> 02:31:03.830
<v Speaker 7>These are nutrients that are going to drive you in a certain direction.</v>

5535
02:31:03.831 --> 02:31:04.520
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

5536
02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:04.701
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5537
02:31:04.701 --> 02:31:06.230
<v Speaker 7>there's kind of both sides of the coin there,</v>

5538
02:31:06.231 --> 02:31:06.710
<v Speaker 7>I guess,</v>

5539
02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:07.670
<v Speaker 7>depending on how you look at it.</v>

5540
02:31:07.930 --> 02:31:10.930
<v Speaker 2>And here's the subtle yet conti last questions that he has.</v>

5541
02:31:10.931 --> 02:31:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious as to why it took so long to answer this question given that you</v>

5542
02:31:14.231 --> 02:31:15.370
<v Speaker 2>answered questions before.</v>

5543
02:31:15.371 --> 02:31:19.470
<v Speaker 2>And I asked this one quite like this before I ask this one on questions after</v>

5544
02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:21.600
<v Speaker 2>when it should be the easiest question for you to answer.</v>

5545
02:31:22.170 --> 02:31:23.730
<v Speaker 2>That's a Kentucky question,</v>

5546
02:31:23.731 --> 02:31:24.240
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

5547
02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:27.300
<v Speaker 2>That belays that exposes your,</v>

5548
02:31:27.330 --> 02:31:28.440
<v Speaker 2>your country nature.</v>

5549
02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:32.220
<v Speaker 2>That is a [inaudible] and his fucking photo of who is that</v>

5550
02:31:32.290 --> 02:31:32.471
<v Speaker 4>guy?</v>

5551
02:31:32.471 --> 02:31:33.304
<v Speaker 4>What's that guy's name?</v>

5552
02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:33.990
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

5553
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.823
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5554
02:31:34.910 --> 02:31:36.400
<v Speaker 4>the author?</v>

5555
02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:36.920
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5556
02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:37.930
<v Speaker 4>looks like Ben Stiller.</v>

5557
02:31:38.110 --> 02:31:39.730
<v Speaker 4>Sam a something or other,</v>

5558
02:31:39.731 --> 02:31:40.564
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5559
02:31:41.010 --> 02:31:42.550
<v Speaker 4>letters to a Christian nation.</v>

5560
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:43.720
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck's the guy's name,</v>

5561
02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:49.570
<v Speaker 4>but he's got an intellectual,</v>

5562
02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:50.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5563
02:31:50.231 --> 02:31:51.070
<v Speaker 4>I certainly,</v>

5564
02:31:51.071 --> 02:31:52.840
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate all the challenges that,</v>

5565
02:31:52.890 --> 02:31:53.651
<v Speaker 4>that people have.</v>

5566
02:31:53.651 --> 02:31:54.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

5567
02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:54.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5568
02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:56.140
<v Speaker 4>it's good to think about all these things.</v>

5569
02:31:56.141 --> 02:31:56.501
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

5570
02:31:56.501 --> 02:31:57.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5571
02:31:57.200 --> 02:31:57.480
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>

5572
02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:59.580
<v Speaker 4>as much criticism is as a,</v>

5573
02:31:59.590 --> 02:32:01.330
<v Speaker 4>I get personally on it gets,</v>

5574
02:32:01.331 --> 02:32:03.670
<v Speaker 4>I think ultimately if you take kind of,</v>

5575
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:04.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5576
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:05.800
<v Speaker 4>what you may call the crunchiness out of it,</v>

5577
02:32:05.801 --> 02:32:06.430
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

5578
02:32:06.430 --> 02:32:10.800
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of like real reflection on yourself that you can take a gaze at.</v>

5579
02:32:10.801 --> 02:32:11.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like fighters who,</v>

5580
02:32:11.980 --> 02:32:12.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5581
02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:14.850
<v Speaker 4>either you either train with people who all love you and care about you.</v>

5582
02:32:14.851 --> 02:32:18.370
<v Speaker 4>You go with savages that want to kill you and take your head off.</v>

5583
02:32:18.371 --> 02:32:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5584
02:32:18.820 --> 02:32:20.350
<v Speaker 4>you'll learn more from the savages,</v>

5585
02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:20.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5586
02:32:20.691 --> 02:32:21.820
<v Speaker 4>and you'll learn how to,</v>

5587
02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:23.530
<v Speaker 4>you learn different things about yourself,</v>

5588
02:32:23.531 --> 02:32:24.910
<v Speaker 4>holes in your game and weaknesses.</v>

5589
02:32:24.911 --> 02:32:25.420
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5590
02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:25.691
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5591
02:32:25.691 --> 02:32:25.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5592
02:32:25.901 --> 02:32:27.490
<v Speaker 4>I think actually you even talking to you,</v>

5593
02:32:27.491 --> 02:32:29.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not an easy thing to learn,</v>

5594
02:32:29.231 --> 02:32:33.610
<v Speaker 4>but learning to just take the meat of the criticisms and try and not take the,</v>

5595
02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:33.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5596
02:32:33.970 --> 02:32:34.990
<v Speaker 4>the barbs of it.</v>

5597
02:32:35.050 --> 02:32:36.310
<v Speaker 4>So it's hard,</v>

5598
02:32:36.311 --> 02:32:36.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5599
02:32:36.521 --> 02:32:39.280
<v Speaker 4>I know you kind of created a lot of what the website is,</v>

5600
02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:40.071
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

5601
02:32:40.071 --> 02:32:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I go to the website and there's certain stuff.</v>

5602
02:32:41.751 --> 02:32:42.081
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

5603
02:32:42.081 --> 02:32:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't go,</v>

5604
02:32:42.470 --> 02:32:44.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a little fucking marketing,</v>

5605
02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:44.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5606
02:32:44.531 --> 02:32:44.930
<v Speaker 2>it was a little,</v>

5607
02:32:44.930 --> 02:32:45.750
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

5608
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5609
02:32:46.010 --> 02:32:46.361
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

5610
02:32:46.361 --> 02:32:46.550
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

5611
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:47.271
<v Speaker 2>we'll go over it.</v>

5612
02:32:47.271 --> 02:32:51.050
<v Speaker 2>We'll go over it because I don't personally think it needs to be that way.</v>

5613
02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:52.520
<v Speaker 2>I think the product stands on its own.</v>

5614
02:32:52.521 --> 02:32:54.800
<v Speaker 2>And I think the subject is very interesting.</v>

5615
02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:58.520
<v Speaker 2>And what I always tell people on the program as you just look into nootropics,</v>

5616
02:32:58.521 --> 02:32:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5617
02:32:58.940 --> 02:33:00.500
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the reasons why I wanted to have you,</v>

5618
02:33:00.501 --> 02:33:00.741
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5619
02:33:00.741 --> 02:33:03.810
<v Speaker 2>address some of the shit that that's been said and um,</v>

5620
02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:07.280
<v Speaker 2>and let people know there's no evidence whatsoever that any of this stuff was</v>

5621
02:33:07.281 --> 02:33:07.761
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>

5622
02:33:07.761 --> 02:33:08.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5623
02:33:08.290 --> 02:33:08.740
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

5624
02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:11.860
<v Speaker 4>What happened to roll on and roll off what's been kind of</v>

5625
02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:14.433
<v Speaker 4>mood is taking,</v>

5626
02:33:14.600 --> 02:33:17.740
<v Speaker 4>he's taking over the rollover and it'd become a mess.</v>

5627
02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:18.230
<v Speaker 4>Another,</v>

5628
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:20.050
<v Speaker 4>the partying aspect people don't have,</v>

5629
02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:21.970
<v Speaker 4>those are the origins of this,</v>

5630
02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:22.841
<v Speaker 4>of this,</v>

5631
02:33:22.841 --> 02:33:23.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5632
02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:24.153
<v Speaker 4>experiment.</v>

5633
02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:26.240
<v Speaker 4>People for whatever reason have a,</v>

5634
02:33:26.290 --> 02:33:26.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5635
02:33:26.850 --> 02:33:27.301
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

5636
02:33:27.301 --> 02:33:29.020
<v Speaker 4>you can't be a serious person.</v>

5637
02:33:29.050 --> 02:33:32.110
<v Speaker 4>So rollovers pretty much the shroom tech.</v>

5638
02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:32.620
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5639
02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:33.290
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

5640
02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:38.020
<v Speaker 4>And then what's role on now anything Rolando Kinda got divided into two aspects</v>

5641
02:33:38.021 --> 02:33:39.760
<v Speaker 4>that it was trying to do too many things at once.</v>

5642
02:33:39.761 --> 02:33:43.210
<v Speaker 4>So the shroom tech sport provides that kind of energy element and then the</v>

5643
02:33:43.211 --> 02:33:46.390
<v Speaker 4>shroom tech immune provides the health element that was missed.</v>

5644
02:33:46.391 --> 02:33:47.890
<v Speaker 4>That was the second component.</v>

5645
02:33:47.891 --> 02:33:49.930
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of been divided into two,</v>

5646
02:33:50.050 --> 02:33:50.883
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5647
02:33:50.980 --> 02:33:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Problem is,</v>

5648
02:33:52.151 --> 02:33:52.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5649
02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:55.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people automatically assume that people are full of shit.</v>

5650
02:33:56.110 --> 02:33:56.980
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5651
02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:00.790
<v Speaker 2>when you have any thing that they can criticize anything,</v>

5652
02:34:00.791 --> 02:34:01.200
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

5653
02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:03.850
<v Speaker 2>any weakness in the link that they can point to and go,</v>

5654
02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:04.061
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5655
02:34:04.061 --> 02:34:05.710
<v Speaker 2>he sells fucking Alpha nails.</v>

5656
02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5657
02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:07.021
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

5658
02:34:07.021 --> 02:34:07.854
<v Speaker 4>let me see your nails.</v>

5659
02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:09.450
<v Speaker 4>You doesn't have Alpha nails on.</v>

5660
02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:10.993
<v Speaker 4>Totally normal.</v>

5661
02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:11.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5662
02:34:11.401 --> 02:34:12.234
<v Speaker 4>come on man.</v>

5663
02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:14.940
<v Speaker 4>It's Alpha nails is like a Saturday night live sketch.</v>

5664
02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:16.411
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5665
02:34:16.411 --> 02:34:17.500
<v Speaker 4>you know how that developed.</v>

5666
02:34:17.501 --> 02:34:17.911
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

5667
02:34:17.911 --> 02:34:18.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5668
02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:18.611
<v Speaker 4>I was glad to,</v>

5669
02:34:18.611 --> 02:34:23.080
<v Speaker 4>fighters were a lot of fun and instill and I'm one of my best friends is Roger,</v>

5670
02:34:23.081 --> 02:34:26.470
<v Speaker 4>where today we are talking about it and all of these fighters still have to go</v>

5671
02:34:26.471 --> 02:34:31.471
<v Speaker 4>to that Sally Jensen Aisle in the supermarket and buy those dainty little nail</v>

5672
02:34:31.811 --> 02:34:32.644
<v Speaker 4>Polish</v>

5673
02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:34.900
<v Speaker 4>nail Polish.</v>

5674
02:34:34.990 --> 02:34:35.823
<v Speaker 4>They don't but,</v>

5675
02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:36.550
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

5676
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:37.390
<v Speaker 4>but they can do it.</v>

5677
02:34:37.391 --> 02:34:38.224
<v Speaker 4>So they do</v>

5678
02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:41.980
<v Speaker 4>well there are some benefits.</v>

5679
02:34:41.981 --> 02:34:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Some of the fighters say that,</v>

5680
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5681
02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:45.970
<v Speaker 4>they put it on their toes because if they'd been stomped in the toe and their</v>

5682
02:34:45.990 --> 02:34:46.930
<v Speaker 4>nails gonna fall off,</v>

5683
02:34:46.931 --> 02:34:48.640
<v Speaker 4>it'll hide that potential damage.</v>

5684
02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:50.460
<v Speaker 4>Some people just say it and you know,</v>

5685
02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:51.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

5686
02:34:51.430 --> 02:34:55.330
<v Speaker 4>There's a few practical reasons also that it prevents chipping and kind of your</v>

5687
02:34:55.331 --> 02:34:56.410
<v Speaker 4>nail from breaking,</v>

5688
02:34:56.411 --> 02:34:57.700
<v Speaker 4>coming apart and having a tiny,</v>

5689
02:34:57.970 --> 02:35:02.970
<v Speaker 4>well it's kind of like putting a coat of glue over the top of your frank Trigg</v>

5690
02:35:02.981 --> 02:35:06.550
<v Speaker 4>started using and they used to call them twinkle toes trig because he would</v>

5691
02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:09.040
<v Speaker 4>paint up his nails like to protect the,</v>

5692
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:11.710
<v Speaker 4>they can use clear coat,</v>

5693
02:35:11.711 --> 02:35:12.910
<v Speaker 4>but they don't use clear coat.</v>

5694
02:35:12.911 --> 02:35:16.420
<v Speaker 4>They use pink because why the fuck not because they're fighters in anybody who</v>

5695
02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:18.130
<v Speaker 4>says they're gay or not.</v>

5696
02:35:18.131 --> 02:35:18.730
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5697
02:35:18.730 --> 02:35:19.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5698
02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:19.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

5699
02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:19.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5700
02:35:19.961 --> 02:35:20.241
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5701
02:35:20.241 --> 02:35:23.290
<v Speaker 4>it's something that we kind of developed as a different alternative for that,</v>

5702
02:35:23.291 --> 02:35:24.041
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

5703
02:35:24.041 --> 02:35:24.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5704

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5712
02:35:29.890 --> 02:35:31.460
<v Speaker 4>criticizing Islam variety.</v>

5713
02:35:31.461 --> 02:35:33.460
<v Speaker 4>There's some beautiful dopiness right here.</v>

5714
02:35:33.461 --> 02:35:35.380
<v Speaker 4>This is discontinuous,</v>

5715
02:35:35.570 --> 02:35:36.820
<v Speaker 4>his guys talking about a</v>

5716

<v Speaker 2>Alpha brand.</v>

5717
02:35:37.441 --> 02:35:37.711
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5718
02:35:37.711 --> 02:35:39.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're under 35 and you take it,</v>

5719
02:35:39.361 --> 02:35:40.470
<v Speaker 2>you're effectively throwing,</v>

5720
02:35:40.471 --> 02:35:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you're perfectly balanced neurotransmitter levels out of balance.</v>

5721
02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

5722
02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's and capital the reason why some people say it makes them sick</v>

5723
02:35:48.571 --> 02:35:49.500
<v Speaker 2>or it doesn't work.</v>

5724
02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Ugh.</v>

5725
02:35:50.310 --> 02:35:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Just the sick typical business tactics that virtually everyone in the industry</v>

5726
02:35:55.141 --> 02:35:55.974
<v Speaker 2>uses.</v>

5727
02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you dumb fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You fucking shithead.</v>

5730
02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:04.350
<v Speaker 2>There's some people it can benefit stupid and if you don't like it,</v>

5731
02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:06.210
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to focus on it.</v>

5732
02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:07.440
<v Speaker 2>If it's not your thing,</v>

5733
02:36:07.441 --> 02:36:08.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to get into it.</v>

5734
02:36:08.341 --> 02:36:10.790
<v Speaker 2>But people are looking for something to point a finger on.</v>

5735
02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

5736
02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:13.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people out there that are looking to be empowered by</v>

5737
02:36:13.351 --> 02:36:14.520
<v Speaker 2>criticizing the,</v>

5738
02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:17.820
<v Speaker 2>it'd be be empowered by pointing a finger if you don't like it,</v>

5739
02:36:17.821 --> 02:36:19.080
<v Speaker 2>don't buy it stupid.</v>

5740
02:36:19.081 --> 02:36:20.790
<v Speaker 2>And if you're under 35 and you take it,</v>

5741
02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:22.230
<v Speaker 2>oh cause you've done extensive studies,</v>

5742
02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:24.180
<v Speaker 2>you know the exact time when people need it.</v>

5743
02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:24.751
<v Speaker 2>Shut up.</v>

02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:29.550
<v Speaker 4>well under 35 when I was studied and certainly not a,</v>

5749
02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:33.090
<v Speaker 4>not a large candidate for it and I was shown to be deficient in a variety of</v>

5750
02:36:33.091 --> 02:36:34.810
<v Speaker 4>these neurotransmitters and I was um,</v>

5751
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:35.850
<v Speaker 4>I promise I was,</v>

<v Speaker 4>able to honor that money back guarantee that it will be up to the stores if you</v>

5771
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Just like with food items on,</v>

02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:29.680
<v Speaker 10>We want to talk about nothing.</v>

5785
02:37:30.130 --> 02:37:30.963
<v Speaker 10>Okay guys,</v>

5786

5787
02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:33.910
<v Speaker 10>I got a message board filled with idiots.</v>

5788
02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:35.141
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

5789
02:37:35.141 --> 02:37:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I think barring other comedians jokes onstage.</v>

5790
02:37:37.870 --> 02:37:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but hear me out.</v>

5795
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:49.270

5796
02:37:49.271 --> 02:37:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Comedy is a performance art.</v>

5797
02:37:51.050 --> 02:37:52.120
<v Speaker 2>They does it in all caps.</v>

5798
02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Why is it when idiots want to make a point and they think it's profound.</v>

5799
02:37:55.781 --> 02:37:56.860
<v Speaker 2>They put it in all caps.</v>

5800
02:37:57.010 --> 02:37:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's a performance art.</v>

02:37:59.081 --> 02:38:01.270

5811
02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:17.511
<v Speaker 2>But what do you think bro?</v>

5812
02:38:17.511 --> 02:38:18.850

02:38:30.011 --> 02:38:32.350
<v Speaker 2>what if I'd fought for a chick to say,</v>

5823
02:38:32.351 --> 02:38:34.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah come come fuck raped the shit out of me son.</v>

5824
02:38:36.930 --> 02:38:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5825
02:38:37.570 --> 02:38:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I almost wonder like would it be cool to like have like your own Internet?</v>

5826
02:38:40.601 --> 02:38:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Like like it's a friends list of your Internet.</v>

5827
02:38:42.401 --> 02:38:43.480
<v Speaker 2>So like everything,</v>

5828
02:38:43.530 --> 02:38:45.280
<v Speaker 2>well that's sort of what it is on Twitter.</v>

5829
02:38:45.281 --> 02:38:46.510
<v Speaker 2>You know when you block somebody's,</v>

5830
02:38:46.511 --> 02:38:48.640
<v Speaker 2>you know you find shit has you block them.</v>

5831
02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:49.620
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of what it is.</v>

5832
02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:52.510
<v Speaker 2>The message board when Shit heads pop up you block them.</v>

5833
02:38:52.750 --> 02:38:54.820
<v Speaker 2>You know what bothers me man,</v>

5834
02:38:54.821 --> 02:38:58.630
<v Speaker 2>is just the numbers on the message board or are so great at this point,</v>

5835
02:38:58.780 --> 02:38:58.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5836
02:38:58.961 --> 02:39:01.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's gotten to such a crazy point where there's,</v>

5837
02:39:01.390 --> 02:39:03.670
<v Speaker 2>there's over 6 million posts on this fucking bored,</v>

5838
02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:04.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5839
02:39:04.390 --> 02:39:05.440
<v Speaker 2>or 5 million,</v>

5840
02:39:05.441 --> 02:39:07.990
<v Speaker 2>798,000 that's crazy.</v>

5841
02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:09.130
<v Speaker 2>So many people,</v>

5842
02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:11.110
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to keep track of it but it's so,</v>

5843
02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:11.973
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to,</v>

5844
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:15.040
<v Speaker 2>which you got to do is just weed out the cons when you find weeds and your</v>

5845
02:39:15.041 --> 02:39:15.551
<v Speaker 2>grass,</v>

5846
02:39:15.551 --> 02:39:16.870
<v Speaker 2>just pull them out and pluck them.</v>

5847
02:39:17.350 --> 02:39:20.800
<v Speaker 2>But there's so many of them and there's so many trolls are so many people that</v>

5848
02:39:20.801 --> 02:39:22.120
<v Speaker 2>are just doing it for reactions.</v>

5849
02:39:22.121 --> 02:39:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Even my friends like a non,</v>

5850
02:39:23.770 --> 02:39:24.370
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

5851
02:39:24.370 --> 02:39:26.730
<v Speaker 2>he trolls all the time and I just look at this,</v>

5852
02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:29.170
<v Speaker 2>the arguments that he presents and they're just so ridiculous.</v>

5853
02:39:29.171 --> 02:39:31.900
<v Speaker 2>But then he'll be a fucking 30 page argument,</v>

5854
02:39:31.930 --> 02:39:32.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5855
02:39:32.291 --> 02:39:35.470
<v Speaker 2>30 pages of people biting his troll and then he</v>

5856
02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:37.940
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

5857
02:39:37.940 --> 02:39:38.701
<v Speaker 2>It's a waste.</v>

5858
02:39:38.701 --> 02:39:39.880
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of,</v>

5859
02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:40.561
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>

5860
02:39:40.561 --> 02:39:41.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a massive waste.</v>

5861
02:39:42.010 --> 02:39:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should have an old truck,</v>

5862
02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:46.500
<v Speaker 2>no trolls zone where you're not allowed to troll like one,</v>

5863
02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:48.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's also an intelligence test.</v>

5864
02:39:48.041 --> 02:39:48.874
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

5865
02:39:48.970 --> 02:39:51.640
<v Speaker 2>cause some trolls are so fucking obvious when people were jumping on him and</v>

5866
02:39:51.641 --> 02:39:51.881
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

5867
02:39:51.881 --> 02:39:54.620
<v Speaker 2>God really like the one with the guy who just,</v>

5868
02:39:54.660 --> 02:39:56.470
<v Speaker 2>we talked about a comedian stealing.</v>

5869
02:39:56.620 --> 02:39:59.260
<v Speaker 2>He's either reason idiot or that's a successful troll.</v>

5870
02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:00.190
<v Speaker 2>You've got us to talk about it,</v>

5871
02:40:00.191 --> 02:40:00.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5872
02:40:00.730 --> 02:40:01.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5873
02:40:01.031 --> 02:40:03.250
<v Speaker 2>people love that for whatever fucking reason.</v>

5874
02:40:03.430 --> 02:40:08.430
<v Speaker 2>All these dingbats out there love just getting someone's reaction when you</v>

5875
02:40:08.681 --> 02:40:09.390
<v Speaker 2>respond to that,</v>

5876
02:40:09.390 --> 02:40:10.630
<v Speaker 2>it gives a win.</v>

5877
02:40:10.830 --> 02:40:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Like what a weird way to win.</v>

5878
02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Just a massively annoying con until someone calls you out on it and then you go</v>

5879
02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:18.200
<v Speaker 2>poned,</v>

5880
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:20.071
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

5881
02:40:20.071 --> 02:40:22.980
<v Speaker 2>A ridiculous game you're playing where it's impossible for you lose.</v>

5882
02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:26.640
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is just be really annoying until someone calls you on it and</v>

5883
02:40:26.641 --> 02:40:27.510
<v Speaker 2>then you're a winner.</v>

5884
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Like what to talk about setting the bar low man.</v>

5885
02:40:31.470 --> 02:40:31.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5886
02:40:31.651 --> 02:40:33.390
<v Speaker 2>is that like the lowest bar ever?</v>

5887
02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:38.010
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is be enough of a shithead that somebody points it out and</v>

5888
02:40:38.011 --> 02:40:38.940
<v Speaker 2>then you're a winner.</v>

5889
02:40:41.730 --> 02:40:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going to have to be their own fucking name soon that's going to fix</v>

5890
02:40:45.391 --> 02:40:45.691
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

5891
02:40:45.691 --> 02:40:47.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of the things with Twitter that somebody pointed out that's a</v>

5892
02:40:47.851 --> 02:40:48.684
<v Speaker 2>really good point.</v>

5893
02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:49.140
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

5894
02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:50.250
<v Speaker 2>most people on Twitter,</v>

5895
02:40:50.251 --> 02:40:50.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5896
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:51.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5897
02:40:51.021 --> 02:40:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I look at your fucking name,</v>

5898
02:40:52.171 --> 02:40:52.561

<v Speaker 2>there's your name.</v>

5900
02:40:54.190 --> 02:40:54.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5901
02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:57.060
<v Speaker 2>most people have Joshua Blah,</v>

5902
02:40:57.061 --> 02:40:57.181
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

5903
02:40:57.181 --> 02:40:57.660
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

5904
02:40:57.660 --> 02:40:59.550
<v Speaker 2>They have their fucking name on their Twitter page.</v>

5905
02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:02.630
<v Speaker 6>Somehow Facebook just added my fucking phone number on.</v>

5906
02:41:02.650 --> 02:41:03.380
<v Speaker 6>I didn't eat,</v>

5907
02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:06.500
<v Speaker 6>I didn't put my phone number on my Facebook and the other day somebody was like,</v>

5908
02:41:06.501 --> 02:41:07.360
<v Speaker 6>why do you have your real phone?</v>

5909
02:41:07.450 --> 02:41:09.260
<v Speaker 6>Like real phone number on your Facebook page?</v>

5910
02:41:09.261 --> 02:41:09.531
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

5911
02:41:09.531 --> 02:41:10.610
<v Speaker 6>are you fucking serious?</v>

5912
02:41:10.930 --> 02:41:14.570
<v Speaker 6>And it's like my app or my iPhone must have done it or something.</v>

5913
02:41:14.810 --> 02:41:15.643
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

5914
02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:17.000
<v Speaker 6>You might want to check that shit man.</v>

5915
02:41:17.001 --> 02:41:18.130
<v Speaker 6>Cause I didn't do it and</v>

5916
02:41:18.330 --> 02:41:18.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5917
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:20.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't have my phone on anything.</v>

5918
02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:21.840
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous though.</v>

5919
02:41:22.930 --> 02:41:24.340
<v Speaker 6>And then like this Twitter shit,</v>

5920
02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:25.090
<v Speaker 6>like uh,</v>

5921
02:41:25.090 --> 02:41:30.090
<v Speaker 6>the location it's set to default on the other day and I'm like great.</v>

5922
02:41:30.311 --> 02:41:32.290
<v Speaker 6>I just told everybody where I live.</v>

5923
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:35.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't remember I got,</v>

5924
02:41:35.130 --> 02:41:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I got hacked,</v>

5925
02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:37.930
<v Speaker 2>my Twitter got hacked and they were saying something about it.</v>

5926
02:41:38.010 --> 02:41:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I'll join a contest and win an iPad too.</v>

5927
02:41:41.430 --> 02:41:42.600
<v Speaker 2>They've got lady Gaga,</v>

5928
02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:44.401
<v Speaker 2>Lady Gaga.</v>

5929
02:41:44.401 --> 02:41:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I sent out a tweet to like 100 million people.</v>

5930
02:41:46.831 --> 02:41:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Whoever the fuck she's gotten her Twitter page about an iPad too.</v>

5931
02:41:49.770 --> 02:41:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5932
02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Cause apparently lady Gaga does her own Twitter and everybody likes to know</v>

5933
02:41:53.150 --> 02:41:53.311
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

5934
02:41:53.311 --> 02:41:54.144
<v Speaker 2>which I do too.</v>

5935
02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not comparing myself to lady Gaga.</v>

5936
02:41:59.130 --> 02:42:00.420
<v Speaker 2>No one can compare to Gaga.</v>

5937
02:42:00.900 --> 02:42:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5938
02:42:01.530 --> 02:42:02.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5939
02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.500
<v Speaker 2>they can do that somehow or another,</v>

5940
02:42:04.501 --> 02:42:05.790
<v Speaker 2>they get into your account.</v>

5941
02:42:05.791 --> 02:42:06.624
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

5942
02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:07.860
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what what you have to do,</v>

5943
02:42:07.861 --> 02:42:11.730
<v Speaker 2>but there must be some legal way they're doing it because it can be as simple as</v>

5944
02:42:11.731 --> 02:42:14.700
<v Speaker 2>they get your password because they don't seem to be sending a bunch of other</v>

5945
02:42:14.701 --> 02:42:15.534
<v Speaker 2>shit out with it.</v>

5946
02:42:15.690 --> 02:42:18.870
<v Speaker 2>It's just as one tweet that keeps repeating about,</v>

5947
02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:19.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5948
02:42:19.290 --> 02:42:20.490
<v Speaker 2>sign up for an iPad too.</v>

5949
02:42:20.491 --> 02:42:22.450
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be the one that everybody gets gangs.</v>

5950
02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a money market money.</v>

5951
02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:28.240
<v Speaker 2>The most machines pointed at hacking.</v>

5952
02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:29.191
<v Speaker 2>How do they do that?</v>

5953
02:42:29.191 --> 02:42:29.880
<v Speaker 2>How are they getting,</v>

5954
02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:32.210
<v Speaker 2>are they getting your password generators?</v>

5955
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:36.110
<v Speaker 6>Is that what we're running full time board generators and you click on a link in</v>

5956
02:42:36.111 --> 02:42:36.201
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

5957
02:42:36.201 --> 02:42:38.510
<v Speaker 6>you're not logged in and you log in by mistake.</v>

5958
02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Someone hits you with like a keystroke tracker or some other more devious virus</v>

5959
02:42:43.841 --> 02:42:44.231
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

5960
02:42:44.231 --> 02:42:46.450
<v Speaker 2>But usually it's just kind of password generators.</v>

02:44:18.801 --> 02:44:21.280
<v Speaker 6>your Internet that you already have and then you can use.</v>

6033
02:44:22.671 --> 02:44:23.330

6035
02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:27.860

6036
02:44:27.861 --> 02:44:29.180
<v Speaker 6>Why they don't know?</v>

02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:30.973

6041
02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:36.370
<v Speaker 6>but there's a lot of people that are like that,</v>

02:44:49.900 --> 02:44:51.260
<v Speaker 6>you're a younger girl.</v>

6058
02:44:51.490 --> 02:44:53.110
<v Speaker 6>Some people don't want anymore</v>

6059
02:44:53.230 --> 02:44:54.250
<v Speaker 2>distractions in their lives.</v>

6060
02:44:54.251 --> 02:44:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Didn't want to be able to watch TV on their phone.</v>

6061
02:44:56.410 --> 02:44:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6062
02:44:56.830 --> 02:44:58.090
<v Speaker 2>For some people it's porn.</v>

6063
02:44:58.100 --> 02:45:00.160
<v Speaker 2>There's some dudes have a problem with porn on their phone.</v>

6064
02:45:00.430 --> 02:45:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I was reading about this,</v>

6065
02:45:01.391 --> 02:45:05.860
<v Speaker 2>like guys have like fucking gigs of porn on their phone as her house porn on</v>

6066
02:45:05.861 --> 02:45:06.300
<v Speaker 2>their phone.</v>

6067
02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

6068
02:45:06.970 --> 02:45:10.870
<v Speaker 2>She used to sometimes like someone that's grocery wants a girl,</v>

6069
02:45:11.230 --> 02:45:14.860
<v Speaker 2>especially the little one like Esther just thinking about are just shoving</v>

6070
02:45:14.861 --> 02:45:15.694
<v Speaker 2>things in there.</v>

6071
02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:19.780
<v Speaker 2>So as we bring this fucking odd podcast home,</v>

6072
02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:22.840
<v Speaker 2>we never really did figure out a way to fix this situation,</v>

6073
02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but we can drive it around it and we just did it.</v>

6074
02:45:25.530 --> 02:45:26.140
<v Speaker 2>We gave it,</v>

6075
02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:27.820
<v Speaker 2>we gave it the date that's looking around.</v>

6076
02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:30.260
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking to take care of it.</v>

6077
02:45:30.610 --> 02:45:30.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6078
02:45:30.971 --> 02:45:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Well I think the number one thing that's going to happen at some of the people</v>

6079
02:45:34.421 --> 02:45:34.931
<v Speaker 2>that are in power,</v>

6080
02:45:34.931 --> 02:45:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I have to slowly die off.</v>

6081
02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:40.420
<v Speaker 2>They have to get old and pass on and then the young people have to move into a</v>

6082
02:45:40.421 --> 02:45:44.050
<v Speaker 2>position of power where they kind of grow up with the Internet and they grow up</v>

6083
02:45:44.051 --> 02:45:48.400
<v Speaker 2>with a better understanding of how they're perceived and how the world works and</v>

6084
02:45:48.401 --> 02:45:51.820
<v Speaker 2>how things don't have to be as greedy and fucked up and corrupt as they are.</v>

6085
02:45:52.030 --> 02:45:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Halliburton didn't have to make that much money and Ron didn't have to make that</v>

6086
02:45:55.091 --> 02:45:55.820
<v Speaker 2>much money.</v>

6087
02:45:55.820 --> 02:45:56.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6088
02:45:56.200 --> 02:45:58.690
<v Speaker 2>so much of what happened didn't have to happen.</v>

6089
02:45:58.691 --> 02:46:00.100
<v Speaker 2>So much of the money that changed,</v>

6090
02:46:00.490 --> 02:46:02.210
<v Speaker 2>changed hands and you know,</v>

6091
02:46:02.410 --> 02:46:04.240
<v Speaker 2>so much of the transactions that transpire,</v>

6092
02:46:04.241 --> 02:46:06.820
<v Speaker 2>they weren't necessarily like it got too crazy.</v>

6093
02:46:07.270 --> 02:46:07.541
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

6094
02:46:07.541 --> 02:46:10.990
<v Speaker 2>And I think the upcoming generations will see that that will be</v>

6095
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.511
<v Speaker 4>historically,</v>

6096
02:46:11.511 --> 02:46:12.500
<v Speaker 4>I think we're seeing it now.</v>

6097
02:46:12.501 --> 02:46:13.400
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>

6098
02:46:13.401 --> 02:46:13.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6099
02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:14.950
<v Speaker 4>this talk of the return,</v>

6100
02:46:14.951 --> 02:46:15.591
<v Speaker 4>it cuts a quad,</v>

6101
02:46:15.591 --> 02:46:18.050
<v Speaker 4>all the new type of that that's going to change things.</v>

6102
02:46:18.230 --> 02:46:20.900
<v Speaker 4>I think really what that may be is just the movement.</v>

6103
02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:22.730
<v Speaker 4>And I think we're all part of that.</v>

6104
02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:25.100
<v Speaker 4>That kinda new person that's arriving,</v>

6105
02:46:25.130 --> 02:46:27.260
<v Speaker 4>that new consciousness that's creating itself.</v>

6106
02:46:27.261 --> 02:46:30.140
<v Speaker 4>And I think there will be leaders that will emerge from that movement.</v>

6107
02:46:30.141 --> 02:46:31.910
<v Speaker 4>But the movement itself is what's key.</v>

6108
02:46:31.911 --> 02:46:34.350
<v Speaker 4>And I think all of us who are playing are,</v>

6109
02:46:34.590 --> 02:46:36.530
<v Speaker 4>are part kind of expanding.</v>

6110
02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:37.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6111
02:46:37.010 --> 02:46:40.610
<v Speaker 4>what we're open to and our beliefs and both riding that balance between</v>

6112
02:46:40.611 --> 02:46:42.260
<v Speaker 4>skepticism and an open mind,</v>

6113
02:46:42.261 --> 02:46:42.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6114
02:46:42.471 --> 02:46:43.220
<v Speaker 4>have to be,</v>

6115
02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:44.900
<v Speaker 4>you have to have both and you have to have,</v>

6116
02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:48.520
<v Speaker 4>have that kind of truth seeking aspect of yourself to doe,</v>

6117
02:46:48.830 --> 02:46:49.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6118
02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:52.330
<v Speaker 4>find the ways between that silage or absurdness of,</v>

6119
02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:54.020
<v Speaker 4>of the skepticism and the,</v>

6120
02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:54.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6121
02:46:54.530 --> 02:46:56.180
<v Speaker 4>to open in [inaudible] and,</v>

6122
02:46:56.330 --> 02:46:57.650
<v Speaker 4>and find where the truth lies.</v>

6123
02:46:57.651 --> 02:46:58.610
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's uh,</v>

6124
02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:02.810
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be the key key trade of what we need to do here going forward.</v>

6125
02:47:02.811 --> 02:47:05.540
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to create the movement that will inspire the leaders.</v>

6126
02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I just hope it stays together in some form.</v>

6127
02:47:09.411 --> 02:47:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I hope we don't have to rebuild civilization cause that would fucking suck cause</v>

6128
02:47:13.851 --> 02:47:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I live around too many dummies.</v>

6129
02:47:15.710 --> 02:47:16.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6130
02:47:16.071 --> 02:47:19.340
<v Speaker 2>there's just too many dummies out there to just rely on the people that are at</v>

6131
02:47:19.341 --> 02:47:22.550
<v Speaker 2>hand right now and I have some sort of an even vote and have everything work.</v>

6132
02:47:22.551 --> 02:47:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6133
02:47:23.170 --> 02:47:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6134
02:47:23.870 --> 02:47:24.321
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

6135
02:47:24.321 --> 02:47:27.410
<v Speaker 2>we're not prepared but like little children toss into the woods,</v>

6136
02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:28.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6137
02:47:28.970 --> 02:47:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6138
02:47:29.430 --> 02:47:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Well we're not prepared to be running shit.</v>

6139
02:47:32.210 --> 02:47:33.690
<v Speaker 2>God dammit heats.</v>

6140
02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:34.521
<v Speaker 2>Keep it together.</v>

6141
02:47:34.521 --> 02:47:37.160
<v Speaker 2>To a certain extent people would be,</v>

6142
02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:38.810
<v Speaker 2>it would be better than severe.</v>

6143
02:47:39.290 --> 02:47:39.740
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

6144
02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:41.820
<v Speaker 2>we don't need anything fucking traumatic.</v>

6145
02:47:41.821 --> 02:47:42.980
<v Speaker 2>The more we do preemptive,</v>

6146
02:47:42.990 --> 02:47:46.290
<v Speaker 4>I really like the more you go out there and push aggressively now the better</v>

6147
02:47:46.291 --> 02:47:47.124
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be.</v>

6148
02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:50.760
<v Speaker 4>If we just kind of let things happen that's no ball comes crashing hard.</v>

6149
02:47:50.761 --> 02:47:52.140
<v Speaker 4>But if we're out there pushing it now,</v>

6150
02:47:52.141 --> 02:47:52.590
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

6151
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:55.110
<v Speaker 4>like we're doing here on the podcast player in our small part,</v>

6152
02:47:55.260 --> 02:47:57.990
<v Speaker 4>everybody else play in their small part to open their consciousness,</v>

6153
02:47:57.991 --> 02:48:00.810
<v Speaker 4>open their friends consciousness and find that truth,</v>

6154
02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:01.700
<v Speaker 4>then uh,</v>

6155
02:48:01.700 --> 02:48:01.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6156
02:48:01.890 --> 02:48:05.010
<v Speaker 4>hopefully it'll fall a little less hard when it actually comes to crash.</v>

6157
02:48:05.050 --> 02:48:05.831
<v Speaker 2>Listen Arbor,</v>

6158
02:48:05.831 --> 02:48:07.600
<v Speaker 2>you got a lot of haters on my message board.</v>

6159
02:48:07.601 --> 02:48:09.970
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons is because you change your fucking name to Aubrey.</v>

6160
02:48:10.270 --> 02:48:13.360
<v Speaker 2>The other is because you're a little bit too handsome and do's don't like that.</v>

6161
02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:16.180
<v Speaker 2>It makes them uncomfortable then then all of the marketing stuff.</v>

6162
02:48:16.181 --> 02:48:17.830
<v Speaker 2>But people always ask me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why am I involved with this?</v>

02:48:33.340 --> 02:48:36.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were skeptical and I totally understand that.</v>

6188
02:48:53.951 --> 02:48:57.730
<v Speaker 2>brutal criticism that sometimes makes you really see things from a different</v>

6189
02:48:57.731 --> 02:48:58.564
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that he fucked up when he released the information for the ultimate fighter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I agreed that's a spoiler,</v>

6287
