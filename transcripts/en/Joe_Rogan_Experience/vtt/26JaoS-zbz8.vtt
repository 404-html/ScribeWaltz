<v Speaker 2>I listened to your,</v>

9
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 2>the last album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to that fucking thing</v>

10
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen to it all the time when I'm</v>

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Less good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what music is supposed to do.</v>

13
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.370
<v Speaker 2>I just stunned by the fact that for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>longest time you were basically doing</v>

14
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 2>the songwriting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were doing a lot of that.</v>

15
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 2>You were making your own music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you were known more as a songwriter.</v>

16
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so you do the things that come up and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.040

<v Speaker 2>out what your thing is.</v>

21
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.980

100
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.380

<v Speaker 1>Gene Simmons came to see me one time a</v>

101
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>few years back at New Year's Eve at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv,</v>

102
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 1>him and his family to see me.</v>

103
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>New Year's Eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking legitimately nervous the</v>

104
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at Jane [inaudible]</v>

105
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.593
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

106
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>we're not looking at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

108
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>it was so odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

109
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>you know who I am?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

110
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's strange stuff,</v>

111
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:27.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this phrase,</v>

112
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but I love talking to people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a year,</v>

113
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>two years into the situation you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now where he just kind of getting</v>

114
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>settled into it where it still seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fantasy land.</v>

115
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that it would ever not seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fantasy land because I spent enough</v>

116
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>years not in fantasy land to realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's in fantasy land.</v>

117
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>You could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be like 71 day on cocaine,</v>

118
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.670
<v Speaker 1>15 ex wives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gotta hope not.</v>

119
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>That sounds horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like it happens to a lot of</v>

120
00:04:58.901 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

121
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe.</v>

122
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I hope not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

123
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.174
<v Speaker 1>I hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>

124
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean you seem like you could avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a horrid,</v>

125
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>horrid existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a balancing act I think with any</v>
<v Speaker 1>great musician or any great artist</v>

127
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>really is like doing the art and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're,</v>

128
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.230
<v Speaker 1>you're in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in this,</v>

129
00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>this weird thing where you know you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna win grammys and you're going to</v>

130
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>have platinum albums if they still have</v>
<v Speaker 1>those anymore and you're going to be on</v>

131
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>these talk shows and people are gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it.</v>

132
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a different animal now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean yes and no.</v>

134
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

135
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

136
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>whatever we have is because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the music and when music</v>

137
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>lead and so try to do anything other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

138
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have fun with some of the stuff,</v>

139
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get somebody wants me to do a bit on</v>

140
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>the show or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine with that,</v>

141
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:48.634
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

142
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>But it's still all just comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

143
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all,</v>

144
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>the focus is always going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and anything other than that,</v>

145
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was never in my mind and he</v>

146
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.550
<v Speaker 1>focused on trying to stay famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that makes sense?</v>

147
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And I knew you were going to think like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

148
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy.</v>

149
00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:07.294
<v Speaker 1>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

150
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't make music for that reason.</v>

151
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>And in order to win awards or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

152
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make it because I like it and hope</v>

153
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:17.680
<v Speaker 1>that it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

154
00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it was very clear in your music</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself that does what you're dealing</v>

155
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.950
<v Speaker 1>very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear that that's pure,</v>

156
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.580
<v Speaker 1>that it's just this is what you do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're concentrating on that.</v>

157
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing disingenuous about it.</v>

158
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing pumped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fake or.</v>

159
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

160
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope not,</v>

161
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

162
00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:35.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

163
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.303
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

164
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.770
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it's gotta be a weird world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

165
00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>the world of the music business is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange world.</v>

166
00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a lot of musicians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 1>navigating the world of commerce and</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and</v>

168
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.361
<v Speaker 1>there again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

169
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>

170
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>if you just simplify it down to let the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music lead and let that kind of be</v>

171
00:06:56.121 --> 00:07:01.121
<v Speaker 1>always the focus for me that makes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>real easy to not make what decisions you</v>

172
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>would regret or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or feel like weren't you.</v>

173
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>So as long as that's the focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

174
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that other stuff just kind of</v>

175
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.760
<v Speaker 1>becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>external noise that will all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter,</v>

177
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>

178
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a hard thing to navigate in</v>

179
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.950
<v Speaker 1>that realm to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

180
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.873
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

181
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.430
<v Speaker 1>but you must see it being a difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for some folks.</v>

182
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.303
<v Speaker 1>You now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

183
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know,</v>

184
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.270
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people,</v>

185
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>care very much about</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

187
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the first person to ever get me</v>

188
00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:47.460
<v Speaker 1>in dangerous waters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm talking about people.</v>

189
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.410
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to name names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound judgemental.</v>

190
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.190
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife calls this pulling back the</v>

191
00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 1>curtain too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

192
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.210
<v Speaker 1>don't pull back that curtain too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

193
00:08:00.211 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>if you want to pull it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you,</v>

194
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:03.270
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the guy that likes to pull back</v>

195
00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Speaker 1>the curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good to look back there</v>

196
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.630
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

197
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 1>the monsters are up to.</v>

198
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think,</v>

199
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

200
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.680
<v Speaker 1>if you roll up into the music business</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

201
00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:20.580
<v Speaker 1>this is my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you roll up into one to make records</v>

202
00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:22.770
<v Speaker 1>and wanting to be in the music business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wanting to make a living,</v>

203
00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:24.480
<v Speaker 1>playing music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

204
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 1>having absolutely no opinion of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do or who you are,</v>

205
00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:31.620
<v Speaker 1>how you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want everybody else to tell you</v>

206
00:08:31.621 --> 00:08:33.720
<v Speaker 1>how to do it and what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when and where,</v>

207
00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:35.670
<v Speaker 1>and why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>

208
00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:39.780
<v Speaker 1>it can be a confusing thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be a lot of external opinions</v>

209
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.260
<v Speaker 1>that aren't yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will create someone that is not</v>

210
00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:45.420
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will have to play for the rest</v>

211
00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:48.690
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was that.</v>

212
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as you're doing things that,</v>

214
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.930
<v Speaker 1>that are you and do come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>from you and from who you are and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to do that that's never wrong</v>

216
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

217
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.180
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that doesn't add up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>most times it doesn't add up to some</v>

218
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 1>kind of commercial success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

219
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:18.321
<v Speaker 1>at least you can look at yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror on it and not hate whatever it is</v>

221
00:09:18.561 --> 00:09:20.290
<v Speaker 1>you have to go out and play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

222
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it can become my artistic equivalent</v>

223
00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:26.570
<v Speaker 1>of like a soulless corporate job where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of get sucked into</v>

224
00:09:26.571 --> 00:09:28.370
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be doing it for a living.</v>

225
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it makes you money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never really get to be yourself</v>

226
00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:34.490
<v Speaker 1>because you're sort of programmed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that they've sort of</v>

227
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.470
<v Speaker 1>manufactured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

228
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

229
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>a or an or you ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some other passion or talent that you</v>

230
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>have</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the guise of it seeming risky or</v>

231
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible and try to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go do this thing that seems like in your</v>

232
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 1>mind is the normal thing to do.</v>

233
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Like when Garth Brooks put on that wig</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretended to be that other dude,</v>

234
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.480
<v Speaker 1>remember that part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that thing to remember.</v>

235
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.720
<v Speaker 1>The love that I love when someone goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

236
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way off the reservation.</v>

237
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the story was that,</v>

238
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:11.390
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if this is true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was supposed to be like a</v>

239
00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:12.590
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

240
00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:15.140
<v Speaker 1>they did a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a behind the music.</v>

241
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Is that about this fake guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think.</v>

242
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea was that we're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a movie here it is.</v>

243
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like this was supposed to be</v>

244
00:10:24.171 --> 00:10:28.460
<v Speaker 1>like the soundtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the mistake if there was a</v>

245
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to try to discuss</v>

246
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>research and career in the realm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>making mistakes,</v>

247
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.920
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who am I to judge anybody?</v>

248
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Typically somebody who is as successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he is,</v>

249
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'd love.</v>

250
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I got friends in low places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love a lot of garth's music.</v>

251
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a garth brooks hater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a colossal fuck up.</v>

252
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:51.860
<v Speaker 1>That I think is hilarious and if God's</v>
<v Speaker 1>was here,</v>

253
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I'd pull that up and I would tell him I</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved him and I would say,</v>

254
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:57.320
<v Speaker 1>come on dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck were you smoking back</v>

255
00:10:57.321 --> 00:10:58.790
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who talked you into this?</v>

256
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say,</v>

257
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:05.111
<v Speaker 1>I think at the time that he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to be into what in the world else</v>

258
00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:07.850
<v Speaker 1>can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way I can become more</v>

259
00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:12.170
<v Speaker 1>successful is if I become someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make them successful.</v>

260
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:17.530
<v Speaker 1>He was so successful and still is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that space that he can't be any bigger</v>

261
00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:20.630
<v Speaker 1>than he is like Stephen King when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to write as Richard Bachman.</v>

262
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

263
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

264
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aware of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

265
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.650
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a bunch of books under a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pseudonym because he was so gigantic</v>

266
00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:31.790
<v Speaker 1>that he decided to write some books</v>
<v Speaker 1>under a different name so that people</v>

267
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:35.330
<v Speaker 1>would sort of appreciate the work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was instead of as a Stephen King</v>

268
00:11:35.331 --> 00:11:35.901
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

269
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Or just maybe even as an exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

270
00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think very much that's what it is.</v>

271
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I would look at it very much the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

272
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's kind of hard when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>your face up there to put a mask on.</v>

273
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Something should have got like Rick</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baker to do them up with a fake nose,</v>

274
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

275
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.520
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:11:52.521 --> 00:11:57.521
<v Speaker 1>Well make like an ugly weathered look in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saddle Warren Dude,</v>

277
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>put a seal wig on and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 1>But it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a behind the music story on his</v>

279
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 1>life store and the drugs and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and the moodiness and you know,</v>

280
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 1>but the music was always there and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hilarious behind the,</v>

281
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 1>behind the music.</v>

282
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 1>You could watch it on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I highly recommend it.</v>

283
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I will watch it on Youtube.</v>

284
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that particular thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's pulled himself out of that.</v>

285
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 1>He had a giant long hiatus and here's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting thing about garth brooks.</v>

286
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>He can't get his shit on itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

287
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>You have to get it on whatever his CD or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

288
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Then there's also his personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had something called ghost tunes for</v>

289
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:36.461
<v Speaker 1>a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

290
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Was that the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like his own curated streaming</v>

291
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>service where you stream only garth</v>
<v Speaker 1>brooks tunes or something like that.</v>

292
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember something about that.</v>

293
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his idea is that he wants his</v>

294
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.250
<v Speaker 1>albums played from there to as ghost</v>
<v Speaker 1>tunes.</v>

295
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>He wants his albums played from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first song to the last.</v>

296
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.270
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want like little bits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks.</v>

297
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to sell his songs</v>
<v Speaker 1>individually.</v>

298
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 1>This is what I believe I've read that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked.</v>

299
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.430
<v Speaker 1>He thinks of his albums as one</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuous work and while I,</v>

300
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I as much as anybody can understand that</v>

301
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:13.540
<v Speaker 1>and want very much people to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things as bodies work,</v>

302
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but in the world we're living in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

303
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you gotta let people skip over</v>
<v Speaker 1>a song here,</v>

304
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>let people do whatever they want with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

305
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:25.980
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want control people's right</v>

306
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.550
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

307
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's just a song that gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

308
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.950
<v Speaker 1>And that song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sell that song individually,</v>

309
00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 1>that'll get them and then maybe they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

310
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well listen to this 100 times.</v>

311
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 1>What else Chris got to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

312
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.353
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

313
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 1>So how did you get a quote unquote</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered as a singer?</v>

314
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you started off as a songwriter,</v>

315
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but you were always singing.</v>

316
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I was singing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in bluegrass bands.</v>

317
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I was in rock bands touring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>in a pickup truck or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

319
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>

320
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm 39.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many years did you do that for?</v>

321
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

322
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I moved to Nashville when I was 23 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the first three years I was in</v>

323
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only wrote three times a day living,</v>

324
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.573
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping,</v>

325
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.720
<v Speaker 1>breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>songwriting,</v>

326
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.590
<v Speaker 1>trying to learn how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.610
<v Speaker 1>in a way that kept me a job at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing company.</v>

328
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how does that work when you get</v>

329
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>signed by a publishing company or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a job at a publishing company</v>

330
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>writing while you have your contract</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor deal,</v>

331
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 1>basically it's like you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sign a deal with,</v>

332
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got a year and they get an</v>

333
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:36.490
<v Speaker 1>option or two to pick it back up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>another couple of years.</v>

334
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

335
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:39.170
<v Speaker 1>if one of those songs hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

336
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those terms were worked out,</v>

337
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:43.990
<v Speaker 1>whether you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of publishing they have,</v>

338
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.930
<v Speaker 1>a percentage that you have and they pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a salary in exchange for,</v>

339
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're lucrative.</v>

340
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 1>It can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

341
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 1>it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>if you have a bunch of songs on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio and so for you was,</v>

343
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 1>you were getting by doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

344
00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I know I've made a very comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>living up to the point</v>

345
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 1>about and what that allowed me to go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and play bluegrass for next to no money</v>

346
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 1>or no play rock and roll and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have fun doing it and not worried</v>

347
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>about that being how I'm making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

348
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've got to do it for the right</v>

349
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in a lot of ways,</v>

350
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the songwriting thing,</v>

351
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.760
<v Speaker 1>the commerce pay for the art I guess in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which I am a firm believer.</v>

352
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 1>And then some people were arguing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a conversation that struggle and I</v>

353
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.250
<v Speaker 1>will have the commerce paying for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

354
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

355
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great thing.</v>

356
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:35.941
<v Speaker 1>It still is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

357
00:15:35.941 --> 00:15:37.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still write songs for people.</v>

358
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I still write with people when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked me to do that for because it's</v>

359
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:42.570
<v Speaker 1>cool to get into somebody else's head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:15:42.571 --> 00:15:47.571
<v Speaker 1>or a kind of sit down with them and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help them realize some vision of what</v>

361
00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 1>it is they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's still one of my favorite</v>

362
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:54.650
<v Speaker 1>things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just as interested in that as I</v>

363
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:57.260
<v Speaker 1>am in and doing my own thing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

364
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So when you learn how to write music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

365
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you would write,</v>

366
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 1>will you sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you sit down with an idea in mind</v>

367
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.980
<v Speaker 1>with a guitar?</v>

368
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you sit down with a pen and pad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you,</v>

369
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 1>how do you write songs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

370
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.110
<v Speaker 1>if I'm riding by myself or with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else because there's a lot of different</v>

371
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:17.200
<v Speaker 1>processes it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever comes up that day for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally,</v>

373
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 1>if I was just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

374
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit down and go over in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that corner and write a song,</v>

375
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably have a legal pad and a pen</v>

376
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 1>much likely have sitting right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd start strumming until that felt</v>

377
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>like something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how does that make me feel?</v>

378
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep started humming the melody maybe.</v>

379
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully somewhere in humming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The melody of word would pop out that</v>

380
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 1>are noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would turn into a word.</v>

381
00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 1>And from there you can kind of grow this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing into whatever it is supposed to</v>

382
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

383
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Now that that's how I would do it if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sitting around by myself.</v>

384
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Now there's other times you and I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be having a conversation and you could</v>

385
00:16:55.821 --> 00:16:59.360
<v Speaker 1>say a phrase or a line or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I could read a sign going down the</v>

386
00:16:59.361 --> 00:16:59.970
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

387
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 1>if you're a songwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always writing songs.</v>

388
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a choice that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

389
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.810
<v Speaker 1>an affliction that you have in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just kind of walking around a</v>

390
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously things will hit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or moments will hit you or visual were</v>

392
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 1>hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will spark something.</v>

393
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

394
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can come from anywhere.</v>

395
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:25.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the truth.</v>

396
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.080
<v Speaker 1>It sounds a lot like writing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I don't,</v>

397
00:17:30.081 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I personally cannot write comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

398
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I would think the creative process is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much the same.</v>

399
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to kind of take life and</v>

400
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.670
<v Speaker 1>distilled into something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.890
<v Speaker 1>that evokes an emotional response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you sometimes sit down with a blank</v>

402
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 1>slate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have no idea what you want to</v>

403
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:49.500
<v Speaker 1>talk about or write about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

404
00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's back to the publishing deal</v>

405
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

406
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 1>that was my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we would set appointments,</v>

407
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:59.490
<v Speaker 1>we'd come in at noon and I have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>appointment with Ryder,</v>

408
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.193
<v Speaker 1>ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 1>we sit down and try to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

410
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be weird when you first</v>

411
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 1>worked with someone for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of first dates.</v>

412
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of first days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

413
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 1>you find out pretty quickly how you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of a</v>

414
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're right with writers who do</v>

415
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.130
<v Speaker 1>that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 1>you can very much walk into a room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of throw all the,</v>

417
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

418
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:25.430
<v Speaker 1>how'd you do?</v>

419
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.750
<v Speaker 1>And all that kind of answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get the,</v>

420
00:18:26.751 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you just get down to it and you'd just</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

421
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.270
<v Speaker 1>dive into it and start working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to,</v>

422
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is on my mind,</v>

423
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:35.260
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think of this now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sucks,</v>

424
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be not nice a little bit</v>

425
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 1>to each other and you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you don't know each other</v>

426
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to act like you do in order to</v>

427
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:47.700
<v Speaker 1>get to a spot where a song can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be something.</v>

428
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And when do you ever write with no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

429
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.380
<v Speaker 1>no guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no music.</v>

430
00:18:53.381 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever just have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

431
00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a song that I wrote on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the travel record that we had a</v>

432
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.080
<v Speaker 1>couple of records back traveler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote driving down the road,</v>

433
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving through the desert on interstate</v>

434
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:08.844
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

435
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.940
<v Speaker 1>wrote the whole thing driving and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to go figure out how to play it.</v>

436
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you're driving in your car,</v>

437
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.460
<v Speaker 1>did you record it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had,</v>

438
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a phone.</v>

439
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:22.311
<v Speaker 1>This is just turn the voice recorder on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phone and trying to,</v>

440
00:19:24.421 --> 00:19:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife was asleep in the seat next to</v>

441
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 1>him and I'm trying not to wake my wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

442
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm being real quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

443
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:35.121
<v Speaker 1>And then you get it done and you put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>away and you go listen to it later and</v>

444
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.110
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

445
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So in all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many songs do you think you've</v>

446
00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:45.621
<v Speaker 1>written an excess of a thousand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably somewhere like that.</v>

447
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you have stacks of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like laying around somewhere?</v>

448
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all cataloged at the publishing</v>

449
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:54.400
<v Speaker 1>company I write for and they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.960
<v Speaker 1>accounted for for the most part and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can kind of go back through them and dig</v>

452
00:19:58.961 --> 00:19:59.910
<v Speaker 1>in him if I need to.</v>

453
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for an album?</v>

454
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this what I've been doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

455
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:04.751
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:20:04.751 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this record we're putting out in the</v>

457
00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 1>last record that we have out a safe or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few covers.</v>

458
00:20:09.691 --> 00:20:11.720
<v Speaker 1>They're all songs that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 1>a decade old or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

460
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:14.600
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

461
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So might as well get stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long is that one?</v>

462
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that song is</v>

463
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.030
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably one of the first songs I</v>

464
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:23.730
<v Speaker 1>wrote when I moved to town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was probably 25 when I wrote that.</v>

465
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well I can't guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>now my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we like to support.</v>

492
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the art form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>music that has always been very</v>

493
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 2>inspirational to me and I've always</v>
<v Speaker 2>drawn upon it for.</v>

494
00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:36.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that hunter s thompson quote</v>

495
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.070
<v Speaker 2>about music being fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever seen that quote,</v>

496
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CV pull.</v>

497
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.680
<v Speaker 2>It's on my instagram page from pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

498
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was listening to Gary Clark Jr</v>

499
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>just a couple of days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

500
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:53.390
<v Speaker 2>that guy can play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck</v>

501
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a freak.</v>

502
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.330
<v Speaker 2>He was with honey honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best Way.</v>

503
00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

504
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.160
<v Speaker 2>they did a version of midnight rider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

505
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>music has always been a matter of</v>

506
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

507
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.570
<v Speaker 2>a question of fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sentimental people call it inspiration,</v>

508
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:10.960
<v Speaker 2>but what they really mean is fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always needed fuel.</v>

509
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm a serious consumer on some nights I</v>
<v Speaker 2>still believe that a car,</v>

510
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:18.670
<v Speaker 2>but the gas needle on empty can run</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 50 more miles if you have the</v>

511
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:20.620
<v Speaker 2>right music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very loud on the radio.</v>

512
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.233
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

513
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I liked music in the car myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

514
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uniquely inspirational.</v>

515
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Like very few things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the art of music and music creation</v>

516
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 2>is such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

517
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I think when it's done correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say is a,</v>

518
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a very pure art form in the sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people that are doing it are</v>

519
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:48.130
<v Speaker 2>really like digging into their creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>engines and you know,</v>

520
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 2>just getting the gears turning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling these things out and it</v>

521
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.330
<v Speaker 2>represents like however much burden you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in your personality,</v>

522
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:01.690
<v Speaker 2>in your life and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can either help you or hurt you in</v>

523
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:04.300
<v Speaker 2>this process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some people's music sort of</v>

524
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:08.680
<v Speaker 2>represents the torment of their life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people's music represents the</v>

525
00:23:08.681 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 2>purity of their vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all has different effects on</v>

526
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 2>people and some sort of strange and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre way.</v>

527
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to say that,</v>

528
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the songs I was talking about the</v>

529
00:23:18.661 --> 00:23:19.770
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else talking about this,</v>

530
00:23:19.771 --> 00:23:24.771
<v Speaker 1>but I like songs that allow you to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>ownership of them and make them personal</v>

531
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:29.250
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

532
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And I like listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's probably what we all</v>

533
00:23:35.131 --> 00:23:39.330
<v Speaker 1>like about songs eventually is our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to relate to them,</v>

534
00:23:39.331 --> 00:23:44.331
<v Speaker 1>but also they in and they become like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come back and write a song I can play</v>

535
00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 1>a song on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really mean anything</v>

536
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:51.650
<v Speaker 1>until somebody listens to it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're uh,</v>

537
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of what that song is about in</v>

538
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:57.210
<v Speaker 1>relation to them comes back at us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

539
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 1>on a stage or it comes or lives in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that way.</v>

540
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's so cool.</v>

541
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:02.620
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

542
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that makes a song</v>

543
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 1>complete.</v>

544
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like they're even done</v>
<v Speaker 1>until somebody listens to it and</v>

545
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.770
<v Speaker 1>attaches to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

546
00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that I love so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>about songs.</v>

547
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's thing is different too,</v>

548
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could have two songs that</v>

549
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 1>are the exact same song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's sung by different people and</v>

550
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 1>they have a completely different feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some certain covers he listen to a</v>

551
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:30.290
<v Speaker 1>certain coverage just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

552
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 1>just has it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just hits you in a totally different</v>

553
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:34.011
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

554
00:24:34.011 --> 00:24:35.460
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

555
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.130
<v Speaker 1>and then the other side of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.450
<v Speaker 1>two different people can listen to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same version of a song and it means</v>

557
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:45.620
<v Speaker 1>totally different things to them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they attached the pieces of their life</v>

558
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:48.360
<v Speaker 1>to it in a way that is unique to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

559
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.240
<v Speaker 1>that's the coolest thing in world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

560
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 1>It's interactive in some sort of a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

561
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:53.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

562
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

563
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing exists.</v>

564
00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.840
<v Speaker 1>What I mean by like sometimes people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>music represents sort of the tournament</v>

565
00:25:00.841 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 1>is going on their own personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was thinking specifically,</v>

566
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I was amy winehouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was a big amy winehouse fan and</v>

567
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 1>there's something about sash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

568
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Fucking phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that Rehab Song</v>

569
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.680
<v Speaker 1>because she put that Rehab Song out when</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knew she was a mess right in.</v>

570
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And then she still tried to make me go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rehab.</v>

571
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

572
00:25:22.061 --> 00:25:24.230
<v Speaker 1>you made it sound happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

573
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.760
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm riding this thing right into the</v>

574
00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

575
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stopping for the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

576
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm hitting the throttle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>

577
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.280
<v Speaker 1>See where this goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was tragic,</v>

578
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>but it produced some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some phenomenal music.</v>

579
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:35.421
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

580
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:39.800
<v Speaker 1>there was something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like almost a fatalistic</v>

581
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.060
<v Speaker 1>acceptance of our own fate or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

582
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can listen to it in that</v>

583
00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 1>perspective now that she's with us</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

584
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:52.550
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time it was a lot of teenage</v>

585
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.910
<v Speaker 1>angst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebratory.</v>

586
00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.530
<v Speaker 1>It felt celebratory of the time on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side of,</v>

587
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tragedy of it.</v>

588
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.950
<v Speaker 1>It has a little more weight I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

589
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.000
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

590
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stop and think about how many</v>

591
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 1>tortured souls put out unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

592
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:12.543
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

593
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree,</v>

594
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.540
<v Speaker 1>some of the greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.400
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a requirement that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a little bit out there,</v>

596
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

597
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

598
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:29.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible thing for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a beautiful thing for the rest</v>

599
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:30.770
<v Speaker 1>of us who get to listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

600
00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:32.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

601
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 1>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

602
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.960
<v Speaker 1>just to be an artist in any form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

603
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Requires all this vulnerability and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

604
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>trying to find whatever it is when</v>

605
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.680
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to create something where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is that coming from?</v>

606
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:49.830
<v Speaker 2>The ether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Muse is trying to just find that</v>

607
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:52.740
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're dealing with your</v>

608
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 2>own personal demons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like especially the deep drug demons</v>

609
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.890
<v Speaker 2>seem to produce some of the most insane</v>
<v Speaker 2>music ever.</v>

610
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think Hendrix and Kurt cobain.</v>

611
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And You keep going down that list</v>

612
00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:05.094
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

613
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

614
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a songwriter friend who is</v>

615
00:27:09.101 --> 00:27:14.101
<v Speaker 1>convinced that you can't really produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is really noteworthy</v>

616
00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:18.100
<v Speaker 1>unless you have some kind of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction issue.</v>

617
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.300
<v Speaker 1>So really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

618
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.203
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

619
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true,</v>

620
00:27:22.301 --> 00:27:24.580
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're saying that very thing,</v>

621
00:27:24.581 --> 00:27:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you look back at a history of rock</v>

622
00:27:27.911 --> 00:27:30.030
<v Speaker 1>and roll and music in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:32.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of heavy drugs and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

624
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

625
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 1>getting out there on the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Has in fact reduced some of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>music that we've ever heard.</v>

627
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.390
<v Speaker 1>He also can hear it in the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Stevie Ray Vaughan is a great</v>

628
00:27:43.391 --> 00:27:45.100
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like here,</v>

629
00:27:45.101 --> 00:27:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the getting out there on the edge in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

630
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear it with every ounce of</v>

631
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.473
<v Speaker 1>everything in it.</v>

632
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.010
<v Speaker 2>There's no safety net and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

633
00:27:55.011 --> 00:27:58.490
<v Speaker 2>This is just says all raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

634
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.400
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kinda crazy life,</v>

635
00:28:01.401 --> 00:28:03.140
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy way to make a living.</v>

636
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.090
<v Speaker 1>It is a crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Super Happy.</v>

637
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any of those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

638
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.640
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to have any of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

639
00:28:10.641 --> 00:28:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have to have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction issue to be great.</v>

640
00:28:13.371 --> 00:28:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I just think you just have to pursue it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

641
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.870
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe the addiction.</v>

642
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be healthy addictions.</v>

643
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody would look at it.</v>

644
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Most people that I meet that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful in one way or another,</v>

645
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.020
<v Speaker 1>they have at the very least kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessive tendencies about something</v>

646
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.260
<v Speaker 1>bright and generally it's some part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work.</v>

647
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.120
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

648
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.910
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and focus.</v>

649
00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this kind of super focused thing</v>

650
00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:47.420
<v Speaker 1>that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see certain people,</v>

651
00:28:47.421 --> 00:28:48.111
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

652
00:28:48.111 --> 00:28:51.380
<v Speaker 1>that's why he can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he or she can do that,</v>

653
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.930
<v Speaker 1>that they have this ability to focus.</v>

654
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:55.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

655
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I've always been amazed too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone can take an instrument and</v>

656
00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:03.030
<v Speaker 2>make that instrument sound very specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

657
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Like Gary Clark Jr is another good</v>
<v Speaker 2>example of that.</v>

658
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.743
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>put up on my instagram way back when</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

770
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

771
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid I used to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>more classical music than I do now,</v>

772
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.090
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy occasionally going to the</v>

773
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:29.930
<v Speaker 1>symphony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

774
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't gone in years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

775
00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

776
00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I do like that music it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it moves me in a different kind of way</v>

777
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.780
<v Speaker 1>than listening to different gang would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all right,</v>

778
00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:42.050
<v Speaker 1>here's the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jazz jazz.</v>

779
00:34:42.051 --> 00:34:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I do like jazz music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily like super experimental</v>

780
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:50.480
<v Speaker 1>jazz music that gets way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way out there like acid jazz,</v>

781
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.370
<v Speaker 1>like Coltrane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just.</v>

782
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once again,</v>

783
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I am not a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in no way am I an authority on jazz,</v>

784
00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 1>but if it's on I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will enjoy it because I enjoy as a</v>

785
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>musician.</v>

786
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed just like I hear enjoy great</v>
<v Speaker 1>blues players.</v>

787
00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 1>There's so many great musicians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>jazz,</v>

788
00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:11.240
<v Speaker 1>like I had an opportunity to rush songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn Wilson</v>

789
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 1>called me up one time to go write some</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs for the preservation hall jazz</v>

790
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 1>band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we wrote some songs.</v>

791
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I knew nothing about New Orleans jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

792
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.200
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

793
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

794
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.850
<v Speaker 1>but I went down to New Orleans and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>participated in this and wrote these</v>

795
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:32.700
<v Speaker 1>songs that now live in the jazz world so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

796
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.800
<v Speaker 1>that really is thrilling to me to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing I was telling you about where</v>

797
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go hop into somebody else's space and</v>

00:36:29.081 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have things I like to do.</v>

818
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

819
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I like to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't get to do that a whole lot.</v>

820
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Bass fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

821
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a trout stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

822
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a philosopher in Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not a fly fisherman,</v>

823
00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:44.660
<v Speaker 1>but a spinning tackle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

824
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Just spend a tackle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to use a little ultra lot.</v>

825
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Spending my summers were spent as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in being the creek at 5:30,</v>

826
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

827
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 2>my friend Steve Renaud was just talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a famous writer recently and his last</v>

828
00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the man's name,</v>

829
00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:02.781
<v Speaker 2>but he's famous in the fishing writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and he's a fly fisherman and he's</v>

830
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a really interesting question.</v>

831
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is so much great,</v>

832
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:12.021
<v Speaker 2>great literature attached to fly fishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to spin tackle.</v>

833
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.400
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

834
00:37:15.401 --> 00:37:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

835
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:18.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

836
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

837
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like using spend tackles like</v>

838
00:37:23.381 --> 00:37:25.820
<v Speaker 1>this a workman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

839
00:37:25.821 --> 00:37:28.210
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a blue collar way of doing it</v>

840
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.040
<v Speaker 1>or that's my perception of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people who were fly fishermen</v>

841
00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:34.720
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen these guys in action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:35.770
<v Speaker 1>use a fly Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

843
00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.540
<v Speaker 1>there's an art to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an art,</v>

844
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.330
<v Speaker 1>there's an art to using the all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

845
00:37:40.331 --> 00:37:43.960
<v Speaker 1>But the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were fly fishermen and take a lot</v>

846
00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:47.380
<v Speaker 1>more pride in the art of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

847
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.320
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

848
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.160
<v Speaker 1>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And please forgive me,</v>

849
00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:53.080
<v Speaker 1>fishermen out there if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm misrepresenting it,</v>

850
00:37:53.081 --> 00:37:55.000
<v Speaker 1>anybody who likes to do either of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

851
00:37:55.001 --> 00:38:00.001
<v Speaker 1>but my perception of it is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas with a spinning reel.</v>

852
00:38:02.381 --> 00:38:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And then me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to catch the fish.</v>

853
00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it means I'm flipping it out there,</v>

854
00:38:07.181 --> 00:38:10.180
<v Speaker 1>if it means I'm tossing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it means I'm jake fishing with it</v>

855
00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.560
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figuring</v>

856
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.670
<v Speaker 2>out the way to catch the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fly fishermen,</v>

857
00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 2>they liked the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

858
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I started out with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spinning Rod.</v>

859
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually started out with Zeb,</v>

860
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Co push buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spin Caster Jammies,</v>

861
00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I went to bait casting reel and</v>

862
00:38:32.231 --> 00:38:36.460
<v Speaker 2>then for bass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when I into trout fishing I</v>

863
00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:39.910
<v Speaker 2>eventually moved on to fly fishing and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned how to tie some flies.</v>

864
00:38:39.911 --> 00:38:42.270
<v Speaker 2>And let's say you're serious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sitting here talking about your.</v>

865
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your hobby.</v>

866
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It's been a long time now when I fish I</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish maybe once a year,</v>

867
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Speaker 2>like on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's especially when it happens for me</v>

868
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:52.160
<v Speaker 2>is I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

869
00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>charter,</v>

870
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:57.640
<v Speaker 2>a guy on a boat somewhere to go easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

871
00:38:57.641 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it in Hawaii,</v>

872
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.870
<v Speaker 2>in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the great thing is like say if you</v>

873
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:04.750
<v Speaker 2>stay at a resort that either like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could run a boat,</v>

874
00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 2>they'll take you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you catch a tune or something like that,</v>

875
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 2>and then you cook it and eat it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch and it's amazing.</v>

876
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.473
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

877
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.020
<v Speaker 2>That's about the extent that my fishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>these days,</v>

878
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.300
<v Speaker 2>my other outdoor activities are sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed my fishing time,</v>

879
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:21.100
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that get into fly fishing that it's not</v>

880
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 2>just fishing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the weird things about fly</v>

881
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 2>fishing is a lot of them let the fish</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

882
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of catch and release going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on with fly fishing,</v>

883
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.600
<v Speaker 2>which I mean I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that too.</v>

884
00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean I used to let a lot of them go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that,</v>

885
00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little tormented on that.</v>

886
00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.290
<v Speaker 2>You're putting a fucking hook through</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's head and you're going to let</v>

887
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:43.780
<v Speaker 2>it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how about just not doing that?</v>

888
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.760
<v Speaker 2>If you really love the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about just fish with no hook at all</v>

889
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:48.310
<v Speaker 2>when they bite it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

890
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have had them.</v>

891
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.760
<v Speaker 2>That's probably fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

892
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:54.180
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that we would be.</v>

893
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.280
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird thing that we have in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our head.</v>

894
00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 2>We were trying to activate those reward</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems that were there in place in</v>

895
00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 2>order to keep ourselves fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

896
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Like if there's a thing that happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you catch a fish you've seen like</v>

897
00:40:08.831 --> 00:40:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I've seen with my little kids have taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

898
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:15.520
<v Speaker 2>my daughters fishing and when they catch</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fish they have this look in their face</v>

899
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:16.320
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

900
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

901
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:18.124
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

902
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 2>like this is a super exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they pull it out of the boat and</v>

903
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 2>then the fact that they're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat it later.</v>

904
00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:28.891
<v Speaker 2>There's some weird primal DNA thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets activated when you catch something</v>

905
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's what these fly</v>
<v Speaker 2>fishermen that are letting the fish go</v>

906
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:33.910
<v Speaker 2>or trying to do that.</v>

907
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Just little junkies for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

908
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.300
<v Speaker 2>that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling,</v>

909
00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:42.301
<v Speaker 2>that DNA activation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that reward system thing and obviously</v>

910
00:40:42.521 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult and obviously there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of tremendous amount of skill and</v>

911
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:49.350
<v Speaker 2>finesse involved and fly casting role</v>
<v Speaker 2>casting,</v>

912
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:54.570
<v Speaker 2>trying to place this fly right in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>little pool and dragon with the current</v>

913
00:40:54.821 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 2>and get that nasty trout to bite onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

914
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.930
<v Speaker 2>But you also want to own it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have him and let him go.</v>

915
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't want to like say I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could've had you,</v>

916
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:06.020
<v Speaker 2>but there's no hook on dark side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fluff.</v>

917
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:09.250
<v Speaker 2>You want to know you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to know he bit.</v>

918
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 2>You want to know you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no one goes fly fishing with no hook.</v>

919
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 2>They go with a barbless hook and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch it and then they'll let it go and</v>

920
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:17.861
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

921
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:19.540
<v Speaker 2>As a barbless hook like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

922
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.000
<v Speaker 2>How about I put a Barbara so through</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fucking face.</v>

923
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>

924
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to ruin fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are fishing for all catch and release</v>

925
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:29.670
<v Speaker 2>fishermen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not in.</v>

926
00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I supported 100 percent and I've done</v>

927
00:41:31.721 --> 00:41:33.100
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hypocrite.</v>

928
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 2>That regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have done some catch and release,</v>

929
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:40.600
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like there is a weirdness to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it that it's this why you're not eating</v>

930
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:44.504
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

931
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Like how about you can't just look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

932
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to catch him,</v>

933
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:52.030
<v Speaker 2>catch him in and then let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how,</v>

934
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.130
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to look at them if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't care?</v>

935
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll get him in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

936
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 2>A good percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the number is,</v>

937
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.550
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're like salmon</v>
<v Speaker 2>fishing and you're using like heavy</v>

938
00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:03.110
<v Speaker 2>tackle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good percentage of your catch and</v>

939
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:04.300
<v Speaker 2>release and have those fish are never</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>

940
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Make it catch them with a big lure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barb hooks get them deep in the throat.</v>

941
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 2>He pulled them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their gills are bleeding.</v>

942
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

943
00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.600
<v Speaker 2>that's a scenario that you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

944
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:20.000
<v Speaker 2>catch in that essence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most fishermen I think would know that</v>

945
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't turn that fish back loose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to.</v>

946
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to turn them loose because</v>

947
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:29.000
<v Speaker 2>it's the law as the regulations and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn it loose and you watch it swim away</v>

948
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.030
<v Speaker 2>and look because going about a 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent chance.</v>

949
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

950
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody hates that.</v>

951
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that worst,</v>

952
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they still want that feeling.</v>

953
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird to catching the fish</v>

954
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:40.611
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A weird feeling.</v>

955
00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's that way with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>butterfly.</v>

956
00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Catchers too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because human beings used to be</v>

957
00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:47.930
<v Speaker 2>insectivores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

958
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to this lecture wants by</v>

959
00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna and he was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

960
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great psychedelic author and lecturer.</v>

961
00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:02.570
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about how he was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>into butterfly catching at one point in</v>

962
00:43:02.571 --> 00:43:07.571
<v Speaker 2>time and the odd thing is that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>activates this very primal reward system</v>

963
00:43:08.361 --> 00:43:11.390
<v Speaker 2>in your body the same way catching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish would that.</v>

964
00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 2>It's because human beings used to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>insectivores.</v>

965
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 2>We used to eat a lot of insects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you do find some rare butterfly</v>

966
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 2>that you've been after for months and</v>
<v Speaker 2>months and you have the opportunity to</v>

967
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:25.250
<v Speaker 2>drop the net on that mother fucker</v>
<v Speaker 2>get too excited about them.</v>

968
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird sort of trophy hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>butterfly hunting too,</v>

969
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 2>because you're allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can take that little fucker,</v>

970
00:43:31.461 --> 00:43:34.520
<v Speaker 2>dry them out and put them on a wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and nobody thinks you're a</v>

971
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:38.270
<v Speaker 2>barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people are real racist when it</v>

972
00:43:38.271 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 2>comes to what animals are allowed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

973
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.133
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

974
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pigs and cows are screwed.</v>

975
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

976
00:43:46.881 --> 00:43:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Pigs and cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bulls.</v>

977
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more so bugs,</v>

978
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:51.463
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes blogs.</v>

980
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I went to an ashram once and this lady</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was running the Armstrong had a.</v>

981
00:43:57.981 --> 00:44:02.981
<v Speaker 2>can of raid and she was talking to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the ant problem that they have and</v>

982
00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold up,</v>

983
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.720
<v Speaker 2>so you spray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you spray these ants with poison?</v>

984
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.010
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

985
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.630
<v Speaker 2>and I go see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill the ants.</v>

986
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that contrary to what you're</v>

987
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 2>teaching?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

988
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:17.650
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's just things you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do because otherwise the ants will</v>

989
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.980
<v Speaker 2>get in our food and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

990
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is odd.</v>

991
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:25.700
<v Speaker 2>A urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an odd crossroads here,</v>

992
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:27.920
<v Speaker 2>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a Buddhist,</v>

993
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 2>living in an ashram with a can of poison</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you use for living beings that you</v>

994
00:44:32.161 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 2>don't like being around you.</v>

995
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

996
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.010
<v Speaker 2>but if she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she had like cats that she was</v>

997
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:43.140
<v Speaker 2>killing with a baseball bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody would be mad.</v>

998
00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.400
<v Speaker 2>She'd be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

999
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1000
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With weird rules.</v>

1001
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Sorry to take you down this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very interesting to me.</v>

1002
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that human beings used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be insectivores,</v>

1003
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently something new everyday.</v>

1004
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that they talk</v>

1005
00:44:57.571 --> 00:45:02.571
<v Speaker 2>about in terms of the future of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that insects provide very complex,</v>

1006
00:45:03.661 --> 00:45:08.370
<v Speaker 2>complete proteins and they can provide</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to large amounts of people fairly</v>

1007
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 2>inexpensively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1008
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:11.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cricket proteins,</v>

1009
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.760
<v Speaker 2>very popular tail if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know a lot of people eat cricket</v>

1010
00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:16.060
<v Speaker 2>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:18.810
<v Speaker 2>They have cricket bars and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cricket bars.</v>

1012
00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make bars at a crickets and cricket</v>

1013
00:45:21.901 --> 00:45:24.660
<v Speaker 2>protein bars and apparently they taste</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>

1014
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1015
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.330
<v Speaker 2>my daughter ate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1016
00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we bought like on vacation somewhere,</v>

1017
00:45:28.471 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 2>like there's novelty sack of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>barbecue crickets or something because</v>

1018
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:33.510
<v Speaker 2>kids wanted to try him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1019
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 2>My mom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he actually got it out of the</v>

1020
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:36.240
<v Speaker 2>package,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1021
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.080
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

1022
00:45:37.081 --> 00:45:38.010
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try it.</v>

1023
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:41.310
<v Speaker 2>And she ate it and then she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty good.</v>

1024
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.310
<v Speaker 2>They're not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it as a cricket milkshake?</v>

1025
00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>

1026
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

1027
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 2>is that pre made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the cricket bars from the</v>

1028
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.290
<v Speaker 2>powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would look more palatable if</v>

1029
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:54.820
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have a picture of a cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like crawling out of it.</v>

1030
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Hide that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the.</v>

1031
00:45:57.271 --> 00:45:59.500
<v Speaker 2>There's the cricket protein powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crap.</v>

1032
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.820
<v Speaker 2>They cooked the cricket grind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those little fuckers up and turn it into</v>

1033
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 2>protein powder and it's apparently has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete amino acid profile.</v>

1034
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to digest and it doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 2>people feel bad.</v>

1035
00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1036
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Look at the grams of protein per 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>gallons of water.</v>

1037
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:20.720
<v Speaker 2>How much you can get for a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only get six grams of protein per</v>

1038
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.250
<v Speaker 2>100 grams of water or 100 gallons of</v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

1039
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:27.600
<v Speaker 2>but for crickets you get 71 grams of</v>
<v Speaker 2>protein for the same amount of water.</v>

1040
00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's more than 10 times the amount of</v>

1041
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:31.830
<v Speaker 2>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could.</v>

1042
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:35.310
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it has near the impact</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the environment.</v>

1043
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:39.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm in terms of like raising them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a lot of the waste</v>

1044
00:46:39.451 --> 00:46:42.990
<v Speaker 2>products and the issues that cows have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Methane</v>

1045
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.580
<v Speaker 2>smells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a.</v>

1046
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:48.210
<v Speaker 2>This was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry Dude.</v>

1047
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:49.883
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1048
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting here thinking about eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>crickets.</v>

1049
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about switching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had crickets before,</v>

1050
00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:57.660
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Mexico and they cooked them and</v>

1051
00:46:57.661 --> 00:46:59.740
<v Speaker 2>left him in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the.</v>

1052
00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.640
<v Speaker 2>We stayed at a hotel and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little snack,</v>

1053
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.720
<v Speaker 2>like a little snack thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a little.</v>

1054
00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 2>They were like a almost like a soy sauce</v>
<v Speaker 2>based or some sort of assault based</v>

1055
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.270
<v Speaker 2>chips or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1056
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.580
<v Speaker 2>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were fried and you just crunch them</v>

1057
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1058
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 2>these are actually pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like this.</v>

1059
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:22.410
<v Speaker 2>They're essentially related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of bugs are related to</v>

1060
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:23.244
<v Speaker 2>shellfish.</v>

1061
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like we found on fear factor</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you're allergic to shrimp,</v>

1062
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 2>you're also allergic to roaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1063
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found that out because we made a duty</v>

1064
00:47:32.441 --> 00:47:35.530
<v Speaker 2>roaches and he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he started having an allergic</v>

1065
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to get them a shot of adrenaline</v>

1066
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 2>and taken to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awful.</v>

1067
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bad day.</v>

1068
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:42.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1069
00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:45.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess your throat closes up on you and</v>

1070
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:46.024
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1071
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.140
<v Speaker 2>a lot of inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start wheeze and yeah,</v>

1072
00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:49.300
<v Speaker 2>it was not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 2>But crickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good and high in protein you ever,</v>

1074
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 2>you never eat anything weird to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a straight laced eater?</v>

1075
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1076
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty straight wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1077
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.610
<v Speaker 2>my dad was a bird hunter and a rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunter growing up,</v>

1078
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:05.890
<v Speaker 2>but I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never loved it.</v>

1079
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.993
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1080
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:08.860
<v Speaker 2>It's all about how it's cooked really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1081
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if we ever got that</v>

1082
00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 2>down in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1083
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:13.780
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky.</v>

1084
00:48:13.781 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Like I think if you're around a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild game chef,</v>

1085
00:48:17.171 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Speaker 2>like there's a guy named Hank Shaw who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been on this podcast before who is a</v>

1086
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:24.040
<v Speaker 2>hunter who is also like a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary chef and he makes these</v>

1087
00:48:24.041 --> 00:48:27.520
<v Speaker 2>amazing dishes with wild game and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those guys is like,</v>

1088
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:29.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it's bad because you haven't</v>

1089
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:30.604
<v Speaker 2>cooked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1090
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Let me cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1091
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lost art to some of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a lesser known art maybe.</v>

1092
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Where are you living right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man?</v>

1093
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I live south of Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee.</v>

1094
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.110
<v Speaker 2>So when you flew into hell today and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see like literally it's on fire for</v>

1095
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 2>people listening at this point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the worst fires in the</v>

1096
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 2>history of Los Angeles.</v>

1097
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Pretty scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1098
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:51.850
<v Speaker 2>because it's what's called a dry</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurricane.</v>

1099
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Meaning there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's hurricane force winds,</v>

1100
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:57.430
<v Speaker 2>but there's no rain and the fires are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going fucking crazy.</v>

1101
00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Fifty thousand acres down in a day is</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing right now.</v>

1102
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been here a few days and we were,</v>

1103
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got in two,</v>

1104
00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 2>three days ago and we've been doing some</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>

1105
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:13.300
<v Speaker 2>tv things and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But looking up that on the news is not</v>

1106
00:49:13.301 --> 00:49:14.770
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a fun thing to watch.</v>

1107
00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:17.200
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so heartbroken for everybody losing</v>

1108
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:18.680
<v Speaker 2>their homes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1109
00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.053
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1110
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:23.230
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awful thing to have to watch.</v>

1111
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly is.</v>

1112
00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.530
<v Speaker 2>It's the side effect of living in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place that doesn't have any weather.</v>

1113
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

1114
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Everything dries out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so rarely rains here.</v>

1115
00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:33.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1116
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.940
<v Speaker 2>And when you get like these crazy winds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Santa Ana winds that happened every</v>

1117
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.600
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1118
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 2>this is extraordinary.</v>

1119
00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.640
<v Speaker 2>The winds here and just perfect time for</v>
<v Speaker 2>fires obviously.</v>

1120
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:43.230
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody kicking these things up</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what's,</v>

1121
00:49:43.231 --> 00:49:45.980
<v Speaker 2>what's the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really no one knows when that could be.</v>

1122
00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Arson could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feels like that could be.</v>

1123
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some sick fucks out there.</v>

1124
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.190
<v Speaker 2>They know that the wind is a bad thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>for fire and then all of a sudden the</v>

1125
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:57.670
<v Speaker 2>fire shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that have 20</v>

1126
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 2>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one or two people that are</v>

1127
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.810
<v Speaker 2>either fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 2>That's way out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you were thinking?</v>

1129
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just watched it.</v>

1130
00:50:04.741 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fire spontaneously start,</v>

1131
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:10.710
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:11.860
<v Speaker 2>And these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:50:11.861 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems.</v>

1134
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably right.</v>

1135
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the suspicions is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's arson,</v>

1136
00:50:16.401 --> 00:50:20.820
<v Speaker 2>unrelated or this several fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them and there's so many you</v>

1137
00:50:20.821 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 2>don't want at this point.</v>

1138
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like somebody running around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thinking I don't know what the</v>

1139
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.970
<v Speaker 2>monitor they happen simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.750
<v Speaker 2>All during the same crazy conditions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they happen like way far apart from each</v>

1141
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:35.060
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you talked to firefighters about it</v>

1142
00:50:35.061 --> 00:50:36.710
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of times we don't know,</v>

1143
00:50:36.711 --> 00:50:38.930
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of times there's some</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious suspicions.</v>

1144
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1145
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.950
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunately,</v>

1146
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about all these human</v>

1147
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:47.660
<v Speaker 2>beings and there's one or two or</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1148
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:51.190
<v Speaker 2>whatever the number is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so tortured and so in,</v>

1149
00:50:51.191 --> 00:50:54.950
<v Speaker 2>in pain and so fucked up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their wires crossed.</v>

1150
00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:55.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

1151
00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it and I hope that's not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

1152
00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:02.250
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll watch all these guys on the</v>

<v Speaker 1>property or a firefighter's putting</v>

1155
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:09.450

<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1161
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of people take them</v>

1162
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.190
<v Speaker 2>for granted most of the time until you</v>
<v Speaker 2>need them.</v>

1163
00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.530
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are superheroes that only get</v>

1164
00:51:29.531 --> 00:51:31.290
<v Speaker 2>credit when they do some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1165
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they do do some shit,</v>

1166
00:51:33.251 --> 00:51:35.320
<v Speaker 2>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well without them,</v>

1167
00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.580
<v Speaker 2>like I talked to a firefighter wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it freaked me the fuck he was saying.</v>

1168
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of time until one day</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the right winds,</v>

1169
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a fire that burns all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean,</v>

1170
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.370
<v Speaker 2>just goes right through La and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing we can do about it.</v>

1171
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:49.810
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1172
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.970
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of time.</v>

1173
00:51:51.971 --> 00:51:53.190
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody thinks it.</v>

1174
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of catching the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire and then you realize today like,</v>

1175
00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.210
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's right.</v>

1176
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:59.463
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1177
00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Bel airs on fire where all the rich</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that's on fire.</v>

1178
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:03.631

<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1180
00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like live on the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were watching it in the hotel room,</v>

1181
00:52:09.991 --> 00:52:10.824
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just</v>

1182
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.770
<v Speaker 1>pretty hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1183
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean we changed our route to get over</v>
<v Speaker 1>here today just to get it because</v>

1184
00:52:16.951 --> 00:52:20.100
<v Speaker 1>there's road closures and reflect that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it take you more time?</v>

1185
00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I think we gave ourselves like an hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hour and 20 minutes.</v>

1186
00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:26.610

1197
00:52:53.101 --> 00:52:53.370
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1198

<v Speaker 1>They're eight and seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you bring a tutor on the road with</v>

1201
00:53:01.771 --> 00:53:02.604
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>My mother in law is a retired second</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade school teachers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so we homeschool our children on the</v>

1205
00:53:09.271 --> 00:53:10.380
<v Speaker 1>road and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they get,</v>

1206
00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:13.980
<v Speaker 1>when they studied the Boston tea party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to go look at all the stuff in</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1209
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:21.491
<v Speaker 1>it's a different kind of education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But are there things like that kind of</v>

1210
00:53:21.661 --> 00:53:24.660
<v Speaker 1>live and breathe for them a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than than what I got grown up and</v>

1211
00:53:24.661 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 1>hopefully someday they'll appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like how much of a stretch?</v>

1228
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've tried to be wicked warriors as</v>

<v Speaker 1>much as we can and do,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1234
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.540
<v Speaker 1>some things logistically that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make any sense if you're gonna run</v>

1235
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:27.720
<v Speaker 1>across Canada or we're,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we're out here for a couple of weeks or</v>

1237
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never longer than that,</v>

1238
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never trust it out.</v>

1239
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 1>We're not very rock and roll about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't live out there and don't</v>

1247
00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard way to make a living if</v>

1253
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Like that for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have to.</v>

1255
00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:13.330

1256
00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.150
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had to convince him of that,</v>

1257
00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:16.350
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>make hay while the sun shines on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that wholeheartedly.</v>

1275
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:54.630
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1276
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.520

<v Speaker 1>limits.</v>

1277
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a limit of the amount of</v>

1278

1280
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.780
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your voice starts to get</v>

1281
00:56:03.781 --> 00:56:04.800
<v Speaker 1>strained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one more show.</v>

1298
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call anybody out work with</v>
<v Speaker 1>greedy,</v>

1299
00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:42.310
<v Speaker 1>make moneybags and Christopher two shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>a night out,</v>

1300
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 1>a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But certainly certainly,</v>

1301
00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly everybody,</v>

1302
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:49.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants a,</v>

1303
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you work with.</v>

1304
00:56:50.981 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's their job is to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize what you're able to do</v>

1305
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 1>momentarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1306
00:56:56.021 --> 00:56:59.570
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to look at me,</v>

1307
00:56:59.571 --> 00:57:02.030
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry I can't do this physically.</v>

1308
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not physically possible.</v>

1309
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.570
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to deal within those</v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters and we figured out how to</v>

1310
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.300
<v Speaker 1>maximize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does every country music singer have to</v>

1311
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:12.220
<v Speaker 1>live around Nashville?</v>

<v Speaker 1>you fuckers is one spot that is the kind</v>

1314
00:57:20.171 --> 00:57:25.171
<v Speaker 1>of the hub for a actress living in La or</v>

1322
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1323
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:43.090
<v Speaker 1>certain energy to it as well though?</v>

1324
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.480
<v Speaker 1>It does have an energy to it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had an interview to it and it's a</v>

1325
00:57:46.481 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 1>very changing energy at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a different place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1330
00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:02.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just a music place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's so much else going on.</v>

1331
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.410
<v Speaker 1>It was 19 or 20 cranes building condos</v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it,</v>

1336
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:15.620
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1337
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:19.510
<v Speaker 1>there's an influx of people who all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden think it's a good idea to move to</v>

1338
00:58:19.511 --> 00:58:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Nashville.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1339
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:23.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what I had heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard that.</v>

1340
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:26.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost becoming like La [inaudible]</v>

1341
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means,</v>

1342
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.920
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

1343
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.570
<v Speaker 1>if that means that there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>condo buildings,</v>

1344
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.730
<v Speaker 1>chicks with lips like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

1346
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1347
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't run around and I go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nashville when I have to go into</v>

1348
00:58:42.011 --> 00:58:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Nashville for certain supplies for</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplies,</v>

1349
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.510
<v Speaker 1>and then I parked myself in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the country.</v>

1350
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's where you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live.</v>

1351
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of spread.</v>

1352
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a little bit of land and</v>

1353
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.040
<v Speaker 1>wildlife animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1354
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.010
<v Speaker 1>None of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobcat's and Turkeys and.</v>

1355
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nice,</v>

1356
00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.530
<v Speaker 1>dear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You name it.</v>

1357
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one I've heard about Nashville is</v>

1358
00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:09.610
<v Speaker 1>that Nashville started out as sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pure sort of music environment and</v>

1359
00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:13.830
<v Speaker 1>then over time it became a money grab</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people realized that it's a,</v>

1360
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:16.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a music environment and they said,</v>

1361
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:18.490
<v Speaker 1>how do we capitalize on this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people said,</v>

1362
00:59:18.491 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard this is a music environment.</v>

1363
00:59:19.781 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna move there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it became like a</v>

1364
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.300
<v Speaker 2>place to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be seen and that it's,</v>

1365
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:29.470
<v Speaker 2>it's still got the music there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like weirdly compromised.</v>

1366
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1367
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:34.040
<v Speaker 2>no more than anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1368
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I said human nature,</v>

1369
00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:39.090
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1370
00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds very like I'm anti,</v>

1371
00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1372
00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.480
<v Speaker 1>any corporate involvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have anything to</v>

1373
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.330
<v Speaker 1>say that it's been</v>

1374
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:53.420
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1375
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Tainted or it's all a money grab or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1376
00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1377
00:59:57.311 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Nashville by the way.</v>

1378
00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:00.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1385
01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.570
<v Speaker 2>people that have lived there and then</v>

<v Speaker 2>he'd go down and see all these amateur</v>
<v Speaker 2>van or these bands are just starting out</v>

1391
01:00:26.821 --> 01:00:27.654
<v Speaker 2>and they're amazing.</v>

1392
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's really,</v>

1393
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's some kind of mayberry</v>

1394
01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>version of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1395
01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>of what Nashville is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1396
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>that's Narnia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1397
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:37.480
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

1398
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that's some kind of Unicorn that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're inventing in your mind.</v>

1399
01:00:40.851 --> 01:00:43.600
<v Speaker 1>If you think that that's any challenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to you like that.</v>

1400
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:46.490
<v Speaker 1>There's like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1401
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the equivalent would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1402
01:00:47.691 --> 01:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>but feeling like you moved to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>island somewhere and everybody walks</v>

1403
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>around and has yachts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just direct Martinez all day or</v>

1404
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:56.230
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1405
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even true.</v>

1406
01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like places that you're supposed to</v>

1407
01:01:02.071 --> 01:01:03.720
<v Speaker 2>go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was in Boston,</v>

1408
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:06.290
<v Speaker 2>when I first started out doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard about the comedy store.</v>

1409
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.840
<v Speaker 2>That was like the Mecca rocky had to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the comedy store in Hollywood and I</v>

1410
01:01:09.841 --> 01:01:13.740
<v Speaker 2>was like spoken with harsh tones and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody sort of came to that place.</v>

1411
01:01:13.741 --> 01:01:17.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like a drew everybody in from</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the country and from my friends</v>

1412
01:01:17.881 --> 01:01:19.950
<v Speaker 2>like honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey and other people that I know that</v>

1413
01:01:19.951 --> 01:01:22.950
<v Speaker 2>lived in Nashville for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was Nashville was kind of that.</v>

1414
01:01:22.951 --> 01:01:27.000
<v Speaker 2>To them it's like what it was is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of place where you'd seen and</v>

1415
01:01:27.001 --> 01:01:30.450
<v Speaker 2>heard so much amazing music has come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that part of the world and it's so</v>

1416
01:01:30.451 --> 01:01:32.430
<v Speaker 2>music centered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1417
01:01:32.431 --> 01:01:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1418
01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.930
<v Speaker 2>it has a different vibe because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very art.</v>

1419
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a very artistic city.</v>

1420
01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1421
01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

1422
01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a side to it now and it's been</v>

1423
01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.630
<v Speaker 1>the last five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1424
01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it feels like I'm talking about you,</v>

1425
01:01:48.191 --> 01:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

1426
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing now where you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown and it's more like you're going</v>

1427
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>to a giant Bachelorette party or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1428
01:01:58.081 --> 01:01:59.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just like every,</v>

1429
01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>every bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1430
01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>just looking to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink their face and,</v>

1431
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>and listened to bad cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying like I'm sorry,</v>

1432
01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I need to apologize for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1433
01:02:11.251 --> 01:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you're being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1434
01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's great for the city and a lot of</v>

1435
01:02:15.001 --> 01:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>ways a tourism wise and monetarily and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those.</v>

1436
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>But it also changes that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1437
01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>some notions of that romantic thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>

1438
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>those things still exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>

1439
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>They have to be like a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have sold.</v>

1440
01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:32.380
<v Speaker 1>They need to be sought out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1441
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Like the difference between a real old</v>
<v Speaker 1>school bbq joint and Tgi Friday's.</v>

1442
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing as Tgi Fridays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what you mean?</v>

1443
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1444
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>You're laughing at me like back peddling</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the.</v>

1445
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:46.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1446
01:02:46.951 --> 01:02:47.491
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1447
01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:48.810
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forced the end of this.</v>

1448
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1449
01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:51.750
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about,</v>

1450
01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:56.760
<v Speaker 2>but my point about all of it really is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of artistic integrity is a</v>

1451
01:02:56.761 --> 01:02:58.340
<v Speaker 2>fleeting thing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1452
01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.920
<v Speaker 2>in a sacred thing and a critical thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a guy like you to create the kind of</v>

1453
01:03:01.921 --> 01:03:06.921
<v Speaker 2>music that you make and I'm always</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested like how someone cultivates</v>

1454
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:09.210
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how someone protects that.</v>

1455
01:03:09.310 --> 01:03:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Because I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what goes away.</v>

1456
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 2>It's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things go off the rails,</v>

1457
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:19.460
<v Speaker 2>it's usually the focus away from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative aspect of it going the art to</v>

1458
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 2>making the thing that you loved in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning when you got into this thing,</v>

1459
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes people get.</v>

1460
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedians in a big way,</v>

1461
01:03:26.851 --> 01:03:31.851
<v Speaker 2>they good movies and they become famous</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they believe their own bullshit</v>

1462
01:03:32.011 --> 01:03:33.750
<v Speaker 2>and they put out these specials that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

1463
01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:36.240
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real easy to fall into.</v>

1464
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1465
01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1466
01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>

1467
01:03:40.141 --> 01:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1468
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:45.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a side of that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that maybe that is what's</v>

1469
01:03:45.591 --> 01:03:48.860
<v Speaker 1>in their heart at that moment and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as real as anything else,</v>

1470
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1471
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that it's there in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong environment.</v>

1472
01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Well has been surrounded by the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with the wrong influences and the</v>

1473
01:03:57.171 --> 01:03:58.004
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1474
01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1475
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody's going to evolve in one</v>

1476
01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:06.660
<v Speaker 1>way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1477
01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1478
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's going to have these high</v>
<v Speaker 1>points and low points of,</v>

1479
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.980
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of where they really were in the zone,</v>

1480
01:04:15.981 --> 01:04:18.590
<v Speaker 1>so to speak or not in the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Creatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that is just life and um,</v>

1482
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1483
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I dunno as long for me if there's a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to preserve some notion of</v>

1484
01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.640
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that thing I sent earlier.</v>

1485
01:04:37.641 --> 01:04:42.641
<v Speaker 1>It's just like if you let all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff just put the blinders on and go,</v>

1486
01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I am here,</v>

1487
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:50.510
<v Speaker 1>here are the guys that I played music</v>
<v Speaker 1>with and then the girls were going to</v>

1488
01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:51.860
<v Speaker 1>sit in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do,</v>

1489
01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:56.150
<v Speaker 1>what will we do if none of this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff existed and that's.</v>

1490
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:58.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way you keep it,</v>

1491
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>which should be as you keep it right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment and right into the room and</v>

1492
01:05:05.871 --> 01:05:10.871
<v Speaker 1>don't let some of some notion of trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to outdo yourself for a out sell</v>

1493
01:05:13.401 --> 01:05:17.280
<v Speaker 1>yourself or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make more money than the other guy or,</v>

1494
01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>or having number one over top of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other guy or you know,</v>

1495
01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>because all that kind of stuff's</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer two number ones and those</v>

1496
01:05:24.731 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 1>are just numbers that.</v>

1497
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.800
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are so a tainted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just doing things that,</v>

1498
01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>that manufacturer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that number that they want to have that</v>

1499
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a real thing at that</v>

1500
01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:43.770
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

1501
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I always felt weird about contests and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that in any sort of like ranking</v>

1502
01:05:49.091 --> 01:05:52.670
<v Speaker 1>system that involves art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1503
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:55.020
<v Speaker 1>so your way anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of.</v>

1504
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that like the Oscars and</v>

1505
01:05:57.761 --> 01:05:59.540
<v Speaker 2>the grammys and all that kind of shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1506
01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't give a fuck who you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>is great.</v>

1507
01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who you think is the</v>

1508
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 2>greatest number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the number.</v>

1509
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Here's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The winter is open the envelope.</v>

1510
01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he going to get it?</v>

1511
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Like the work is the work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work is done.</v>

1512
01:06:13.601 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's apocalypse now is a great</v>

1513
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:18.190
<v Speaker 2>fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what you give them a</v>

1514
01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:21.940
<v Speaker 2>gold statue or not like what's the work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The work is great.</v>

1515
01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Like for it to win a thing or not when a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1516
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:27.400
<v Speaker 2>you know in some of the things that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1517
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:32.260
<v Speaker 2>you can tell that the wind is tainted by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political climate that the people</v>

1518
01:06:32.261 --> 01:06:35.790
<v Speaker 2>are like leaning towards something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's socially aware and console.</v>

1519
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Somebody made a movie with lesbians and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Save the planet from.</v>

1520
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.820
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that kind of shit becomes</v>

1521
01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:45.490
<v Speaker 2>transparent and obvious and you can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in rig the system and win an award.</v>

1522
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that awards for art or goofy</v>
<v Speaker 2>awards for comedy or super every comedy</v>

1523
01:06:52.181 --> 01:06:54.760
<v Speaker 2>competition I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're super goofy.</v>

1524
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:58.090
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's missing the whole idea of the</v>

1525
01:06:58.091 --> 01:06:59.170
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea.</v>

1526
01:06:59.171 --> 01:07:02.230
<v Speaker 2>The thing is supposed to be the art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not supposed to be trying to win an</v>

1527
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:03.064
<v Speaker 2>award.</v>

1528
01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not and,</v>

1529
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want an award out of that and it</v>

1530
01:07:08.781 --> 01:07:12.320
<v Speaker 1>allows you to make more art and it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people pay attention to the art.</v>

1531
01:07:12.321 --> 01:07:17.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of a bastardization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always felt like there was a show</v>

1532
01:07:17.271 --> 01:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>called last comic standing and the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about it was it,</v>

1533
01:07:19.971 --> 01:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>it got a lot of comics that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't heard of and they put them on</v>

1534
01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:23.624
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

1535
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:26.320
<v Speaker 2>the career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bad thing was that they're doing</v>

1536
01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:30.530
<v Speaker 2>like a contest and like who's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience platform or do you want Mike?</v>

1537
01:07:30.531 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about debbie?</v>

1538
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1539
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of those shows.</v>

1540
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not as many anymore.</v>

1541
01:07:40.361 --> 01:07:41.660
<v Speaker 1>A lot of from the singing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1542
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:45.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like to watch those shows because</v>

1543
01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:50.260
<v Speaker 1>people also like the idea that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be one thing,</v>

1544
01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:54.880
<v Speaker 1>one minute and one moment on television</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make you some other totally</v>

1545
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:58.030
<v Speaker 1>different person below them on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's why Susan Boyle was so</v>

1546
01:07:58.031 --> 01:07:59.100
<v Speaker 1>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1547
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw this woman.</v>

1548
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was doubting her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes out there and she's got pipes</v>

1549
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and she belts that song out and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see Simon who's just a douche bag</v>

1550
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:11.830
<v Speaker 1>because was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1551
01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:15.500
<v Speaker 1>She's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could see it like undeniable.</v>

1552
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>But those were good moments though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are good moments.</v>

1553
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Those are the best moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other good moments are like when</v>

1554
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>they have American idol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have those people that have no</v>

1555
01:08:24.711 --> 01:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>business being there and they played</v>
<v Speaker 1>their auditions too.</v>

1556
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Those are the other good moments for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong reasons,</v>

1557
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:32.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1558
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.180
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're watching that show that</v>

1559
01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>you're watching it for that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1560
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Is there a good show to introduce people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to country music?</v>

1561
01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1562
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>they used to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There used to be like shows where people</v>

1563
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:45.780
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1564
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:46.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to have,</v>

1565
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Nashville now and tell you like,</v>

1566
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that really exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1567
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a country music was specific show.</v>

1568
01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we really have that</v>

1569
01:08:56.211 --> 01:08:57.410
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a variety show,</v>

1570
01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 1>like Johnny Cash show or a show or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1571
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that anymore and I don't</v>

1572
01:09:02.781 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>know how much people want that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1573
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:09.320
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it might exist but one person</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>

1574
01:09:09.321 --> 01:09:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe there's not the right person</v>

1575
01:09:11.331 --> 01:09:11.660
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

1576
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think someone needs to make it.</v>

1577
01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:17.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's so much what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me about all these artists I got</v>

1578
01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:20.270
<v Speaker 1>to go look into and I'm sure there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch that are coming up that are</v>

1579
01:09:20.271 --> 01:09:24.950
<v Speaker 1>probably equally talented and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they just need an opportunity like</v>

1580
01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:26.870
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something like along those lines,</v>

1581
01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a variety show.</v>

1582
01:09:28.561 --> 01:09:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Our really talented people can come and</v>
<v Speaker 1>show their songs,</v>

1583
01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.790
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1584
01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1585
01:09:34.230 --> 01:09:34.851
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1586
01:09:34.851 --> 01:09:37.640
<v Speaker 1>the closest thing to that right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen this Mike Judge show the</v>

1587
01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Mike Judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy from King of the hill and uh,</v>

1588
01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.370
<v Speaker 1>it's Beavis and butthead tales from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tour bus or something like that.</v>

1589
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:46.610
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes,</v>

1590
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.010
<v Speaker 1>he talks to all these old school like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas country acts or,</v>

1591
01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.560
<v Speaker 1>or like it's all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the folklore of country music and</v>

1592
01:09:54.561 --> 01:09:57.800
<v Speaker 1>these and he doesn't like interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>style and they're all telling me stories</v>

1593
01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.860
<v Speaker 1>and latest trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

1595
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll</v>

1596
01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.560
<v Speaker 4>be at 36 brand new cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The horn sound like a dying.</v>

1597
01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.570
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jerry machine gun.</v>

1598
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Shot up a demo right next door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>$50,000 with false teeth.</v>

1599
01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:23.290
<v Speaker 4>I knew that he was facing his shoes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want me in the lab.</v>

1600
01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:29.040
<v Speaker 1>So they would tell stories and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>animate them.</v>

1601
01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is what all these guys that</v>

1602
01:10:30.991 --> 01:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>you see are animated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the real guys that lived a lot</v>

1603
01:10:33.451 --> 01:10:35.310
<v Speaker 1>of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Telling these stories.</v>

1604
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.850
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are not made up characters or in</v>

1605
01:10:37.851 --> 01:10:39.120
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way.</v>

1606
01:10:39.121 --> 01:10:41.430
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know some of the guys that wind up</v>

1607
01:10:41.431 --> 01:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>being animated on these things and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have for years said,</v>

1608
01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if even half of the folk lore that</v>

1609
01:10:47.491 --> 01:10:50.780
<v Speaker 1>exists in country music could be told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1610
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.880
<v Speaker 1>it would be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be the biggest thing in the</v>

1611
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1612
01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:56.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's what he's doing right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that show and he's doing an</v>

1613
01:10:56.611 --> 01:10:59.550
<v Speaker 1>excellent job of it and it's really for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1614
01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.110
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's not as entertaining to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

1615
01:11:01.111 --> 01:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me as a musician,</v>

1616
01:11:02.821 --> 01:11:04.210
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>

1617
01:11:04.211 --> 01:11:08.740
<v Speaker 1>some of the folk lore and knowing how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many great characters and storytellers</v>

1618
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:11.610
<v Speaker 1>exists in country music and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>

1619
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so refreshing to see these guys get</v>

1620
01:11:15.121 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 1>stories told about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

1621
01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know Mike Judge's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country music fan.</v>

1622
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got to tell you,</v>

1623
01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.020
<v Speaker 1>he's knocking it out of the park as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned with this,</v>

1624
01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this TV show.</v>

1625
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I hope it does really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad you brought this up.</v>

1626
01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

1628
01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And I don't say that about much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like get super pumped up</v>

1629
01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>about a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch other shit?</v>

1630
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1631
01:11:41.071 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I like a lot of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1632
01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean some pretty obvious things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones and walking dead.</v>

1633
01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm ended that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1634
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I like kind of science fiction based</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and uh,</v>

1635
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked but I liked,</v>

1636
01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I like things that are done well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1637
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think both of those were done well</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do you binge watch TV shows?</v>

1638
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way I can watch the TV</v>

1639
01:12:03.121 --> 01:12:03.690
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1640
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.100
<v Speaker 1>because half the time I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something when,</v>

1641
01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.550
<v Speaker 1>when it actually comes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1642
01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:08.913
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1643
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.420
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at yourself right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you look at all this cool shit that</v>

1644
01:12:13.421 --> 01:12:17.020
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you hope that just keep doing it this</v>

1645
01:12:17.021 --> 01:12:18.730
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have some grand plans?</v>

1646
01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.340
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we far surpassed any grand plan that I</v>

1647
01:12:22.341 --> 01:12:26.600
<v Speaker 1>might've had collected years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1648
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hopeful that we get to continue to</v>

1649
01:12:30.201 --> 01:12:33.680
<v Speaker 1>do some cool things and have fun doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:35.240
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1652
01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm at that age where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1653
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just old enough not to be stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what we're doing and</v>

1654
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:48.400
<v Speaker 1>hopefully young enough to really get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep doing it for a little while and,</v>

1655

1658
01:12:53.931 --> 01:12:58.040
<v Speaker 1>gotten to do and we'll get to do in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and hopefully the next few years</v>

1659
01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.980
<v Speaker 1>will just be a continuation of that.</v>

1660
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:04.230
<v Speaker 2>That's all you could ask for Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1661
01:13:04.231 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1663
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:09.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1664
01:13:09.201 --> 01:13:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could like write a script for how,</v>

1665

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how the curve of I want my</v>

1666
01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.180
<v Speaker 1>career of putting records out to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

1667
01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't write it any better for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1668
01:13:22.761 --> 01:13:27.410
<v Speaker 1>and I get to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have freedom to do basically whatever I</v>

1669
01:13:27.411 --> 01:13:32.411
<v Speaker 1>want and I'm in play however I want and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying about whatever I want.</v>

1670
01:13:33.561 --> 01:13:33.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1671
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1672
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the greatest thing in the world.</v>

1673
01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you get young guys coming up to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>young girls coming up to you that have</v>

1674
01:13:43.101 --> 01:13:46.190
<v Speaker 1>dreams of being a singer songwriter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1675
01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Asked you for advice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1676
01:13:48.031 --> 01:13:49.970
<v Speaker 1>and my advice has always just be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1677
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:51.290
<v Speaker 1>be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be nice.</v>

1678
01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1679
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's,</v>

1680
01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:57.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's always easier than making</v>

1681
01:13:57.921 --> 01:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>too many enemies or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

1682
01:13:59.921 --> 01:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1683
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you inevitably have people that don't</v>

1684
01:14:04.191 --> 01:14:06.260
<v Speaker 1>believe in what you do or thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1685
01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.090
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

1686
01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:10.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a subjective thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1687
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:14:12.371 --> 01:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Being nice is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also being you,</v>

1689
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.620
<v Speaker 1>be you and be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1690
01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:18.350
<v Speaker 1>And if you do those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1691
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the best recipe to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>

1692
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:23.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1693
01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:26.680
<v Speaker 1>for you to put yourself into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>position to get lucky.</v>

1694
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Is this something that you had to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out yourself?</v>

1695
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1696
01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1697
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start and I don't know how it</v>

1698
01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:42.520
<v Speaker 1>works from your end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do when you start and when you</v>

1699
01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:44.170
<v Speaker 1>get your first little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1700
01:14:44.171 --> 01:14:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I get a publishing deal and then you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be around some of what an industry is</v>

1701
01:14:48.341 --> 01:14:53.140
<v Speaker 1>and then you slowly but surely get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet people who are successful in</v>

1702
01:14:53.141 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 1>different facets of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what I find is the people</v>

1703
01:14:58.031 --> 01:15:00.670
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I gravitate towards and that I</v>

1704
01:15:00.671 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 1>really respect and look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1705
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I career like that would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1706

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1707
01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.350
<v Speaker 1>caring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving the individuals who,</v>

1708
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.220
<v Speaker 1>who support younger artists and they um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they do nice things for people out</v>

1710
01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:21.700
<v Speaker 1>in the world and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they make music that's in their</v>

1711
01:15:21.701 --> 01:15:24.070
<v Speaker 1>heart and those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the things that</v>

1712
01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I think are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are good to aspire to as a musician.</v>

1713
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:32.110

<v Speaker 1>people as you can,</v>

1726
01:15:59.691 --> 01:16:03.550

<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1727

<v Speaker 1>You can learn how to write better songs</v>

1732
01:16:14.061 --> 01:16:16.460
<v Speaker 1>more often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

1733
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1734
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:18.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1735
01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive me,</v>

1736
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:22.280
<v Speaker 1>this is a wrong analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you can really learn</v>

1737
01:16:22.281 --> 01:16:23.114
<v Speaker 1>how to be funny</v>

1738
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that,</v>

1739
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1740
01:16:28.991 --> 01:16:30.950
<v Speaker 2>you're the funny or not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized like,</v>

1741
01:16:30.951 --> 01:16:32.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people need to learn how to be</v>

1742
01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.240
<v Speaker 2>comfortable enough to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:38.210
<v Speaker 2>I've met people that sucked and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got good.</v>

1744
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

1745
01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.600
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's well I'm giving the wrong advice</v>

1746
01:16:41.601 --> 01:16:46.310
<v Speaker 2>then because I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally think like some of it has</v>

1747
01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:49.790
<v Speaker 2>to be innate and then you have to learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to sharpen that tool a little bit.</v>

1748
01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think whoever you are can change.</v>

1749
01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:58.060
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you are in a position</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are incapable of writing songs</v>

1750
01:16:58.161 --> 01:17:01.670
<v Speaker 2>or incapable of being funny or incapable</v>
<v Speaker 2>of writing books or doing paintings,</v>

1751
01:17:01.671 --> 01:17:03.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because of whoever you are right</v>

1752
01:17:03.861 --> 01:17:04.820
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean,</v>

1753
01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:07.250
<v Speaker 2>and whoever you are right now is who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be five years from now</v>

1754
01:17:07.251 --> 01:17:08.084
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

1755
01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I think if you can go enough personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>growth and enough introspective thinking</v>

1756
01:17:12.781 --> 01:17:16.400
<v Speaker 2>and objective realization of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and then the way you</v>

1757
01:17:16.401 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 2>interface with people slowly but surely</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes and evolves and matures your art</v>

1758
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:23.030
<v Speaker 2>will your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your expression well,</v>

1759
01:17:23.031 --> 01:17:26.000
<v Speaker 2>because you're not who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you're not who you were five</v>

1760
01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:27.860
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not who you were 10 years ago.</v>

1761
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my thought.</v>

1762
01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:31.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

1763
01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it works with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that just aren't</v>

1764
01:17:33.651 --> 01:17:36.230
<v Speaker 2>fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>

1765
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.920
<v Speaker 2>But I used to think that there was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you sucked in the beginning,</v>

1766
01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 2>you're going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I met</v>

1767
01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:44.370
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be some spark,</v>

1768
01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:46.890
<v Speaker 1>spark or drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1769
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:48.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1770
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I think if would you say that if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that was trying to be funny was</v>

1771
01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:56.170
<v Speaker 1>not funny at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they at least knew that they weren't</v>

1772
01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:57.340
<v Speaker 1>funding and had to get better at it?</v>

1773
01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1774
01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they think they're funny and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they become funny and select is.</v>

1775
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that there was much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a clear defined pattern then I think</v>

1776
01:18:09.021 --> 01:18:10.380
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1777
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:15.850
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's about being clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cluelessness is the enemy of any</v>

1778
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:19.400
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that you're going to make</v>

1779
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.320
<v Speaker 2>that's going to have a real impact on</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1780
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:22.700
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're clueless,</v>

1781
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.370
<v Speaker 2>have you done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't see how people perceive you.</v>

1782
01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.910
<v Speaker 2>If you're not aware of how they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking you in,</v>

1783
01:18:28.911 --> 01:18:32.250
<v Speaker 2>when you're communicating with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your art is gonna suck.</v>

1784
01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have a connection with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1785
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:36.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a connection with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a connection with</v>

1786
01:18:36.561 --> 01:18:39.920
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think unless there's some sort of a</v>

1787
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:44.360
<v Speaker 2>solitary thing that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe maybe sculpting or painting</v>

1788
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:48.050
<v Speaker 2>like can be a madman is like totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in your own world and create some</v>

1789
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 2>crazy art form that someone can come</v>
<v Speaker 2>along and look at and go,</v>

1790
01:18:50.361 --> 01:18:52.730
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anything where you're interacting</v>

1791
01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 2>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a big part of that</v>

1792
01:18:55.281 --> 01:19:00.281
<v Speaker 2>interaction is the way you look through</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people's eyes and the way they</v>

1793
01:19:01.011 --> 01:19:03.980
<v Speaker 2>take in what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just what you want to get out,</v>

1794
01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.110
<v Speaker 2>but also you are recognition.</v>

1795
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Some sort of either peripherally or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's,</v>

1796
01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:09.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously your,</v>

1797
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:14.000
<v Speaker 2>your realization of how they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceiving your thoughts and ideas and</v>

1798
01:19:14.001 --> 01:19:17.150
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what vehicle you're delivering these</v>

1799
01:19:17.151 --> 01:19:20.330
<v Speaker 2>ideas in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it clunky and too loud or do you have</v>

1800
01:19:20.331 --> 01:19:25.331
<v Speaker 2>the same thought and make it smooth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm and sinking into people with the</v>

1801
01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 2>right words and the right cadence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the right,</v>

1802
01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:30.710
<v Speaker 2>you can have the same ideas but they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1803
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.460
<v Speaker 2>they need a better vehicle to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>through and I think cluelessness</v>

1804
01:19:34.461 --> 01:19:39.080
<v Speaker 2>prevents you from objectively analyzing</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own work.</v>

1805
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So self awareness,</v>

1806
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.110
<v Speaker 2>self awareness is really important part</v>
<v Speaker 2>and brutal honesty,</v>

1807
01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:46.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with yourself.</v>

1808
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:47.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1809
01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go with that.</v>

1810
01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you must have that with songs,</v>

1811
01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:54.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do you have songs where you write</v>

1812
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and then you go back and what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this?</v>

1813
01:19:57.930 --> 01:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1814
01:19:59.971 --> 01:20:03.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have songs where,</v>

1815
01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:05.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1816
01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:07.860
<v Speaker 1>your rights every day you write a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get done,</v>

1817
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to the end of the day</v>
<v Speaker 1>without thinking that you did something</v>

1818
01:20:10.861 --> 01:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's only on,</v>

1819
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:15.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get away from it a little bit</v>

1820
01:20:15.361 --> 01:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>and then like read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to it or reexamine it and go</v>

1821
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.610
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Hey,</v>

1822
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

1823
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:29.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it's easy to feel like you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>a genius in the moment as a song.</v>

1824
01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a couple of drinks.</v>

1825
01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:32.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1826
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1827
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:41.190
<v Speaker 1>like how much of the stuff that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually write becomes a song that you</v>

1828
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:42.360
<v Speaker 1>publish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1829
01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.230
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're writing like how many of the</v>

1830
01:20:46.231 --> 01:20:50.280
<v Speaker 1>days spent do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it actually come out to be like a</v>

1831
01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:53.850
<v Speaker 1>full song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a song in three hours?</v>

1832
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can also not right spending</v>

1833
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:56.820
<v Speaker 1>three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1834
01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't want to,</v>

1835
01:20:58.170 --> 01:20:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you asking if there's like a</v>

1836
01:20:59.761 --> 01:21:01.020
<v Speaker 1>schedule to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1837
01:21:01.021 --> 01:21:01.321
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1838
01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean like how much of it like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really connects with you.</v>

1839
01:21:04.801 --> 01:21:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure you must be sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you sit down and on the first</v>

1840
01:21:09.271 --> 01:21:11.130
<v Speaker 1>draft you just fucking nail it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1841
01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 1>You've got an inspiration to me every</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1842
01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:18.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just trying to see if there's</v>

1843
01:21:18.661 --> 01:21:22.650
<v Speaker 1>parallels between ca because comedy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 10 to 1:10 things.</v>

1844
01:21:22.651 --> 01:21:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I write a bullshit and one thing that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom might be something there.</v>

1845
01:21:26.410 --> 01:21:27.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1846
01:21:27.001 --> 01:21:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing,</v>

1847
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:31.680
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing 10 percent of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is,</v>

1848
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is worked at Judeen good enough to put</v>

1849
01:21:35.011 --> 01:21:37.260
<v Speaker 1>out in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're probably doing pretty</v>

1850
01:21:37.261 --> 01:21:37.560
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1851
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

1852
01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1853
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.810
<v Speaker 1>of things that are worth something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1854
01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you hope for better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that if you're doing that,</v>

1855
01:21:47.371 --> 01:21:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that's doing your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to go.</v>

1856
01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I also believes you've got to go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the ones that aren't there just</v>

1857
01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:56.850
<v Speaker 1>to kind of flush them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get the,</v>

1858
01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:58.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to get that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they,</v>

1859
01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:01.200
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stuck there and it's gonna mess with</v>

1860
01:22:01.201 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 1>everything I should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>

1861
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.120
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1862
01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.520
<v Speaker 1>if there's something on your mind to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on,</v>

1863
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:08.520
<v Speaker 1>work on it to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it the best you can.</v>

1864
01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then look at it and go,</v>

1865
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:12.930
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this really something I should have</v>

1866
01:22:12.931 --> 01:22:15.090
<v Speaker 1>worked on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no?</v>

1867
01:22:15.091 --> 01:22:18.060
<v Speaker 1>And then just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can push it out and kind of</v>

1868
01:22:18.061 --> 01:22:20.370
<v Speaker 1>move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's important to kind of</v>

1869
01:22:20.371 --> 01:22:22.680
<v Speaker 1>flush out your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind that way creatively.</v>

1870
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever come back to your stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of almost like,</v>

1871
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:28.800
<v Speaker 1>like come back to it when you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it in forever and look at</v>

1872
01:22:28.801 --> 01:22:31.020
<v Speaker 1>it with fresh eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost like you're collaborating</v>

1873
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:36.021
<v Speaker 1>with somebody else and now I'm very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who believes like the first</v>

1874
01:22:36.121 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 1>instinct is probably the correct one</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time.</v>

1875
01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to go back and edit and</v>

1876
01:22:42.961 --> 01:22:45.060
<v Speaker 1>edit and edit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not me really.</v>

1877
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you write a song,</v>

1878
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:49.230
<v Speaker 1>you write a song pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1879
01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:50.900
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does everybody do it that way?</v>

1880
01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:51.380
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1881
01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.213
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

1882
01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:55.140
<v Speaker 1>There are guys who will take a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>year to write one song really.</v>

1883
01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:00.380
<v Speaker 1>And I can't write with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect them but I don't have that</v>

1884
01:23:01.531 --> 01:23:02.970
<v Speaker 1>kind of patience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1885
01:23:02.971 --> 01:23:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And they've written some songs that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think are fantastic and I really do</v>

1886
01:23:06.911 --> 01:23:07.391
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1887
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1888
01:23:08.170 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely impatient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erotic songs.</v>

1889
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1890
01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>my favorite songs are ones that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of fall down out of the sky in a</v>

1891
01:23:18.401 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 1>bolt of lightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you wrote it in about 10 minutes and</v>

1892
01:23:21.311 --> 01:23:22.960
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what it was supposed to</v>

1893
01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:24.040
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1894
01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go eat a sandwich.</v>

1895
01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much you should be,</v>

1896
01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:31.950
<v Speaker 2>right under the influence of something.</v>

1897
01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really to do that.</v>

1898
01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1899
01:23:36.331 --> 01:23:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm going to have a sip of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bourbon or something,</v>

1900
01:23:39.151 --> 01:23:39.984
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1901
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:42.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that that much because I</v>

1902
01:23:42.361 --> 01:23:44.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1903
01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I like the clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1904
01:23:45.131 --> 01:23:46.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1905
01:23:48.630 --> 01:23:51.120
<v Speaker 1>some guys can't do it without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some guys,</v>

1906
01:23:51.121 --> 01:23:53.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that makes them,</v>

1907
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:57.450
<v Speaker 1>all of the sudden turned into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan of songwriting,</v>

1908
01:23:57.451 --> 01:23:58.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>

1909
01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.600
<v Speaker 1>that's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to do something like that,</v>

1910
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's recreational and I'm gonna go eat a</v>

1911
01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:11.030
<v Speaker 1>bunch of chips and watch a movie or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like I'm not going to get.</v>

1912
01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get any real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1913
01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:15.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not much worthwhile.</v>

1914
01:24:15.721 --> 01:24:16.830
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come out of that for me.</v>

1915
01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1916
01:24:19.161 --> 01:24:22.880
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this different approach to</v>

1917
01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:27.140
<v Speaker 2>essentially w w what's an open ended</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative avenue,</v>

1918
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like creating a song,</v>

1919
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:32.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like a blank sheet of paper and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1920
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:36.320
<v Speaker 2>your idea and so many different people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have different approaches to how to,</v>

1921
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:38.210
<v Speaker 2>how to make that thing come out of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1922
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1923
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.320
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that I haven't tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different ways,</v>

1924
01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:48.670
<v Speaker 1>but I find for me the process that</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity works better than,</v>

1925
01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:52.610
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than trying to alter myself to,</v>

1926
01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:57.680
<v Speaker 1>to get to some other plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there is another planet I</v>

1927
01:24:57.681 --> 01:24:59.450
<v Speaker 1>don't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been there.</v>

1928
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would want,</v>

1929
01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.860
<v Speaker 2>like George Carlin had an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1930
01:25:02.861 --> 01:25:06.260
<v Speaker 2>the real comedy who'd write comedy sober</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he would smoke a joint,</v>

1931
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:07.990
<v Speaker 2>punch it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1932
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he'd write the initial ideas.</v>

1933
01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:14.430
<v Speaker 2>You write it all out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write out the bit that needed.</v>

1934
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at this thing again.</v>

1935
01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that probably works in</v>

1936
01:25:23.231 --> 01:25:23.890
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1937
01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:24.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1938
01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.810
<v Speaker 2>I've started adopting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to write almost all high and now</v>

1939
01:25:28.811 --> 01:25:33.610
<v Speaker 2>I write 50 percent high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent sober and then a punch up</v>

1940
01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:35.620
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1941
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But not to punch up as can be a term for</v>

1942
01:25:39.251 --> 01:25:40.660
<v Speaker 2>editing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:25:40.661 --> 01:25:41.930
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1944
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:46.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on some styles of writing.</v>

1945
01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Some guys right in bit form like they</v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1946
01:25:49.481 --> 01:25:51.620
<v Speaker 2>So the other day I walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would write it out like,</v>

1947
01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:55.030
<v Speaker 2>and other guys would just like say</v>
<v Speaker 2>clocks,</v>

1948
01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.570
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of clocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the arbitrary decision that we all</v>

1949
01:25:58.571 --> 01:26:00.130
<v Speaker 2>made that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1950
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:04.610
<v Speaker 2>these numbers around this dial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this it's minute is this amount of time</v>

1951
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 2>and you'll just start writing all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things out of that.</v>

1952
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.670
<v Speaker 2>You might write a whole essay out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1953
01:26:09.671 --> 01:26:11.570
<v Speaker 2>You might have one paragraph that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

1954
01:26:11.571 --> 01:26:15.470
<v Speaker 2>like one quick one liner about time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1955
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an answer to a pretentious friend and</v>

1956
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:22.050
<v Speaker 2>like there is new time and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you fucking show up late,</v>

1957
01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.840
<v Speaker 2>you get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's time for you get a new job.</v>

1958
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:29.370
<v Speaker 2>That could be a way where you could take</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and you know,</v>

1959
01:26:29.650 --> 01:26:34.550
<v Speaker 2>just take like this big essay on it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would extract an idea that could</v>

1960
01:26:34.551 --> 01:26:39.170
<v Speaker 2>eventually be humor on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody's got a different style</v>

1961
01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:40.100
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1962
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:43.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of thinking.</v>

1963
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because all a lot of thinking,</v>

1964
01:26:45.741 --> 01:26:48.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I always love talking to</v>

1965
01:26:48.591 --> 01:26:50.240
<v Speaker 2>people that do something completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than me.</v>

1966
01:26:50.241 --> 01:26:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Like you always want to know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1967
01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.920
<v Speaker 2>how does a guy who writes books do this?</v>

1968
01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:59.240
<v Speaker 2>How does a guy who writes songs do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it guy who makes movies do</v>

1969
01:26:59.241 --> 01:27:00.074
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1970
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:01.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it seems like it's a lot of the</v>

1971
01:27:01.821 --> 01:27:02.940
<v Speaker 2>same muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>

1972
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Then in talking here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that the processes are</v>

1973
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:10.010
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they always translate.</v>

1974
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I think the focus is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your whatever your end goal</v>

1975
01:27:15.561 --> 01:27:17.000
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're trying to create.</v>

1976
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:21.170
<v Speaker 2>It's all about showing up and doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>work and staring at it and trying to</v>

1977
01:27:21.171 --> 01:27:23.030
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for,</v>

1978
01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.550
<v Speaker 2>for comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot about getting in front of the</v>

1979
01:27:25.551 --> 01:27:27.530
<v Speaker 2>crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotTa work a lot.</v>

1980
01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 2>If you don't work a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to work,</v>

1981
01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:32.000
<v Speaker 2>just won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be out there.</v>

1982
01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.040
<v Speaker 2>You can't just create comedy on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

1983
01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I think you with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>talented musicians,</v>

1984
01:27:36.771 --> 01:27:40.400
<v Speaker 2>you could probably developed a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>jam and record before anybody ever got a</v>

1985
01:27:40.401 --> 01:27:43.030
<v Speaker 2>chance to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>

1986
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:44.260
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1987
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly different style of</v>

1988
01:27:46.251 --> 01:27:47.570
<v Speaker 2>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although we did,</v>

1989
01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do try things out on the road,</v>

1990
01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1991
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.850
<v Speaker 2>and you kind of get a feel for them</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes that way.</v>

1992
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:54.170
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>

1993
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:56.330
<v Speaker 2>we do some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1994
01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.690
<v Speaker 2>But probably not as much as what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1995
01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a different art form.</v>

1996
01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever have,</v>

1997
01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:07.730
<v Speaker 2>do you ever do things specifically with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intention of getting material out of</v>

1998
01:28:07.731 --> 01:28:08.564
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1999
01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in life?</v>

2000
01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like go do something.</v>

2001
01:28:14.751 --> 01:28:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe if I go do this I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll figure out,</v>

2002
01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I'll get some songs out of this or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2003
01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I ever specifically do</v>

2004
01:28:23.001 --> 01:28:27.560
<v Speaker 2>something to get material out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do do things because something</v>

2005
01:28:27.561 --> 01:28:29.450
<v Speaker 2>comes up and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds so weird.</v>

2006
01:28:29.451 --> 01:28:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then from that,</v>

2007
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:35.950
<v Speaker 2>and then from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either good things happen or I have a</v>

2008
01:28:35.951 --> 01:28:40.540
<v Speaker 2>story that sounds like it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be the best way to do it.</v>

2009
01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To just live a happy,</v>

2010
01:28:42.221 --> 01:28:46.780
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled life and mine that happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled life for ideas rather than</v>

2011
01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:50.560
<v Speaker 2>chase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting things with the specific</v>

2012
01:28:50.561 --> 01:28:52.450
<v Speaker 2>intention of turning them into</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>

2013
01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2014
01:28:52.890 --> 01:28:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely,</v>

2015
01:28:55.740 --> 01:29:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I go do things that might make me</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable or put myself in</v>

2016
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 2>situations where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sounds like</v>

2017
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.140
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what,</v>

2018
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:04.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2019
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case in point and that turned out to</v>

2020
01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:08.281
<v Speaker 1>be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2021
01:29:08.281 --> 01:29:10.430
<v Speaker 1>we are now good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2022
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:12.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I ever met Timberlake,</v>

2023
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Justin timberlake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2024
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I got a call to basically play at his</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday party.</v>

2025
01:29:18.031 --> 01:29:21.990
<v Speaker 1>His wife called me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is no live,</v>

2026
01:29:21.991 --> 01:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>like he'd seen a youtube video or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and said,</v>

2027
01:29:25.261 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you come play?</v>

2028
01:29:26.221 --> 01:29:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And he thought I was getting punked or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was just,</v>

2029
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:33.690
<v Speaker 1>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the conversation with his wife</v>

2030
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Jessie was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

2031
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:37.423
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

2032
01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of things that he's</v>

2033
01:29:40.171 --> 01:29:42.270
<v Speaker 1>done a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to find new experiences</v>

2034
01:29:42.271 --> 01:29:44.370
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was wondering if you would like</v>

2035
01:29:44.371 --> 01:29:47.220
<v Speaker 1>to come play at his birthday party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking and so this is what you</v>

2036
01:29:47.221 --> 01:29:48.310
<v Speaker 1>came up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2037
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:52.020
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this realm duty saw a youtube video on</v>

2038
01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.610
<v Speaker 1>getting him to complete his birthday</v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

2039
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out to be fine and we hung</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a,</v>

2040
01:29:56.890 --> 01:29:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2041
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:02.200
<v Speaker 1>and but it on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would to me,</v>

2042
01:30:02.201 --> 01:30:03.950
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really strange.</v>

2043
01:30:03.951 --> 01:30:05.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going to happen.</v>

2044
01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But out of that we,</v>

2045
01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:11.700
<v Speaker 1>we've become friends and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done things together and,</v>

2046
01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:13.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good things have come out of it,</v>

2047
01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:16.520
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was no intent out of it other</v>

2048
01:30:16.521 --> 01:30:19.730
<v Speaker 1>than that than I thought it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to go do.</v>

2049
01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And so I went and hung out and it turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to be great.</v>

2050
01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:27.920
<v Speaker 1>And we're good friends now and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty bad ass.</v>

2051
01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that.</v>

2052
01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.240
<v Speaker 1>But that's how we met you to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2053
01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.210
<v Speaker 1>there we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was literally his birthday present</v>

2054
01:30:35.211 --> 01:30:37.350
<v Speaker 1>one year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's wild man.</v>

2055
01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:38.630
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2056
01:30:38.631 --> 01:30:43.631
<v Speaker 1>I think that might be the formula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just if you can do things that you find</v>

2057
01:30:44.451 --> 01:30:48.240
<v Speaker 1>interesting and just have those as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

2058
01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:55.660
<v Speaker 1>excellent a side side adventures in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2059
01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.051
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2060
01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:57.970
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody else has to understand it but</v>

2061
01:30:57.971 --> 01:30:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2062
01:30:58.770 --> 01:31:00.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the cool part about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2063
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:02.020
<v Speaker 1>people used to get onto me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2064
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I used to be able to grasp band and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2065
01:31:03.731 --> 01:31:06.220
<v Speaker 1>why are you spending time being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bluegrass band?</v>

2066
01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of being in that bluegrass band,</v>

2067
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I got a cut on Adele,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2068
01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.593
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2069
01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:13.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2070
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:18.870
<v Speaker 1>who would've thought that that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ex a plus b equals c formula for that.</v>

2071
01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:24.370
<v Speaker 1>They'll be in a bluegrass band and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a pop cut on the biggest pop</v>

2072
01:31:24.371 --> 01:31:25.480
<v Speaker 1>star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny though,</v>

2073
01:31:25.481 --> 01:31:26.590
<v Speaker 1>that someone would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2074
01:31:26.591 --> 01:31:28.060
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to be in a bluegrass</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to me.</v>

2080
01:31:38.071 --> 01:31:43.071
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna I'm gonna Follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow that road until it ends or takes</v>

2081
01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:47.940
<v Speaker 1>a curve or runs off a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do anything specifically to try</v>

2082
01:31:47.941 --> 01:31:50.100
<v Speaker 1>to enrich your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you read a lot or anything?</v>

2083
01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a huge reader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do play a lot of,</v>

2084
01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2085
01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I just play it a lot of guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's my thing that I really</v>

2086
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:02.800
<v Speaker 1>kind of internalize on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost like a meditation.</v>

2087
01:32:02.801 --> 01:32:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2088
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:07.360
<v Speaker 1>If I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm feeling bad or in a bad head</v>

2089
01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:09.430
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pick up a guitar.</v>

2090
01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.660
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2091
01:32:12.230 --> 01:32:14.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2092
01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:16.940
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's if there's a centering thing,</v>

2093
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pick up a guitar to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for me and I don't know.</v>

2094
01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's flexing your mind a little</v>

2095
01:32:29.031 --> 01:32:30.830
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is something,</v>

2096
01:32:30.831 --> 01:32:31.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2097
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:34.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the guitars,</v>

2098
01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:37.640
<v Speaker 1>one of those things where you never</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you're ever getting any</v>

2099
01:32:37.641 --> 01:32:42.440
<v Speaker 1>better at it until one day you wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you understand something that you</v>

2100
01:32:42.441 --> 01:32:46.010
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand and hadn't understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the 10 years you've been trying to</v>

2101
01:32:46.011 --> 01:32:49.070
<v Speaker 1>understand it and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this new,</v>

2102
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new space to live in on it and then</v>

2103
01:32:53.711 --> 01:32:55.510
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the coolest thing in the world</v>

2104
01:32:55.511 --> 01:32:56.740
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2105
01:32:57.370 --> 01:32:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if</v>

2106
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:03.120
<v Speaker 1>you hit a new level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2107
01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:05.650
<v Speaker 1>like you're working out and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>working out and you're working on your</v>

2108
01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:10.150
<v Speaker 1>workout for 10 years and you never get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit this point where like,</v>

2109
01:33:10.170 --> 01:33:12.130
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the peak of what I have.</v>

2110
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And then some day for some unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

2111
01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:19.330
<v Speaker 1>your body or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense and all of a sudden you</v>

2112
01:33:19.331 --> 01:33:20.740
<v Speaker 1>could do something that you could never</v>
<v Speaker 1>do before.</v>

2113
01:33:21.850 --> 01:33:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what planning guitar is.</v>

2114
01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Do I kind of understand the space you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and I think that applies</v>

2115
01:33:29.891 --> 01:33:32.100
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2116
01:33:32.101 --> 01:33:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this moving me Animoto Musashi quote</v>

2117
01:33:35.531 --> 01:33:40.000
<v Speaker 1>that I like I use all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you understand the way broadly you</v>

2118
01:33:40.001 --> 01:33:42.640
<v Speaker 1>see it in all things and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2119
01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:46.420
<v Speaker 1>this place that you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these new level places like that</v>

2120
01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:49.880
<v Speaker 1>exists in martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It exists in comedy.</v>

2121
01:33:49.881 --> 01:33:53.650
<v Speaker 1>It exists in writing and exists and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure it exists in music,</v>

2122
01:33:53.651 --> 01:33:58.651
<v Speaker 1>although I don't do music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this thing of this Zen Samurai</v>

2123
01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:03.040
<v Speaker 1>thing you're talking about of just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this constant focus until you reach some</v>

2124
01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:06.430
<v Speaker 1>new understanding of the thing and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know how you're getting there</v>

2125
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:07.330
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

2126
01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but you're working towards something but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what it is until you get</v>

2127
01:34:11.591 --> 01:34:12.670
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2128
01:34:12.671 --> 01:34:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And then you get it and you have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>new piece of knowledge or it's a piece</v>

2129
01:34:17.621 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 1>of and it's a new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you're selling something</v>

2130
01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:23.080
<v Speaker 1>new too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's the thing you were</v>

2131
01:34:23.081 --> 01:34:26.410
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier about people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck accommodate.</v>

2132
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.510
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2133
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:30.930
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2134
01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:37.160
<v Speaker 1>that's what I get off on is finding a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding that,</v>

2135
01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:38.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2136
01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:41.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't claim to be,</v>

2137
01:34:41.150 --> 01:34:41.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like</v>

2138
01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't belong in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2139
01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Gary Clark junior world or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2140
01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:51.431
<v Speaker 1>but I do love guitar enough to know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always playing enough to try to find</v>

2141
01:34:54.201 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>that new space to live and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coolest thing the world to me because</v>

2142
01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll never get to whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never an end to it.</v>

2143
01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2144
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no perfection.</v>

2145
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:05.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2146
01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never an end to it.</v>

2147
01:35:08.711 --> 01:35:13.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just a constantly trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>better at doing what you do or being,</v>

2148
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.380
<v Speaker 1>being used that trying to make yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2149
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:19.580
<v Speaker 2>And that thing seems to manifest itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>more with,</v>

2150
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:21.320
<v Speaker 2>with a singular focus like</v>

2151

2153
01:35:26.061 --> 01:35:28.540
<v Speaker 1>one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

2154
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's it for me for the most part.</v>
