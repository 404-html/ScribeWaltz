00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:04.530
<v Speaker 1>that is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not just in this talk,</v>

4
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>that's not talk where you zig zagged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roy Roy's story is a perfect example of</v>

6
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>that and explain who roy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>roy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's who got me started in bow hunting</v>

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>and he is the toughest man I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>met.</v>

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I've shared more experiences with Roy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mountains.</v>

10
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.740
<v Speaker 1>He's life to finding type experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>that we've talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

12
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bond we've created together has been</v>

13
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>over a handful of experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize when you're out of your</v>

15
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>comfort zone like that and when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>both so committed to a pursuit,</v>

16
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>those bonds form quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

17
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>And so we've formed a strong bond over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>handful of experiences over a couple of</v>

18
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>years will really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>we went to high school together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started bow hunting as I think 18,</v>

21
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>19 years old and had hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

22
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>life changing life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defining experiences together over the</v>

23
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

24
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>So our bond naturally was like brothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

25
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

27
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.830
<v Speaker 1>when everybody doubted me when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up and doubted my dream of ever</v>

28
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>becoming anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never did.</v>

29
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>He was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always the guy that believed in</v>

30
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>this year of sheep hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was up sheep hunting where we had</v>

32
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>sheep hunted before together and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed around.</v>

33
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

35
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>dangerous hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

36
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's more prepared or he was more</v>

37
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>prepared for hunt's like that than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody in the world.</v>

38
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>He's done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done it as much as anyone that I</v>

39
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>know and I've been successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's killed,</v>

40
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>had killed nine rams and he one misstep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fell and died,</v>

41
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime of his life,</v>

42
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>essentially 49 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

45
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three kids,</v>

46
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the toughest Alaska hunters looked</v>

47
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>up to one step gone.</v>

48
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just talk,</v>

50
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>when you say zig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should've zagged.</v>

51
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>There's risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

52
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to it,</v>

53
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it just puts everything in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the allure to it because I can</v>

54
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>speak for Roya and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I know we,</v>

55
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>we always have known about the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was part of the draw is we wanted</v>

56
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>to go where nobody else wanted to go or</v>
<v Speaker 1>do things that nobody else wanted to do.</v>

57
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>That was the only thing that made us</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

58
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And it goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That made us different.</v>

59
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes back to,</v>

60
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level,</v>

61
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>the playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>we felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>if we would go and do the hardest hunts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the toughest conditions,</v>

64
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>nobody else would want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we would,</v>

65
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden we were calling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots,</v>

66
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>we call the shots of the mountain calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shots and all that,</v>

67
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>that hunt the mountain.</v>

68
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
<v Speaker 1>One at Roy fell and he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a if fell 700 feet.</v>

69
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

71
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that where he fell just tough,</v>

72
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>unforgiving sheep country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

73
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you,</v>

74
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>once you start going there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to stop.</v>

75
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.103
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most dangerous hunts</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep.</v>

77
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.903
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>on that hunt specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give a hundred tags and a lot of</v>

81
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>times there's this one sheep killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that difficult.</v>

82
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think 40% of the people never even</v>

83
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>go because of the weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the conditions,</v>

84
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>because it's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they draw the tag and don't even get</v>

85
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that there was a case with you</v>

86
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>when you went up there grizzly hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were supposed to go sheep hunting as</v>

87
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

89
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>it was moose hunting Moose.</v>

90
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>We were going to do a moose sheep Combo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's so much snow we couldn't</v>

91
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>even get to sheep country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

92
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a plan where we're going to go</v>

93
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>sheep hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was with Roy.</v>

94
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>That was with Roy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

95
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>So we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>an amazing moose hunt together and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed a nice big bowl.</v>

97
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just had just a,</v>

98
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>just another epic adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

99
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a haunt that maybe a handful of people</v>

100
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>would want to do because we were so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

101
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles back and had to haul a moose out</v>

102
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>over a mountain in the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

103
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

104
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

105
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>But the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

106
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>it def,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was perfect because it's our last</v>

107
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>hunt together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died two weeks later and that hunt</v>

108
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>and capsulated everything about us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just hard.</v>

109
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It was miserable and it was rewarding</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

110
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we achieved success were not very many</v>

111
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>people would have and we did it together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

112
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

113
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and then two weeks laters was his sheep.</v>

114
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an iconic photo that I think</v>

115
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 1>was forever going to define you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hunt with you,</v>

116
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>the big cut in your face and blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming down your face and you send it</v>

117
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 1>to me while you were out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying we have,</v>

119
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>we haven't gotten one yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120

<v Speaker 1>This Sao went over and was attacking the</v>

186
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>corpse of the bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bear died.</v>

187
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.250
<v Speaker 1>She didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She smelled blood,</v>

188
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>just went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

<v Speaker 1>these brown bear are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big predators.</v>

190
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.200

<v Speaker 1>it's going to have an issue.</v>

191
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 1>So she hurt when I shot the bore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made a noise.</v>

<v Speaker 1>didn't know what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew he had made this noise.</v>

194
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 1>So she ran towards where he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well as soon as she hit his path,</v>

195
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.400

<v Speaker 1>Arrow pass through them.</v>

196
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.040

<v Speaker 1>smelling blood,</v>

220
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>it was so much going on at one time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it got something triggered in her</v>

221
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 1>head and she was just crazy.</v>

222
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>So here she comes and I killed my bears</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a creek.</v>

223
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>She got to the creek and Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

224
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.970
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she hasn't stopped long enough</v>

225
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

226
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she comes up to our side of the creek</v>

227
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.890
<v Speaker 1>and not have an arrow knocked and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

228
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 1>ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what I'm going to do with an Arrow,</v>

229
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:39.211

<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>

230
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I never packed a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just had my bow and he had,</v>

231
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 1>he had the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stands up at 20 yards away and</v>

233
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 1>and it's a standoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we think,</v>

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stood up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

238
00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 1>dropped down and leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were like,</v>

239
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 1>get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

240
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 1>she drops down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beeline right towards us charging.</v>

241
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And so roy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

242
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.053
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.100
<v Speaker 1>he drops her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 1>one shot made a good shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit like Mr. Head butt hit like right</v>

245
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:17.420
<v Speaker 1>here and it was folded her right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

246
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.440
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

247
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 1>what stands out for me is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

248
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

249
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.220
<v Speaker 1>we were never worried about our lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>were at stake.</v>

250
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 1>We were never worried about any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a typical reaction would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

252
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.610
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could have died or something like</v>

253
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

254
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cussed because I'm like,</v>

255
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I was mad she did that and required Roy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act,</v>

256
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was just,</v>

257
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I cussed and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

258
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:50.190
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>

259
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were worried about ourselves.</v>

260
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 1>We were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't want to have to kill another</v>

261
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:58.830
<v Speaker 1>bear and we weren't nervous about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

262
00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.911
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

263
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

264
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 1>where else am I going to have somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on that same page with me that,</v>

265
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.770
<v Speaker 1>that's common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation and not see their life</v>

266
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:10.720
<v Speaker 1>flash before their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just do what you have to do to,</v>

267
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>to stop the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's never gonna happen.</v>

268
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to have somebody like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in my life again.</v>

269
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

270
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

271
00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>we knew the risks were involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that we did and we embraced</v>

272
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it and we were fine with it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't consume us or anything.</v>

273
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm going to miss is having</v>

274
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on my same page that I can trust like</v>

275
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 1>roy was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have to have someone who's</v>

277
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:42.810
<v Speaker 1>experienced that as many times it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>roy has had where it was,</v>

278
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.060
<v Speaker 1>he knew exactly what he had to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

279
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

280
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>And he and his people know what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do.</v>

281
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's executing that is what's hard,</v>

282
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

283
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so knowing what it takes,</v>

284
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 1>not panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in control and then getting the</v>

285
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>job done with one shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare.</v>

286
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so roy in those situations was as,</v>

287
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

288
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been with everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say he's as good as anybody</v>

289
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 1>that I know of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

291
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 1>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 1>when he fell and I got the news that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell and died.</v>

293
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

294
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I could believe it I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was mad and I'm still mad.</v>

295
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know everything happens for a</v>

296
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:33.470
<v Speaker 1>reason and I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

297
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a lot of faith and I know,</v>

298
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to think everything's going to</v>

299
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>be okay and we'll see each other again.</v>

300
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I know all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still makes me mad.</v>

301
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

302
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we missed or we missed out on a lot of</v>

303
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 1>experiences we'd still love to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about and we were just</v>

304
00:12:58.031 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had these big,</v>

305
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>big goals and big dreams and I'm mad</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's gone.</v>

306
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely,</v>

307
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just understandable.</v>

308
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

309
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.770
<v Speaker 1>it's something that very few people</v>
<v Speaker 1>could probably relate to.</v>

310
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 1>The kind of intimate friendship that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have with someone who's</v>

311
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 1>experienced those kinds of hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been in the,</v>

312
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 1>in the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's don,</v>

313
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>like that Moose Hunt that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about when you guys were deep,</v>

314
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:29.090
<v Speaker 1>deep in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

315
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>in the wilderness like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

316
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 1>it's something that very few people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

317
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.430
<v Speaker 1>very few people ever experienced that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of danger,</v>

318
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.490
<v Speaker 1>that kind of an intimate moment in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wilderness.</v>

319
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Just that connection to the wild that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys had together.</v>

320
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the whole point I guess with all</v>

321
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 1>that is it's people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you just,</v>

322
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.840
<v Speaker 1>you're murderous or you want to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a small part of what me and Roy</v>

323
00:13:58.841 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 1>experience together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kills were,</v>

324
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we achieved our goal.</v>

325
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the journey.</v>

326
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It was the Brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

327
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up.</v>

328
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what hunting is.</v>

329
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not just you're out killing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

330
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you're experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

331
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.380
<v Speaker 1>its most brutal or it's most rewarding</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the entire gamut.</v>

332
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that makes you who you are.</v>

333
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's powerful.</v>

334
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what hunting was to us.</v>
