<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This house is for sale in northern</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tiny thing.</v>

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a houseboat,</v>

20
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Speaker 1>like with like built in thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda like A.</v>

<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>

24
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would you be content</v>

25
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>that's very small?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be great for a little while.</v>

26
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>That's very small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred 60.</v>

27
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

28
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to shower like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

29
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>that little tiny house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

30
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the one that's bigger than</v>

31
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a 320 foot.</v>

32
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>It says three and a 20 foot tiny cabin</v>
<v Speaker 1>in big bear.</v>

33
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's attainable.</v>

34
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.080
<v Speaker 1>That's bigger than we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still for sale.</v>

35
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>This video chip in today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go put up last year,</v>

36
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>320 foot tiny cabin in big bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing Small House.</v>

37
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aw,</v>

38
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should do Jamie.</v>

39
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.350
<v Speaker 1>So simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should buy that place and turn it</v>

40
00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>into our big bear studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we should do to fucking</v>

41
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet the shows up there.</v>

42
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I bet if we did a show in big bear in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woods like that,</v>

43
00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it would have a totally different feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

44
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'd be hearing your guests</v>

45
00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 1>screaming in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being mauled by mountain lions,</v>

46
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>but if he did do a show up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck would you convince people</v>

47
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.770
<v Speaker 1>to drive two hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could we get there?</v>

48
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>People that are training up there or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

49
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they could pop over here like four</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

50
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Granada love getting Tito Ortiz occur</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day and then you'd be like,</v>

51
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:18.971
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

52
00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Hey Chuck Liddell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

53
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canelo's a pussy.</v>

54
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:27.091
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

55
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fantasy is that that becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a simple life.</v>

56
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 1>You pare down everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the aggravation you get.</v>

57
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe two bills come to the house will</v>
<v Speaker 1>go crazy.</v>

58
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.020
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be a problem.</v>

59
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 1>If it was just single Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no family,</v>

60
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 1>no kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be a problem.</v>

61
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I would just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I really probably think already I</v>

62
00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>would already have a place like that up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there where I could just go and chill.</v>

63
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just that I was thinking of just the</v>

64
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:56.500
<v Speaker 1>little place like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little hideout next to the house</v>

65
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>like Mark Twain had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he have a place that</v>

66
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.360
<v Speaker 2>little octagon kind of a room and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would leave his house with his daughters</v>

67
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 2>and his wife and he would go up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>steps and go into his little thing on</v>

68
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 2>this table was just his pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a box of cigars,</v>

69
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>his writing pads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his pens,</v>

70
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 2>and he just would hang out there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke all day and work and then he would</v>

71
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>go back home and maybe that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that cuts the edge off.</v>

72
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.370
<v Speaker 2>It gives you your isolation and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>simplicity and then you return back to</v>

73
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>the people you have to feed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little something that'll work.</v>

74
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 2>If you've got the people you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed.</v>

75
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have to feed straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woodsboro oh yeah.</v>

76
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Caught up path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

77
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be the real trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the kids leave,</v>

78
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 2>when they get big enough and they take</v>
<v Speaker 2>off and it's just Bam to you and your</v>

79
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the wife ones get like five</v>

80
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's probably like encouraging you to</v>

81
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 2>go get a cab and get another dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rescue a dog.</v>

82
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Let's adopt a kid.</v>

83
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 2>They want to keep you tethered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well tethered to little things.</v>

84
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>They're the nestor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

85
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 2>They were the nest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They if they,</v>

86
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>if the nest is empty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their job.</v>

87
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 2>They build that nest once everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted everyone in that nest safe and</v>

88
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're built to do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen women that have like</v>

89
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of dogs when you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 2>you want a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

91
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Like the towel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't have the time for a kid.</v>

92
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Like how much time are you spending on</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking dogs?</v>

93
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Like it's probably pretty close now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just me and my fluffy babies made</v>

94
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.460
<v Speaker 2>my mom and just fluffy babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it.</v>

95
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 2>But what is it about people that want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>further complicate their lives?</v>

96
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

97
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Why does everybody always want bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that just a part of the,</v>

98
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 2>the genes?</v>

99
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>

100
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.891
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

101
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I think a drive in us to always do more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explore more,</v>

102
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 2>push more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

103
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 2>There's something built into human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings that have that and then we have a</v>

104
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:59.340
<v Speaker 2>system that rewards that in capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the,</v>

105
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the board game that we're all</v>

106
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it keeps you racing to get more stuff</v>

107
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 2>in bigger house and more things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

108
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Like if there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that didn't exist,</v>

109
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 2>if you weren't able to accumulate that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

110
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 2>what would we be doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd still be striving but for other</v>

111
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is our reality.</v>

112
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it manifests itself in more cars.</v>

113
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 2>A bigger house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 2>they were optics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always trying to survive.</v>

115
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 2>But surviving is not that hard today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

116
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you try to instead,</v>

117
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 2>because it's not too complicated to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>find your food,</v>

118
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of puzzles and</v>

119
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 2>challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shelters taken care of.</v>

120
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 2>So you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

121
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I just need a new car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cars two years old,</v>

122
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.960
<v Speaker 2>28 miles on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving a car with 20</v>

123
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smells like farts.</v>

124
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

125
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>it makes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>you just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I think you do that long</v>

127
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to realize hopefully that that</v>

128
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 1>stuff doesn't really make you happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

129
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>it does to an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you get out of your poor days</v>

130
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 1>and you kinda like get above water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you help your family out and you get</v>

131
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:24.821
<v Speaker 1>some stuff you're proud of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you just are adding more stress</v>

132
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>because you're bigger bills and bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes and all this stuff.</v>

133
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 1>You've got to fill up it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually does the opposite.</v>

134
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It makes you more stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not as happy.</v>

135
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And then you got to kind of strike that</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>

136
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Carrey has been on this kick</v>

137
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>explaining that to people because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Jim Carey said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

139
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.070
<v Speaker 1>but basically his quote was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish everybody would get rich and</v>

140
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>famous and they would see that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what makes you happy.</v>

141
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 1>people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

143
00:06:58.191 --> 00:06:59.790
<v Speaker 1>if I was rich and famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

144
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>would be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish that everyone would get rich and</v>

146
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>famous so they'd realize that that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer.</v>

147
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he say is the answer he makes</v>

148
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>to make paintings shitting on people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking them.</v>

149
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>That seems to make you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that as art?</v>

150
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he paints.</v>

151
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the peace and love,</v>

152
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Bro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's aggressive.</v>

153
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Paintings are all like shitting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people mocking people.</v>

154
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Clearly assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's not like he's like</v>

155
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>trying to accentuate the love in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

156
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 1>He's just shitting all over these bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

157
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.660
<v Speaker 1>That makes them happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

159
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it good to focus on the bad people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like has anybody changed their opinion</v>

161
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>based on Jim Carey's art?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody know?</v>

162
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like a big jeff sessions fan right</v>
<v Speaker 1>till I saw these paintings and then with</v>

163
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:57.341
<v Speaker 1>Jim Carey's got him with a giant fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>wart covered dick holding it out in</v>

164
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jizzing all over the constitution.</v>

165
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.300
<v Speaker 1>This little Yoda head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always a question.</v>

168
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of art that rails against</v>

169
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>something is effective in changing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you're railing against?</v>

170
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Like does it actually have an impact?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a slow impact?</v>

171
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Does it change over time and pens in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>art?</v>

172
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>

173
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I think Tina fey legitimately changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people feel about Sarah Pailin.</v>

174
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.630
<v Speaker 1>I think she legitimately may have</v>
<v Speaker 1>affected the way people were willing to</v>

175
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:45.941
<v Speaker 1>accept Sarah Pailin or vote for because</v>
<v Speaker 1>her impression of her was so brilliant.</v>

176
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if people remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

177
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 1>It was so god damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looked exactly like it looked like</v>

178
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>her attitude and she said things people</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually</v>

179
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 3>attributed to Sarah Pailin because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that Sarah Pailin actually said</v>

180
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 3>it because Tina face at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She fucking nailed it.</v>

181
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so funny.</v>

182
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Her show a timmy Kimmy Schmidt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that show?</v>

183
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 3>Breakable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kimmy Schmidt.</v>

184
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorite show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>

185
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 3>It's Tina fey show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's in it.</v>

186
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes she plays the lead is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stick.</v>

187
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of here.</v>

188
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're right now the audio folks.</v>

189
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at an image of Tina Fey as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Pailin right next to Sarah Pailin</v>

190
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 3>and it's fucking indistinguishable</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>

191
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 3>It's so good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but did she.</v>

192
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Do you think she affected people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>already liked Sarah Pailin?</v>

193
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you like Sarah Palin,</v>

194
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're out of your fucking mind.</v>

195
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Those people like Sarah Palin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were out of their fucking minds.</v>

196
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're basically working with a less</v>

197
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 3>than functional brain.</v>

198
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 3>You thought that that was a good idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that lady could be running things</v>

199
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 3>like that close to being president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a construct to,</v>

200
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was an entertainer,</v>

201
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 3>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

202
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 3>but I mean Sarah Palin was a construct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't what everybody thought.</v>

203
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:08.960
<v Speaker 3>She was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like,</v>

204
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 3>there was one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a story.</v>

205
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 3>I am not hundred percent sure this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

206
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 3>but it makes sense that someone shot a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caribou and then they drove her to the</v>

207
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Caribou that gave her the rifle and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>stood over the Caribou and took photos</v>

208
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 3>so that they could show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

209
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 3>she's a hunter like us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>US regular folk out here hunting</v>

210
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out if that's true.</v>

211
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Just a public relations kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to,</v>

212
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 3>we need a google plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believe it,</v>

213
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

214
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

215
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way all that stuff is due,</v>

216
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.690
<v Speaker 3>I believe because I want to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My announceable.</v>

217
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe she just,</v>

218
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.550
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say you're an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a good woman.</v>

219
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey look,</v>

220
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 3>she was the governor of Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easy.</v>

221
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I can be the government lab for two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had showbiz.</v>

222
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Caribou after missing five times</v>

223
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 3>showing shooting Caribou on the latest</v>
<v Speaker 3>episode of a Reality Television show.</v>

224
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.643
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

225
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 3>What's amazing is how that she really</v>
<v Speaker 3>fell off.</v>

226
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

227
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 3>she's just shooting it freehand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't have a rest.</v>

228
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.953
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

229
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you do that?</v>

230
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.103
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see.</v>

231
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Show this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see how she does it.</v>

232
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fucking stupid.</v>

233
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Listen folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only reason to do this,</v>

234
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.810
<v Speaker 3>does she have a rest shut?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's free handing this.</v>

235
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.090
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

236
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got The packs on it and now she's going</v>

237
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 3>to rest it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm?</v>

238
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.560
<v Speaker 3>They said a tiny little Caribou to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>

239
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 3>That's why the Caribou is still around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just firing.</v>

240
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a juvenile Caribou and she hasn't</v>

241
00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 3>shot yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what we got.</v>

242
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.640
<v Speaker 3>And she has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

243
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.100
<v Speaker 3>went down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She took some shots.</v>

244
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she took.</v>

245
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Took some shots and missed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

246
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 3>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she freehanded at first and then she</v>

247
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 3>needed a rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She should have used arrest immediately</v>

248
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 3>and I've have shot animals freehanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not never far away.</v>

249
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I shot a moose at 60 yards free trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a free hand in it because you're not as</v>

250
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:07.864
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>

251
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 3>W with a bow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

252
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 3>a bose more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

253
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 3>a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a more accurate with a bow at like 60,</v>

254
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 3>70 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freehand.</v>

255
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 3>Not more accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the range that I am with a rifle</v>

256
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 3>with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get out you could shoot</v>

257
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 3>accurately on arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like way out longer distances.</v>

258
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 3>But when you're just holding it up like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

259
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 3>it's based on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've got to kind of lock it</v>

260
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:36.090
<v Speaker 3>into your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to but isn't a bucket</v>

261
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.190
<v Speaker 3>steady now bought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is about the tension of the</v>

262
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 3>bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your arm is kind of locked out in the</v>

263
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 3>tension of the bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could keep your arm pretty fucking</v>

264
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:48.140
<v Speaker 3>steady and I practice it everyday like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

265
00:12:48.141 --> 00:12:51.180
<v Speaker 3>So practicing keeping my arm very steady</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>

266
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.100
<v Speaker 3>So all these stabilizer muscles in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder are very strong.</v>

267
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 3>And having a gun out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like let's just a little so</v>

268
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 3>and also the recoil if you're not used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shooting and it doesn't look like</v>

269
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:02.100
<v Speaker 3>she's used to shooting the.</v>

270
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.970
<v Speaker 3>She didn't immediately go for the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a seasoned hunter would have either</v>

271
00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:11.971
<v Speaker 3>lane prone or throw their pack down</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately put that rifle over it and</v>

272
00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:14.770
<v Speaker 3>settle in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So rifles resting on something.</v>

273
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

274
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.010
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of times they'll bring like</v>
<v Speaker 3>sticks but they pod fail somewhere</v>

275
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.710
<v Speaker 3>making a reality show for Tlc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>

276
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 3>But what I've read though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was a photo shoot,</v>

277
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:28.660
<v Speaker 3>they did see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you can find this fake.</v>

278
00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that the thing is fake?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they just put a circle around them,</v>

279
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 3>but that's just for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the filming.</v>

280
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.660
<v Speaker 3>The caribou definitely went down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

281
00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:41.140
<v Speaker 3>But I mean I don't think she shot it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it went down.</v>

282
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it's most likely she shot it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it went down because you see the way</v>

283
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 3>she's reacting and everybody else's</v>
<v Speaker 3>reacting.</v>

284
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.430
<v Speaker 3>That seems pretty real to me.</v>

285
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not impossible.</v>

286
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Shoot an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially that's a juvenile Caribou,</v>

287
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.850
<v Speaker 3>that she how old their antlers are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

288
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

289
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.330
<v Speaker 3>This is what you would call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if that was an elk,</v>

290
00:13:58.331 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 3>you'd call that a spike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey look,</v>

291
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:01.860
<v Speaker 3>it's people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking about the production</v>

292
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's one camera on her and then</v>

293
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.990
<v Speaker 3>there's one behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that means that,</v>

294
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 3>that then have a third that's focused</v>
<v Speaker 3>just on the animal and that means</v>

295
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 3>there's three camera guys out there with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

296
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:14.480
<v Speaker 3>That's just sounds like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

297
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.760
<v Speaker 3>And the camera is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

298
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

299
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:21.220
<v Speaker 3>They might have recreated the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bomb.</v>

300
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.660
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

301
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.370
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what man?</v>

302
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 3>The reality is whenever you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with air quote reality shows,</v>

303
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.310
<v Speaker 3>there's massive fuckery involved and</v>
<v Speaker 3>editing and please,</v>

304
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.390
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to whether you could affect it,</v>

305
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 3>whether or not the art can affect what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think.</v>

306
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

307
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 3>what trump did during the election,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he like calling people out and mocking</v>

308
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:48.540
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really thinks that art it,</v>

309
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 3>that's not her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was kind of like a,</v>

310
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>like a long island</v>

311
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.050
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a insult comic,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was just like going after these guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm picking the biggest stadium in</v>

332
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.140
<v Speaker 1>texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>capital e.</v>
<v Speaker 1>his opponent is a disaster for Texas</v>

<v Speaker 1>borders,</v>

337
00:15:58.821 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 1>military and vets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

338
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an article yesterday showing</v>

339
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.040
<v Speaker 1>all the Times that trump has been lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stunning.</v>

340
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>But one of the more recent ones was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

341
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did,</v>

342
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:16.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interview where he was talking about</v>

343
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.670
<v Speaker 1>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lester Holt,</v>

344
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Lester Holt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

345
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.510
<v Speaker 1>It was Lester Holt and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that they fudged that</v>

346
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>interview and it costs them badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then they played the transcript.</v>

347
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.390
<v Speaker 1>They wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they showed the transcript of the</v>

348
00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They released the full interview.</v>

349
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no fudging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

350
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 1>It just played it as is.</v>

351
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.720
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

352
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

353
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:39.810
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that he's.</v>

354
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.710
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you saw is not real.</v>

355
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.840
<v Speaker 1>The truth is not the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

356
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:46.320
<v Speaker 1>that was what Giuliani said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

357
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 1>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what.</v>

358
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:50.210
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's real.</v>

359
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Except what I tell you his real well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that they've realized that</v>

360
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:57.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain percentage of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are with them that just need</v>

361
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 1>some wiggle room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just need somewhere or argue they</v>

362
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 1>just need some consideracy threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not thinkers.</v>

363
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.730
<v Speaker 1>They just need a little bit of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they could run with and use to</v>

364
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if comedians come out and attack</v>

365
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:13.850
<v Speaker 1>trump and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's comics that are,</v>

366
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher and all these people that</v>

367
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:18.230
<v Speaker 1>come out and really go against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it have any effect?</v>

368
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It has an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does for sure.</v>

369
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I think Alec Baldwin has the most effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

370
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>that impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't impression of him.</v>

371
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 1>That oppression is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

372
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>makes trump angry to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps shitting on him.</v>

373
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 1>He keeps watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't stop watching it.</v>

374
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.110
<v Speaker 1>That alone has an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

375
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've never seen a time where</v>

376
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 1>people are more angry at the press and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

377
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the deep state trying to take out the</v>

<v Speaker 1>lady from the handmaid's tale when deep</v>

436
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.070
<v Speaker 1>trouble and he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare for pence.</v>

437
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Fucking religious nut over the top won't</v>

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I just saw him on Jay Leno's show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems like a reasonable car.</v>

440
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It looks very presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Seems kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems like he respects.</v>

444
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a nutty Mormon for sure.</v>

445
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.720
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because all Mormons are nutty.</v>

446
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:35.560
<v Speaker 1>More than just being a mormons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nutty.</v>

447
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.750

<v Speaker 1>rebranded.</v>

449
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Calling them a mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like calling a small person.</v>

522
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.390
<v Speaker 3>puts in his mouth and then comes back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me like he's retrieving something.</v>

00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:57.550
<v Speaker 3>in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fill my ass,</v>

582
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 3>my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Happy Labor Day.</v>

583
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.630
<v Speaker 3>But I thought when you got hit by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rambler,</v>

584
00:27:03.631 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to like not move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you got to get out of there.</v>

585
00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:08.070
<v Speaker 3>You've got to get to medical attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to go.</v>

586
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.960
<v Speaker 3>What it does is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

587
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.900
<v Speaker 3>you can't suck the venom out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what people think.</v>

588
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:13.831
<v Speaker 3>People Think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

589
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 3>you just cut it and suck the venom out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what rattlesnake venom does.</v>

590
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 3>What it does is it digests your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it digest your flesh.</v>

591
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:23.650
<v Speaker 3>The venom does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

592
00:27:23.651 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 3>it causes necrosis.</v>

593
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:30.260
<v Speaker 3>So would it would essentially is doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is digesting you with venom and this is</v>

594
00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 3>the way they kill rabbits and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the eat and swallow.</v>

595
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 3>They bite them and then they kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does Venom and it starts to digest the</v>

596
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:45.231
<v Speaker 3>flesh and then they swallow it whole and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it aids in their processing of this</v>

597
00:27:45.241 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 3>animal who.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

598
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.040
<v Speaker 3>So the snake hits a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

599
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 3>If he were to take his mouth off after</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes,</v>

600
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 3>would it have been partially digested?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>

601
00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 3>That literally starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts digesting.</v>

602
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts,</v>

603
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.960
<v Speaker 3>it starts decomposing and digesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you get bit by a Rattlesnake,</v>

604
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.590
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you need massive skin</v>
<v Speaker 3>grafts and um,</v>

605
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.540
<v Speaker 3>you have massive tissue loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And necrosis is one guy documented.</v>

606
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.970
<v Speaker 3>He got bit on the arm and they had a med</v>
<v Speaker 3>vac amount and the helicopter.</v>

607
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.970
<v Speaker 3>And then he had to go through a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>series of operations to repair his arm.</v>

608
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.580
<v Speaker 3>She's like Mesh and skin grafts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all these different things and it</v>

609
00:28:30.581 --> 00:28:34.500
<v Speaker 3>still was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like years later his arm is fucked up so</v>

610
00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:36.540
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get medical attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you die?</v>

611
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

612
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.350
<v Speaker 3>It would just spread through organs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't exactly know you.</v>

613
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 3>You might survive a rattlesnake bite if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get medical attention if</v>

614
00:28:47.401 --> 00:28:51.240
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't the most amount of venom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real scary thing as young ones.</v>

615
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Young young rattle snakes just empty out</v>
<v Speaker 3>on you.</v>

616
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Just like young boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know first like,</v>

617
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's all this coming from?</v>

618
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Even storing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know how to control it.</v>

619
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.220
<v Speaker 3>The that's how it is with the older one</v>
<v Speaker 3>trap.</v>

620
00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.860
<v Speaker 3>Like 80 year old man.</v>

621
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever know the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between like an 18 year old fella</v>

622
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:24.830
<v Speaker 3>shooting arc as Bill Hicks would say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arking ropes of Judaism versus a</v>

623
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.870
<v Speaker 3>rattlesnake that's like thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a fucking.</v>

624
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:29.380
<v Speaker 3>Like a tree trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

625
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.840
<v Speaker 3>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran over one month.</v>

626
00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:32.880
<v Speaker 3>This was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was running with my,</v>

627
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 3>not the last dogs that are deceased,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my dogs before that,</v>

628
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:43.580
<v Speaker 3>when I used to have pit bulls and we ran</v>
<v Speaker 3>over what I thought was a a large stick</v>

629
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.500
<v Speaker 3>in the road and the trail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as I'm running over it in the air,</v>

630
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.850
<v Speaker 3>I realize it is a giant rattlesnake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

631
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.100
<v Speaker 3>thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As my former.</v>

632
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was huge.</v>

633
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 3>Seven feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just in the middle of the trail,</v>

634
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 3>just completely stretched out like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick.</v>

635
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sunning itself and the dogs ran</v>

636
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 3>right over it and it didn't strike you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just know.</v>

637
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 3>The dog's luckily listened to me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't aware that it was,</v>

638
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.390
<v Speaker 3>but those dogs were crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those dogs had been bitten three times.</v>

639
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My dogs have been bitten three times by</v>

640
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:20.710
<v Speaker 3>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they knew they just killed the</v>

641
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:21.850
<v Speaker 3>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't give a fuck.</v>

642
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Pitfalls are so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the craziest dogs.</v>

643
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.080
<v Speaker 3>They're so hard wired for combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the rattle snake was in the paper.</v>

644
00:30:31.381 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck</v>

645
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:39.670
<v Speaker 3>that killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even worry for a second that</v>

646
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:42.350
<v Speaker 3>he got bit in the face at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got hit,</v>

647
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 3>bitten the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got bitten.</v>

648
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.830
<v Speaker 3>The face of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Frank Sinatra.</v>

649
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Is there a name that time he named the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs.</v>

650
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.940
<v Speaker 3>The craziest dog I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A dog killed everything he could.</v>

651
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 3>His main game was I leave him in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>yard and he tried to kill lizards,</v>

652
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.033
<v Speaker 3>his main games.</v>

653
00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like a video game who just walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the yard,</v>

654
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.440
<v Speaker 3>stomping on the grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for lizards,</v>

655
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 3>dive on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

656
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 3>it was like a game to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to find lizards to kill.</v>

657
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.710
<v Speaker 3>How was he with people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was wonderful with people.</v>

658
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Was a sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet.</v>

659
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Never strike out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go after a person.</v>

660
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.101
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

661
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 3>He never been a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

662
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 3>He was a little aggressive with his like</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to play and it will freak</v>

663
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 3>people out because he would like to play</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pull ropes with you.</v>

664
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Like he'd want to grab a rope and bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to you and have you pull on it and he</v>

665
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:26.670
<v Speaker 3>would make these horrific noises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'd.</v>

666
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.740
<v Speaker 3>You'd be pulling it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people were like,</v>

667
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

668
00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:35.230
<v Speaker 3>he's just playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a sweet dog.</v>

669
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give him a cruise with quantum,</v>

670
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:38.090
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

671
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.330
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

672
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

673
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Crazy kisses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was so.</v>

674
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 3>They get a bad rap though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They deserve it.</v>

675
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 3>They deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They deserve it.</v>

676
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.190
<v Speaker 3>They deserve because you don't know if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just walking down the street and</v>

677
00:31:48.191 --> 00:31:51.640
<v Speaker 3>you see a pit bull off leash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People should be cautious.</v>

678
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.390
<v Speaker 3>People don't want to hear that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they love their dog.</v>

679
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.850
<v Speaker 3>My dog is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't say that they are bred to fight.</v>

680
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're bred for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where they came from.</v>

681
00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:01.190
<v Speaker 3>That's where the breed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

682
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 3>No bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why there's such great dogs</v>

683
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 3>is because they're bred the good ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least to have no aggression</v>

684
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:11.710
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever towards people so that when</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dogs are fighting,</v>

685
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.520
<v Speaker 3>they could go in and separate them with</v>
<v Speaker 3>no fear of the dogs turning on the.</v>

686
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.660
<v Speaker 3>On the owner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting where they do this.</v>

687
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

688
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.560
<v Speaker 3>but America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

689
00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.170
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

690
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 3>American pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's called.</v>

691
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.270
<v Speaker 3>American pit bull terrier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the Michael Vick thing</v>

692
00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:29.490
<v Speaker 3>was all about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

693
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.540
<v Speaker 3>There's a been around for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

694
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been over 100 years or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple hundred years,</v>

695
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.230
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

696
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 3>that was originally going to be our</v>
<v Speaker 3>national animal before they went with</v>

697
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:43.790
<v Speaker 3>the Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben Franklin sell the Eagle.</v>

698
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even notice the idea.</v>

699
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 3>It was who wanted the pitbull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

700
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean they use it as war dogs when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>use them in,</v>

701
00:32:51.631 --> 00:32:53.690
<v Speaker 3>in the army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would have been a cool symbol?</v>

702
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know the,</v>

703
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:59.840
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with those dogs is multifold</v>

704
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.840
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a very high prey drive.</v>

705
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.910
<v Speaker 3>Like they're their drive to attack</v>
<v Speaker 3>things is very high and the more they're</v>

706
00:33:07.911 --> 00:33:09.980
<v Speaker 3>bred for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better.</v>

707
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 3>The more intelligent they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more intense they are and people</v>

708
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 3>love them because of their intensity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>their intelligence and their loyalty</v>

709
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Speaker 3>towards their owners is outrageous so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that love is deep.</v>

710
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:21.990
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the pimple people,</v>

711
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 3>because they really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say anything,</v>

712
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:27.520
<v Speaker 3>do they get really up in arms about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

713
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:31.610
<v Speaker 3>they don't want them to have a bad rap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I love those dogs.</v>

714
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of my dogs killed one of my</v>

715
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:35.870
<v Speaker 3>other dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

716
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

717
00:33:37.311 --> 00:33:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have two female pit bulls.</v>

718
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.880
<v Speaker 3>You can't have that two females.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll just go and just.</v>

719
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.970
<v Speaker 3>They never sorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never decide who the bosses.</v>

720
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.730
<v Speaker 3>They decided that they start off like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

721
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:54.230
<v Speaker 3>they'll figure they'll have a fight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then one will win and then you say,</v>

722
00:33:54.231 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well in normal situation this one</v>

723
00:33:56.811 --> 00:34:01.260
<v Speaker 3>realizes that it's the Alpha and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other one will back off and no</v>

724
00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.470
<v Speaker 3>fucking way that with girls they won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit.</v>

725
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Girls never quit to go back to it.</v>

726
00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.730
<v Speaker 3>What if one of them was hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marshall?</v>

727
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be fine.</v>

728
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.780
<v Speaker 3>That'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was fine with my male dogs.</v>

729
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a female dog.</v>

730
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 3>She wanted other females around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was not fine with my mails.</v>

731
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:19.070
<v Speaker 3>If the mail was getting attention and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't,</v>

732
00:34:19.071 --> 00:34:22.670
<v Speaker 3>she would get angry like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're stealing my attention as well.</v>

733
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:25.250
<v Speaker 3>She was a prison dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>

734
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 3>She was in the lab animal shelter for</v>
<v Speaker 3>many months.</v>

735
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.880
<v Speaker 3>When I got to Brian Collins wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to me and again,</v>

736
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:31.371

<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

738
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:34.070
<v Speaker 3>I can't get her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My yards too small.</v>

739
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog is so amazing.</v>

740
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.950

<v Speaker 3>And I went to see her and she was the</v>

741
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:41.951
<v Speaker 3>sweetest dog to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it a puppy still or still got her?</v>

742
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's still a puppy,</v>

743
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.900
<v Speaker 3>but she was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just fucking dangerous</v>

744
00:34:47.901 --> 00:34:48.800
<v Speaker 3>around dogs.</v>

745
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My sister had a uh,</v>

746
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.520
<v Speaker 3>a bull mastiff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

747
00:34:52.521 --> 00:34:54.170
<v Speaker 3>those are great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Dogs.</v>

748
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.430
<v Speaker 3>That's so kind to people's like loving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you put them with children.</v>

749
00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a big dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's head as like our heads combined,</v>

750
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.690
<v Speaker 3>but other dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other small dogs really it was bred for</v>

751
00:35:05.691 --> 00:35:10.610
<v Speaker 3>that and it would go and just any dog on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a leash with an old lady attached did</v>

752
00:35:10.611 --> 00:35:13.010
<v Speaker 3>not care and just pin it to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

753
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:15.020
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you just couldn't get it out.</v>

754
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean that just in the breed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a dog that was a massive that just</v>

755
00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:22.820
<v Speaker 3>died and I just had him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is Johnny Cash.</v>

756
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.890
<v Speaker 3>We just had to put them down when walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

757
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.870
<v Speaker 3>He was 13 and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the saddest moment.</v>

758
00:35:29.871 --> 00:35:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Like the last week of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marshall was in the pool and he was</v>

759
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 3>jumping around and playing with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>daughters.</v>

760
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's having a good time and Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to come to the pool but he</v>

761
00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 3>couldn't walk over there and so he</v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

762
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.930
<v Speaker 3>It would take a couple steps and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>be panting and his legs would be shaken</v>

763
00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.930
<v Speaker 3>and cable take a couple steps and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>panting and his legs shake and he was</v>

764
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:53.530
<v Speaker 3>just in agony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I picked him up all 140 pounds of</v>

765
00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 3>tons of big dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I run man,</v>

766
00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:00.690
<v Speaker 3>I start coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran this morning and then for the rest</v>

767
00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:02.820
<v Speaker 3>of the day I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I try to talk,</v>

768
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 3>I got like your throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

769
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 3>it's the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm breathing in dust and pollen and I'm</v>

770
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Speaker 3>in the bottom of these canyons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running through all this shit and the</v>

771
00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:16.701
<v Speaker 3>dogs in front of me kicking up dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Iran on the concrete today and I'm</v>

772
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 3>making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point is I carried them so I had to</v>

773
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:25.320
<v Speaker 3>carry them over to the pool and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sat down there and he just laid down</v>

774
00:36:25.321 --> 00:36:27.050
<v Speaker 3>there and he was smiling and pants.</v>

775
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.960
<v Speaker 3>He was totally deaf by the time he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like completely deaf.</v>

776
00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Acute would be lying there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

777
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hungry?</v>

778
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Johnny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he touched me like,</v>

779
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:36.780
<v Speaker 3>well where'd you come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

780
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Bummer about big dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They die so well.</v>

781
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.960
<v Speaker 3>13 is not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

782
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.030
<v Speaker 3>They actually died at like nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

783
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:46.200
<v Speaker 3>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're ready to go.</v>

784
00:36:46.201 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 3>And what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can't.</v>

785
00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.190
<v Speaker 3>My dog's about 80 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

786
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.560

<v Speaker 3>you fall deeply in love with it and then</v>

<v Speaker 3>seven years.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

791
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.280
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

795
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.990
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks ago.</v>

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

798
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.630
<v Speaker 3>it was rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is rough,</v>

799
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 3>but it was really hard seeing him</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffer.</v>

800
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Like when I try to bring them in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

801
00:37:21.191 --> 00:37:25.680
<v Speaker 3>the last year was rough in the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of months it was,</v>

802
00:37:25.681 --> 00:37:27.190
<v Speaker 3>when do we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

803
00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 3>when do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when do we put them down because I don't</v>

804
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:33.390
<v Speaker 3>want to come home and find him dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for a year we knew he was kind of a</v>

805
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.390
<v Speaker 3>slow deterioration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like couldn't walk him anymore.</v>

806
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.270
<v Speaker 3>That was about two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two years ago.</v>

807
00:37:39.271 --> 00:37:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't walk them because where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live is a lot of hills.</v>

808
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.180
<v Speaker 3>You just couldn't do the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would just take a few steps and have</v>

809
00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:47.850
<v Speaker 3>to breathe heavy and they take a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>steps and have to breathe heavy.</v>

812
00:37:50.671 --> 00:37:52.230
<v Speaker 3>long as he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sweet dog,</v>

815
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:03.000

<v Speaker 3>over to them and you could take the</v>

816

<v Speaker 3>steak from Louisville who would never</v>
<v Speaker 3>growl at you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>When I.</v>

824
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.270
<v Speaker 3>When Marshall comes out of the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pulled a towel.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's like massage time.</v>

833
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 1>What about all the hair and the pool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

834

837
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 1>looks like algae growing on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nasty hair.</v>

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 1>It's on your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wash them off afterwards on down.</v>

850
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Why would you worry about the dog and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yourself?</v>

851
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only worry about myself and not the</v>

852
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:36.360
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you get a salt water thing for</v>

853
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.760
<v Speaker 1>your pool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

854
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole rigmarole room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

855
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:43.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know.</v>

856
00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I got him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on other projects.</v>

857
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just one of those guys that</v>

858
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:49.730
<v Speaker 1>dismisses important things in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

859
00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just that in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I get high,</v>

860
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I think about it incessantly had fucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my head.</v>

861
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happens to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

862
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

863
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:02.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get high and then you realize,</v>

864
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.900
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been thinking about this at</v>

865
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:06.190
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're high it's the only</v>

866
00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:07.060
<v Speaker 1>thing you're thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

867
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:07.894
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

868
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.913
<v Speaker 1>Things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

869
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have been thinking about like a</v>

870
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.080
<v Speaker 1>year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sprinkler.</v>

871
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.330
<v Speaker 1>How much is that leaking water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much water is at league and what</v>

872
00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 1>have we run out of water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I have to think about all the</v>

873
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 1>sprinklers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brokenness.</v>

874
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I should just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with me?</v>

875
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I just make that goal to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>that call me out lately?</v>

876
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I can keep up.</v>

877
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at this point,</v>

878
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 1>do you have a number that you try and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay below in your inbox?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

928
00:42:34.081 --> 00:42:35.490
<v Speaker 2>they do work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

929
00:42:35.491 --> 00:42:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not coughing unless I'm talking when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking.</v>

930
00:42:38.281 --> 00:42:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I just feel that in the back of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>throat.</v>

931
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.910
<v Speaker 2>It's right at it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like two hours after running.</v>

932
00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

933
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Up Up to two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you that it sort of goes away.</v>

934
00:42:49.591 --> 00:42:52.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like my body to run with one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those masks that they wear at the</v>

935
00:42:52.471 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 2>airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was,</v>

936
00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.540
<v Speaker 2>it's here anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

937
00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.553
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be all right.</v>

938
00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Let me try this coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some coffee.</v>

939
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that helps.</v>

940
00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Coffee generates phlegm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

941
00:43:04.201 --> 00:43:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I saw an article this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get your thoughts on it.</v>

942
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

943
00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I was reading about a that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about putting a video gaming in</v>

944
00:43:14.521 --> 00:43:17.640
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

945
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.570
<v Speaker 2>And the way they were talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

946
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.020
<v Speaker 2>this is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be in the Olympics.</v>

947
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.260
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

948
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.390
<v Speaker 2>kids consider themselves athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only hangup that they had on it was</v>

949
00:43:27.391 --> 00:43:31.020
<v Speaker 2>it the video games are violent and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to promote that.</v>

950
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 2>But to me it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

951
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.460
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this really a sport?</v>

952
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.060
<v Speaker 2>This is the Olympics trying to cash in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all that is.</v>

953
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

954
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:42.360
<v Speaker 3>it Olympics are dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a dirty business.</v>

955
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:47.570
<v Speaker 3>And this was highlighted by the movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ikaros saw that movie and you realize</v>

956
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.550
<v Speaker 3>how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the IOC is in bed with the world</v>

957
00:43:53.551 --> 00:43:57.030
<v Speaker 3>antidoping agency and how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

958
00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:02.220
<v Speaker 3>how they sort of functioned together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what it really is all about is</v>

959
00:44:02.221 --> 00:44:05.670
<v Speaker 3>making money and anything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>compromises that making money,</v>

960
00:44:05.671 --> 00:44:07.890
<v Speaker 3>they're going to vote against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

961
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.860
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a dirty business.</v>

962
00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:15.360
<v Speaker 3>And if they did have it in the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they would basically do is take</v>

963
00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:18.480
<v Speaker 3>these guys who were making millions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars playing video games</v>

964
00:44:18.481 --> 00:44:19.890
<v Speaker 3>at a professional level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

965
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.340
<v Speaker 3>And millions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would make them work for free and</v>

966
00:44:23.341 --> 00:44:25.170
<v Speaker 3>then they would make all the millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars.</v>

967
00:44:25.171 --> 00:44:26.030
<v Speaker 3>But it's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

968
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.190
<v Speaker 3>You get to be in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dirty business.</v>

969
00:44:29.191 --> 00:44:30.630
<v Speaker 3>I think the Olympics are dirty.</v>

970
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.440
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

971
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Well his chest in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

972
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Why been took wrestling out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But chassis.</v>

973
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:40.450
<v Speaker 1>We're actually moving pieces around</v>
<v Speaker 1>video games.</v>

974
00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Just icons on a screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

975
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:43.651
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

976
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:45.550
<v Speaker 1>They took wrestling out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took wrestling.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

980
00:44:49.751 --> 00:44:51.330
<v Speaker 1>They did know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

981
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I love wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they took it out.</v>

982
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 1>They might have brought it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was gone,</v>

983
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.243
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

984
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.680
<v Speaker 1>No know wrestling's not out of the 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

985
00:44:58.681 --> 00:45:01.860
<v Speaker 1>They took it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no wrestling in the summer</v>

986
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

987

<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>

988
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

989
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

990
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't I never heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there were.</v>

991
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 1>There was at one point in time they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it,</v>

992
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 1>but I thought that thought it was put</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in.</v>

993
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.820
<v Speaker 1>It was the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was out for at least one and 2013 ioc</v>

994
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 1>voted to drop wrestling from the summer</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympic program.</v>

995
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Effective 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

996
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

997
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's happened yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's supposed to be for 20,</v>

998
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's.</v>

999
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was in the Olympics</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the summer.</v>

1000
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.850
<v Speaker 1>It was not 21 yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

1004

<v Speaker 1>but it's a very highly skilled game.</v>

1043
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's definitely something</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable like the.</v>

1044
00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>He used to be thought as a frivolous</v>
<v Speaker 1>waste</v>

1045
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 3>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now you can make legitimate money</v>

1046
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:34.080
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't.</v>

1047
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:36.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you classify it as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>

1048
00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean they call it east sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they an athlete?</v>

1049
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it is the top Gamer and athlete?</v>

1050
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 3>The only caveat is that it's hand eye</v>
<v Speaker 3>coordination right there.</v>

1051
00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:51.160
<v Speaker 3>His hand eye coordination and what do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you consider a sport?</v>

1052
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 3>Do you consider something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You move your entire body or it's just</v>

1053
00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:58.240
<v Speaker 3>moving your fingers enough because his</v>
<v Speaker 3>pool of sport.</v>

1054
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Billiards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that sport?</v>

1055
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's A.</v>

1056
00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a game that requires hand,</v>

1057
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:08.860
<v Speaker 3>eye coordination and control and touch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tennis is a sport,</v>

1058
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:10.503
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Tennis requires full ankle being full</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental being.</v>

1060
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:15.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

1061
00:48:15.511 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 3>You're running around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're jumping back and forth,</v>

1062
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:20.390
<v Speaker 3>you're swatting that ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're shooting at you.</v>

1063
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:23.080
<v Speaker 3>Trying to get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the the amount of endurance you</v>

1064
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:26.500
<v Speaker 3>have and stamina and explosiveness all</v>
<v Speaker 3>contributes to your game.</v>

1065
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Would you make an exception for someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really good at Cubert?</v>

1066
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my favorite subway surfers in</v>

1067
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.210
<v Speaker 3>subway surfers and my daughter plays</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>

1068
00:48:37.211 --> 00:48:38.044
<v Speaker 3>She's a little wizard.</v>

1069
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a sport.</v>

1070
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:46.000
<v Speaker 3>The only one in the Olympics because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they realize there's massive amounts of</v>

1071
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 3>people that are watching it and playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them now and they could make a lot of</v>

1072
00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:50.190
<v Speaker 3>money in arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>

1073
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.080
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're filling arenas in Olympics.</v>

1074
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 3>The live part of it is a billion dollar</v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

1075
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of sports that are</v>

1076
00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:01.810
<v Speaker 3>in the Olympics had no one gives a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>about if they're not in the Olympics.</v>

1077
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:02.651
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1078
00:49:02.651 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that curling,</v>

1079
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 3>curling the ski shoot one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The skeet shooting one with a call that</v>

1080
00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:10.920
<v Speaker 3>full on or pentathlon or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1081
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.840
<v Speaker 3>there's the one that Bruce Jenner one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which one was that?</v>

1082
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.310
<v Speaker 3>That's the decathlon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he have to shoot shit now?</v>

1083
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.360
<v Speaker 3>Throw a spear or something now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did the Javelin javelins part.</v>

1084
00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Technically a spear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but okay.</v>

1085
00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Is archery archery's in the Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.530
<v Speaker 3>Is that a sport?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1087
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 3>that's more of a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1088
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.140
<v Speaker 3>You're using your full body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well not really.</v>

1089
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean you are for stability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're stabilizing with your legs and</v>

1090
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:44.410
<v Speaker 3>you have a certain stance and if your</v>
<v Speaker 3>bows heavy to pull back then it requires</v>

1091
00:49:44.411 --> 00:49:46.810
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a,</v>

1092
00:49:46.811 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 3>that's blurring the lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the scent.</v>

1093
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:51.760
<v Speaker 3>I think archery is essentially a martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>art with a tool,</v>

1094
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're demonstrating but you</v>

1095
00:49:54.311 --> 00:49:56.530
<v Speaker 3>could do it on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's target archery,</v>

1096
00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.160
<v Speaker 3>target shooting in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1097
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.710
<v Speaker 3>as part of skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1098
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:06.220
<v Speaker 3>And I think they do both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it in summary reaction girl that</v>

1099
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:08.160
<v Speaker 3>was just targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1100
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Just shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1101
00:50:09.671 --> 00:50:11.170
<v Speaker 3>That girl you were telling me about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 3>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's close to a video game.</v>

1103
00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1104
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.310
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Video Games are.</v>

1105
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe,</v>

1106
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 3>but like we were showing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>showing that Sarah Palin thing,</v>

1107
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:24.110
<v Speaker 3>which she was trying to shoot offhand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally hot,</v>

1108
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.700
<v Speaker 3>holding the gun up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's um,</v>

1109
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more of a sport if you try to</v>

1110
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 3>shoot offhand or pistol shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say like pistol shooting would</v>

1111
00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:38.030
<v Speaker 3>definitely be a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they do those courses,</v>

1112
00:50:38.031 --> 00:50:40.360
<v Speaker 3>you ever seen those courses that they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>for training?</v>

1113
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Ready Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Light goes off and then you run through</v>

1114
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:44.970
<v Speaker 3>a door and then you turn a corner and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tight,</v>

1115
00:50:44.971 --> 00:50:45.410
<v Speaker 3>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tight,</v>

1116
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:49.490
<v Speaker 3>and then you die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some are bad guys and some are good</v>

1117
00:50:49.491 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a bunch of different</v>

1118
00:50:52.311 --> 00:50:55.130
<v Speaker 3>ones they do and some of them are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>targets and some of them are targets</v>

1119
00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 3>that are dressed up like people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1120
00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more of a sport.</v>

1121
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a very physically demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you ever seen the candle reeves</v>

1122
00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:03.820
<v Speaker 3>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's training for John Wick two.</v>

1123
00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Now please God make John Wick three</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff with them running through times</v>

1124

<v Speaker 3>square on a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting people in the head in John Wick</v>

1125
00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're already doing it,</v>

1126
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just show the footage.</v>

1127
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the training footage for John Wick.</v>

1128
00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.390
<v Speaker 3>John Wick two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1129
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:21.790
<v Speaker 3>that mother Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keanu Reeves,</v>

1130
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 3>he gets into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was training with my friend.</v>

1131
00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:28.841
<v Speaker 3>He can Machado in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they do rubato no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>

1133
00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:32.763
<v Speaker 3>Give me some volume.</v>

1134
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:39.410
<v Speaker 3>So like when you watch him shoot in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

1135
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.010
<v Speaker 3>he looks very comfortable shooting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>even his martial arts,</v>

1136
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 3>like the stuff that he's doing in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

1137
00:51:45.021 --> 00:51:46.510
<v Speaker 3>it's legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

1138
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:48.320
<v Speaker 3>it's doable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

1139
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:50.780
<v Speaker 3>He's really training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1140
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's not doing anything where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd go get the,</v>

1141
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:56.990
<v Speaker 3>like there's no road house moves like</v>
<v Speaker 3>house last night.</v>

1142
00:51:56.991 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 3>I love roadhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got home from the comedy store last</v>

1143
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.110
<v Speaker 3>night and it was going to go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but roadhouse was on like,</v>

1144
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.220
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm standing up.</v>

1145
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 3>I stayed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the best gun in the bar.</v>

1146
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.820
<v Speaker 3>I watched it an hour and a half in until</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed the guy by grabbing his neck.</v>

1147
00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.880
<v Speaker 3>That's when I had to go sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1148
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.160
<v Speaker 3>you missed the big end scene in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1149
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:17.240
<v Speaker 3>It's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Song I saw enough,</v>

1150
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.930
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's on a horse in John Wick three.</v>

1151

1152
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:24.860
<v Speaker 3>He's like Tom Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get back on the Chevelle.</v>

1153
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Why are you giving them a horse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's Tom Cruise.</v>

1154
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 3>The 1970 Chevelle is the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a fucking horse.</v>

1155
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.990
<v Speaker 3>So he trains like legit shooting trains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legit shooting,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1210
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:08.160

1211
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:13.370
<v Speaker 1>He knows what's unique about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the things that he's saying or,</v>

1212
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:18.500
<v Speaker 1>or like legitimately profound and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and like legitimately deeply</v>

1213
00:55:20.041 --> 00:55:22.500
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're reading it and you go,</v>

1214
00:55:22.501 --> 00:55:23.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

1215
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:28.260
<v Speaker 1>this guy was a real thinking person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like deeply considering these</v>

1216
00:55:28.261 --> 00:55:33.261
<v Speaker 1>things from all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>angles and yet he allowed that crazy</v>

1217
00:55:34.171 --> 00:55:39.171
<v Speaker 1>Sheila lady to run his call and poisoned</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and nations.</v>

1218
00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 1>But even before that he was collecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolls royces and he was like,</v>

1219
00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:47.100
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loved the love luxury.</v>

1220
00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:48.710
<v Speaker 1>The problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1221
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:51.390
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try and motivate people.</v>

1222
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.310
<v Speaker 1>It starts out like these nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions,</v>

1223
00:55:53.311 --> 00:55:55.410
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they taste money,</v>

1224
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:57.450
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over greed.</v>

1225
00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Speaker 1>It just takes you over and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>shake it.</v>

1226
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:01.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I be in a,</v>

1227
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.350
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1228
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:05.820
<v Speaker 1>for tourists when I've had a Rolls</v>
<v Speaker 1>Royce?</v>

1229
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about just one rolls Royce,</v>

1230
00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1231
00:56:08.941 --> 00:56:12.450
<v Speaker 1>but these people need to power power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>greed.</v>

1232
00:56:12.451 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's and celebrity and then you can't</v>

1233
00:56:15.031 --> 00:56:16.780
<v Speaker 1>shake it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these televangelists,</v>

1234
00:56:16.781 --> 00:56:20.190
<v Speaker 1>when all those televangelists wind down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they start off like preaching</v>

1235
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 1>around the south dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in little churches.</v>

1236
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Then they started making millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars and it goes off the rails.</v>

1237
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Greed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demon.</v>

1238
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

1239
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because like that guy from what</v>

1240
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:35.380
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has some good points is some good</v>

1241
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some stuff in dianetics that's</v>

1242
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.150
<v Speaker 1>makes very good sense that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1243
00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that all that good stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is negated by a love of objects?</v>

1244
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that it ends up corrupting them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they start making other choices that</v>

1245
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:52.610
<v Speaker 1>don't align with what they're preaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1246
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's where they're human beings.</v>

1247
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.620
<v Speaker 1>We're all human beings and you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting that power and then all of this</v>

1248
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 1>money comes in and it was rough sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was also a lot of sex.</v>

1249
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 1>A lot of sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cult was a lot about just free sex.</v>

1250
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Everybody banging everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how it all comes down to</v>

1251
00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:17.410
<v Speaker 1>those things is always becomes sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

1252
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.740
<v Speaker 1>power and celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a potent comp.</v>

1253
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Like they all fall from those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desires these great benefits to all</v>

1254
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1255
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Sex feels great if you have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

1256
00:57:29.081 --> 00:57:31.960
<v Speaker 1>you can buy awesome things and you enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you feel like you've</v>

1257
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:35.410
<v Speaker 1>accomplished something if you have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of celebrity than everybody kisses your</v>

1258
00:57:35.411 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 1>ass and he would walk in the room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands class together and everybody</v>

1259
00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:41.650
<v Speaker 1>would go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a different kind of celebrity,</v>

1260
00:57:41.651 --> 00:57:42.484
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1261
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 1>His celebrity was not just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

1271
00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:11.350
<v Speaker 1>There was a yoga class that I used to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where the guy who was the instructor</v>

1272
00:58:11.351 --> 00:58:15.670
<v Speaker 1>was banging some of the students and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was slimy.</v>

1273
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:16.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1274
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:21.631
<v Speaker 1>you could tell he would sing in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sing songs and be like,</v>

1275
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are killing my buddy.</v>

1276
00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of there.</v>

1277
00:58:25.551 --> 00:58:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And you're so white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything about it.</v>

1278
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:30.600
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

1279
00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:32.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slippery guy.</v>

1280
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Like in his thing was being this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really spiritual yoga guy,</v>

1281
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.740
<v Speaker 1>his 40 year old women whose husbands</v>
<v Speaker 1>retired a fucking them.</v>

1282
00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:43.630
<v Speaker 1>They would really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know him.</v>

1283
00:58:43.631 --> 00:58:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be given them privates,</v>

1284
00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:50.260
<v Speaker 1>air</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowel checkup.</v>

1285
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would probably talk to them about</v>

1286
00:58:54.341 --> 00:58:59.341
<v Speaker 1>sensuality and of course in their aura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then probably lay some shit down</v>

1287
00:58:59.501 --> 00:59:00.350
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1288
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.810
<v Speaker 1>one of the main problems in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships is there.</v>

1289
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 1>The Passion sometimes ebbs when there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a loss of respect and appreciation for</v>

1290
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 1>each other as individuals as unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul's.</v>

1291
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm experiencing that in my</v>

1292
00:59:14.081 --> 00:59:15.370
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

1293
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.060
<v Speaker 1>So sorry to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boundaries of intimacy should not be</v>

1294
00:59:19.061 --> 00:59:20.050
<v Speaker 1>related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it me?</v>

1295
00:59:20.051 --> 00:59:24.430
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like I'm seeing the real you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one else sees boundaries in</v>

1296
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.410
<v Speaker 1>intimacy should not be confined by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of paper.</v>

1297
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:28.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1298
00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:31.940
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously that the vows of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage have already been broken by</v>

1299
00:59:31.941 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 1>your husband who's not nice to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1300
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Let me write down the apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My apartment in Encino,</v>

1301
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:40.610
<v Speaker 1>sweet yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Brown,</v>

1302
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Brown walk around barefoot everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hot yoga guy touch with nature.</v>

1303
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.440
<v Speaker 1>The hot yoga guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got busted for sleeping with all</v>

1304
00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 1>these women and was the hot yoga.</v>

1305
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:57.980
<v Speaker 1>He fucked everybody more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was accused of sexual assault.</v>

1306
00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:01.910
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guy wasn't sexually assaulting</v>

1307
01:00:01.911 --> 01:00:05.660
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's just slipping the Deq in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were allowing it.</v>

1308
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>They wanted the deck like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>

1309
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's some people that it's a</v>

1310
01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>power move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people say that that's abuse,</v>

1311
01:00:12.661 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1312
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>the Yoga Guru who manipulates the woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then foxer that he is in a way</v>

1313
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>definitely being guilty of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>misconduct and perhaps even something</v>

1314
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>more egregious because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that they have between the</v>

1315
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>guru and the student and he's violating</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trust in that power dynamic.</v>

1316
01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Catholic church,</v>

1317
01:00:39.981 --> 01:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1318
01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the same.</v>

1319
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty year old married woman in a</v>

1320
01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:49.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking yoga teacher is not the same as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little kid in a priest,</v>

1321
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's using power for them to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

1322
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1323
01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>One of them is rape and abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one is a lady wants Dick.</v>

1324
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't say she wanted to</v>

1325
01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>touch her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just twisted this around and apologize.</v>

1326
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>All those yoga teachers out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking their students.</v>

1327
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a violation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a guru,</v>

1328
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>anything that's a teacher and below</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using that,</v>

1329
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you're manipulating that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1330
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>But wasn't that like a big part of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a undergraduate students and professors</v>

1331
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>back in the day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do that anymore.</v>

1332
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a big thing.</v>

1333
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my high school,</v>

1334
01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>the basketball teacher ended up marrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his best girl basketball player.</v>

1335
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy ending yet worked out.</v>

1336
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how old was she beating him?</v>

1337
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>He was probably 30 something and she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

1338
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did they get my basketball?</v>

1339
01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After school.</v>

1340
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>During school now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was Doris and then they</v>

1341
01:01:49.071 --> 01:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was illegal then?</v>

1342
01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1343
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:53.241
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1344
01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many states it probably was legal in</v>

1345
01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1346
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you it was what year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 85.</v>

1347
01:02:01.461 --> 01:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>80 seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guarantee it was.</v>

1348
01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>17 was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it was legal really.</v>

1349
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet 16 was legal,</v>

1350
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1351
01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's not to say that there can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a happy ending when somebody is the</v>

1352
01:02:12.591 --> 01:02:16.190
<v Speaker 1>teacher or for the quarter on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's definitely a violation,</v>

1353
01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>but it is manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the age of consent in 19 eight?</v>

1354
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Note New Jersey.</v>

1355
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.470
<v Speaker 4>Age Sixteen years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>16.</v>

1356
01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1357
01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I could have hit on this crew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1358
01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:28.440
<v Speaker 4>But hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Consent for sexual conduct.</v>

1359
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:30.750
<v Speaker 4>16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This applies to both heterosexual and</v>

1360
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 4>homosexual conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a general matter,</v>

1361
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 4>this means that a person who is 16 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>old can generally consent to have sex</v>

1362
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.680
<v Speaker 4>with any adult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is in 2018.</v>

1363
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.450
<v Speaker 4>That's today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's today.</v>

1364
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:44.760
<v Speaker 4>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing,</v>

1365
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know this Asia Argento thing</v>

1366
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:53.730
<v Speaker 4>going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the 17 year old kid when he had sex</v>

1367
01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:55.350
<v Speaker 4>with her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was in California.</v>

1368
01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:00.530
<v Speaker 4>So he's saying it's sexual assault</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she had sex with him and then</v>

1369
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:05.460
<v Speaker 4>she got Tony Bourdain to pay this kid</v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

1370
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Three hundred plus thousand dollars to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut his mouth.</v>

1371
01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:13.710
<v Speaker 4>And then it came out that she was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hypocrite because she seduced this kid</v>

1372
01:03:13.711 --> 01:03:17.880
<v Speaker 4>and fucked him and she had played his</v>
<v Speaker 4>mom and a movie 10 years prior when he</v>

1373
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.510
<v Speaker 4>was only seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really kind crazy.</v>

1374
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:24.990
<v Speaker 4>There's pictures of her and the kid when</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kid was a like a little kid,</v>

1375
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 4>she stayed close to him and called him</v>
<v Speaker 4>like her son and he would call her mom</v>

1376
01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:32.760
<v Speaker 4>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they got together and she lied</v>

1377
01:03:32.761 --> 01:03:35.700
<v Speaker 4>about it and so she didn't fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then pictures came out of her in bed</v>

1378
01:03:35.701 --> 01:03:38.850
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then her friends released text</v>

1379
01:03:38.851 --> 01:03:40.980
<v Speaker 4>messages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

1380
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:46.370
<v Speaker 4>she's a fucking monster in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was he of legal age when they had sex?</v>

1381
01:03:46.381 --> 01:03:48.600
<v Speaker 4>This is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was 17 at the time,</v>

1382
01:03:48.601 --> 01:03:51.060
<v Speaker 4>so it have been totally legal if this</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in New Jersey,</v>

1383
01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.330
<v Speaker 4>but it happened in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is all going on while she was</v>

1384
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:57.390
<v Speaker 4>making a big deal of Harvey Weinstein</v>
<v Speaker 4>having sex with her when she was 22,</v>

1385
01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:00.090
<v Speaker 4>like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was crippled.</v>

1386
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.340
<v Speaker 4>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1387
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:02.730
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing is crazy.</v>

1388
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:05.790
<v Speaker 4>But my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1389
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.670
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest about that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean seventeens,</v>

1390
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.160
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be okay that I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

1391
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:18.630
<v Speaker 4>even if it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just not the same for boys.</v>

1392
01:04:18.631 --> 01:04:20.940
<v Speaker 4>It is not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should she have done it?</v>

1393
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.780
<v Speaker 4>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1394
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:23.933
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not.</v>

1395
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.880
<v Speaker 4>Should she be locked up in a cage for 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>years for doing that?</v>

1396
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:28.590
<v Speaker 4>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a freak,</v>

1397
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That lady is a freak.</v>

1398
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.750
<v Speaker 4>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was 17,</v>

1399
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 4>but she's more guilty of being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hypocrite than anything.</v>

1400
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.720
<v Speaker 4>Did she stay in touch with them all</v>
<v Speaker 4>those years?</v>

1401
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.620
<v Speaker 4>She was playing the mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1402
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:44.400
<v Speaker 4>The real creepy pictures her in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie with him when he was like a little</v>

1403
01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:47.730
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as creepy as woody Allen</v>

1404
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.110
<v Speaker 4>when he had his daughter sitting on his</v>
<v Speaker 4>lap and then 10 years later that same</v>

1405
01:04:52.111 --> 01:04:54.570
<v Speaker 4>daughter is holding his hand as his</v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend in a brand,</v>

1406
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.030
<v Speaker 4>in the front row of a basketball game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of weird.</v>

1407
01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Think that's a little creepier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why that is so weird.</v>

1408
01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:07.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you even a reason to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make that comparison,</v>

1409
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:12.380
<v Speaker 4>but the point is that kid would have no</v>
<v Speaker 4>case at all if this was in New Jersey,</v>

1410
01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:14.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in New Jersey,</v>

1411
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:16.230
<v Speaker 4>which I don't think he should have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>

1412
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.090
<v Speaker 4>Does he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he prosecuting like</v>

1413
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 3>or he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He apparently threatened to go public</v>

1414
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.680
<v Speaker 3>within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted money and they gave him money.</v>

1415
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bourdain did and gave them a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

1416
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 3>300,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$380,000 and even after he got paid,</v>

1417
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 3>he comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the most expensive dick that</v>

1418
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:36.420
<v Speaker 3>lady will ever get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he comes out,</v>

1419
01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.630
<v Speaker 3>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It came out anyway.</v>

1420
01:05:37.631 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who released it.</v>

1421
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

1422
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Somebody released it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened,</v>

1423
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.600
<v Speaker 3>but what they're basically showing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this whole thing,</v>

1424
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:52.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of her attacking being attacked by</v>

1425
01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated.</v>

1426
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he did exactly what she said he</v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

1427
01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:01.060
<v Speaker 3>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she clearly is deceptive.</v>

1428
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:06.300
<v Speaker 3>She definitely lied about this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the age of consent being</v>

1429
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was 18 or if it was.</v>

1430
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:12.380
<v Speaker 3>If he was 18 rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if it was like in New Jersey where at</v>

1431
01:06:12.381 --> 01:06:17.381
<v Speaker 3>16 there's no case and she just fucked a</v>
<v Speaker 3>young kid and I'm just going to be</v>

1432
01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:18.274
<v Speaker 3>honest.</v>

1433
01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.820
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that's creepy is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had this sort of mom's son thing</v>

1434
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:25.600
<v Speaker 3>going on with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They talked about each other as mom and</v>

1435
01:06:25.601 --> 01:06:26.290
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>

1436
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:31.290
<v Speaker 3>If she was just a hot 35 year old who</v>
<v Speaker 3>had sex with a handsome 17 year old boy</v>

1437
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.890
<v Speaker 3>seventeens as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing.</v>

1438
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.830
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was a 35 year old man and a 17</v>

1439
01:06:38.831 --> 01:06:41.140
<v Speaker 3>year old girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she directed the movie too.</v>

1440
01:06:41.141 --> 01:06:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Does that change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1441
01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.380
<v Speaker 3>She directed the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new one,</v>

1442
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:50.200
<v Speaker 3>the movie 10 years ago when he was a 17</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old or a seven year old rather.</v>

1443
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

1444
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:52.840
<v Speaker 3>You know my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my.</v>

1445
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:58.290
<v Speaker 3>She was 37 when she was seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was seven when he was 17.</v>

1446
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.480
<v Speaker 3>She.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't make a move when,</v>

1447
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.640
<v Speaker 3>when he was seven though dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was waited until he was 17.</v>

1448
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:05.760
<v Speaker 3>She's a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.190
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she got close to the wire,</v>

1450
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't hold on anymore.</v>

1451
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:14.440
<v Speaker 3>And then for ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's will you move to New Jersey?</v>

1452
01:07:14.441 --> 01:07:16.690
<v Speaker 3>I won't over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the issue.</v>

1453
01:07:16.691 --> 01:07:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's the same thing</v>

1454
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the only thing she's really</v>

1455
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:24.580
<v Speaker 3>guilty of here is hypocrisy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>deception.</v>

1456
01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she's guilty of a sex</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime even though she technically is in</v>

1457
01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:30.160
<v Speaker 3>my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1458
01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:31.720
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I a sexist?</v>

1459
01:07:31.721 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sexist against men.</v>

1460
01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:36.623
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think.</v>

1461
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.190
<v Speaker 3>I think the guy's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

1462
01:07:39.191 --> 01:07:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so damaged,</v>

1463
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.390
<v Speaker 3>but I knew that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that damage from her.</v>

1464
01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.490
<v Speaker 3>He would have been dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have been damaged from a girl</v>

1465
01:07:45.491 --> 01:07:47.570
<v Speaker 3>who was his age too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who fucked him and then didn't call</v>

1466
01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:47.730
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1467
01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1468
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:50.590
<v Speaker 3>Emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a crime.</v>

1469
01:07:50.591 --> 01:07:51.191
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear it,</v>

1470
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:52.210
<v Speaker 3>you hear this argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1471
01:07:52.211 --> 01:07:56.230
<v Speaker 3>well a boy can be effective for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone can be affected.</v>

1472
01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.570
<v Speaker 3>And when you're 40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1473
01:07:57.910 --> 01:08:00.940
<v Speaker 3>in some of these instances where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>teacher sleeps with the kid and it's a</v>

1474
01:08:00.941 --> 01:08:03.910
<v Speaker 3>boy and he's 14 and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1475
01:08:03.911 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would love it.</v>

1476
01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.480
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a boy now at 14,</v>

1477
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:10.510
<v Speaker 3>you're still don't know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still mixed up.</v>

1478
01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.180
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a teacher student dynamic.</v>

1479
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a different situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's stipulating you.</v>

1480
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1481
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 4>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this dynamic equal to the teacher</v>

1482
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:22.040
<v Speaker 4>student?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because she was the director and she</v>

1483
01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:27.041
<v Speaker 4>played his mother and she clearly had</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a maternal love like sort</v>

1484
01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 4>of relationship with him early on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it became sexual later.</v>

1485
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.590
<v Speaker 4>But then she says he jumped her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She says the Horny kid jumped me.</v>

1486
01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 4>That's what she said to her friend when</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's being honest.</v>

1487
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe he did.</v>

1488
01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:43.610
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he was in love and pining for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole time.</v>

1489
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:47.660
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's one of the reasons why he</v>
<v Speaker 4>came out and wanted money in the first</v>

1490
01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:49.820
<v Speaker 4>place to trying to get back at her</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she didn't want to have anything</v>

1491
01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 4>to do with him anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe they had a couple of drinks</v>

1492
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:55.610
<v Speaker 4>together and she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1493
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:59.210
<v Speaker 4>she just didn't know what to do when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>started making moves on her and so she</v>

1494
01:08:59.211 --> 01:09:02.830
<v Speaker 4>fucked him because she's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's possible to know.</v>

1495
01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.670
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a crime?</v>

1513
01:09:48.521 --> 01:09:53.521
<v Speaker 2>I remember 80 bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend of mine who grew hair</v>

1514
01:09:53.531 --> 01:09:56.920
<v Speaker 2>when he was 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a little Italian kid.</v>

1515
01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.810
<v Speaker 2>He had a mustache full team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure his pupils were gigantic.</v>

01:10:01.811 --> 01:10:06.811
<v Speaker 2>Good</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asia Argento go fuck that guy.</v>

1517
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.270

<v Speaker 2>He would get a haircut and would grow</v>

1518
01:10:10.271 --> 01:10:14.410
<v Speaker 2>back by the time he got in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just Italian.</v>

1519
01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated.</v>

1520
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is</v>

1521
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.080
<v Speaker 4>she had a consensual sexual relationship</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Harvey Weinstein after the alleged</v>

1522
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.320
<v Speaker 4>incident where he ate her pussy and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't want him to.</v>

1523
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Well that's like the cosby thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep coming back.</v>

1524
01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:32.310
<v Speaker 2>There was a couple that came back and</v>

1525
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:35.220
<v Speaker 4>don't wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were they aware that he drugged them the</v>

1526
01:10:35.221 --> 01:10:36.054
<v Speaker 4>first time?</v>

1527
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the details.</v>

1528
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:41.180
<v Speaker 2>It sounded like it sounded like they</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew something was weird,</v>

1529
01:10:41.181 --> 01:10:43.170
<v Speaker 2>but then they came back anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you didn't like</v>

1530
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 4>exonerate someone from a rape just</v>
<v Speaker 4>because after the rape you're friendly</v>

1531
01:10:47.151 --> 01:10:47.840
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>

1532
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

1533
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:52.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a big mental impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what's going on with</v>

1534
01:10:52.131 --> 01:10:52.700
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>

1535
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Just that it's some people they want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>mitigate the effects of being raped by</v>

1536
01:10:57.891 --> 01:11:01.880
<v Speaker 4>turning into something different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they made me would establish a</v>

1537
01:11:01.881 --> 01:11:04.130
<v Speaker 4>consensual relationship with the person</v>
<v Speaker 4>after they rape</v>

1538
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:05.960
<v Speaker 2>them to try and take their power back a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>

1539
01:11:06.170 --> 01:11:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just that,</v>

1540
01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 4>to try to relieve themselves of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling of being a victim.</v>

1541
01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 4>They almost make it consensual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like a weird psychological</v>

1542
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:18.540
<v Speaker 3>dynamic that you and I will never</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand as men will never understand.</v>

1543
01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.070
<v Speaker 3>And now because it's not the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>

1544
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:21.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1545
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.620
<v Speaker 2>So if she went back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1546
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:24.563
<v Speaker 2>with Harvey</v>

1547
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:27.470
<v Speaker 3>woman can't comes over your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1548
01:11:27.471 --> 01:11:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a single guy,</v>

1549
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:30.830
<v Speaker 3>am I in a cabinet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little cabin,</v>

1550
01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.210
<v Speaker 3>a little tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$320.</v>

1551
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.980
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in big bear.</v>

1552
01:11:33.981 --> 01:11:36.290
<v Speaker 3>You weren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you weren't flannels and you're cutting</v>

1553
01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:37.124
<v Speaker 3>wood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1554
01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.790
<v Speaker 3>And a girl comes over and she sucks your</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick against your will.</v>

1555
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you're doing this.</v>

1556
01:11:42.921 --> 01:11:46.310
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once it's over,</v>

1557
01:11:46.311 --> 01:11:47.180
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1558
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to feel like I got raped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to establish a</v>

1559
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.640
<v Speaker 3>relationship with this lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're a guy.</v>

1562
01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:01.760

<v Speaker 3>safety.</v>

1563
01:12:01.761 --> 01:12:03.590
<v Speaker 3>This is the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Physical Safety.</v>

1564
01:12:03.591 --> 01:12:06.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to work out with his gay.</v>

1565
01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:09.950
<v Speaker 3>Jim used to work out at Gold's gym on</v>
<v Speaker 3>coal and I say gay gym because it was</v>

1566
01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:14.810
<v Speaker 3>just like a lot of gay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really obvious overtanned,</v>

1567
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:18.290
<v Speaker 3>you know gay guys were like super thin</v>
<v Speaker 3>tank,</v>

1568

<v Speaker 3>fucking combat boots and real</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leather fucking paper Boi.</v>

1571
01:12:25.851 --> 01:12:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Hats on and mother working out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend can gay,</v>

1572
01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:31.040
<v Speaker 3>but my point is while I was in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>working out,</v>

1573
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:34.670
<v Speaker 3>these guys would hit on you right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd feel like,</v>

1574
01:12:34.671 --> 01:12:36.590
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at you and hitting on you</v>

1575
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:41.330
<v Speaker 3>and it made you uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well welcome to being a woman and not</v>

1576
01:12:41.331 --> 01:12:43.940
<v Speaker 3>even really because I could fuck those</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys up.</v>

1577
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.970
<v Speaker 3>So I wasn't worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if a guy tries to go to the parking</v>

1578
01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:47.960
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1579
01:12:47.961 --> 01:12:49.250
<v Speaker 3>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're good.</v>

1580
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.460
<v Speaker 3>This is going to get violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stopped trying to fuck me right now.</v>

1581
01:12:52.461 --> 01:12:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Like I can actually fuck you up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas if I'm a girl I have to worry</v>

1582
01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.930
<v Speaker 3>that I'm fumbling for my keys and these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys behind me in the parking lot and</v>

1583
01:12:59.931 --> 01:13:02.120
<v Speaker 3>they want to push me into the car and</v>
<v Speaker 3>take my pants off.</v>

1584
01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:04.940
<v Speaker 3>This is a real concern for women that</v>
<v Speaker 3>men don't have.</v>

1585
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.170
<v Speaker 3>So our ideas of what it would be like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be in a non consensual relationship with</v>

1586
01:13:09.171 --> 01:13:10.970
<v Speaker 3>a woman where she sucks your Dick</v>
<v Speaker 3>against your will.</v>

1587
01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:11.810
<v Speaker 3>It's just not comparable.</v>

1588
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:16.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a great point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Douglas movie came out and it</v>

1589
01:13:16.971 --> 01:13:18.530
<v Speaker 2>was the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the reverse.</v>

1590
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I forget which movie was he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes down on him and he's like,</v>

1591
01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:24.050
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop it.</v>

1592
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a work relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1593
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:29.240
<v Speaker 2>stop down little attraction now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't fatal attraction.</v>

1594
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:33.230
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't behind the candelabra it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1595
01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 2>it was another movie and it became like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thing.</v>

1596
01:13:35.751 --> 01:13:39.710
<v Speaker 2>It became like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a joke because as a disclosure,</v>

1597
01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:42.170
<v Speaker 2>because as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who was the star?</v>

1598
01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Demi Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1599
01:13:44.451 --> 01:13:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she goes down on him and everyone</v>

1600
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:50.840
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to make the case that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could happen to a man to the culture</v>

1601
01:13:50.841 --> 01:13:53.330
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now god,</v>

1602
01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.410
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1603
01:13:54.411 --> 01:13:55.850
<v Speaker 2>she's a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1604
01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll leave</v>

1605
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:58.400
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut up.</v>

1608

<v Speaker 3>Wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Putting it out there and giving it a</v>

1610

<v Speaker 3>What is that like</v>
<v Speaker 3>for any quote whatsoever?</v>

1614
01:14:21.221 --> 01:14:25.900
<v Speaker 3>So they just take some wonky quote from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Boise News station.</v>

1615
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Some guy's drunk when he writes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's barely paying attention now it's</v>

1616
01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:32.190
<v Speaker 3>just someone with a blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like dawn's movie hut.</v>

1617
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:39.060
<v Speaker 3>He loved it in the middle of the forest</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were.</v>

1618
01:14:40.361 --> 01:14:41.710
<v Speaker 3>When I was watching road house last</v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

1619
01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:44.920
<v Speaker 3>he put a cassette and this is Mercedes</v>
<v Speaker 3>car is playing music,</v>

1620
01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:46.720
<v Speaker 3>shoved in the in there and play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1621
01:14:46.721 --> 01:14:49.180
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking kiss.</v>

1622
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:51.280
<v Speaker 3>My daughter got a cassette from one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>her friends,</v>

1623
01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:53.890
<v Speaker 3>a cassette player looking for cassettes.</v>

1624
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:56.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get them day or something.</v>

1625
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:57.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1626
01:14:57.161 --> 01:15:00.190
<v Speaker 3>like she has a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're really pretty obscure.</v>

1627
01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.100
<v Speaker 3>This is a real concern that everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have is digital,</v>

1628
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we're moving to kindles and</v>

1629
01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:09.580
<v Speaker 3>ebooks and all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he downloadable music and less</v>

1630
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:14.620
<v Speaker 3>physical music that anything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens that wipes that stuff out,</v>

1631
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.140
<v Speaker 3>that wipes out their ability to play it</v>
<v Speaker 3>a deserve.</v>

1632
01:15:18.141 --> 01:15:20.740
<v Speaker 3>The recording we lose every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be gone forever.</v>

1633
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.500
<v Speaker 3>All information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of our information is becoming</v>

1634
01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:26.110
<v Speaker 3>digital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I becoming more and more vulnerable.</v>

1635
01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:31.050
<v Speaker 3>We're becoming more and more aware and</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more educated that were risk.</v>

1636
01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Like we're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're more aware that we're being</v>

1637
01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 3>attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people are trying to steal this</v>

1638
01:15:35.981 --> 01:15:38.280
<v Speaker 3>stuff and we're putting more of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>faith in it.</v>

1639
01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is as we become more</v>

1640
01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 3>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even with that,</v>

1641
01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:43.480
<v Speaker 3>just the more information we</v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulated,</v>

1642
01:15:43.481 --> 01:15:45.970
<v Speaker 3>the more vulnerable that information</v>
<v Speaker 3>ends.</v>

1643
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:50.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not like books that are like locked</v>
<v Speaker 3>solid and they're always going to be</v>

1644
01:15:50.531 --> 01:15:52.630
<v Speaker 3>there as long as you keep it in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fireproof container.</v>

1645
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is our.</v>

1646
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:58.900
<v Speaker 3>Our knowledge itself is way more</v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable than it's ever been before.</v>

1647
01:15:58.901 --> 01:16:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Yet way more advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

1648
01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.770
<v Speaker 3>We've been before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really interesting.</v>

1649
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it all backed up on the cloud?</v>

1650
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:10.630
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Dr Robert Schoch on the podcast,</v>

1651
01:16:10.631 --> 01:16:15.160
<v Speaker 3>who's a geologist from Boston University</v>
<v Speaker 3>freaked me the fuck out talking about</v>

1652
01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:20.020
<v Speaker 3>coronal mass ejections from the sun and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what what they believe happened</v>

1653
01:16:20.021 --> 01:16:24.700
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around 12,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some sort of a gigantic solar</v>

1654
01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:27.830
<v Speaker 3>event that caused lightening storms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1655
01:16:27.831 --> 01:16:30.640
<v Speaker 3>like when it's a storm and rain is</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming down from the sky,</v>

1656
01:16:30.641 --> 01:16:34.270
<v Speaker 3>like fucking buckets of rain everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it was like that with lightning</v>

1657
01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:38.740
<v Speaker 3>and the lightning literally turning the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and the glass and certain places.</v>

1658
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.240
<v Speaker 3>How long?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

1659
01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Mass extinction of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really mass extinction of people like</v>

1660
01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.200
<v Speaker 3>just lightening raining down on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole planet.</v>

1661
01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:49.210
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't my gun off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

1662
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it's a controversial theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was proposing,</v>

1663
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:58.471
<v Speaker 3>but it's based on what they believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly happened with a coronal mass</v>

1664
01:16:59.051 --> 01:17:02.960
<v Speaker 3>ejection from the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which can and does happen and has had</v>

1665
01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.200
<v Speaker 3>passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think about that,</v>

1666
01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.660
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to stop like a giant</v>

1667
01:17:07.661 --> 01:17:08.560
<v Speaker 3>asteroid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden</v>

1668
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>they're happening all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:14.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just not big intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why not?</v>

1670
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Why not have one buildup and last I seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comparison of the earth next to the</v>

1671
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:21.940
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:26.030
<v Speaker 1>When they show the solar flares are</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of times larger than the earth</v>

1673
01:17:26.031 --> 01:17:29.800
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy like,</v>

1674
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's far away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right guys?</v>

1675
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 1>It'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still gonna have a barbecue this</v>

1676
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couple million miles.</v>

1677
01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.450
<v Speaker 1>How many miles is the sun away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many million?</v>

1678
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:41.270
<v Speaker 1>There's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1679
01:17:41.271 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 1>the moon is $200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It varies.</v>

1680
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:46.490
<v Speaker 1>It goes a little closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little further away,</v>

1681
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:48.720
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere around 200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty thousand.</v>

1682
01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty thousand.</v>

1683
01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Ninety 3 million miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun.</v>

1684
01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me pull up a comparison.</v>

1685
01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.460
<v Speaker 1>The Sun in comparison to the size of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth in you,</v>

1686
01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.060
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1687
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 1>a million times bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A million times.</v>

1688
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Million Times bigger than the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1689
01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big question.</v>

1690
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Say a solar flare pops off.</v>

1691
01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.510
<v Speaker 1>If it's that far away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

1692
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how many know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know it's coming for awhile.</v>

1693
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.770
<v Speaker 1>You have a couple minutes just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1694
01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:22.900
<v Speaker 1>that's going to look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the one point $3.</v>

1695
01:18:22.901 --> 01:18:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Billion earths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Geez.</v>

1696
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Look at the earth though with a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot</v>

1697
01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:29.373
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh there.</v>

1698
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now look at those ejections.</v>

1699
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at those flares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no big.</v>

1700
01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Those flares are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then look at the size of the earth.</v>

1701
01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Like those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's common.</v>

1702
01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:41.240
<v Speaker 1>That's every day that's happening all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1703
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen video of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>

1704
01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1705
01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Like what's happening on the sun right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

1706
01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Should freak everybody the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it varies.</v>

1707
01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:53.570
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1708
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:55.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a giant nuclear fireball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1709
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:59.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just a constant nuclear explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1710
01:18:59.451 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Look at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks so hot.</v>

1711
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:06.350
<v Speaker 1>What a shit design,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1712
01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.400
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to heat everything up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just put a big fucking fireball</v>

1713
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>and the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's basically like a,</v>

1714
01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 1>like a fireplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy.</v>

1715
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.040
<v Speaker 1>How crazy that it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

1716
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:20.900
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

1717
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1718
01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:25.280
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the arguments that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb people use for religion.</v>

1719
01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the odds that all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out perfectly?</v>

1720
01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.400
<v Speaker 1>That we're this close to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1721
01:19:31.401 --> 01:19:32.450
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1722
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Scientists are trying to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>creator from EU.</v>

1723
01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Japan is trying to land in unmanned</v>
<v Speaker 1>robot on an asteroid twice the distance</v>

1724
01:19:40.461 --> 01:19:42.980
<v Speaker 1>of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a 186 million miles away.</v>

1725
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It next month,</v>

1726
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:46.100
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next month.</v>

1727
01:19:46.101 --> 01:19:48.180
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try and land on it.</v>

1728
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Raced the Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know they were in this</v>

1729
01:19:52.181 --> 01:19:54.420
<v Speaker 1>space game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's orbiting it right now apparently.</v>

1730
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese have the hymn of worry.</v>

1731
01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Eight satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That takes gigantic high resolution.</v>

1732
01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:04.590
<v Speaker 1>A full photos of the earth from 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles out every 10 minutes.</v>

1733
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere around then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

1734
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:08.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1735
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull that up to him of worry.</v>

1736
01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the.</v>

1737
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.250
<v Speaker 3>What's the details of the memoir?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

1738
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:16.320
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the best things to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>against these flat earth dorks.</v>

1739
01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Like for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things they were saying is</v>

1740
01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:24.060
<v Speaker 3>that there was no full photos of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth from space that everything was</v>

1741
01:20:24.061 --> 01:20:27.240
<v Speaker 3>just stitched together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

1742
01:20:27.241 --> 01:20:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Jack Shit is so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a scary stupid theory.</v>

1743
01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Real time is real time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look.</v>

1744
01:20:33.511 --> 01:20:35.550
<v Speaker 3>It's nighttime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far away is the distance?</v>

1745
01:20:35.551 --> 01:20:39.270
<v Speaker 3>The hamawand say I think it's 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles.</v>

1746
01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Him a worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>

1747
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:42.990
<v Speaker 3>That's a satellite.</v>

1748
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:50.390
<v Speaker 3>The satellite is 22,000 miles above the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and it takes real time.</v>

1749
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Photos every 10 minutes and high</v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution.</v>

1750
01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:55.650
<v Speaker 3>They're like massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive photographs,</v>

1751
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:58.470
<v Speaker 3>but they use it to predict weather and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can like.</v>

1752
01:20:58.471 --> 01:21:02.500
<v Speaker 3>You could literally see storms coming in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and share so bad ass at it.</v>

1753
01:21:02.501 --> 01:21:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Look how he zoom in and zoom out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know I had no idea the Japanese were</v>

1754
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:07.231
<v Speaker 3>doing all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

01:21:07.231 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 3>they're on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>

1756
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:12.060
<v Speaker 3>They make the best cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cars don't break your fucking around</v>

1757
01:21:12.061 --> 01:21:13.690
<v Speaker 3>with these teslas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit's going to run out of</v>

1758
01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:15.900
<v Speaker 3>batteries in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gonna be stuck.</v>

1759
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:19.200
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be with chapped lips</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Mad Max movie.</v>

1760
01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Just shuffling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get to Nevada.</v>

1761
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.020
<v Speaker 3>Trinity's trying to charge my car with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

1762
01:21:25.021 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 3>I have credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have.</v>

1763
01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:31.581
<v Speaker 3>My credit cards is giving me water</v>
<v Speaker 3>from California,</v>

1764
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:33.370
<v Speaker 3>so I'm kind of queer here.</v>

1765
01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.640
<v Speaker 3>It worked for queer this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just listing my footprint.</v>

1766
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Electric car guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd that work out?</v>

1767
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Where your conflict minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Electric car.</v>

1768
01:21:45.511 --> 01:21:49.140
<v Speaker 3>You paid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just tried to be nice to have a planet</v>

1769
01:21:49.141 --> 01:21:51.540
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could those cars not run on solar</v>

1770
01:21:51.541 --> 01:21:52.800
<v Speaker 3>power?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I don't get.</v>

1771
01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.060
<v Speaker 3>Especially in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything.</v>

1772
01:21:55.061 --> 01:21:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Solar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you have a solar roof panel</v>

1773
01:21:57.271 --> 01:21:59.070
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The car itself,</v>

1774
01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:01.450
<v Speaker 3>you regenerate the battery hood should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be solar.</v>

1775
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1776
01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at all the known asteroids from</v>

1777
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 3>1999 to 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1778
01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1779
01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 3>We live in a shooting gallery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at NASA is identified more than</v>

1780
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:17.710
<v Speaker 3>18,000 near Earth objects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just floating around all three</v>

1781
01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.170
<v Speaker 3>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on back that up again.</v>

1782
01:22:19.171 --> 01:22:21.300
<v Speaker 3>The discovery rate averages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did it say?</v>

1783
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Forty per week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's asteroids.</v>

1784
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

1785
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Back Up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back Up.</v>

1786
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 3>Chance of a large earth asteroid hitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth is slim.</v>

1787
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.850
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But scientists will continue to monitor</v>

1788
01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:38.260
<v Speaker 3>all known near Earth objects for any</v>
<v Speaker 3>potential collusion with us.</v>

1789
01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.170
<v Speaker 3>They say with slim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1790
01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Until you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to this one sign,</v>

1791
01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:42.990
<v Speaker 3>look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1792
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:44.550
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to this one scientist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1793
01:22:44.551 --> 01:22:45.490
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1794
01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.400
<v Speaker 3>they already have plans in effect if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find asteroids.</v>

1795
01:22:50.401 --> 01:22:52.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that I'm concerned</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1796
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 3>They're already thinking about that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll be fine.</v>

1797
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 3>So then I talked to Neil degrasse Tyson</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

1798
01:22:57.061 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 3>how much time would we need to plan for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a satellite or an asteroid hitting us?</v>

1799
01:23:00.571 --> 01:23:01.710
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least 10 years.</v>

1800
01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1801
01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Ten years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten years.</v>

1802
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.951
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1803
01:23:04.951 --> 01:23:05.711
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're fucked.</v>

1804
01:23:05.711 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd</v>

1805
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.210
<v Speaker 1>be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1806
01:23:07.211 --> 01:23:10.290
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this other guy lied to me.</v>

1807
01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:14.140
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean 10 years from when?</v>
<v Speaker 1>From when you find it to when we could</v>

1808
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:15.430
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1809
01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.800
<v Speaker 1>that it would take us to 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not so figure out towards earth.</v>

1810
01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>You need 10 years gap time between</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing it's definitely gonna hit</v>

1811
01:23:24.851 --> 01:23:29.260
<v Speaker 1>earth and having the ability and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology to shift its direction.</v>

1812
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't you just go and shoot a rocket</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it?</v>

1813
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:31.781
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a food time.</v>

1862
01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.340
<v Speaker 1>He was in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had no windows.</v>

1863
01:25:36.341 --> 01:25:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It was covered with roaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.230
<v Speaker 1>No sink in the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at you now,</v>

1865
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:43.830
<v Speaker 1>making bread on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets mocking the president and then</v>

1866
01:25:43.831 --> 01:25:46.220
<v Speaker 1>one of the best comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1867
01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1868
01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:51.180
<v Speaker 1>what a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a mess.</v>

1869
01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.760
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't want him to come back.</v>

1870
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Some people think they should be allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come back and he served time off and,</v>

1871
01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.050
<v Speaker 1>and then the argument by a lot of women</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1872
01:26:01.051 --> 01:26:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't said anything like he had</v>

1873
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>one on anything.</v>

1874
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

1875
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.860
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1876
01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:08.630
<v Speaker 4>what shows that he's learned?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything.</v>

1877
01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What should you have to do?</v>

1878
01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:12.843
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1879
01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Louise Very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he'll,</v>

1880
01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.350
<v Speaker 2>if he wants to keep doing it after this</v>
<v Speaker 2>reception,</v>

1881
01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:20.350
<v Speaker 2>he'll probably come out with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>statement or do something.</v>

1882
01:26:20.351 --> 01:26:22.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is,</v>

1883
01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:26.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did he lose?</v>

1884
01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:29.590
<v Speaker 2>They took away networks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took away his stuff.</v>

1885
01:26:29.591 --> 01:26:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Just film distributors weren't going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put out as film.</v>

1886
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:33.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the film,</v>

1887
01:26:33.371 --> 01:26:34.510
<v Speaker 2>but as a comedian</v>

1888
01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:35.590
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by all accounts,</v>

1889
01:26:35.591 --> 01:26:37.990
<v Speaker 4>the film was shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody has seen the film?</v>

1890
01:26:37.991 --> 01:26:40.720
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a few friends that saw.</v>

1891
01:26:40.721 --> 01:26:42.550
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just so creepy and weird,</v>

1892
01:26:42.551 --> 01:26:43.480
<v Speaker 4>especially in light of</v>

1893
01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.890
<v Speaker 2>what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.200
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1895
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:47.980
<v Speaker 2>but regardless whether it was good or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1896
01:26:47.981 --> 01:26:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like the industry said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fx said,</v>

1897
01:26:51.311 --> 01:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking this show from you ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said we're taking this stuff on Netflix.</v>

1898
01:26:54.690 --> 01:26:57.280
<v Speaker 2>We're taking this off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely definitely lost</v>

1899
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:58.780
<v Speaker 2>money financially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1900
01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.100
<v Speaker 2>And those are entities that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies</v>

1901
01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:06.730
<v Speaker 4>that punishment or is that them</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercising their desire to not work with</v>

1902
01:27:06.731 --> 01:27:09.280
<v Speaker 4>someone who has been accused of</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that they don't want to be</v>

1903
01:27:09.281 --> 01:27:11.200
<v Speaker 4>associated with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a punishment?</v>

1904
01:27:11.230 --> 01:27:13.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that they're,</v>

1905
01:27:13.031 --> 01:27:16.750
<v Speaker 4>they're making a decision of who they</v>
<v Speaker 4>work with and who they're not work with.</v>

1906
01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:18.420
<v Speaker 4>It affects him negative.</v>

1907
01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not necessarily a punishment.</v>

1908
01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:21.563
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1909
01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would feel like a punishment.</v>

1910
01:27:24.630 --> 01:27:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is there's these entities</v>

1911
01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.920
<v Speaker 2>that can prevent him from making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>living as a comedian though he can walk</v>

1912
01:27:31.921 --> 01:27:36.900
<v Speaker 2>into a garage and if he has fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come see him.</v>

1913
01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:39.450
<v Speaker 2>He has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has that under his control.</v>

1914
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can stop that,</v>

1915
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:44.880
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he can do it.</v>

1916
01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:47.130
<v Speaker 2>It's up to him whether he wants to or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1917
01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:50.340
<v Speaker 2>It's up to his fans whether they show up</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not and it's up to the people that</v>

1918
01:27:50.341 --> 01:27:53.410
<v Speaker 2>hate what he did and I'm really against</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to not go,</v>

1919
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:55.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why this thing was weird,</v>

1920
01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:59.250
<v Speaker 2>but he just showed up with a seller</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like his favorite place to go</v>

1921
01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.220
<v Speaker 2>and he just worked out material in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

1922
01:28:02.221 --> 01:28:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Like Kyle was saying is just they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped in there and they can't get out.</v>

1923
01:28:06.091 --> 01:28:08.010
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have an option to say.</v>

1924
01:28:08.011 --> 01:28:08.844
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see</v>

1925
01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.970
<v Speaker 4>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the different spins though.</v>

1926
01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:16.060
<v Speaker 4>All the different women spins and w one</v>
<v Speaker 4>one really bizarre spin that I saw was</v>

1927
01:28:17.631 --> 01:28:21.440
<v Speaker 4>this woman was saying that this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>indicative of the problem of all comedy</v>

1928
01:28:21.441 --> 01:28:26.441
<v Speaker 4>clubs and aggressive male audience and</v>
<v Speaker 4>women sitting there feeling threatened,</v>

1929
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:30.120
<v Speaker 4>not being able to use their voice and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like use user voice.</v>

1930
01:28:30.121 --> 01:28:32.840
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you gonna heckle?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were saying like you like you would</v>

1931
01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:34.490
<v Speaker 4>be more empowered if there were more</v>
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>

1932
01:28:34.491 --> 01:28:37.580
<v Speaker 4>so you could heckle is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not cool,</v>

1933
01:28:37.670 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 4>like you're not supposed to do that at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy club,</v>

1934
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:42.560
<v Speaker 4>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't like someone just don't laugh,</v>

1935
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:45.620
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>

1936
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:50.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not your job or it's not your place</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say that you don't like someone when</v>

1937
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:53.890
<v Speaker 4>the other people do like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know if you're right,</v>

1938
01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.270
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to get up and walk out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1939
01:28:56.271 --> 01:28:58.700
<v Speaker 4>just like you're going to see a movie</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're an audience member,</v>

1940
01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The deal is you're not there to perform.</v>

1941
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:05.100
<v Speaker 4>The audience is there to just sit there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and laugh or not laugh,</v>

1942
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:07.800
<v Speaker 4>but don't be rude to the other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are enjoying it.</v>

1943
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:10.800
<v Speaker 4>So as soon as you break your</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensibilities above,</v>

1944
01:29:10.801 --> 01:29:14.070
<v Speaker 4>the rest of the audience will your</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem you've made.</v>

1945
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.420
<v Speaker 4>If you decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1946
01:29:15.421 --> 01:29:17.100
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go home and write about it,</v>

1947
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:18.150
<v Speaker 4>that's totally your prerogative.</v>

1948
01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:19.840
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get up and walk out.</v>

1949
01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1950
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 4>Go somewhere else and talk about it on</v>
<v Speaker 4>stage yourself.</v>

1951
01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 4>Nothing wrong with any of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this one woman's take was like women</v>

1952
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:29.600
<v Speaker 4>don't feel like they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can.</v>

1953
01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:32.850
<v Speaker 4>They have the ability to speak out about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1954
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speak out like so you're saying like to</v>

1955

<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1956

<v Speaker 4>I don't want you on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know everything about you and your</v>

1957
01:29:39.481 --> 01:29:43.110
<v Speaker 4>story and I want you to perform in front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of me.</v>

1958
01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Even those other people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>

1959
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.490
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that these aggressive men were</v>

1960
01:29:47.491 --> 01:29:49.050
<v Speaker 4>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good to see you back.</v>

1961
01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Louis aggressive men like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1962
01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:55.350
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like there's a framing of this</v>

1963
01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:00.300
<v Speaker 4>and this is one of its becomes this male</v>
<v Speaker 4>versus female framing that sort of</v>

1964
01:30:00.301 --> 01:30:04.170
<v Speaker 4>represents aggressive men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual men doing things to women they</v>

1965
01:30:04.171 --> 01:30:06.780
<v Speaker 4>don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The women are sitting there in silence.</v>

1966
01:30:06.781 --> 01:30:09.960
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to be there and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have a voice because they feel</v>

1967
01:30:09.961 --> 01:30:13.950
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmed and overpopulated or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>outnumbered</v>

1968
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:18.230
<v Speaker 2>flurry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Problem is those guys that Harvey and</v>

1969
01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:23.320
<v Speaker 2>him and Matt Lauer and people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are the poster boys for that,</v>

1970
01:30:25.791 --> 01:30:29.340
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to be watched very</v>
<v Speaker 2>closely and how does many of our fitting</v>

1971
01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:30.174
<v Speaker 2>into that</v>

1972
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:32.880
<v Speaker 4>confused by this one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>By all accounts,</v>

1973
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Matt Lauer had affairs right in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>office with girls who worked with them.</v>

1974
01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 4>So what was inappropriate that as he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>having sex with his staff.</v>

1975
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1976
01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was also hitting on people that</v>

1977
01:30:44.271 --> 01:30:46.010
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to be hit on was in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

1978
01:30:46.011 --> 01:30:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the accusations.</v>

1979
01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just,</v>

1980
01:30:49.581 --> 01:30:51.590
<v Speaker 2>he was dating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was also,</v>

1981
01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>

1982
01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:56.400
<v Speaker 2>making weird advancements in the office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1983
01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.800
<v Speaker 2>That all these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these guys,</v>

1984
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:03.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all very complicated.</v>

1985
01:31:03.111 --> 01:31:06.750
<v Speaker 2>They're all very fuzzy kind of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1986
01:31:07.150 --> 01:31:08.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys are going to be watched very</v>

1987
01:31:08.721 --> 01:31:11.480
<v Speaker 2>closely as you see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louie just goes to this little club and</v>

1988
01:31:11.481 --> 01:31:14.270
<v Speaker 2>does a set and it's national news and</v>
<v Speaker 2>national debate.</v>

1989
01:31:14.271 --> 01:31:15.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1990
01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:19.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's heady stuff.</v>

1991
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Teddy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:25.760
<v Speaker 4>What's fascinating is that as a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going through this great time of</v>

1993
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:30.790
<v Speaker 4>change in this great time of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>introspective thinking and of observing</v>

1994
01:31:34.941 --> 01:31:39.830
<v Speaker 4>our behavior and discussing our behavior</v>
<v Speaker 4>and watching this,</v>

1995
01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:42.770
<v Speaker 4>like you have the worst case examples of</v>
<v Speaker 4>which my,</v>

1996
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:43.970
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is cosby.</v>

1997
01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:46.460
<v Speaker 4>Worst case example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugging people.</v>

1998
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:48.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1999
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:50.390
<v Speaker 4>there's a woman who was on television on</v>
<v Speaker 4>CNN.</v>

2000
01:31:50.391 --> 01:31:53.990
<v Speaker 4>She said something that freaked me out</v>
<v Speaker 4>when she said that is entirely possible</v>

2001
01:31:53.991 --> 01:31:58.070
<v Speaker 4>that bill cosby is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most prolific serial rapist in</v>

2002
01:31:58.071 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a big statement I heard that</v>

2003
01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 4>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she's right.</v>

2004
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:04.780
<v Speaker 4>She's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how many,</v>

2005
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.630
<v Speaker 4>how many people does a regular rapist</v>
<v Speaker 4>raped before they get caught?</v>

2006
01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:08.573
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2007
01:32:09.330 --> 01:32:11.010
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the number that came out</v>

2008
01:32:11.011 --> 01:32:13.320
<v Speaker 2>against him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's other people that you</v>

2009
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:14.220
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

2010
01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2011
01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:18.140
<v Speaker 4>That's like the far end of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2012
01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.890
<v Speaker 4>And then on the other end of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>spectrum,</v>

2013
01:32:19.891 --> 01:32:22.660
<v Speaker 4>you've got like Louis [inaudible] who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2014
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:27.230
<v Speaker 4>did something definitely you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to happen to your wife know where</v>

2015
01:32:27.231 --> 01:32:28.560
<v Speaker 4>your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your kids,</v>

2016
01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.910
<v Speaker 4>but your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the whole story.</v>

2017
01:32:31.911 --> 01:32:34.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kurt Kurt Metzger was telling me that</v>

2018
01:32:34.831 --> 01:32:37.410
<v Speaker 4>one of the girls who came out against</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2019
01:32:37.411 --> 01:32:42.110
<v Speaker 4>like they had been flirting like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole weekend and talking about sex like</v>

2020
01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.700
<v Speaker 4>the whole weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he did that and then he had</v>

2021
01:32:44.701 --> 01:32:47.910
<v Speaker 4>sent the girl a text saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really sorry that I did that.</v>

2022
01:32:47.911 --> 01:32:49.230
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry about it.</v>

2023
01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about sex all weekend</v>

2024
01:32:51.570 --> 01:32:56.460
<v Speaker 4>and then when the accusations came out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously there was more accusations</v>

2025
01:32:56.461 --> 01:32:59.910
<v Speaker 4>that seemed to be more egregious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She threw her hat into the mix as well.</v>

2026
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.650
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's true or not</v>

2027
01:33:01.651 --> 01:33:03.270
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with a lot of these stories</v>

2028
01:33:03.271 --> 01:33:05.010
<v Speaker 4>is you're hearing them third,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fourth,</v>

2029
01:33:05.011 --> 01:33:06.780
<v Speaker 4>fifth hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

2030
01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:10.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all you know is he said those stories</v>

2031
01:33:10.021 --> 01:33:14.460
<v Speaker 4>are true and that he recognized that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>did something wrong and he was going to</v>

2032
01:33:14.461 --> 01:33:16.890
<v Speaker 4>take time off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that to me is not a guy defending</v>

2033
01:33:16.891 --> 01:33:18.420
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a guy saying,</v>

2034
01:33:18.450 --> 01:33:19.950
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely fucked up.</v>

2035
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:23.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to step back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he steps back for nine months or</v>

2036
01:33:23.671 --> 01:33:26.280
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people saying that's not long</v>

2037
01:33:26.281 --> 01:33:28.650
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't do anything like you gotta.</v>

2038
01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:31.920
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should someone do?</v>

2039
01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:36.120
<v Speaker 4>Like in one of the things that Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ian Black said on twitter before they</v>

2040
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:39.510
<v Speaker 4>told his Dick off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuffed it in his nose,</v>

2041
01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:45.870
<v Speaker 4>that was a crazy thing to watch because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like super progressive,</v>

2042
01:33:45.871 --> 01:33:48.030
<v Speaker 4>very liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was saying that,</v>

2043
01:33:48.031 --> 01:33:50.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that me too has to offer men of</v>

2044
01:33:50.781 --> 01:33:54.990
<v Speaker 4>road to redemption and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of these women were saying</v>

2045
01:33:54.991 --> 01:33:57.360
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every road to redemption begins</v>

2046
01:33:57.361 --> 01:33:58.410
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

2047
01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.320
<v Speaker 4>which is a very valid point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very valid point.</v>

2048
01:34:01.321 --> 01:34:02.580
<v Speaker 4>Like you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should have to say,</v>

2049
01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:04.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2050
01:34:04.261 --> 01:34:06.060
<v Speaker 4>and I think he's said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

2051
01:34:06.061 --> 01:34:08.250
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what he said to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

2052
01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:11.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean you had to one public</v>

2053
01:34:11.251 --> 01:34:12.570
<v Speaker 4>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did he say I'm sorry.</v>

2054
01:34:12.571 --> 01:34:13.710
<v Speaker 4>And that what public statement,</v>

2055
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:16.830
<v Speaker 2>that times article is kind of like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>availed.</v>

2056
01:34:16.831 --> 01:34:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2057
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:20.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2058
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:23.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hesitate to comment on any of it</v>

2059
01:34:23.161 --> 01:34:28.161
<v Speaker 2>because it's like his mess and like if</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone that comments on it or it comes</v>

2060
01:34:28.231 --> 01:34:30.510
<v Speaker 2>near it or like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the owner of the comedy cellar,</v>

2061
01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.030
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>aftermath,</v>

2062
01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.880
<v Speaker 2>the aftermath of what this guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2063
01:34:35.881 --> 01:34:38.970
<v Speaker 2>why am I as the owner of the seller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2064
01:34:39.150 --> 01:34:42.450
<v Speaker 2>why is he have to get brought into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louise Behavior?</v>

2065
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:47.210
<v Speaker 4>I saw at least a half a dozen articles</v>
<v Speaker 4>written about what a piece of Shit</v>

2066
01:34:47.210 --> 01:34:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Michael Che was for saying that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Louis deserves the opportunity to make a</v>

2067
01:34:51.681 --> 01:34:52.710
<v Speaker 4>living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2068
01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:56.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going after Michael Che and his is</v>

2069
01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 4>useless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2070
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:01.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>

2071
01:35:01.611 --> 01:35:04.190
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're allowed their opinion that</v>

2072
01:35:04.191 --> 01:35:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Michael Che's opinions useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2073
01:35:05.811 --> 01:35:07.700
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the beautiful things</v>
<v Speaker 4>about free expression</v>

2074
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.870
<v Speaker 2>now complete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

2075
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:11.660
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's kind of the most</v>

2076
01:35:11.661 --> 01:35:14.570
<v Speaker 2>interesting for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that I take pleasure in</v>

2077
01:35:14.571 --> 01:35:16.970
<v Speaker 2>any of this because it's horrible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone involved.</v>

2078
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:19.490
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

2079
01:35:19.491 --> 01:35:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's companies that probably won't go</v>

2080
01:35:22.701 --> 01:35:25.310
<v Speaker 2>back into business with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a comedian,</v>

2081
01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could put a show up in the park,</v>

2082
01:35:27.501 --> 01:35:29.210
<v Speaker 2>he could put a show up anywhere he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>

2083
01:35:29.211 --> 01:35:32.600
<v Speaker 2>It's really up to him and people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>protest it.</v>

2084
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:35.480
<v Speaker 2>They can not show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can buy tickets by the thousands.</v>

2085
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:40.750
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be interesting to see when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes that part of his earning and</v>

2086
01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:45.890
<v Speaker 2>that part of his life in his own hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really can't stop him.</v>

2087
01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in that way.</v>

2088
01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's how you frame it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't think,</v>

2089
01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:57.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't think louise a bad guy at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what Louis is a pervert and I</v>

2090
01:35:57.381 --> 01:35:58.730
<v Speaker 4>think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2091
01:35:58.970 --> 01:36:03.230
<v Speaker 4>he's into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think part of it is like being naughty</v>

2092
01:36:03.231 --> 01:36:05.720
<v Speaker 4>and doing something that's forbidden and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2093
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:10.721
<v Speaker 4>in getting away with it and having these</v>
<v Speaker 4>girls like him for being a comedian and</v>

2094
01:36:11.241 --> 01:36:14.690
<v Speaker 4>then doing that to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is just my speculation.</v>

2095
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.650
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of weirdness to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that he's like,</v>

2096
01:36:19.410 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm an angry person and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to be hurtful.</v>

2097
01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:27.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't think any of that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was just terrible judgment.</v>

2098
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:31.700
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could say a lot about it.</v>

2099
01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like what it is,</v>

2100
01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.420
<v Speaker 4>is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not like,</v>

2101
01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.080
<v Speaker 4>he's not trying to hurt people.</v>

2102
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:44.180
<v Speaker 4>I think he's just fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mean let's think about what it is</v>

2103
01:36:44.181 --> 01:36:46.280
<v Speaker 4>he's asking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I jerk off in front of you?</v>

2104
01:36:46.710 --> 01:36:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Like it's the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2105
01:36:47.691 --> 01:36:49.090
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2106
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:54.250
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to that kind of creepy</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit is like the most considerate way to</v>

2107
01:36:54.981 --> 01:36:57.440
<v Speaker 4>approach it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] can I jerk off in front of</v>

2108
01:36:57.441 --> 01:37:00.680
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like literally asking adorable,</v>

2109
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:03.760
<v Speaker 4>so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2110
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:06.260
<v Speaker 4>it is a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not diminishing the effect that it</v>

2111
01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:08.220
<v Speaker 4>would have on a woman who respects them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and wants,</v>

2112
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:10.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she just thinks that he's our friend and</v>

2113
01:37:10.221 --> 01:37:11.570
<v Speaker 4>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got his dick out.</v>

2114
01:37:11.571 --> 01:37:13.610
<v Speaker 4>Like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that's not what I'm</v>

2115
01:37:13.611 --> 01:37:14.160
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

2116
01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

2117
01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:20.520
<v Speaker 2>Those women were obviously very hurt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's degrees of like,</v>

2118
01:37:20.521 --> 01:37:22.530
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see texted this or they said that</v>

2119
01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:27.450
<v Speaker 2>to go out and do that to somebody in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful position and come out and say</v>

2120
01:37:27.451 --> 01:37:30.540
<v Speaker 2>it and know that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate from the world.</v>

2121
01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:34.230
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were in a place that they were hurt</v>

2122
01:37:34.231 --> 01:37:37.080
<v Speaker 2>enough that they felt that they had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say something and do something.</v>

2123
01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just want like on this personal</v>

2124
01:37:40.231 --> 01:37:42.060
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want them to be okay.</v>

2125
01:37:42.090 --> 01:37:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want everybody to be okay.</v>

2126
01:37:43.321 --> 01:37:48.270
<v Speaker 2>You want them to be okay and feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had justice and for coming out,</v>

2127
01:37:48.271 --> 01:37:49.980
<v Speaker 2>being brave enough to come out and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2128
01:37:49.981 --> 01:37:52.560
<v Speaker 2>But you also want to protect people from</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happening again,</v>

2129
01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:53.483
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2130
01:37:53.670 --> 01:37:54.610
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

2131
01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 4>only way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the only ways,</v>

2132
01:37:56.190 --> 01:38:00.840
<v Speaker 2>just like you got to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know this and there was,</v>

2133
01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:02.700
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a feeling,</v>

2134
01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2135
01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 2>the comedy world is separate and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>

2136
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:10.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy environment and nightclub</v>

2137
01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 2>kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you heard when these ones,</v>

2138
01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:18.201
<v Speaker 2>these women came out was now this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of inappropriate that girls,</v>

2139
01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:22.110
<v Speaker 2>women can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't come into a club and just feel</v>

2140
01:38:22.111 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have to field all this stuff</v>

2141
01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:27.030
<v Speaker 2>and guys hitting on them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it kind of made you look at the</v>

2142
01:38:27.031 --> 01:38:31.260
<v Speaker 2>scene and be like alright maybe this</v>
<v Speaker 2>scene could be cleaned up a little bit</v>

2143
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:32.183
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

2144
01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:37.220
<v Speaker 4>It's like what I was saying about really</v>
<v Speaker 4>a worse version of working out at a gay</v>

2145
01:38:37.221 --> 01:38:40.520
<v Speaker 4>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you go to a gay gym and you see</v>

2146
01:38:40.521 --> 01:38:44.540
<v Speaker 4>men Leer at you get that feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys want to have sex with you and</v>

2147
01:38:44.541 --> 01:38:46.070
<v Speaker 4>you definitely don't want to have sex</v>
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>

2148
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:49.190
<v Speaker 4>That is how women feel all the time.</v>

2149
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're coming to the comedy store or</v>

2150
01:38:51.731 --> 01:38:55.480
<v Speaker 2>wherever and you're trying to just start</v>
<v Speaker 2>out as a comic and that's such a big</v>

2151
01:38:55.481 --> 01:38:58.330
<v Speaker 2>thing already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you throw a whole nother level</v>

2152
01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:01.960
<v Speaker 2>layer on it that everyone's hitting on</v>
<v Speaker 2>you from the doorman to the headliner.</v>

2153
01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:05.980
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be a big thing and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2154
01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.190
<v Speaker 2>So I think that those women should feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

2155
01:39:09.191 --> 01:39:12.550
<v Speaker 2>that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely made an impact.</v>

2156
01:39:12.551 --> 01:39:14.980
<v Speaker 2>They should know that they've been heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they,</v>

2157
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:17.770
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shined a light on something that</v>

2158
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:22.480
<v Speaker 2>even people that were in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men that were in it were unaware of.</v>

2159
01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were definitely heard.</v>

2160
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:28.710
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult for people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>consider really objectively consider</v>

2161
01:39:28.711 --> 01:39:31.170
<v Speaker 4>other people's perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like really,</v>

2162
01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.460
<v Speaker 4>people consider it in a convenient way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2163
01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:36.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they know what they can get away</v>

2164
01:39:36.391 --> 01:39:38.850
<v Speaker 4>with what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really consider how the other</v>

2165
01:39:38.851 --> 01:39:42.510
<v Speaker 4>person feels and thinks and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's on both sides.</v>

2166
01:39:42.511 --> 01:39:44.670
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's inconsiderate women is</v>

2167
01:39:44.671 --> 01:39:46.580
<v Speaker 4>inconsiderate men and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2168
01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.180
<v Speaker 4>we both do it to each other and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>people develop bad traits and bad</v>

2169
01:39:51.181 --> 01:39:55.200
<v Speaker 4>associations with the opposite sex and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very common thing that people do.</v>

2170
01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.680
<v Speaker 4>But I think situations where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion is so emotionally charged</v>

2171
01:40:03.031 --> 01:40:05.070
<v Speaker 4>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good for us.</v>

2172
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:07.530
<v Speaker 4>It's good for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It allows the,</v>

2173
01:40:07.531 --> 01:40:09.810
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this public discourse.</v>

2174
01:40:09.811 --> 01:40:12.090
<v Speaker 4>It allows this public discussion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:12.760
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2176
01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.530
<v Speaker 2>and there hasn't been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2177
01:40:15.670 --> 01:40:19.960
<v Speaker 2>people that have gotten hurt by that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have come out and said it,</v>

2178
01:40:19.961 --> 01:40:23.650
<v Speaker 2>like in our scene where they're like</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice people and they've been attacked.</v>

2179
01:40:23.651 --> 01:40:25.570
<v Speaker 2>It was very few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

2180
01:40:25.571 --> 01:40:27.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some big important people in</v>

2181
01:40:27.371 --> 01:40:30.290
<v Speaker 2>this scene and they're acting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriately and then,</v>

2182
01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2183
01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely woken up and moved it</v>

2184
01:40:34.481 --> 01:40:35.410
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2185
01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I have a funny daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you have a funny daughter who</v>

2186
01:40:38.531 --> 01:40:41.020
<v Speaker 2>knows if they see our life and want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go pursue it.</v>

2187
01:40:41.021 --> 01:40:44.710
<v Speaker 2>You want them to be able to go to a club</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not have to deal with a whole</v>

2188
01:40:44.711 --> 01:40:47.290
<v Speaker 2>nother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's enough when you're starting out to</v>

2189
01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:51.160
<v Speaker 2>get five minutes of good material and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the audience to like you and get the</v>

2190
01:40:51.161 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 2>respect of your peers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you got to have about someone</v>

2191
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:56.140
<v Speaker 2>following you in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the parking lot.</v>

2192
01:40:56.170 --> 01:40:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine who's a comic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she got hit on by.</v>

2193
01:40:59.381 --> 01:41:02.800
<v Speaker 2>This other guy was a comic who shall</v>
<v Speaker 2>remain nameless.</v>

2194
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:05.740
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she showed me some of the texts that he</v>

2195
01:41:05.741 --> 01:41:07.810
<v Speaker 2>sent her and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2196
01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.310
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them was like,</v>

2197
01:41:09.311 --> 01:41:12.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one that can make you calm</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something fucking crazy.</v>

2198
01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm Jeez.</v>

2199
01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2200
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.410
<v Speaker 2>hey bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:22.240
<v Speaker 2>But those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then it comes down to,</v>

2202
01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:25.120
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these women were heard.</v>

2203
01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's created a movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2204
01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.210
<v Speaker 2>but then it becomes on the other side it</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes about.</v>

2205
01:41:31.211 --> 01:41:35.740
<v Speaker 2>But did this man's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he punished enough and do we have</v>

2206
01:41:35.741 --> 01:41:39.250
<v Speaker 2>control over whether or not he's allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come back to the audience?</v>

2207
01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Like for a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2208
01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:43.720
<v Speaker 2>the thing about a guy being angry with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2209
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.810
<v Speaker 2>it carries that threat of physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>

2210
01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:49.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different thing.</v>

2211
01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.930
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking I was on a hike the other</v>

2212
01:41:52.931 --> 01:41:56.680
<v Speaker 2>day and I was thinking about that fine</v>
<v Speaker 2>line at the end of the night in a bar.</v>

2213
01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Those meat head guys were trying to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit on girls and when it doesn't work</v>

2214
01:42:00.821 --> 01:42:02.590
<v Speaker 2>they decide they're just going to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>

2215
01:42:02.591 --> 01:42:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't lesbian know that they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight.</v>

2216
01:42:04.211 --> 01:42:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fine line between,</v>

2217
01:42:07.571 --> 01:42:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2218
01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:12.040
<v Speaker 2>They're both almost violent acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like aggressively hitting on women</v>

2219
01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:13.420
<v Speaker 2>and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to happen.</v>

2220
01:42:13.421 --> 01:42:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Well screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way that has been</v>

2221
01:42:15.521 --> 01:42:17.350
<v Speaker 2>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just frustration,</v>

2222
01:42:17.710 --> 01:42:22.710
<v Speaker 2>but you know it's traded but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for looking at a male doing that,</v>

2223
01:42:24.251 --> 01:42:28.810
<v Speaker 2>like it isn't aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an aggressive animal here and a</v>

2224
01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:31.510
<v Speaker 2>one minute he could've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've said yes and brought him home</v>

2225
01:42:31.511 --> 01:42:34.210
<v Speaker 2>with me when I said no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he's punching that guy in the</v>

2226
01:42:34.211 --> 01:42:39.211
<v Speaker 2>parking lot though I don't want really a</v>
<v Speaker 2>common narrative whenever don't get</v>

2227
01:42:39.341 --> 01:42:40.870
<v Speaker 2>laid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to hit on girls and they just</v>

2228
01:42:40.871 --> 01:42:42.040
<v Speaker 2>beat the shit out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:42:42.041 --> 01:42:43.390
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2230
01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.420
<v Speaker 2>this fucking sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it happens all the time.</v>

2231
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's such in my body and you know,</v>

2232
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.340
<v Speaker 2>when you're walking down the in the.</v>

2233
01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Even in the village you're walking down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the street and there's just like an</v>

2234
01:42:52.630 --> 01:42:56.800
<v Speaker 2>angry frat group of guys just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>raging drunk,</v>

2235
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:59.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to get laid at minutes</v>

2236

<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2237
01:43:00.251 --> 01:43:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Male anchors my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point being that there's men are</v>

2238
01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:09.300
<v Speaker 2>formidable creatures and they're big and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hairy and there's why the 7</v>

2239
01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.800
<v Speaker 2>billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because men are gross and they shoot</v>

2240
01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:14.830
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's shooting loads into people.</v>

2241
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Especially at your weightlifting gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend,</v>

2242
01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:21.710
<v Speaker 2>a gay friend in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York and that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean it's to the point where when</v>

<v Speaker 3>ceiling like that hits where your biceps</v>

2258
01:44:00.190 --> 01:44:03.740

2272
01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even weirder when it's packaged</v>

2273
01:44:40.881 --> 01:44:44.290
<v Speaker 3>with advertising and sleekness and music</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2274
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:47.810
<v Speaker 3>and then you see it in real life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are tech sells baby and then on</v>

<v Speaker 3>imagery.</v>

2279
01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like you'll be grateful and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're old and your sex drive is gone?</v>

2280
01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:03.980

<v Speaker 3>Then I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad.</v>

2282
01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.550
<v Speaker 3>What do you hate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sex?</v>

2283
01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:11.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about sex being bad.</v>

2284
01:45:11.001 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 3>It's about being an asshole and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>also about the shit roll.</v>

2285
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:18.470
<v Speaker 3>The dice that you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're physically unattractive,</v>

2286
01:45:18.471 --> 01:45:21.680
<v Speaker 3>what's difficult to get someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>attracted to you that's hard to.</v>

2287
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:25.670
<v Speaker 3>That is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is inescapable reality of some</v>

2288
01:45:25.671 --> 01:45:28.250
<v Speaker 3>people's bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people were just,</v>

2289
01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:33.690
<v Speaker 3>they have bad genetics and then it must</v>
<v Speaker 3>be insanely frustrating.</v>

2290
01:45:33.710 --> 01:45:37.010
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you got to just find someone</v>

2291
01:45:37.011 --> 01:45:37.940
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny looking.</v>

2292
01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Then you don't want them</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hit on you the way she hit on a</v>

2293
01:45:42.891 --> 01:45:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Michael Douglas movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they hired and able bodied actor to play</v>

2298
01:46:00.531 --> 01:46:01.820

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2299
01:46:01.821 --> 01:46:04.880
<v Speaker 3>how many elephant men are in the actor's</v>
<v Speaker 3>guild?</v>

2300
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:08.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exhausting keeping up with</v>

2301
01:46:08.901 --> 01:46:11.090
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every.</v>

2302
01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:13.370
<v Speaker 3>Everything is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

2303
01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2304
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:16.280
<v Speaker 3>this is the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>

2305
01:46:16.281 --> 01:46:20.600
<v Speaker 3>like we're getting outraged and</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions and then it'll kind of come</v>

2306
01:46:20.601 --> 01:46:24.980
<v Speaker 3>back to a normal stranger things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>elephant man remake criticized by</v>

2307
01:46:24.981 --> 01:46:28.040
<v Speaker 3>disability charity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what this is?</v>

2308
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Do you know you need a good actor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2309
01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:32.130
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't be happy.</v>

2310
01:46:32.150 --> 01:46:34.010
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

2311
01:46:34.011 --> 01:46:37.520
<v Speaker 3>No disrespect to the disability charity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of these disability charities</v>

2312
01:46:37.521 --> 01:46:41.390
<v Speaker 3>criticized this just so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>highlight their charity and it's very</v>

2313
01:46:41.391 --> 01:46:44.630
<v Speaker 3>good for the charity if they criticize</v>
<v Speaker 3>things because it makes people aware of</v>

2314
01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:46.250
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a big public story and then</v>

2315
01:46:46.251 --> 01:46:49.440
<v Speaker 3>they get donations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad for them to consider the</v>

2316
01:46:49.441 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2317
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 2>they're probably just artists trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the film and who knows if they're</v>

2318
01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:55.800
<v Speaker 2>good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know that they're going to</v>

2319
01:46:55.801 --> 01:46:56.634
<v Speaker 2>respect it.</v>

2320
01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:01.500
<v Speaker 3>No need disability person in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>person with disability to play a person</v>

2321
01:47:01.501 --> 01:47:04.140
<v Speaker 3>with disability period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You piece of shit.</v>

2322
01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:07.500
<v Speaker 3>But isn't that what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up and let people have</v>

2323
01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:10.080
<v Speaker 3>disability speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I thought acting was pretending.</v>

2324
01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:15.110
<v Speaker 3>How about something that you're not</v>

<v Speaker 3>day and so I'll,</v>

2371
01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:11.020
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll knock me out of Ketosis for a few</v>

2372
01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:12.790
<v Speaker 3>hours and knocked me back just a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

2373
01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But right now I'm in a,</v>

2374
01:49:14.890 --> 01:49:17.620
<v Speaker 3>you would call it mild ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at my pis strip,</v>

2375
01:49:17.650 --> 01:49:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I put it up on my instagram is a chart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shows you like the darkest to the</v>

2376
01:49:22.151 --> 01:49:23.410
<v Speaker 3>lightest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Several been on it for five days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six days.</v>

2379
01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.360
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always feel good.</v>

2380
01:49:32.230 --> 01:49:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I get used to doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm used to,</v>

2381
01:49:34.271 --> 01:49:36.820
<v Speaker 3>it seems to weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like I'm not on that spectrum at</v>

2382
01:49:36.821 --> 01:49:40.690
<v Speaker 3>all because it dried out a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I put it up to what happens if</v>

2383
01:49:40.691 --> 01:49:45.691
<v Speaker 3>you eat a slice of vetoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll knock me down to that negative was</v>

2384
01:49:46.511 --> 01:49:47.540
<v Speaker 3>nothing back.</v>

2385
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.930
<v Speaker 3>I would call that one slice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2386
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:52.450
<v Speaker 3>I would call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm somewhere in the range of moderate,</v>

2387
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.030
<v Speaker 3>moderate Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate,</v>

2388
01:49:55.031 --> 01:49:56.500
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pissed on him.</v>

2389
01:49:56.501 --> 01:49:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Then I let this trip sit for a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit and it dried and it looks a little</v>

2390
01:49:59.531 --> 01:50:01.090
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disgusting.</v>

2391
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it does for me though,</v>

2392
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:09.220
<v Speaker 3>it's very good for my appetite and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive benefits like my mind feels</v>

2393
01:50:09.221 --> 01:50:10.750
<v Speaker 3>clear when you put them on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2394
01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a certain amount of fog</v>

2395
01:50:13.151 --> 01:50:15.640
<v Speaker 3>that comes with carbohydrate consumption</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much.</v>

2396
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:16.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2397
01:50:16.721 --> 01:50:19.810
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate consumption in general and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2398
01:50:19.811 --> 01:50:24.070
<v Speaker 3>when you eat carbohydrates post</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate consumption is a lack of</v>

2399
01:50:24.071 --> 01:50:27.790
<v Speaker 3>mental clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a down turn of the way your brain</v>

2400
01:50:27.791 --> 01:50:30.050
<v Speaker 3>functions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I call that sleep nap.</v>

2401
01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:32.710
<v Speaker 3>Time nap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat sweet,</v>

2402
01:50:32.711 --> 01:50:33.820
<v Speaker 3>sweet nap time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nap time.</v>

2403
01:50:34.230 --> 01:50:36.220
<v Speaker 3>When you and I contrast in many ways my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend,</v>

2404
01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:38.460
<v Speaker 3>I try and dial it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you know.</v>

2409
01:50:45.641 --> 01:50:49.060
<v Speaker 3>of my favorite dishes on planet earth is</v>
<v Speaker 3>linguine with clams.</v>

2410
01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.290
<v Speaker 3>When I want to go off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I was in Italy,</v>

2411
01:50:53.291 --> 01:50:55.000
<v Speaker 3>I was in Italy a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2412
01:50:55.090 --> 01:50:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Where'd you go to everyday?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ravello Ravello where's the Amalfi</v>

2413
01:50:59.321 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 3>coast?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went to copper and we took a boat to</v>

2414
01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:06.190
<v Speaker 3>copper and we ate there and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal food.</v>

2415
01:51:06.191 --> 01:51:09.880
<v Speaker 3>The food was outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fresh clams with the sardines man</v>

2416
01:51:09.881 --> 01:51:14.760
<v Speaker 3>filets starting filets in olive oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the best.</v>

2417
01:51:14.761 --> 01:51:16.390
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2418
01:51:16.391 --> 01:51:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good clams.</v>

2419
01:51:17.561 --> 01:51:19.280
<v Speaker 3>The clamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was so fresh.</v>

2420
01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:21.720
<v Speaker 3>But it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were um,</v>

2421
01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:25.420
<v Speaker 3>a Valentine Thomas who is a professional</v>
<v Speaker 3>pr spear.</v>

2422
01:51:25.421 --> 01:51:27.760
<v Speaker 3>Fisher person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was on the other day and she was</v>

2423
01:51:27.761 --> 01:51:31.720
<v Speaker 3>saying that the oceans in that area are</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely overfished.</v>

2424
01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:33.181
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:51:33.181 --> 01:51:35.560
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost impossible for a regular</v>

2426
01:51:35.561 --> 01:51:39.310
<v Speaker 3>person to go there and catch a fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Texas overfished everything.</v>

2427
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:43.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a bummer being alive now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a bummer that every,</v>

2428
01:51:43.650 --> 01:51:45.820
<v Speaker 3>everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always the end of whatever.</v>

2429
01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.690
<v Speaker 3>It's the end of the coral reef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the end of these animals running</v>

2430
01:51:49.691 --> 01:51:52.750
<v Speaker 3>through the woods at the end of such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bummer.</v>

2431
01:51:53.730 --> 01:51:56.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even like I tried to show my kids</v>

2432
01:51:56.141 --> 01:51:59.800
<v Speaker 3>like nice nature videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I used to watch with my dad and</v>

2433
01:51:59.830 --> 01:52:02.560
<v Speaker 3>everyone at the end is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is going away,</v>

2434
01:52:02.561 --> 01:52:03.780
<v Speaker 3>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ugh.</v>

2435
01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:06.220
<v Speaker 3>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it is going away.</v>

2436
01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of it.</v>

2437
01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:14.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's how you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're definitely in an</v>

2438
01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.930
<v Speaker 3>unsustainable path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2439
01:52:16.931 --> 01:52:19.420
<v Speaker 3>In terms of just what we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculturally.</v>

2440
01:52:19.421 --> 01:52:21.640
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to farmers and you</v>

2441
01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.370
<v Speaker 3>appreciate this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do with large scale</v>

2442
01:52:24.371 --> 01:52:27.460
<v Speaker 3>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to grow food in the</v>

2443
01:52:27.461 --> 01:52:32.461
<v Speaker 3>same plot of land for fucking 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Corn and just constantly soy,</v>

2444
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:36.670
<v Speaker 3>throwing minerals on the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly growing and then you get</v>

2445
01:52:36.671 --> 01:52:39.370
<v Speaker 3>these minerally deficient plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2446
01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:41.310
<v Speaker 3>they're just not the same and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

2447
01:52:41.490 --> 01:52:44.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing is good for is</v>

2448
01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>like deer because deer</v>

2449
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 4>can combine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat all your corn when they want.</v>

2450
01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:50.780
<v Speaker 4>You get a high population of deer in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>area,</v>

2451
01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:54.830
<v Speaker 4>but you're not supposed to feed cattle</v>
<v Speaker 4>corn either.</v>

2452
01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:57.560
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depends also like wildlife is</v>

2453
01:52:57.561 --> 01:53:01.310
<v Speaker 4>supposed to exist in like wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 4>habitat,</v>

2454
01:53:01.311 --> 01:53:06.311
<v Speaker 4>which is like forests and grasslands and</v>
<v Speaker 4>meadows and sun fed.</v>

2455
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 4>Fed plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:53:08.961 --> 01:53:11.480
<v Speaker 4>They're supposed to be wandering around</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating all these things.</v>

2457
01:53:11.481 --> 01:53:16.290
<v Speaker 4>They're not supposed to be existing in</v>
<v Speaker 4>these massive thousand Acre Cornfield,</v>

2458
01:53:16.370 --> 01:53:17.690
<v Speaker 4>so great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird.</v>

2459
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:21.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like white tailed deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To a certain extent.</v>

2460
01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:24.770
<v Speaker 4>This country have become like farm</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals there go weird farm animal</v>

2461
01:53:24.771 --> 01:53:26.090
<v Speaker 4>that's not in a fence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2462
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:29.180
<v Speaker 4>They're just always around farms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just eating farm food.</v>

2463
01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:29.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2464
01:53:29.941 --> 01:53:33.800
<v Speaker 4>Like my friend Doug had this interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought about that.</v>

2465
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:35.750
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are.</v>

2466
01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:41.110
<v Speaker 4>He goes to my cows are eating grass</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he has a farm barn.</v>

2467
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:44.510
<v Speaker 4>The cows are eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those cows are natural,</v>

2468
01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:46.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're organic.</v>

2469
01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:50.930
<v Speaker 4>They're eating grass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My dear are eating gmo corn who also the</v>

2470
01:53:50.931 --> 01:53:53.180
<v Speaker 4>deer that are on my property.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That desert wild.</v>

2471
01:53:53.210 --> 01:53:56.780
<v Speaker 4>The wild animals are not organic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>

2472
01:53:56.781 --> 01:54:00.080
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy because you're eating</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's totally unnatural for</v>

2473
01:54:00.081 --> 01:54:01.850
<v Speaker 4>them to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is gmo corn.</v>

2474
01:54:01.851 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Speaker 4>Corn is everywhere and it's gmo corn</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's growing this corn.</v>

2475
01:54:05.601 --> 01:54:06.530
<v Speaker 4>That side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2476
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:10.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like Monsanto corn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's growing this roundup fucking</v>

2477
01:54:10.011 --> 01:54:12.650
<v Speaker 4>sprayed corn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had these deer eating</v>

2478
01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:19.040
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet the cows that are in captivity</v>

2479
01:54:19.130 --> 01:54:23.690
<v Speaker 4>are grazing naturally grass and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred percent organic.</v>

2480
01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:24.740
<v Speaker 4>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>

2481
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:26.150
<v Speaker 4>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

2482
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:30.860
<v Speaker 4>I was reading that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the whole fertilizer thing that we</v>

2483
01:54:30.890 --> 01:54:34.800
<v Speaker 4>weren't able to get nitrogen out of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>air until this one scientist did it.</v>

2484
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:36.500
<v Speaker 4>Fritz Haber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fritz Haber.</v>

2485
01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:37.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those.</v>

2486
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:40.220
<v Speaker 4>The same guy who created Zyklon Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2487
01:54:40.730 --> 01:54:41.301
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2488
01:54:41.301 --> 01:54:43.970
<v Speaker 4>He was a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a Jew is a Jew in Germany and he</v>

2489
01:54:43.971 --> 01:54:45.390
<v Speaker 4>was there in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2490
01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:49.550
<v Speaker 4>in World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was the guy who created the gas that</v>

2491
01:54:49.551 --> 01:54:53.180
<v Speaker 4>they use to spray on the allies and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

2492
01:54:53.181 --> 01:54:55.790
<v Speaker 4>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he created the hopper method for</v>

2493
01:54:55.791 --> 01:54:58.520
<v Speaker 4>extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which led to,</v>

2494
01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:00.080
<v Speaker 4>they think that the nitrogen and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's.</v>

2495
01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:03.240
<v Speaker 4>There's a great radio lab podcast on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2496
01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called the bad show and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>shows how sometimes good people also do</v>

2497
01:55:09.231 --> 01:55:12.170
<v Speaker 4>horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Fritz harbor was one of the ones</v>

2498
01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:13.610
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they highlighted.</v>

2499
01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:18.830
<v Speaker 4>But when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were going to give him the</v>

2500
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:22.400
<v Speaker 4>Nobel prize for creating the harbor</v>
<v Speaker 4>method for extracting nitrogen from the</v>

2501
01:55:22.401 --> 01:55:24.860
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the air around us is 80 percent</v>

2502
01:55:24.861 --> 01:55:26.630
<v Speaker 4>nitrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you couldn't get it out right.</v>

2503
01:55:26.690 --> 01:55:27.320
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't get it out.</v>

2504
01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.060
<v Speaker 4>He figured out how to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when we breed,</v>

2505
01:55:29.061 --> 01:55:31.270
<v Speaker 4>we think we breathing in oxygen mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2506
01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:36.280
<v Speaker 4>it's mostly nitrogen and then some</v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen and he figured out how to get it</v>

2507
01:55:36.531 --> 01:55:41.531
<v Speaker 4>out and turn it into fertilizer and use</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in on soil and really increased</v>

2508
01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:44.580
<v Speaker 4>radically the amount of food that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are able to grow.</v>

2509
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.000
<v Speaker 4>He also at the same time figured out how</v>
<v Speaker 4>to spray gas on on the troops,</v>

2510
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:52.470
<v Speaker 4>so they wanted him for crimes against</v>
<v Speaker 4>humanity.</v>

2511
01:55:52.471 --> 01:55:55.140
<v Speaker 4>They wanted him for war crime at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>

2512
01:55:55.141 --> 01:55:56.550
<v Speaker 4>They were going to give him the Nobel</v>
<v Speaker 4>prize.</v>

2513
01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking car.</v>

2514
01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:04.580
<v Speaker 4>And then they used his gas for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>concentration on his family.</v>

2515
01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:09.210
<v Speaker 4>Check this out and his extended family</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he created [inaudible] on gas.</v>

2516
01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:13.710
<v Speaker 4>But he puts in Zyklon A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a smell that they attached to it</v>

2517
01:56:13.711 --> 01:56:16.530
<v Speaker 4>so that you were aware of when the gas</v>
<v Speaker 4>was present,</v>

2518
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:18.990
<v Speaker 4>so like if you were working with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there was a leak,</v>

2519
01:56:18.991 --> 01:56:20.160
<v Speaker 4>it was a very obvious smell.</v>

2520
01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:25.370
<v Speaker 4>The Nazis took cycle on a and remove</v>
<v Speaker 4>that smell and turned to design clumpy,</v>

2521
01:56:25.801 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 4>which they used to spray the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people in the concentration camp.</v>

2522
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:34.590
<v Speaker 4>Jews and his family got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of his extended family was killed</v>

2523
01:56:34.591 --> 01:56:37.740
<v Speaker 4>with the very gas that he created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2524
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he died.</v>

2525
01:56:38.971 --> 01:56:41.910
<v Speaker 4>He was exiled from Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing was horrible.</v>

2526
01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:45.090
<v Speaker 4>His.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a Jew and so he tried to stand up</v>

2527
01:56:45.091 --> 01:56:48.630
<v Speaker 4>for Jews as scientists and as people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was like slowly getting pushed</v>

2528
01:56:48.631 --> 01:56:51.000
<v Speaker 4>out of the Nazis were taking control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2529
01:56:51.001 --> 01:56:53.360
<v Speaker 4>And then he wanted to believe in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>country and he attack.</v>

2530
01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.473
<v Speaker 4>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had,</v>

2531
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:56.930
<v Speaker 4>he had terrible health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2532
01:56:56.970 --> 01:56:59.700
<v Speaker 4>And he died like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was going to Switzerland for</v>

2533
01:56:59.701 --> 01:57:02.070
<v Speaker 4>treatment and he wound up dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's little,</v>

2534
01:57:02.150 --> 01:57:04.470
<v Speaker 4>his wife killed herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wife shot himself,</v>

2535
01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:07.590
<v Speaker 4>shot herself in the chest in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2536
01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.473
<v Speaker 4>in front of.</v>

2537
01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:11.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was him and his son and he left his</v>

2538
01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:15.480
<v Speaker 4>13 year old son with his dead wife and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then went back to war.</v>

2539
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:17.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.890
<v Speaker 4>She did it because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he was killing people with gas.</v>

2541
01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Is Gas was used.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was.</v>

2542
01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.020
<v Speaker 4>She was apparently gravely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was a scientist as well.</v>

2543
01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was gravely upset at the direction</v>

2544
01:57:27.691 --> 01:57:31.530
<v Speaker 4>that his science had taken that he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was involved in this new thing.</v>

2545
01:57:31.531 --> 01:57:34.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine you're the architect of this new</v>

2546
01:57:34.231 --> 01:57:37.400
<v Speaker 4>method of killing mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Extermination.</v>

2547
01:57:37.410 --> 01:57:39.540
<v Speaker 4>But then here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the other problem with that.</v>

2548
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:41.760
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy,</v>

2549
01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:43.680
<v Speaker 4>but what does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

2550
01:57:43.681 --> 01:57:46.140
<v Speaker 4>Like he's too good at killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2551
01:57:46.141 --> 01:57:50.370
<v Speaker 4>we don't believe in killing people by</v>
<v Speaker 4>having them choked to death on the fluid</v>

2552
01:57:50.371 --> 01:57:52.290
<v Speaker 4>in their lungs is built up because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>poison.</v>

2553
01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.450
<v Speaker 4>We would rather you take a bullet to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick,</v>

2554
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:59.750
<v Speaker 4>like</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck you were in war cannons</v>

2555
01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:00.570
<v Speaker 4>and people.</v>

2556
01:58:00.570 --> 01:58:05.570
<v Speaker 4>They have these gigantic 50 millimeter</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns blowing people to smithereens and</v>

2557
01:58:06.211 --> 01:58:08.280
<v Speaker 4>that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the gas is not okay.</v>

2558
01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:11.010
<v Speaker 4>Like we have rules where we're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to kill,</v>

2559
01:58:11.011 --> 01:58:13.470
<v Speaker 4>kill the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

2560
01:58:13.650 --> 01:58:18.030
<v Speaker 4>We're dropping nuclear bombs on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</v>

2561
01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Nuclear bombs that are completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>indiscriminate.</v>

2562
01:58:20.731 --> 01:58:23.700
<v Speaker 4>Wipe out entire cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Killed hundreds of thousands of people</v>

2563
01:58:23.701 --> 01:58:25.710
<v Speaker 4>in one blast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's okay,</v>

2564
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:27.120
<v Speaker 4>but that's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gas,</v>

2565
01:58:27.610 --> 01:58:31.410
<v Speaker 4>that gas is dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an asshole to use the gas bro.</v>

2566
01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.260
<v Speaker 4>Terrible stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>

2567
01:58:34.261 --> 01:58:36.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a very terrible store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird store.</v>

2568
01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:40.020
<v Speaker 4>So then he created,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they took that and that's where</v>

2569
01:58:40.021 --> 01:58:42.250
<v Speaker 4>fertilizer came from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know where he went wrong.</v>

2570
01:58:42.610 --> 01:58:47.440
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to fund the war effort by</v>
<v Speaker 3>extracting gold from the ocean who is</v>

2571
01:58:47.441 --> 01:58:51.430
<v Speaker 3>convinced that just like his hobby or</v>
<v Speaker 3>method of extracting nitrogen from the</v>

2572
01:58:51.431 --> 01:58:53.230
<v Speaker 3>air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going to be able to because the</v>

2573
01:58:53.231 --> 01:58:56.140
<v Speaker 3>ocean has gold in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very small amounts of gold,</v>

2574
01:58:56.141 --> 01:58:58.540
<v Speaker 3>but he felt like if you could get it all</v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

2575
01:58:58.690 --> 01:59:02.710
<v Speaker 3>it would be a large amount and he could</v>
<v Speaker 3>extract that gold from the ocean and</v>

2576
01:59:02.711 --> 01:59:07.420
<v Speaker 3>then use it to fund the war effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like you and I have a treasure</v>

2577
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:12.780
<v Speaker 3>to do once the bread shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but gold show,</v>

2578
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:16.880
<v Speaker 3>tom and joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scuba gear on bags.</v>

2579
01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Harbor Gold process is unique for</v>
<v Speaker 3>several reasons.</v>

2580
01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:25.660
<v Speaker 3>It effectively is capable of yielding</v>
<v Speaker 3>extraction efficiencies with complex</v>

2581
01:59:25.730 --> 01:59:30.520
<v Speaker 3>oars in the high 90 percent range with</v>
<v Speaker 3>gold purity in the 99 percent range.</v>

2582
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:34.780
<v Speaker 3>Preprocessing prior to process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We carefully analyze the or for the</v>

2583
01:59:34.781 --> 01:59:38.140
<v Speaker 3>content of other minerals and or</v>
<v Speaker 3>constituents.</v>

2584
01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:41.170
<v Speaker 3>So is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this something that they actually</v>

2585
01:59:41.171 --> 01:59:42.070
<v Speaker 3>use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2586
01:59:42.370 --> 01:59:45.280
<v Speaker 3>maybe they use it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use it for other things that didn't</v>

2587
01:59:45.281 --> 01:59:47.950
<v Speaker 3>go to the society and I eliminated</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sinai.</v>

2588
01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:50.500
<v Speaker 3>He was a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

2589
01:59:50.830 --> 01:59:53.320
<v Speaker 3>The gold thing didn't pan out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wink,</v>

2590
01:59:53.321 --> 01:59:54.041
<v Speaker 3>wink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nudge,</v>

2591
01:59:54.041 --> 01:59:56.260
<v Speaker 3>nudge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no pun intended.</v>

2592
01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pan for gold.</v>

2593
02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:04.270
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he apparently worked on that for</v>

2594
02:00:04.271 --> 02:00:06.850
<v Speaker 3>years and years and it just never came</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fruition.</v>

2595
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Well that was his failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as big success,</v>

2596
02:00:10.170 --> 02:00:13.180
<v Speaker 3>he felt like he was going to recreate</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nitrogen method with the gold</v>

2597
02:00:13.181 --> 02:00:15.670
<v Speaker 3>method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like figure it out another way to just</v>

2598
02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:18.190
<v Speaker 3>be a hero for Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

2599
02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:20.110
<v Speaker 3>An amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

2600
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:23.740
<v Speaker 3>What's so now we're left with corn being</v>
<v Speaker 3>fed to cows,</v>

2601
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:29.440
<v Speaker 3>has corn in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is awful.</v>

2602
02:00:29.530 --> 02:00:33.160
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing is I read about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff and uh,</v>

2603
02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you read about this,</v>

2604
02:00:35.230 --> 02:00:38.740
<v Speaker 3>it's such an unnatural thing that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing to the cattle to feed them this</v>

2605
02:00:38.741 --> 02:00:41.710
<v Speaker 3>corn and dualism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But are we at a point where there's just</v>

2606
02:00:41.711 --> 02:00:45.970
<v Speaker 3>so many people on the planet that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the only way you can do it?</v>

2607
02:00:45.971 --> 02:00:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Or is there other ways to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like a,</v>

2608
02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:49.474
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna read you.</v>

2609
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Some people are always complaining about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the methane gas that's produced by cows</v>

2610
02:00:53.951 --> 02:00:56.690
<v Speaker 3>and that was one of the big arguments</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people would say,</v>

2611
02:00:56.691 --> 02:01:01.510
<v Speaker 3>well one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 3>should not eat cows is because if you do</v>

2612
02:01:01.511 --> 02:01:03.100
<v Speaker 3>eat cows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you're on like that</v>

2613
02:01:03.101 --> 02:01:06.100
<v Speaker 3>carnivore diet and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you eat is cows.</v>

2614
02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:09.610
<v Speaker 3>It has a massive negative contribution</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the environment.</v>

2615
02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:14.470
<v Speaker 3>But Sean Baker sent me this scientific</v>
<v Speaker 3>overview and it says in the</v>

2616
02:01:14.471 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 3>environmental side of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entirety of all plants and animal</v>

2617
02:01:18.701 --> 02:01:22.320
<v Speaker 3>agriculture contributes to nine percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the total unit.</v>

2618
02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:26.350
<v Speaker 3>US greenhouse gas emissions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal agriculture makes up about four</v>

2619
02:01:26.351 --> 02:01:28.530
<v Speaker 3>percent and cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2620
02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:33.540
<v Speaker 3>specifically about one point nine</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent based on the latest EPA data.</v>

2621
02:01:35.890 --> 02:01:39.710
<v Speaker 3>If every single person in the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States gives up eating meat and went</v>

2622
02:01:39.711 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 3>vegan</v>

2623
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:42.980
<v Speaker 4>end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single animal were to magically</v>

2624
02:01:42.981 --> 02:01:45.950
<v Speaker 4>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The overall worldwide effect on</v>

2625
02:01:45.951 --> 02:01:50.951
<v Speaker 4>greenhouse gas emissions would be about</v>
<v Speaker 4>less than one percent difference.</v>

2626
02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:55.220
<v Speaker 4>But as I spoke with a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frank,</v>

2627
02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:00.640
<v Speaker 4>I say this guy's name mid low her from a</v>
<v Speaker 4>UC Davis,</v>

2628
02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:04.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the world's leading authorities</v>

2629
02:02:04.371 --> 02:02:06.770
<v Speaker 4>on greenhouse gases and animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>agriculture.</v>

2630
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:08.990
<v Speaker 4>And said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting the blame on meat is a</v>

2631
02:02:08.991 --> 02:02:12.230
<v Speaker 4>disservice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it distracts from the real issue of</v>

2632
02:02:12.231 --> 02:02:15.980
<v Speaker 4>our tremendous fossil fuel utilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

2633
02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot that goes.</v>

2634
02:02:18.751 --> 02:02:20.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the gas that's coming off</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2635
02:02:20.910 --> 02:02:22.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's where this is the methane,</v>

2636
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:24.030
<v Speaker 2>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2637
02:02:24.090 --> 02:02:24.661
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2638
02:02:24.661 --> 02:02:25.121
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2639
02:02:25.121 --> 02:02:30.121
<v Speaker 4>the real concern that keeps coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had this lady and she's on this</v>

2640
02:02:31.921 --> 02:02:34.530
<v Speaker 4>carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which it seems to me that she's got.</v>

2641
02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.340
<v Speaker 4>She had some matches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive autoimmune issues like had her</v>

2642
02:02:38.670 --> 02:02:43.170
<v Speaker 4>hip replaced and she was 17 and her</v>
<v Speaker 4>ankle replaced like massive arthritis</v>

2643
02:02:43.171 --> 02:02:46.710
<v Speaker 4>issues and she's on this diet of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat and several other people on this</v>

2644
02:02:46.711 --> 02:02:48.450
<v Speaker 4>diet as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're calling it the carnivore diet</v>

2645
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:50.640
<v Speaker 4>and experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least for the short term,</v>

2646
02:02:50.641 --> 02:02:52.260
<v Speaker 4>they're experiencing these tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits.</v>

2647
02:02:52.770 --> 02:02:56.520
<v Speaker 4>So the critics are saying you are</v>
<v Speaker 4>contributing to greenhouse gases and</v>

2648
02:02:56.521 --> 02:02:58.620
<v Speaker 4>methane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're ruining the environment by eating</v>

2649
02:02:58.621 --> 02:02:59.970
<v Speaker 4>beef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's saying,</v>

2650
02:02:59.971 --> 02:03:01.200
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really.</v>

2651
02:03:01.690 --> 02:03:02.490
<v Speaker 4>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2652
02:03:02.490 --> 02:03:06.300
<v Speaker 4>the amount is very small in comparison</v>
<v Speaker 4>to all the other issues.</v>

2653
02:03:06.301 --> 02:03:08.940
<v Speaker 4>It's less than one percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>greenhouse gases,</v>

2654
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:12.930
<v Speaker 2>but then they also hear that on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that it's really oil that is</v>

2655
02:03:12.931 --> 02:03:14.640
<v Speaker 2>being used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2656
02:03:14.641 --> 02:03:15.690
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still a,</v>

2657
02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:20.280
<v Speaker 2>a carbon based thing to try to transport</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2658
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:23.880
<v Speaker 2>to support the food from the farming all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way through the transporting to</v>

2659
02:03:24.490 --> 02:03:27.390
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of the waste to doing all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it that there's for now,</v>

2660
02:03:27.391 --> 02:03:29.850
<v Speaker 2>but Tesla's making semis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tesla's,</v>

2661
02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.630
<v Speaker 4>they're constructing these gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super Cool.</v>

2662
02:03:32.631 --> 02:03:34.310
<v Speaker 4>Look and fucking Tron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>semis,</v>

2663
02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:39.960
<v Speaker 4>they're going to operate entirely on</v>
<v Speaker 4>batteries and once that happens you have</v>

2664
02:03:40.041 --> 02:03:44.930
<v Speaker 4>automated battery controlled trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I think the real problem is going</v>

2665
02:03:44.931 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 4>to be people out of jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be a giant crisis.</v>

2666
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:49.700
<v Speaker 4>Even robots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2667
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:53.480
<v Speaker 4>Once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially for drivers apparently for</v>

2668
02:03:53.481 --> 02:03:57.110
<v Speaker 4>men in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some massive number in the millions of</v>

2669
02:03:57.330 --> 02:04:00.590
<v Speaker 4>people in this country rely on driving</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a living.</v>

2670
02:04:00.610 --> 02:04:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a big part of their job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their drivers.</v>

2671
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2672
02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2673
02:04:06.321 --> 02:04:10.130
<v Speaker 2>they say that's happening now across all</v>
<v Speaker 2>industries that are trying to figure</v>

2674
02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:10.510
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2675
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:13.280
<v Speaker 2>the automation is putting so many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of work.</v>

2676
02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk to Bernie Sanders</v>

2677
02:04:14.931 --> 02:04:16.080
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You who?</v>

2678
02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

2679
02:04:17.321 --> 02:04:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and Bernie been emailing each other.</v>

2680
02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Really burning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a great one.</v>

2681

<v Speaker 2>I'd like to talk to that guy.</v>

2683
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:30.240
<v Speaker 4>I also want to talk to other people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are proponents of universal basic income</v>

2684
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:35.100
<v Speaker 4>and Ilan has said that he thinks that</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is gonna be a real factor in the</v>

2685
02:04:35.101 --> 02:04:36.660
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Universal basic income.</v>

2686
02:04:36.661 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 4>So this is a truck that we're looking</v>

2687
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>at right now in a video and what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>

2688
02:04:40.081 --> 02:04:42.750
<v Speaker 1>A rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is anyone in that apple store from</v>

2690
02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:47.520
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty six cameras on board.</v>

2691
02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>That's so dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the batteries?</v>

2692
02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Is that on the bottom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the bottom of the batteries?</v>

2693
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that driving itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2694
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:57.090
<v Speaker 1>It was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone driving that know the trailer is</v>

2695
02:04:57.091 --> 02:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>all batteries</v>
<v Speaker 1>strapped packages.</v>

2696
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Thing is the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The price is supposed to be around</v>

2697
02:05:04.321 --> 02:05:06.750
<v Speaker 1>$200,000 for one of those.</v>

2702
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:20.640
<v Speaker 1>human driving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one had a human driving it.</v>

2703
02:05:20.641 --> 02:05:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe these are in production</v>

2704
02:05:22.441 --> 02:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's chasing a prototype.</v>

2705

<v Speaker 1>That dork chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get himself</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just having a fucking corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of just having the engine and</v>

2751
02:07:40.841 --> 02:07:43.870
<v Speaker 1>you're shifting and the smell of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does something to you for sure.</v>

2752
02:07:43.871 --> 02:07:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I love new bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

2753
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:47.950
<v Speaker 1>They're very mechanical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you have an old one?</v>

2754
02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:49.620
<v Speaker 1>60 seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2755
02:07:49.630 --> 02:07:51.280
<v Speaker 1>those are the real ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

2756
02:07:51.310 --> 02:07:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Little sewing machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bag.</v>

2757
02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:56.380
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so light too.</v>

2758
02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what they've done with those?</v>

2759
02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:02.850
<v Speaker 1>They've taken those old vw bug and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old porsche engine in the back.</v>

2760
02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a lot of people doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the buses too.</v>

2761
02:08:05.530 --> 02:08:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'd put like 170 horsepower old</v>

2762
02:08:08.321 --> 02:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>porsche engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem like a lot.</v>

2763
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:11.830
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 70 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a lot,</v>

2764
02:08:11.831 --> 02:08:13.440
<v Speaker 1>but the car weighs nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2765
02:08:13.550 --> 02:08:14.620
<v Speaker 1>more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2766
02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:17.650
<v Speaker 1>With the gas tank in the front of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car and you get those little tiny skinny</v>

2767
02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:18.840
<v Speaker 1>tires on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday,</v>

2768
02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:21.430
<v Speaker 1>stand out all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the beauty of it is that you</v>

2769
02:08:21.431 --> 02:08:23.950
<v Speaker 1>have the original engine and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of puttering along,</v>

2770
02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:26.340
<v Speaker 1>but everyone gets annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

2771
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:29.950
<v Speaker 1>like a slow clown car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People cut you off just to get around.</v>

2772
02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:32.770
<v Speaker 1>You just don't even want to look at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not in this day and age.</v>

2773
02:08:32.771 --> 02:08:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think about how fast teslas</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

2774
02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are unbelievably fast.</v>

2775
02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:38.650
<v Speaker 1>It's another</v>

2776
02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:39.483
<v Speaker 2>station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2777
02:08:39.570 --> 02:08:42.330
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that gas law,</v>

2778
02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:45.390
<v Speaker 2>but there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is telling you the sunrise was</v>

2779
02:08:45.391 --> 02:08:48.840
<v Speaker 2>coming up and I'm just silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No other cars around.</v>

2780
02:08:48.841 --> 02:08:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Just going through this prairie</v>

2781
02:08:50.230 --> 02:08:51.450
<v Speaker 1>going to beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smokey Robinson.</v>

2782
02:08:51.451 --> 02:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Let me stop for an hour and a half to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some electricity.</v>

2783
02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can drive for two hours now.</v>

2784
02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Pull over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you have to plan out</v>

2785
02:08:59.041 --> 02:09:02.850
<v Speaker 1>just for charging extra five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a good day at trying to figure</v>

2786
02:09:02.851 --> 02:09:03.684
<v Speaker 1>out my ribs.</v>

2787
02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:06.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the rock star move.</v>

2788
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had met smokey once before in New</v>

2789
02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:12.500
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a charity for kids in the arts,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2793
02:09:19.281 --> 02:09:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I'd met him before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was excited to take the GIG and I</v>

2794
02:09:21.501 --> 02:09:24.560
<v Speaker 2>figured I'll meet smokey Robinson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an outdoor arena,</v>

2795
02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:25.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an outdoor event.</v>

2796
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:29.030
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just used me to burn time while the</v>

2797
02:09:29.031 --> 02:09:31.430
<v Speaker 2>sun went down and then he could come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>at nighttime.</v>

2798
02:09:32.050 --> 02:09:35.390
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm sitting there with a guy that I'm</v>

2799
02:09:35.391 --> 02:09:38.780
<v Speaker 2>just talking to and smoky comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our dressing rooms or trailers because</v>

2800
02:09:38.781 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 2>it's outside and this gravel driveway</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff and smoke.</v>

2801
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:45.140
<v Speaker 2>He comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like 78 now.</v>

2802
02:09:45.141 --> 02:09:47.570

<v Speaker 2>red jumpsuit,</v>

2804
02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:52.280

2807
02:09:59.511 --> 02:10:03.920
<v Speaker 2>literally 20 feet so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And drops them off at the stage so he</v>

2808
02:10:03.921 --> 02:10:06.760
<v Speaker 2>could go right up onto the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even want to get his.</v>

2809
02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:10.010
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to get his boots dirty on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gravel walkway.</v>

2810
02:10:10.011 --> 02:10:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>your studio.</v>

<v Speaker 2>right up on stage.</v>

2827
02:10:44.571 --> 02:10:48.500
<v Speaker 1>star for a long time forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents were listening to them when</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've never seen him.</v>

2885
02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Now you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on Conan the other night and I</v>

2886
02:13:03.321 --> 02:13:05.690
<v Speaker 1>was going to try and get tickets to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in the palm desert.</v>

2887
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Burl and I were planning on going to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosby before the scandal broke.</v>

2888
02:13:10.070 --> 02:13:10.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2890
02:13:11.511 --> 02:13:13.190
<v Speaker 1>because we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking to him one night at the</v>

2891
02:13:13.191 --> 02:13:16.340
<v Speaker 1>store and we'd always heard like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>good he is.</v>

2892
02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Got to go see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to go see.</v>

2893
02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock had said,</v>

2894
02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:20.780
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucking killed.</v>

2895
02:13:20.781 --> 02:13:23.930
<v Speaker 1>He killed for two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went on stage with no opening act.</v>

2896
02:13:24.250 --> 02:13:27.920
<v Speaker 1>He just walks out there and he starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and she starts crushing and he</v>

2897
02:13:27.921 --> 02:13:30.860
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was blown away and Chris Rock was</v>

2898
02:13:30.861 --> 02:13:31.630
<v Speaker 1>saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2899
02:13:31.630 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went</v>

2900
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:32.611
<v Speaker 3>to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2901
02:13:32.611 --> 02:13:33.990
<v Speaker 3>God damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an amateur.</v>

2902
02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:36.210
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2903
02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:36.850
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2904
02:13:36.850 --> 02:13:39.390
<v Speaker 3>we should go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So burt and I were planning and</v>

2905
02:13:39.391 --> 02:13:43.050
<v Speaker 3>something came out we had to cancel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then right after that,</v>

2906
02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:45.470
<v Speaker 3>something fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something big came up</v>

2907
02:13:47.190 --> 02:13:47.910
<v Speaker 3>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

2908
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's terrible.</v>

2909
02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I saw som though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill went and song.</v>

2910
02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him.</v>

2911
02:13:53.461 --> 02:13:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife was pregnant with our first baby</v>

2912
02:13:57.570 --> 02:14:00.390
<v Speaker 2>and we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing Conan and then I was going</v>

2913
02:14:00.391 --> 02:14:02.850
<v Speaker 2>to have two weeks off before the baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>was born.</v>

2914
02:14:02.851 --> 02:14:06.630
<v Speaker 2>That was gonna be the last Gig I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take two weeks off and</v>

2915
02:14:06.631 --> 02:14:09.690
<v Speaker 2>just hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before this new baby came,</v>

2916
02:14:09.691 --> 02:14:13.140
<v Speaker 2>we were living in New York and we went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see cosby.</v>

2917
02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld took us to see cosby at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carnegie Hall.</v>

2918
02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2919
02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:22.400
<v Speaker 2>And we laughed for two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a masterclass that he was so</v>

2920
02:14:23.071 --> 02:14:24.600
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so easy,</v>

2921
02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:28.830
<v Speaker 2>and we just laughed forever and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went home and her water broke.</v>

2922
02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:30.451
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2923
02:14:30.451 --> 02:14:33.540
<v Speaker 2>We always felt like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that laughing kind of made her water</v>

2924
02:14:33.541 --> 02:14:35.280
<v Speaker 2>break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a,</v>

2925
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:38.310
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impressive.</v>

2926
02:14:38.311 --> 02:14:39.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was impressive about it.</v>

2927
02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:43.710
<v Speaker 2>He would tell these stories and build</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2928
02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:48.600
<v Speaker 2>build it without laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would be like very few labs for</v>

2929
02:14:48.601 --> 02:14:51.510
<v Speaker 2>like 10 minutes as he's telling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

2930
02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 2>And you didn't realize even as a comic</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was building this tension.</v>

2931
02:14:55.531 --> 02:15:00.531
<v Speaker 2>So when the laugh did come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was bigger than any laugh you've ever</v>

2932
02:15:01.591 --> 02:15:03.510
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he would just,</v>

2933
02:15:03.570 --> 02:15:07.770
<v Speaker 2>it was the building of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the confidence to not feel like he</v>

2934
02:15:07.771 --> 02:15:10.080
<v Speaker 2>had to go from laugh to laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to laugh every 30 seconds.</v>

2935
02:15:10.230 --> 02:15:11.160
<v Speaker 2>He would just let it build</v>

2936
02:15:11.410 --> 02:15:15.130
<v Speaker 3>bill and then it would ba boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would explode.</v>

2937
02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.720
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there's recordings of him</v>
<v Speaker 3>later in life,</v>

2938
02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:21.140
<v Speaker 3>like before the scandal broke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when he was in his seventies</v>

2939
02:15:21.410 --> 02:15:24.590
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think now it would be</v>

2940
02:15:24.591 --> 02:15:26.110
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go to see him,</v>

2941
02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:27.560
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's not performing now,</v>

2942
02:15:27.561 --> 02:15:29.390
<v Speaker 3>but if you was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be impossible.</v>

2943
02:15:29.450 --> 02:15:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like so gross and so tainted and so</v>

2944
02:15:34.700 --> 02:15:36.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you would have crazy.</v>

2945
02:15:37.130 --> 02:15:41.810
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to watch him almost like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist and observe him before.</v>

2946
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it would think about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now if you watch,</v>

2947
02:15:45.050 --> 02:15:49.040
<v Speaker 3>even if you want you to recording,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be watching it thinking I wonder</v>

2948
02:15:49.041 --> 02:15:51.440
<v Speaker 3>if he right now in the back of his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2949
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a rapist and they don't know.</v>

2950
02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:54.973
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2951
02:15:55.150 --> 02:15:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked at anything that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>done since then.</v>

2952
02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was such a.</v>

2953
02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:05.920
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to make a public relations</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>

2954
02:16:06.010 --> 02:16:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Last year he did a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you find a find a video of bill cosby</v>

2955
02:16:11.351 --> 02:16:16.351
<v Speaker 3>holding court in a barbershop in Philly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was at a barbershop and Philly and</v>

2956
02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:20.560
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about jazz musicians</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like he was like giving them,</v>

2957
02:16:21.250 --> 02:16:23.930
<v Speaker 3>giving them trivia questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's barbershop,</v>

2958
02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:27.310
<v Speaker 3>jazz musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was reading the comments and the</v>

2959
02:16:27.311 --> 02:16:28.690
<v Speaker 3>comments are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we love you,</v>

2960
02:16:28.691 --> 02:16:30.460
<v Speaker 3>bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe you bill.</v>

2961
02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:34.030
<v Speaker 3>You know those accusers are assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2962
02:16:34.470 --> 02:16:35.920
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me some volume</v>

2963
02:16:36.030 --> 02:16:41.030
<v Speaker 7>raises on base,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on base making and I'm making up these</v>

2964
02:16:43.490 --> 02:16:48.490
<v Speaker 7>because you don't have your glass.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He told me that I'll take a two hour</v>

2965
02:16:48.841 --> 02:16:49.674
<v Speaker 7>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He</v>

2966
02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:53.270
<v Speaker 7>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>

2967
02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:54.810
<v Speaker 7>this doctor got me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

2968
02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:59.520
<v Speaker 7>Dr. I take my shower.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm one of those people that wipe the</v>

2969
02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:01.590
<v Speaker 7>shower now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want the water running on the</v>

2970
02:17:01.591 --> 02:17:03.030
<v Speaker 7>towel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want them to be able to do.</v>

2971
02:17:03.031 --> 02:17:07.100
<v Speaker 7>I want to be clean and dry when I get</v>
<v Speaker 7>out of that.</v>

2972
02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:12.490
<v Speaker 7>Obviously maybe with me properly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but obviously you live alone</v>

2973
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:19.170
<v Speaker 7>so you have to clean up as my father</v>
<v Speaker 7>would say,</v>

2974
02:17:19.470 --> 02:17:23.160
<v Speaker 7>behind your own mess.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even when I was married,</v>

2975
02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:25.510
<v Speaker 7>I did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody in the house after a certain</v>

2976
02:17:25.511 --> 02:17:27.210
<v Speaker 7>age,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he looks really old independently.</v>

2977
02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:32.240
<v Speaker 7>Take care of</v>
<v Speaker 7>unanimous when they left,</v>

2978
02:17:32.401 --> 02:17:34.080
<v Speaker 7>but they was independently.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They can stand on.</v>

2979
02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:36.450
<v Speaker 7>It's weird to watch him because this</v>
<v Speaker 7>life as well.</v>

2980
02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:39.480
<v Speaker 3>He's wearing that hello friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kept,</v>

2981
02:17:39.810 --> 02:17:43.830
<v Speaker 3>he would wear that on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would wear sweaters that say hello</v>

2982
02:17:43.831 --> 02:17:46.710
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started saying that clothes dressing</v>

2983
02:17:46.711 --> 02:17:50.270
<v Speaker 3>up on stage was a crutch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sometimes he would come out with just</v>

2984
02:17:50.271 --> 02:17:52.410
<v Speaker 3>like his birkenstocks and just take them</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

2985
02:17:52.411 --> 02:17:55.820
<v Speaker 3>He just be in his socks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought that being dressed up was</v>

2986
02:17:55.870 --> 02:18:00.450
<v Speaker 3>like putting on too much of a show that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should rely purely on the spoken</v>

2987
02:18:00.451 --> 02:18:01.920
<v Speaker 3>word of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2989
02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:09.990
<v Speaker 3>I certainly don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy you telling other people how</v>

2990
02:18:09.991 --> 02:18:11.040
<v Speaker 3>they should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

2991
02:18:11.130 --> 02:18:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of ways to do it.</v>

2992
02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course he wants to be comfortable on</v>

2993
02:18:15.541 --> 02:18:17.030
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where a hello friends?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well he's fine,</v>

2995
02:18:18.330 --> 02:18:20.550
<v Speaker 3>but he was big at telling people how</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're supposed to live.</v>

2996
02:18:20.551 --> 02:18:21.240

3060
02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:17.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3061
02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:21.770
<v Speaker 1>but once you're up there and two people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are coming and you're doing it,</v>

3117
02:23:53.041 --> 02:23:55.410
<v Speaker 1>driven it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a million dollar car,</v>

3118
02:23:57.110 --> 02:24:02.110
<v Speaker 1>blue nine something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just in traffic around Santa</v>

3123
02:24:10.501 --> 02:24:12.180
<v Speaker 1>as another car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they only made one of it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>or eighties and it would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd only made like this was like the</v>

3127
02:24:19.081 --> 02:24:21.500
<v Speaker 1>second one or something,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on me and stuff.</v>

02:27:15.461 --> 02:27:18.430
<v Speaker 3>but they put modern suspension and</v>
<v Speaker 3>brakes and a modern engine in it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a cold water.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's just tons of traffic.</v>

3320
02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I see this man like running down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>center of the traffic,</v>

3321
02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:29.140

<v Speaker 2>he goes past the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>picks up his hubcap that came off and</v>

3323
02:32:33.371 --> 02:32:34.510
<v Speaker 2>goes running back the other way.</v>

02:32:42.450 --> 02:32:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

02:32:43.311 --> 02:32:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a good show.</v>

3332
02:32:58.250 --> 02:33:03.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so much better for him than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight show in that he gets to be who</v>

3333
02:33:04.441 --> 02:33:06.150
<v Speaker 3>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely.</v>

3334
02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:08.880
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

3335
02:33:08.881 --> 02:33:12.210
<v Speaker 3>He fucking loves cars and he knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything about them.</v>

3336
02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loves it.</v>

3337
02:33:14.310 --> 02:33:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that 73 Mazda.</v>

3338
02:33:16.021 --> 02:33:19.350
<v Speaker 3>That guy was actually there while I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3339
02:33:19.470 --> 02:33:22.590
<v Speaker 3>He was the next one after we filmed my</v>
<v Speaker 3>episode,</v>

3340
02:33:22.591 --> 02:33:27.060
<v Speaker 3>he was waiting and he's got this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>73 mazda that's like fucking super</v>

3341
02:33:27.061 --> 02:33:30.940
<v Speaker 3>souped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really light to see when he rolled are</v>

3342
02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:33.090
<v Speaker 3>rolled a card to that video and what did</v>
<v Speaker 3>he roll?</v>

3343
02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:34.830
<v Speaker 3>He rolled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a truck.</v>

3344
02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Seinfeld rolled one of his cars to kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like a baby roll.</v>

3345
02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Seinfeld had a baby role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3346
02:33:42.061 --> 02:33:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the hospital off the off</v>
<v Speaker 3>ramp.</v>

3347
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:45.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was a big deal.</v>

3348
02:33:46.380 --> 02:33:47.213
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3349
02:33:47.370 --> 02:33:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I think he went to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You almost died.</v>

3350
02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:51.690
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3351
02:33:51.691 --> 02:33:52.770
<v Speaker 3>there it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3352
02:33:52.771 --> 02:33:53.581
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3353
02:33:53.581 --> 02:33:54.750
<v Speaker 3>it's just a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3354
02:33:54.751 --> 02:33:58.010
<v Speaker 3>that's a Chevelle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what is that Super Vee?</v>

3355
02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:01.260
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to know Jesus.</v>

3356
02:34:01.290 --> 02:34:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Can you hear it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His reaction was funny at the end.</v>

3357
02:34:08.270 --> 02:34:11.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't an accident occurred while the</v>

3358
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:13.040
<v Speaker 2>whole show</v>

3359
02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:15.300
<v Speaker 3>that old dude shouldn't be driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3360
02:34:15.301 --> 02:34:17.560
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of the vibe that you got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay was like,</v>

3361
02:34:17.610 --> 02:34:18.443
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

3362
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it literally one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

3363
02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:27.770
<v Speaker 1>What does that got killed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno is too old to drive</v>

3364
02:34:30.050 --> 02:34:32.800
<v Speaker 1>the avid current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez.</v>

3365
02:34:32.810 --> 02:34:35.750
<v Speaker 1>That seemed like it was a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was several years ago,</v>

3366
02:34:35.751 --> 02:34:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3367
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:41.270
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when this video was put up.</v>

3368
02:34:41.271 --> 02:34:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

3369
02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:43.033
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets out.</v>

3370
02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear him</v>
<v Speaker 1>until he gets home?</v>

3371
02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:50.630
<v Speaker 1>My wife says this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife,</v>

3372
02:34:50.730 --> 02:34:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Alicia and old Barracuda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to tell what that car is.</v>

3373
02:34:56.170 --> 02:34:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Plymouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

3374
02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.140
<v Speaker 1>It isn't old Barracuda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

3375
02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:02.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the first model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barracuda,</v>

3376
02:35:02.631 --> 02:35:04.490
<v Speaker 1>which is a totally different looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

3377
02:35:04.491 --> 02:35:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Then the second generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3378
02:35:09.470 --> 02:35:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Body styles differ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird looking car.</v>

3379
02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:13.490
<v Speaker 1>They're cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3380
02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:16.630
<v Speaker 3>It's good to have an obsessive hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good in life,</v>

3381
02:35:16.970 --> 02:35:18.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you work hard and do all this</v>

3382
02:35:18.571 --> 02:35:21.090
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's still extra time to put your</v>

3383
02:35:21.091 --> 02:35:23.670
<v Speaker 3>energy into something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

3384
02:35:23.671 --> 02:35:25.080
<v Speaker 3>it's imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3385
02:35:25.170 --> 02:35:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I figured that out over the years of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3386
02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:30.090
<v Speaker 3>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need mine,</v>

3387
02:35:33.350 --> 02:35:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Carla and flipped once in the comments</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they just edit it.</v>

3388
02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Tomato look worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to.</v>

3389
02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I was replaying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

3390
02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:41.001
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play that,</v>

3391
02:35:41.001 --> 02:35:43.010
<v Speaker 1>but no more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play it back for us.</v>

3392
02:35:43.250 --> 02:35:46.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people said they saw the unedited</v>

3393
02:35:46.311 --> 02:35:47.900
<v Speaker 1>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

3394
02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it from the beginning.</v>

3395
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:54.980
<v Speaker 1>It looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys shifting.</v>

3396
02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Here's the flip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3397
02:35:56.901 --> 02:36:00.350
<v Speaker 1>he hit a wheel horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No way more than 100 horsepower.</v>

3398
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.903
<v Speaker 1>Let me see this guy</v>

3399
02:36:04.370 --> 02:36:05.410
<v Speaker 8>multiple times.</v>

3400
02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:10.740
<v Speaker 1>One to know that they just added the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same clip back in Atlanta that way</v>

3401
02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:13.880
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3402
02:36:13.881 --> 02:36:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're probably telling the</v>

3403
02:36:16.671 --> 02:36:18.320
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that thing probably flipped</v>

3404
02:36:18.321 --> 02:36:20.360
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever,</v>

3405
02:36:20.420 --> 02:36:22.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever he wants is rough.</v>

3406
02:36:22.290 --> 02:36:24.120
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to get something to flip a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of times,</v>

3407
02:36:24.121 --> 02:36:26.970
<v Speaker 3>like you gotta be really flying to flip</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of times,</v>

3408
02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:30.150
<v Speaker 3>flip once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time all the energy would be</v>

3409
02:36:30.151 --> 02:36:33.600
<v Speaker 3>dissipated by the time he hit bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bang pain,</v>

3410
02:36:33.601 --> 02:36:34.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be careful out there.</v>

3411
02:36:34.801 --> 02:36:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Kids don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially with those old ass cars,</v>

3412
02:36:37.650 --> 02:36:40.350
<v Speaker 3>especially old ass cars with old</v>
<v Speaker 3>suspensions.</v>

3413
02:36:40.410 --> 02:36:43.740
<v Speaker 3>That's why I juice my shit up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern stuff.</v>

3414
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take that neighbor,</v>

3415
02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:46.530
<v Speaker 3>neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

3416
02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:51.560
<v Speaker 3>You fucking old drive fucking tires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those old crack tiredness goes out.</v>

3417
02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Old Tires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No tread.</v>

3418
02:36:56.460 --> 02:36:58.200
<v Speaker 3>You need a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need stuff.</v>

3419
02:36:58.490 --> 02:37:00.630
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could do all this work and like</v>

3420
02:37:00.690 --> 02:37:03.750
<v Speaker 3>really hardcore at your career and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still extra time.</v>

3421
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.801
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just that.</v>

3422
02:37:04.801 --> 02:37:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I think doing one thing only all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time is not good for the brain.</v>

3423
02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good for the brain to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited by a bunch of different things.</v>

3424
02:37:13.470 --> 02:37:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes you more person and</v>

3425
02:37:15.741 --> 02:37:19.490
<v Speaker 3>makes it more interesting with as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>comic is I think is very important.</v>

3426
02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:24.860
<v Speaker 3>It's very important to have a more</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuanced perspective to also have more</v>

3427
02:37:24.861 --> 02:37:27.450
<v Speaker 3>information to draw from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

3428
02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:30.950
<v Speaker 3>you're experiencing more different parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of La and also different types of</v>

3429
02:37:30.951 --> 02:37:33.380
<v Speaker 3>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think different types of failure is</v>

3430
02:37:33.381 --> 02:37:34.630
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

3431
02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:37.220
<v Speaker 3>It go failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mental failure,</v>

3432
02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:39.830
<v Speaker 3>complication failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all that stuff's good for</v>

3433
02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:41.700
<v Speaker 3>something that you're not good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3434
02:37:41.701 --> 02:37:43.040
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3435
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:47.100
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how many times you will</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like a beginner back at the same</v>

3436
02:37:47.101 --> 02:37:49.320
<v Speaker 2>thing you've been practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you start making changes,</v>

3437
02:37:49.470 --> 02:37:50.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3438
02:37:50.250 --> 02:37:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of back to the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this again.</v>

3439
02:37:51.930 --> 02:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>What do you do other than the baking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The baking is the biggest thing.</v>

3440
02:37:56.250 --> 02:37:58.800
<v Speaker 2>The baking is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really like my first hobby.</v>

3441
02:37:58.801 --> 02:38:00.870
<v Speaker 2>I never really had something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3442
02:38:00.990 --> 02:38:05.430
<v Speaker 2>I put all my time into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was always just stand up and then.</v>

3443
02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:06.300
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3444
02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:09.210
<v Speaker 2>the baking and now I'm writing more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever before.</v>

3445
02:38:09.390 --> 02:38:11.610
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting down,</v>

3446
02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:14.410
<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrated for long periods of writing</v>

3447
02:38:14.590 --> 02:38:16.330
<v Speaker 3>comedy or just writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>

3448
02:38:16.390 --> 02:38:17.710
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3449
02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the head writer for live from here,</v>

3450
02:38:21.131 --> 02:38:22.510
<v Speaker 2>the prairie home companion thing.</v>

3451
02:38:23.220 --> 02:38:26.700
<v Speaker 3>And is that garrison keillor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kicks him out.</v>

3452
02:38:26.730 --> 02:38:27.660
<v Speaker 3>That's the new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3453
02:38:27.661 --> 02:38:30.600
<v Speaker 3>he quits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He retired before he got in trouble.</v>

3454
02:38:30.601 --> 02:38:32.180
<v Speaker 3>He retired a couple of years before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3455
02:38:32.190 --> 02:38:33.023
<v Speaker 3>he did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3456
02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:35.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's why the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once he got in trouble,</v>

3457
02:38:35.041 --> 02:38:38.640
<v Speaker 3>that's when the name of getting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble thing was before he even</v>

3458
02:38:38.641 --> 02:38:40.930
<v Speaker 3>retired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was an incident from both.</v>

3459
02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3460
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:43.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an old thing.</v>

3461
02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:45.970
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of a muddled thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very weird one.</v>

3462
02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:50.220
<v Speaker 3>But when I had said that on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was weird and then he just kind</v>

3463
02:38:50.221 --> 02:38:51.960
<v Speaker 3>of hugged a chick and his hand went down</v>
<v Speaker 3>her back.</v>

3464
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Then someone sent me an article that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was more than one incident,</v>

3465
02:38:56.370 --> 02:39:00.630
<v Speaker 3>several of them and that he had been and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't make them public and I don't</v>

3466
02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:01.620
<v Speaker 3>even know what they were,</v>

3467
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:04.310
<v Speaker 2>but I know they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did investigate it,</v>

3468
02:39:04.970 --> 02:39:07.550
<v Speaker 2>but they had to end up changing the name</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

3469
02:39:07.551 --> 02:39:10.160
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time writing for that.</v>

3470
02:39:10.730 --> 02:39:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Then it went really from writing my book</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I got that Gig.</v>

3471
02:39:15.231 --> 02:39:18.240
<v Speaker 2>So I continued writing at that pace and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3472
02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:21.050
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm continuing to write like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3473
02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:24.330
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the writing is the,</v>

3474
02:39:24.350 --> 02:39:27.530
<v Speaker 2>is kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because it's from doing</v>

3475
02:39:27.531 --> 02:39:30.020
<v Speaker 2>standup writing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost seems like something new.</v>

3476
02:39:30.021 --> 02:39:34.160
<v Speaker 2>It almost seems like another hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another different way to exercise your</v>

3477
02:39:34.161 --> 02:39:35.090
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3478
02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:37.210
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different sitting there like</v>

3479
02:39:37.250 --> 02:39:38.830
<v Speaker 2>writing stuff out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really parsing out.</v>

3480
02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:43.320
<v Speaker 2>But it does make me think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't been able to crack it of</v>

3481
02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:48.360
<v Speaker 2>like why not put that effort of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>intense writing style into the standup?</v>

3482
02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:51.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3483
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looser with it.</v>

3484
02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll write it and they'll go perform it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll come back and edit it,</v>

3485
02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:02.620
<v Speaker 2>but that Carlin did that at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would just write the whole thing and</v>

3486
02:40:03.321 --> 02:40:04.520
<v Speaker 2>memorize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3487
02:40:04.521 --> 02:40:07.340
<v Speaker 2>he would like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a book and then go present it.</v>

3488
02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:08.810
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done that.</v>

3489
02:40:08.850 --> 02:40:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

3490
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:10.503
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3491
02:40:10.610 --> 02:40:12.080
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I do is,</v>

3492
02:40:12.081 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do two things.</v>

3493
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:17.220
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I write a premises in word and then I</v>

3494
02:40:17.221 --> 02:40:22.221
<v Speaker 4>have a program called scrivener.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scrivener does is it lets me take things</v>

3495
02:40:22.471 --> 02:40:25.890
<v Speaker 4>into prem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into categories or into subjects.</v>

3496
02:40:26.100 --> 02:40:27.870
<v Speaker 4>So I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3497
02:40:27.871 --> 02:40:30.130
<v Speaker 4>I have a title of a set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3498
02:40:30.330 --> 02:40:33.360
<v Speaker 4>I'll call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my last special's called the one</v>

3499
02:40:33.361 --> 02:40:35.190
<v Speaker 4>that's coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called strange times.</v>

3500
02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:39.150
<v Speaker 4>So I wrote strange times at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and then I have all these different</v>

3501
02:40:39.151 --> 02:40:42.840
<v Speaker 4>subjects in strange times and then I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>move them around,</v>

3502
02:40:42.870 --> 02:40:45.180
<v Speaker 4>I can shift them and each time I click</v>
<v Speaker 4>on one,</v>

3503
02:40:45.210 --> 02:40:48.990
<v Speaker 4>it takes me to all the stuff that I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>written about that subject.</v>

3504
02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:53.420
<v Speaker 4>And then I also can click on another</v>
<v Speaker 4>little part of it and it shows me a cork</v>

3505
02:40:53.421 --> 02:40:56.070
<v Speaker 4>board and on the corkboard is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3506
02:40:56.860 --> 02:41:00.120
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which called virtual index cards,</v>

3507
02:41:01.170 --> 02:41:04.530
<v Speaker 4>the index cards that I can move around</v>
<v Speaker 4>each index card as like notes on</v>

3508
02:41:04.531 --> 02:41:05.110
<v Speaker 4>different parts.</v>

3509
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Like this is a very important part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bit.</v>

3510
02:41:06.810 --> 02:41:09.000
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a note about a study that was</v>

3511
02:41:09.001 --> 02:41:12.690
<v Speaker 4>done that shows that this is real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different things and so I can</v>

3512
02:41:12.691 --> 02:41:15.570
<v Speaker 4>move those around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this way I can look at it in the</v>

3513
02:41:15.571 --> 02:41:18.180
<v Speaker 4>little tiny side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all,</v>

3514
02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:22.980
<v Speaker 4>each individually individual subject is</v>
<v Speaker 4>all in this one long column and I could</v>

3515
02:41:22.981 --> 02:41:27.120
<v Speaker 4>see like the set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is a whole set but then,</v>

3516
02:41:27.250 --> 02:41:32.220
<v Speaker 4>but no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be really ironed out in front</v>

3517
02:41:32.221 --> 02:41:35.580
<v Speaker 4>of an audience because I can write as</v>
<v Speaker 4>much as I want.</v>

3518
02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:39.240
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of it is effective writing</v>
<v Speaker 4>alone.</v>

3519
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:42.000
<v Speaker 4>But it comes to life in front of an</v>
<v Speaker 4>audience and changes.</v>

3520
02:41:42.001 --> 02:41:42.834
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3521
02:41:42.990 --> 02:41:45.870
<v Speaker 2>But how much will you write before you</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it out?</v>

3522
02:41:45.871 --> 02:41:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Like will you write a couple pages into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it or just</v>

3523
02:41:49.030 --> 02:41:50.760
<v Speaker 4>little depends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3524
02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:55.020
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it's thousands of words for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple minute bit.</v>

3525
02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:57.170
<v Speaker 2>And you'll take that up before you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried it.</v>

3526
02:41:57.171 --> 02:41:58.300
<v Speaker 2>You write a thousand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3527
02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:02.120
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes it's just a few lines and</v>

3528
02:42:02.121 --> 02:42:06.200
<v Speaker 4>then I just run with a premise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I'll just try to try to air a</v>

3529
02:42:06.201 --> 02:42:09.770
<v Speaker 4>premise out and see where it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one that I'm working on right</v>

3530
02:42:09.771 --> 02:42:12.770
<v Speaker 4>now that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>

3531
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:17.120
<v Speaker 4>the setup of the premise gets a really</v>
<v Speaker 4>big laugh and that I don't know where to</v>

3532
02:42:17.121 --> 02:42:20.000
<v Speaker 4>go with it over here and I'm fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>around with it and I'm trying to figure</v>

3533
02:42:20.001 --> 02:42:22.430
<v Speaker 4>out where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where to go with Dell or something there</v>

3534
02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:25.070
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not going to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But every day I throw a little bit of</v>

3535
02:42:25.071 --> 02:42:27.350
<v Speaker 4>water on it and I hope to see the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sprouts.</v>

3536
02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

3537
02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:30.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've got a great premise,</v>

3538
02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:31.530
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a great job,</v>

3539
02:42:31.630 --> 02:42:34.440
<v Speaker 4>there's something there definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's one of those ones where I know,</v>

3540
02:42:34.441 --> 02:42:35.970
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't let this go.</v>

3541
02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.350
<v Speaker 4>I know there's something there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but right now</v>

3542
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:41.750
<v Speaker 2>shit Finna take awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be the only one that believes in</v>

3543
02:42:41.751 --> 02:42:43.520
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3544
02:42:43.521 --> 02:42:44.960
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny.</v>

3545
02:42:44.961 --> 02:42:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I was reading something about a raccoon</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day.</v>

3546
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:50.020
<v Speaker 2>I saw a raccoon with her hands and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

3547
02:42:50.030 --> 02:42:52.310
<v Speaker 2>As I was writing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3548
02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:54.290
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I looked through my notes.</v>

3549
02:42:54.370 --> 02:42:58.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like I thought I had a really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>raccoon bit a year ago</v>

3550
02:43:01.270 --> 02:43:05.060
<v Speaker 2>in the audience told me this wasn't very</v>
<v Speaker 2>good and I ended up quitting on it and</v>

3551
02:43:05.061 --> 02:43:07.130
<v Speaker 2>now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm back with my new rec,</v>

3552
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:11.980
<v Speaker 4>let it go and then walk around it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it</v>

3553
