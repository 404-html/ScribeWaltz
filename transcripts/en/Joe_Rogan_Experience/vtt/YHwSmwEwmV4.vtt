00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:22.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dr Mychart originally from Saint John's,</v>

15
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:25.944
<v Speaker 1>Newfoundland.</v>

16
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>now I'm residing in London,</v>

18
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Ontario,</v>

19
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a family doctor and I've been practicing cannabis medicine for just over</v>

20
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:32.514
<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>

21
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.383
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

22
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 2>My name is al experience.</v>

23
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.970
<v Speaker 2>And I used to be in New York Times reporter.</v>

24
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

25
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 2>then I became a spy novelist.</v>

26
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 2>And most recently I wrote the book,</v>

27
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Tell Your children the truth about marijuana,</v>

28
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 2>mental illness and violence,</v>

29
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 2>which came out last month and,</v>

30
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 2>has not endeared me to the cannabis advocacy community.</v>

32
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I'd say</v>

33
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>have they,</v>

34
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:51.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>attacked you mercilessly for this book?</v>

36
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.083
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

37
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's okay.</v>

38
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

39
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I've also heard from a lot of parents,</v>

41
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

43
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:01.191
<v Speaker 2>some users,</v>

44
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 2>but parents who've told me,</v>

45
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

46
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Speaker 2>that the book really encapsulates their,</v>

47
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 2>their family's problems in the last couple of years.</v>

48
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

49
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I suspect my,</v>

50
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>my real thoughts here before we even get started is that we're going to find</v>

51
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>that the truth is somewhere in the middle here.</v>

52
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think marijuana is a hundred percent safe,</v>

54
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>honestly for everybody.</v>

55
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.293
<v Speaker 1>I really don't,</v>

56
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I know too many people that have had experiences where they took too much,</v>

57
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>particularly edibles and,</v>

58
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

60
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I want to say I know anybody who had psychotic breaks,</v>

61
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>but I know some people that freaked out for weeks,</v>

62
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:39.571
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

64
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:39.871
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

65
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>we just had a,</v>

66
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.191
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

67
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>a comedian here from Brazil.</v>

68
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.921
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

69
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days ago,</v>

70
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Rafi Bosstones who said he took a couple of hits of a vape pen,</v>

71
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>he was high for 14 days,</v>

72
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>went to a psychiatrist and he's a big guy.</v>

73
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>He's like six foot five,</v>

74
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:54.901
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

75
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.734
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

76
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:56.731
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

78
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>they told them to keep taking it cause you know,</v>

79
00:01:58.831 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

80
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.121
<v Speaker 1>you're so big,</v>

81
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>just keep smoking.</v>

82
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.941
<v Speaker 1>And so he,</v>

83
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't smoke.</v>

84
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>He just kept hitting this vape pen.</v>

85
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>He said I was high for fucking two weeks.</v>

86
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

87
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>you need to do it properly.</v>

88
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

89
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.620
<v Speaker 1>He's held to the same standard as any other medicines.</v>

91
00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:16.621
<v Speaker 1>So you need to identify that there's risks and there's benefits to it and some</v>

92
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>people are definitely,</v>

93
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>going to be more susceptible to those risks.</v>

95
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And we need to kind of tease out those people and make sure that those people,</v>

96
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>don't put themselves at risk.</v>

98
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

99
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I think so as well.</v>

100
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the reasons why I want to state this because I'm a well known</v>

101
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>marijuana advocate,</v>

102
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.163
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

103
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I do believe,</v>

104
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I believe absolutely there are great benefits to it.</v>

105
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I think there's great benefits in terms of uh,</v>

106
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>relieving pressure,</v>

107
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>ocular pressure for people that have glaucoma,</v>

108
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>people with aids who are on medication,</v>

109
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>people with cancer that are going through chemotherapy find great benefit in</v>

110
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>terms of helping them.</v>

111
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also some people with autism.</v>

112
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I know people that their children have autism and they give them small amounts</v>

113
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.200
<v Speaker 1>of edible marijuana and stops</v>

114
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.033
<v Speaker 3>seizures.</v>

115
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly beneficial in the form of CBD for a lot of different ailments.</v>

116
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 3>But I think with all things,</v>

117
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 3>and this is a stance that I've kind of like really come to accept over the last</v>

118
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 3>few years with all things that affect the mind,</v>

119
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 3>they affect everyone slightly differently.</v>

120
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.273
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

121
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

122
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 3>I'll see you wanted to say something.</v>

123
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:20.310
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>

124
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.143
<v Speaker 3>First of I,</v>

125
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I suspect,</v>

126
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:22.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

127
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:22.991
<v Speaker 3>there were people who said,</v>

128
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 3>don't go on with Joe.</v>

129
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:24.521
<v Speaker 3>He's just going to,</v>

130
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:24.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

131
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 3>he's going to try to eat you alive and,</v>

132
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 3>and especially there'll be,</v>

133
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 3>it'll be two on one.</v>

134
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I told them the truth.</v>

135
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

136
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.043
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

137
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll go on with anybody and I am glad you had me on or you're having me on</v>

138
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:36.731
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

139
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

140
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.373
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

141
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.873
<v Speaker 3>Bill Maher,</v>

142
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.743
<v Speaker 3>he won't have me on.</v>

143
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 3>He's afraid to talk to me about this.</v>

144
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.533
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>

145
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 3>what did he say?</v>

146
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

147
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.551
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

148
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:45.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

149
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 3>he told the or his people told the Simon and Schuster PR people,</v>

150
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

151
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 3>we just don't want to have him on.</v>

152
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 3>And a and NPR had a national NPR show,</v>

153
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 3>had an interview scheduled with me,</v>

154
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 3>an hour long segment,</v>

155
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:57.881
<v Speaker 3>and they canceled it.</v>

156
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

157
00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.811
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

158
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 3>we don't believe in the conclusions of the book.</v>

159
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.941
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

160
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 3>You don't believe in the conclusions of the book,</v>

161
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 3>have me on ask me anything.</v>

162
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I'm so happy that you're not afraid to have me on that.</v>

163
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 3>We can have a conversation that we can have a conversation come at me with any</v>

164
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 3>question you want about the science.</v>

165
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

166
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

167
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 3>I'll say right off the top,</v>

168
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think marijuana's medicine,</v>

169
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.371
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

170
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 3>it has a few,</v>

171
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

172
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 3>medical uses that have been,</v>

173
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:22.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

174
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 3>CBD has been shown to reduce seizures in kids.</v>

175
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:25.924
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

176
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.100
<v Speaker 3>A THC has been shown to reduce the nausea associated with chemotherapy.</v>

177
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:32.284
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>

178
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.921
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

179
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>

180
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 3>people use THC and cannabis has recreational and toxicants.</v>

181
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 3>They used them to get high the same way they use alcohol the same way they use</v>

182
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:41.524
<v Speaker 3>other drugs.</v>

183
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And the sooner we,</v>

184
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 3>we accept that reality,</v>

185
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 3>the better off we'll all be.</v>

186
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 3>That this is a drug and it has risks and benefits and the risks and benefits are</v>

187
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 3>different than alcohol.</v>

188
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 3>They're different than other drugs.</v>

189
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think if you look sort of on a population level basis,</v>

190
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 3>they're less than alcohol.</v>

191
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can even say that.</v>

192
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

193
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I really strongly disagree with that.</v>

194
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

195
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 3>you just have to look at the death rate,</v>

196
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

197
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.661
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

198
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

199
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.320
<v Speaker 3>more people die from alcohol then,</v>

200
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

201
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 3>almost all drugs combined.</v>

202
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 3>But when we're looking at cannabis,</v>

203
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 3>there's zero deaths attributed to the use of cannabis itself.</v>

204
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.881
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

205
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:16.631
<v Speaker 3>You could say,</v>

206
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:16.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

207
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 3>someone could use cannabis and jump off a cliff or something like that,</v>

208
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking about the lethal dose.</v>

209
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 3>You cannot die from cannabis.</v>

210
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 3>And just based upon that alone,</v>

211
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 3>it makes it much,</v>

212
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 3>much safer than alcohol.</v>

213
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 3>So could you say that if that is the case?</v>

214
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

215
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.611
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

216
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 3>so that's a really good question.</v>

217
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

218
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 3>the normal number that's used for us desks from alcohols about 90,000 now,</v>

219
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 3>about 30 to 40,000 of those deaths are desk from the physical effects of</v>

220
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:44.831
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

221
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:45.041
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

222
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:45.401
<v Speaker 3>Essentially,</v>

223
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 3>liver damage,</v>

224
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 3>either chronic liver damage,</v>

225
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:48.701
<v Speaker 3>you get cirrhosis,</v>

226
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:49.534
<v Speaker 3>you die.</v>

227
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 3>In some cases,</v>

228
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 3>you can drink so much that you kill yourself in a night.</v>

229
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.471
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

230
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 3>so that's about 30 to 40,000 deaths.</v>

231
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 3>The other deaths are generally associated with alcohol,</v>

232
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 3>meaning somebody drank exactly violence,</v>

233
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:03.554
<v Speaker 3>suicide,</v>

234
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 3>car accidents and the,</v>

235
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 3>all those numbers are basically based on studies from the 90s and before where</v>

236
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 3>people looked at traffic accidents and there were certain number of those</v>

238
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 3>accidents where people had a blood alcohol content of higher than 0.1.</v>

239
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.411
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

240
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:18.681
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

241
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 3>that's an alcohol associated death.</v>

242
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a fine way to count.</v>

243
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 3>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

244
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 3>nobody has ever done that count for cannabis.</v>

245
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 3>And I can tell you based on the,</v>

246
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 3>on the tox screens that I've seen from Colorado where people,</v>

247
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

248
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 3>had cannabis in their blood and committed suicide,</v>

249
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 3>people have cannabis in,</v>

250
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 3>there are I should say THC and their blood and uh,</v>

251
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 3>and got into a fatal confrontations with police officers.</v>

252
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

253
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

254
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.981
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

255
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 3>and when we do this number for cannabis,</v>

256
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 3>which we need to do as soon as possible,</v>

257
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 3>the number's going to be a lot higher than zero.</v>

258
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 3>I suspect it will be in the 10 to 20,000 range.</v>

259
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 3>We won't know till we actually do it.</v>

260
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.061
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

261
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:53.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

262
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:53.541
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

263
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 3>let's eliminate,</v>

264
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.280
<v Speaker 1>let's go even over the alcohol.</v>

265
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Let's eliminate all things like violence and let's eliminate suicide.</v>

266
00:07:00.841 --> 00:07:03.240
<v Speaker 1>And let's assume those people would have committed violence and committed</v>

267
00:07:03.241 --> 00:07:03.661
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

268
00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:04.494
<v Speaker 1>Without it.</v>

269
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.580
<v Speaker 1>You're still looking at a giant number of people who drink themselves to death.</v>

270
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands and thousands of people every year versus zero with</v>

271
00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:12.960
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

272
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.771
<v Speaker 1>And you're aware,</v>

273
00:07:13.771 --> 00:07:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that correlation does not equal causation.</v>

274
00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:17.040
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

275
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.760
<v Speaker 1>especially in a place like Colorado where you're dealing with cannabis,</v>

276
00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:22.830
<v Speaker 1>something that stays in the system for many,</v>

277
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:23.664
<v Speaker 1>many weeks.</v>

278
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>If you're testing people and they test positive for marijuana and they wind up</v>

279
00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 1>committing suicide or they wind up committing violence,</v>

280
00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 1>they don't even necessarily have to have been under the influence of it.</v>

281
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

282
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.791
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

283
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:36.624
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

284
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Speaker 3>when you test the blood,</v>

285
00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:41.830
<v Speaker 3>you can test the both the active metabolite and the inactive metabolite THC.</v>

286
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.310
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

287
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.101
<v Speaker 3>so the test,</v>

288
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:44.790
<v Speaker 3>when you do a blood test on somebody who's,</v>

289
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

290
00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:45.781
<v Speaker 3>has committed suicide,</v>

291
00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:47.910
<v Speaker 3>it's sophisticated enough to tease that out.</v>

292
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.600
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of people who have the active metabolite in their blood.</v>

293
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

294
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.100
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

295
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.721
<v Speaker 3>Alcoholics,</v>

296
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:55.230
<v Speaker 3>they physically toxic substance.</v>

297
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Cannabis is a neurotoxin for a lot of people.</v>

298
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.040
<v Speaker 3>But in addition to,</v>

299
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

300
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.030
<v Speaker 3>the death,</v>

301
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.660
<v Speaker 3>there's also just the morbidity that's associated with alcohol.</v>

302
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean it ruins people's lives.</v>

303
00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:06.360
<v Speaker 3>That ruins marriages.</v>

304
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

305
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:07.950
<v Speaker 3>it leads to weight gain.</v>

306
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.020
<v Speaker 3>It leads to a lot of metabolic disturbances</v>

307
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>for some people with marijuana too.</v>

308
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I think you could say some people,</v>

309
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>especially weight gain at,</v>

310
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>some people smoke a lot of pot and they get lazy and they started eating Cheetos</v>

311
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:18.981
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>

312
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

313
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>and you could also say that with some people,</v>

314
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:22.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.770
<v Speaker 1>the waken bakers that you know,</v>

316
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:26.420
<v Speaker 1>seem to be wasting their lives away.</v>

317
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's like the stereotypical negative con.</v>

318
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:30.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

319
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:30.731
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

320
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about a negative description of a marijuana user,</v>

321
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 1>it's the waking Baker at the person who is high all the time.</v>

322
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>You could absolutely said that could really ruin relationships.</v>

323
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>You could absolutely say that it would ruin your job.</v>

324
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.471
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>

325
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:42.071
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

326
00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:42.520
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

327
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:42.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:47.620
<v Speaker 3>we're using the term marijuana and really we should be using THC or high THC</v>

329
00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:47.851
<v Speaker 3>when we're,</v>

330
00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:48.600
<v Speaker 3>when we're saying that.</v>

331
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

332
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

333
00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:54.090
<v Speaker 3>people who use a high CBD every day as we know are most people listen to this</v>

334
00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 3>part of the CBD is non psychoactive,</v>

335
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.070
<v Speaker 4>does not get you high super benefits.</v>

336
00:08:58.071 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

337
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 4>that can be extremely beneficial for,</v>

338
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:00.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

339
00:09:00.911 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 4>a variety of different disorders that people have.</v>

340
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

341
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

342
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 4>we really need to be careful about using cannabis versus using THC because the</v>

343
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 4>THC that can do that.</v>

344
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 4>And to your point,</v>

345
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

346
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.461
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

347
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 4>you say like THC can cause the munchies and of course that's,</v>

348
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

349
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 4>not good for someone who doesn't want to gain weight and just,</v>

350
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:19.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

351
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:20.420
<v Speaker 4>so people know the,</v>

352
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 4>the way that it does do that is when she see attached it to the CB one receptor.</v>

353
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 4>You had an increase in a hormone called Ghrelin and Ghrelin,</v>

354
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

355
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 4>can actually induce hunger.</v>

356
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 4>And that's why people get get the munchies.</v>

357
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.851
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

358
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 4>that is not necessarily a bad thing if you're someone who has cancer or if</v>

359
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 4>you're someone you know,</v>

360
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:39.070
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

361
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 4>who's wasting away from,</v>

362
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

363
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 4>from a terrible illness.</v>

364
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

365
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.873
<v Speaker 4>sometimes,</v>

366
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

367
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:43.900
<v Speaker 4>having,</v>

368
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

369
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.350
<v Speaker 4>having the munchies is,</v>

370
00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 4>is definitely a good thing.</v>

371
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

372
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.171
<v Speaker 4>and I know,</v>

373
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:48.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

374
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:50.570
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people have said to me,</v>

375
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

376
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.660
<v Speaker 4>it's not available so you should probably not talk about as much,</v>

377
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:57.760
<v Speaker 4>but there is another cannabinoid called THCV.</v>

378
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.681
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

379
00:09:58.681 --> 00:09:59.020
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

380
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 4>there's over a hundred cannabinoids in cannabis cheat seeing CD early,</v>

381
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:02.660
<v Speaker 4>two of them,</v>

382
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

383
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 4>those are the main ones that people know about.</v>

384
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 4>So THCV has been shown to actually reduce appetite.</v>

385
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 4>So if we can get that out there in the market,</v>

386
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:11.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

387
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:12.391
<v Speaker 4>like we have with,</v>

388
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:13.224
<v Speaker 4>with CBD,</v>

389
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.500
<v Speaker 4>then we can almost seal,</v>

390
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.620
<v Speaker 4>eliminate or potentially,</v>

391
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

392
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 4>substantially reduced the problem that people have with,</v>

393
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

394
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.270
<v Speaker 4>with THC by using it,</v>

395
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

396
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.921
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

397
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:22.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

398
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.510
<v Speaker 4>THCV darker.</v>

399
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 4>And I have a question for you.</v>

400
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 4>When people come into your practice,</v>

401
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.083
<v Speaker 4>did they,</v>

402
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.120
<v Speaker 4>do they want high CBD products or did they want to get intoxicated and no,</v>

403
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.143
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

404
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.163
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

405
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:33.451
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

406
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:33.811
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

407
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:34.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

408
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:37.000
<v Speaker 4>So it's like if they don't need to go to him to get intoxicated.</v>

409
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.531
<v Speaker 4>So people,</v>

410
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 4>so you're seeing a population that is genuinely interested in the health</v>

411
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:41.401
<v Speaker 4>benefits?</v>

412
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:42.121
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely,</v>

413
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:43.200
<v Speaker 4>because I mean if,</v>

414
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 4>and I mean I'm glad that that,</v>

415
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:45.121
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

416
00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 4>that's legalized in Canada because it does make my job a little bit easier</v>

417
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 4>because be like basically everyone who is coming to me now,</v>

418
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 4>I know that they want to use it medically because if they want use it</v>

419
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:55.134
<v Speaker 4>recreationally,</v>

420
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean they just go to the store,</v>

421
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.241
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

422
00:10:57.241 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's kind of a pain to get in to see me come in and have the discussion,</v>

423
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.371
<v Speaker 4>all that type of stuff.</v>

424
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:03.001
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

425
00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 4>the people who see me now,</v>

426
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

427
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:04.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

428
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 4>they're all using it medically.</v>

429
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:06.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

430
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

431
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

432
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 4>to answer your question though,</v>

433
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 4>Alex,</v>

434
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.100
<v Speaker 4>almost all my patients,</v>

435
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 4>as soon as they come in,</v>

436
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.590
<v Speaker 4>they say I don't want to get high.</v>

437
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get high.</v>

438
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 4>Like that's almost what everyone says.</v>

439
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

440
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:17.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

441
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 4>I think the word is out there that uh,</v>

442
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:20.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

443
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 4>CBD is non psychoactive and it doesn't get you high.</v>

444
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Speaker 4>And I think that a lot of people are really interested in that compound.</v>

445
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

446
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.490
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

447
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.960
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

448
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 4>if the people didn't have the success that they've had over the past few years,</v>

449
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

450
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't be as popular as it is.</v>

451
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:35.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

452
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

453
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.443
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

454
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

455
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

456
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.210
<v Speaker 4>we do need to look at the scientific evidence,</v>

457
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 4>but we do need to listen to others.</v>

458
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.390
<v Speaker 4>And the anecdotal evidence is,</v>

459
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

460
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.231
<v Speaker 4>something that,</v>

461
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:43.480
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

462
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 4>that we should consider because it is so strong.</v>

463
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.201
<v Speaker 4>Alex,</v>

464
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:47.011
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you this.</v>

465
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you consider it medicine when it has proven medical benefits?</v>

466
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 4>It obviously can be medicine,</v>

467
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 4>these narrow things</v>

468
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.780
<v Speaker 3>that the FDA has approved it for.</v>

469
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 3>But as you know,</v>

470
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure when people talk about it as Madison,</v>

471
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:00.500
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>

472
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:00.930
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

473
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.763
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

474
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

475
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 3>the ballot initiatives that have gotten it approved as a medicine have really</v>

476
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:08.500
<v Speaker 3>essentially deceive voters about the process.</v>

477
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.011
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

478
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 3>So you go to,</v>

479
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:10.730
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

480
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 3>you go to a pot doctor,</v>

481
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 3>you get an authorization.</v>

482
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 3>That authorization essentially enables you to buy as much cannabis as you want</v>

483
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 3>for the next year.</v>

484
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time in reality,</v>

485
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 3>these doctors are not giving you a real medical examination.</v>

486
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:25.151
<v Speaker 3>They're saying to you,</v>

487
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:25.331
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

488
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:25.991
<v Speaker 3>do you have pain?</v>

489
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:26.771
<v Speaker 3>Do you have anxiety?</v>

490
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Here's your authorization.</v>

491
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should speak for every single about.</v>

492
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.793
<v Speaker 3>We don't do that.</v>

493
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

494
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.001
<v Speaker 3>at my clinic.</v>

495
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 3>And I know that,</v>

496
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:34.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

497
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the clinics in Canada anyway,</v>

498
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

499
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 3>we definitely do not do that.</v>

500
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

501
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

502
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

503
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.010
<v Speaker 3>we provide a lot of education at my clinic and there's other clinics in Canada</v>

504
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.440
<v Speaker 3>also provide education.</v>

505
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

506
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

507
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.560
<v Speaker 3>and I imagine there's a spectrum,</v>

508
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 3>but in the US,</v>

509
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.120
<v Speaker 3>this was a [inaudible].</v>

510
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.580
<v Speaker 3>And I spoke to advocates for my book.</v>

511
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 3>I spoke to Rob Kampia,</v>

512
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:52.870
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

513
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

514
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 3>who ran the marijuana policy project for a long time,</v>

515
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

516
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:56.711
<v Speaker 3>for the book.</v>

517
00:12:56.711 --> 00:12:57.544
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

518
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.510
<v Speaker 3>and he acknowledged,</v>

519
00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

520
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 3>advocates knew that this was a backdoor route to legalization in the year.</v>

521
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.180
<v Speaker 3>I used to joke around about it.</v>

522
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.550
<v Speaker 3>My doctor said,</v>

523
00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

524
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 3>why did you do pot?</v>

525
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:06.851
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

526
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:07.684
<v Speaker 3>I'd get headaches.</v>

527
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.141
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

528
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 3>when do you get headaches?</v>

529
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:09.371
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

530
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 3>whenever I think about the fact that pot's illegal,</v>

531
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.180
<v Speaker 3>so he wrote me a prescription.</v>

532
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:13.361
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

533
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:14.320
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest about it.</v>

534
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.633
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

535
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.121
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

536
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I say in the book at the end,</v>

537
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this should be,</v>

538
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 3>this substance should be legal.</v>

539
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:20.920
<v Speaker 3>I have favor decriminalization.</v>

540
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:22.030
<v Speaker 3>We're just sort of jumping ahead here.</v>

541
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 3>But if it's gonna be legal,</v>

542
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have it be legal for recreational use.</v>

543
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather that we don't pretend that THC high cannabis is a medicine and I'd</v>

544
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 3>rather separate out.</v>

545
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.511
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that same?</v>

546
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

547
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.841
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

548
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:37.060
<v Speaker 3>But why are you saying don't pretend?</v>

549
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Because there's many medicines that have horrific side effects.</v>

550
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 3>The medicine,</v>

551
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.370
<v Speaker 3>THC in regards to children's autism is pretty significant and well documented.</v>

552
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.820
<v Speaker 3>The epilepsy,</v>

553
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.683
<v Speaker 3>autism,</v>

554
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:54.040
<v Speaker 3>those are two huge things that happen with children that they've been shown to</v>

555
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:55.900
<v Speaker 3>severely mitigate with,</v>

556
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 3>with edible marijuana.</v>

557
00:13:57.191 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 3>So I have to push back on your a little bit.</v>

558
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 3>CBD has been shown to reduce seizures in children with epilepsy.</v>

559
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.060
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

560
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.320
<v Speaker 3>it's improved for the anecdotal,</v>

561
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:10.321
<v Speaker 3>but I have a good friend who has a child who he uses it on and he showed it.</v>

562
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.980
<v Speaker 3>He mean it's been a game changer.</v>

563
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

564
00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:14.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean I let just,</v>

565
00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:15.090
<v Speaker 3>let me interrupt for a sec.</v>

566
00:14:15.091 --> 00:14:15.371
<v Speaker 3>Slick.</v>

567
00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:19.090
<v Speaker 3>I had a patient four or five years ago and uh,</v>

568
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 3>she was 20 years old.</v>

569
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.020
<v Speaker 3>She couldn't drive a car because she had seizures.</v>

570
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:23.321
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

571
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 3>So you can imagine being 20 years old,</v>

572
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 3>not being able to drive a car,</v>

573
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 3>all your friends are driving around.</v>

574
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.420
<v Speaker 3>So she uses a little bit of CBD,</v>

575
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 3>not even every day.</v>

576
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.920
<v Speaker 3>She's never had a seizure saying,</v>

577
00:14:34.921 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

578
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 3>and now she's able to drive her car.</v>

579
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.451
<v Speaker 3>But this is,</v>

580
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:38.710
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about CBD,</v>

581
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.210
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about THC.</v>

582
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.220
<v Speaker 3>And so you're talking about,</v>

583
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.450
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a case.</v>

584
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

585
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:44.460
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

586
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.320
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying that your friend's situation didn't happen.</v>

587
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's not real.</v>

588
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:53.191
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that the reason we have clinical trials is because science,</v>

589
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.840
<v Speaker 3>the way you know whether a medicine works or not,</v>

590
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 3>whether a chemical compound works,</v>

591
00:14:58.281 --> 00:14:59.540
<v Speaker 3>whatever that company is,</v>

592
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 3>the best way to know is you give it to two groups of you give,</v>

593
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 3>you give the real medicine to one group of people and you'd give a placebo to</v>

594
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 3>the other group and you see the changes in those two groups over time and you</v>

595
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:11.810
<v Speaker 3>find out whether you're not,</v>

596
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 3>your theory about whether this works on a population level basis is real or not.</v>

597
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 3>That's how that is at the core of medical science.</v>

598
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 3>And we've basically thrown that rule out for THC.</v>

599
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Well that's not entirely correct.</v>

600
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 3>You do know that there's were studies that were run during the Nixon</v>

601
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:30.890
<v Speaker 3>administration that showed the efficacy of marijuana and the safety of it,</v>

602
00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 3>and those were all squashed.</v>

603
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:32.774
<v Speaker 3>And you also,</v>

604
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you know like when we're talking about marijuana,</v>

605
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 3>you talking about something that's federally illegal,</v>

606
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:41.560
<v Speaker 3>it's not something that's easy that's easy to run these FDA studies on.</v>

607
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:41.871
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

608
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:42.420
<v Speaker 3>and I do.</v>

609
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.280
<v Speaker 3>And I said at the end of the book,</v>

610
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:44.450
<v Speaker 3>I think we should drop that.</v>

611
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I think anybody who's got a legitimate interest in researching either THC or</v>

612
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 3>cannabis or any of the compounds for a,</v>

613
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 3>for a medical condition,</v>

614
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 3>let them run phase one,</v>

615
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.081
<v Speaker 3>phase two,</v>

616
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:54.591
<v Speaker 3>phase three,</v>

617
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:54.891
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>

618
00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if this,</v>

619
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 3>if this,</v>

620
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 3>if this plant is good for these things,</v>

621
00:15:58.431 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a great idea.</v>

622
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 3>But still,</v>

623
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 3>why you saying that you don't think it is medicine when all these people find</v>

624
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:05.451
<v Speaker 3>benefit in it?</v>

625
00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:05.990
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

626
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 3>so do you think they're getting it from just the CBD,</v>

627
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 3>the minimal amount of CBD and marijuana?</v>

628
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.361
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

629
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:12.590
<v Speaker 3>I think that again,</v>

630
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

631
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:18.250
<v Speaker 3>there's been a lot of research done on THC and cannabis to see whether or not</v>

632
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.123
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

633
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 3>whether THC is a compound in weather,</v>

634
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:21.261
<v Speaker 3>smoke,</v>

635
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 3>cannabis can treat these conditions.</v>

636
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 3>And for the most part the studies have been negative.</v>

637
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.791
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

638
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:26.270
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

639
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 3>there's negative in what way?</v>

640
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Meaning they haven't shown any actual,</v>

641
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

642
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.441
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

643
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 3>can you stay cite these studies there?</v>

644
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned that in my book.</v>

645
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

646
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:35.691
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

647
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:36.051
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

648
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:38.810
<v Speaker 3>what were the conclusions of these studies when you're saying that they're not</v>

649
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>

650
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.010
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>

651
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:40.431
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

652
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't work,</v>

653
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 3>that the drug didn't work on what?</v>

654
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 3>On cancer,</v>

655
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 3>on Alzheimer's disease,</v>

656
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 3>on irritable bowel syndrome,</v>

657
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.330
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

658
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:49.960
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

659
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.281
<v Speaker 4>Alex,</v>

660
00:16:50.281 --> 00:16:50.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

661
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:50.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

662
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.650
<v Speaker 4>you're throwing a few different things out there and you know,</v>

663
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.710
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate the fact that we can't be going around.</v>

664
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.650
<v Speaker 4>You're saying things like,</v>

665
00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:57.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

666
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.300
<v Speaker 4>cannabis cures cancer,</v>

667
00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:58.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

668
00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.770
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

669
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.400
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

670
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

671
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:01.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

672
00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:05.140
<v Speaker 4>and I've done done videos and this even like recently stating that,</v>

673
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.030
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at the research,</v>

674
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean specifically if you look at specific cancers,</v>

675
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

676
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.140
<v Speaker 4>there are studies that have shown that THC and CBD can help.</v>

677
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:14.981
<v Speaker 4>Like it's safe.</v>

678
00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:16.120
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about breast cancer.</v>

679
00:17:16.121 --> 00:17:18.010
<v Speaker 4>And I did a video on this recently.</v>

680
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:18.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

681
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:22.810
<v Speaker 4>if you are her two positive and you use cheap seeing CBD,</v>

682
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.980
<v Speaker 4>it came in fact,</v>

683
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

684
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.520
<v Speaker 4>reduce tumor size and it can reduce tumor growth.</v>

685
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.060
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

686
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.900
<v Speaker 4>if you have,</v>

687
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.240
<v Speaker 4>what does,</v>

688
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:29.591
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

689
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:30.310
<v Speaker 4>can I interrupt you?</v>

690
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.143
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

691
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.130
<v Speaker 4>What does it subset of breast cancer,</v>

692
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

693
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:33.810
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

694
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:34.510
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

695
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.811
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

696
00:17:34.811 --> 00:17:38.020
<v Speaker 4>there's different types of breast cancer and that's just one subset of,</v>

697
00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:38.860
<v Speaker 4>of breast cancer.</v>

698
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.270
<v Speaker 4>So there are other breast cancers which do not express cannabinoid receptors.</v>

699
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:43.691
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

700
00:17:43.691 --> 00:17:45.580
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a one study,</v>

701
00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:45.941
<v Speaker 4>at least,</v>

702
00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:46.241
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

703
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 4>it's only one study that show that when they gave cheats seat and animal model</v>

704
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 4>and actually cause a proliferation of,</v>

705
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:52.621
<v Speaker 4>of tumor,</v>

706
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:53.454
<v Speaker 4>so at worse than them.</v>

707
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:53.930
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

708
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:54.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

709
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.400
<v Speaker 4>I do agree with you Alex and the fact that,</v>

710
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:56.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

711
00:17:56.521 --> 00:17:59.940
<v Speaker 4>we have to be careful about using terms like that,</v>

712
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.910
<v Speaker 4>but that just doesn't mean that we can't say that cannabis has no good for</v>

713
00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:03.744
<v Speaker 4>cancer at all.</v>

714
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.171
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

715
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 4>even in the National Academies of Science and Engineering Report,</v>

716
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:07.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

717
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:08.870
<v Speaker 4>they said that cancer was,</v>

718
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.320
<v Speaker 4>was great for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.</v>

719
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

720
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

721
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

722
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.630
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely a really good,</v>

723
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

724
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:16.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

725
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.401
<v Speaker 4>medicine for,</v>

726
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:17.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

727
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 4>a lot of different things.</v>

728
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 4>And when we're talking about cheat,</v>

729
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

730
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

731
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.361
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

732
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:21.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

733
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I said earlier of course,</v>

734
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 4>and we need to be careful about,</v>

735
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 4>about THC,</v>

736
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 4>but it definitely is still a medicine.</v>

737
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.030
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

738
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 4>to your point with regards to,</v>

739
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

740
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

741
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.210
<v Speaker 4>not being a medicine say for something like Ptsd,</v>

742
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

743
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.540
<v Speaker 4>I come from it from a clinician's point of view,</v>

744
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not a researcher,</v>

745
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 4>so I need to make sure that my patients are getting better.</v>

746
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.310
<v Speaker 4>It's very frustrating for me just to say to someone,</v>

747
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:44.641
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

748
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:45.810
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing I can do for you.</v>

749
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:46.930
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing I can do for,</v>

750
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

751
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

752
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.900
<v Speaker 4>and I understand that,</v>

753
00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:49.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

754
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 4>doing something sometimes a is not going to be beneficial just because you're</v>

755
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:54.331
<v Speaker 4>doing something,</v>

756
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:56.040
<v Speaker 4>you have to do something that actually works.</v>

757
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

758
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

759
00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:00.210
<v Speaker 4>we do have epidemiological studies and we have,</v>

760
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

761
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.040
<v Speaker 4>other studies have shown that,</v>

762
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

763
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

764
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:03.481
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

765
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 4>when patients are given a cannabis,</v>

766
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.580
<v Speaker 4>it can reduce their symptoms of PTSD.</v>

767
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 4>There's also another study,</v>

768
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:10.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

769
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:11.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't use this drug too often,</v>

770
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 4>call it called Nabilone.</v>

771
00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 4>So nabilone is just pure THC.</v>

772
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 4>Nabilone was shown to reduce nightmares and people who have PTSD.</v>

773
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.090
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

774
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

775
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.540
<v Speaker 4>it's just saying,</v>

776
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:21.901
<v Speaker 4>just so,</v>

777
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 4>just because THC is psychoactive doesn't mean that it's not a medicine.</v>

778
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.700
<v Speaker 4>And just to keep on the topic of,</v>

779
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 4>of PTSD.</v>

780
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:29.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

781
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.181
<v Speaker 4>in addition to that,</v>

782
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:32.280
<v Speaker 4>we've identified mechanisms of action.</v>

783
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

784
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:33.661
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

785
00:19:33.661 --> 00:19:33.791
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

786
00:19:33.791 --> 00:19:34.680
<v Speaker 4>and there's one study,</v>

787
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 4>I think Matt Hill was on the w was one of the authors of that study and he</v>

788
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:41.640
<v Speaker 4>noticed that and people who have PTSD,</v>

789
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.820
<v Speaker 4>there's an over 50% decrease in,</v>

790
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:45.181
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

791
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 4>in levels of [inaudible].</v>

792
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 4>So a nature naturally occurring,</v>

793
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

794
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 4>which is a naturally occurring in the canal when it correct.</v>

795
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.251
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

796
00:19:53.251 --> 00:19:55.050
<v Speaker 4>so you can get that through,</v>

797
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 4>through exercise,</v>

798
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 4>which is one excellent way to do it.</v>

799
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

800
00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.980
<v Speaker 4>and that's part of the,</v>

801
00:19:58.981 --> 00:19:59.041
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

802
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:01.320
<v Speaker 4>the high that you get after you exercise.</v>

803
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 4>But the other way that you can get it is by using cannabis.</v>

804
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:05.311
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>

805
00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:05.721
<v Speaker 4>when she,</v>

806
00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 4>she attaches to those CB one receptors,</v>

807
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 4>you can get a release of an aunt of mine and,</v>

808
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

809
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.910
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a dial can actually increase in animals by another mechanism of</v>

810
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:16.020
<v Speaker 4>action as well.</v>

811
00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

812
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

813
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 4>there's different ways where we can,</v>

814
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

815
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.240
<v Speaker 4>raise a level of,</v>

816
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 4>of deficiency.</v>

817
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

818
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

819
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 4>to me as a clinician,</v>

820
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

821
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:27.270
<v Speaker 4>if I have someone who is not doing very well,</v>

822
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:27.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

823
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 4>they've been on a bunch of different medications,</v>

824
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.020
<v Speaker 4>I've identified that,</v>

825
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:31.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

826
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.550
<v Speaker 4>they have PTSD,</v>

827
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:33.960
<v Speaker 4>we have mechanisms of action,</v>

828
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.010
<v Speaker 4>we have studies.</v>

829
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 4>And then again too,</v>

830
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

831
00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 4>don't discount my clinical experience.</v>

832
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:39.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

833
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.610
<v Speaker 4>I've been working for over five years,</v>

834
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

835
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:42.861
<v Speaker 4>just with,</v>

836
00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:43.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

837
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 4>just with cannabis.</v>

838
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

839
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.330
<v Speaker 4>I do other medicines,</v>

840
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:45.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

841
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 4>I use prescribed other medicines well,</v>

842
00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 4>but I've been doing cannabis medicine for over five years and you know,</v>

843
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.681
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot that,</v>

844
00:20:51.681 --> 00:20:52.514
<v Speaker 4>that I've learned,</v>

845
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.841
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

846
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:54.250
<v Speaker 4>So as much as I've learned,</v>

847
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:54.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

848
00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 4>through reading studies,</v>

849
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

850
00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:56.840
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

851
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.900
<v Speaker 4>and through going to conferences and things like that,</v>

852
00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

853
00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:04.411
<v Speaker 4>for sure that the best resource as a clinician is to learn from your patients</v>

854
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 4>and to hear what your patients tell me.</v>

855
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.250
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

856
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

857
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 4>the things that my patients tell me is that THC is really effective for the</v>

858
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:13.534
<v Speaker 4>sleep at night.</v>

859
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of my patients,</v>

860
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 4>especially my veteran patients,</v>

861
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 4>have done really,</v>

862
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:18.030
<v Speaker 4>really well with,</v>

863
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>

864
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.111
<v Speaker 4>And just,</v>

865
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 4>just one further point too,</v>

866
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

867
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.611
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>

868
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:22.271
<v Speaker 4>I know it was,</v>

869
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 4>it was a 2015 I believe it was.</v>

870
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:25.300
<v Speaker 4>There was a Meta analysis done.</v>

871
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I can pull it up if we need to that indicated that,</v>

872
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

873
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:28.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

874
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:33.670
<v Speaker 4>a lot of medicines that are being used now for PTSD or just simply ineffective.</v>

875
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.330
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing too is that there's never been a medicine made specifically</v>

876
00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:38.920
<v Speaker 4>for PTSD.</v>

877
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.330
<v Speaker 4>So all the medicines that people are using or for anxiety or for depression or</v>

878
00:21:43.331 --> 00:21:44.170
<v Speaker 4>the for insomnia,</v>

879
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 4>there are there for something else,</v>

880
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

881
00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:47.560
<v Speaker 4>but when we look at like,</v>

882
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 4>like a study that says people with PTSD have a lower level of [inaudible] and</v>

883
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:55.120
<v Speaker 4>then if you can increase that a level of Nando mind,</v>

884
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:55.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

885
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:57.160
<v Speaker 4>that's a good way to treat someone.</v>

886
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.810
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter whether it's a vitamin,</v>

887
00:21:58.811 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a hormone,</v>

888
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.500
<v Speaker 4>if as long as you are correcting a deficiency,</v>

889
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.200
<v Speaker 4>you're generally going to get excellent clinical results.</v>

890
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.250
<v Speaker 2>So let me,</v>

891
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.500
<v Speaker 2>let me sort of try to frame this a different way.</v>

892
00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

893
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 2>alcohol reduces blood pressure.</v>

894
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

895
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol in,</v>

896
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:14.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

897
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.980
<v Speaker 2>generally tends to reduce cardiovascular events for people.</v>

898
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

899
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 2>and during prohibition you could actually get a doctor's note for alcohol as a</v>

900
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:23.494
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>

901
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.090
<v Speaker 2>but alcohol is not a medicine.</v>

902
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:25.451
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

903
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a recreational intoxicant.</v>

904
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 2>It has some positive biological qualities and some negative biological</v>

905
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:31.834
<v Speaker 2>qualities.</v>

906
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.561
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

907
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:36.160
<v Speaker 2>there was an argument I think in 10 to 20 years ago should we recommend that</v>

908
00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:39.280
<v Speaker 2>people drink moderately one to two drinks a day.</v>

909
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.540
<v Speaker 2>And I think for the most part,</v>

910
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

911
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.510
<v Speaker 2>the medical profession has come down on the side of saying,</v>

912
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:44.800
<v Speaker 2>let's not do that.</v>

913
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.770
<v Speaker 2>There's too many noncardiac uh,</v>

914
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 2>negative side effects with alcohol.</v>

915
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.660
<v Speaker 4>Just on that note though,</v>

916
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:52.040
<v Speaker 4>Alex in Canada right now,</v>

917
00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:56.420
<v Speaker 4>I know the safe alcohol drinking guidelines are 14 drinks per week for men and</v>

918
00:22:56.421 --> 00:22:57.690
<v Speaker 4>nine drinks a week for,</v>

919
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:58.221
<v Speaker 4>for women.</v>

920
00:22:58.221 --> 00:22:58.800
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

921
00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

922
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.040
<v Speaker 4>basically to sue a day for men,</v>

923
00:23:01.041 --> 00:23:01.874
<v Speaker 4>one and a half.</v>

924
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

925
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.891
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying,</v>

926
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

927
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.240
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>

928
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.120
<v Speaker 2>we don't see huge negative consequences at that level.</v>

929
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.073
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

930
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.153
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

931
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:10.443
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

932
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.360
<v Speaker 2>That's a totally reasonable way to think about alcohol.</v>

933
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.070
<v Speaker 2>But what we're not saying that people was,</v>

934
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 2>this is a medicine.</v>

935
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.710
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's where the confusion around really around high THC,</v>

936
00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:21.730
<v Speaker 2>cannabis lies.</v>

937
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

938
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

939
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to say that your friend's child is not benefiting.</v>

940
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.820
<v Speaker 2>I if you say,</v>

941
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:28.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

942
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.110
<v Speaker 2>he or she's benefiting.</v>

943
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.973
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>

944
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is that that's not good enough for science.</v>

945
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 2>We need randomized controlled trials.</v>

946
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 2>And when those trials have been done and a lot of them have been done,</v>

947
00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

948
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them have been done.</v>

949
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.080
<v Speaker 2>They've almost unequivocally showing the cannabis doesn't work as a medicine,</v>

950
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>the only actual place where beyond</v>

951
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 3>these sort of very limited conditions like chemotherapy associated nausea,</v>

952
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 3>which obviously is terrible for people who have it,</v>

953
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:52.880
<v Speaker 3>but isn't,</v>

954
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 3>isn't that common?</v>

955
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:54.614
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately,</v>

956
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

957
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 3>cannabis has been shown to work as a pain reliever,</v>

958
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.981
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

959
00:23:57.981 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Probably for the same reasons that alcohol works as a pain reliever sort of</v>

960
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 3>dulls your awareness of your pain.</v>

961
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 3>But even in that study or in those,</v>

962
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 3>even in those studies,</v>

963
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:09.980
<v Speaker 3>they're mostly done against placebo,</v>

964
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 3>not against opioids or against and ceds like Ibuprofen.</v>

965
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:19.630
<v Speaker 3>And there was a very big study for cannabis use in chronic pain over a multiyear</v>

966
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:21.830
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>

967
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

968
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.390
<v Speaker 3>in Australia that came out last year that showed that people who used cannabis</v>

969
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.440
<v Speaker 3>had a,</v>

970
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.273
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

971
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.790
<v Speaker 3>had more pain and use more opiates at the end of four years.</v>

972
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Then people who didn't.</v>

973
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

974
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.140
<v Speaker 3>so I would almost argue about what medicine is.</v>

975
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

976
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 3>That study though had a lot of flaws in it.</v>

977
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is that you need to look at someone who is already using</v>

978
00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:47.600
<v Speaker 3>cannabis versus someone who is just using opioids.</v>

979
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.250
<v Speaker 3>So if someone is just using opioids and they want to come off cannabis,</v>

980
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

981
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

982
00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 3>those Malcolm off opiates oil come off of opiates with cannabis,</v>

983
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

984
00:24:56.841 --> 00:25:00.380
<v Speaker 3>multiple studies have shown that that that can be effective.</v>

985
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 3>And that's not was the what was done in the Australian study that you're</v>

986
00:25:03.651 --> 00:25:06.360
<v Speaker 3>referring to get a more naturalistic approach.</v>

987
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

988
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:06.911
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

989
00:25:06.911 --> 00:25:07.940
<v Speaker 3>and also too,</v>

990
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:08.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

991
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:08.510
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

992
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have access to medical marijuana during that whole,</v>

993
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 3>during that whole time.</v>

994
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.400
<v Speaker 3>Those are all self reported and they were getting it from,</v>

995
00:25:16.401 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

996
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 3>recreational sources.</v>

997
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Speaker 3>They weren't getting it from.</v>

998
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.091
<v Speaker 3>That's a big,</v>

999
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 3>that's a big distinction though Alex.</v>

1000
00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Like they weren't getting it from a doctor who prescribed it.</v>

1001
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Two of them,</v>

1002
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.590
<v Speaker 3>they were there.</v>

1003
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:30.060
<v Speaker 3>This was a self reported study and people are getting cannabis that you know,</v>

1004
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.850
<v Speaker 3>they didn't really know what they were getting.</v>

1005
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.790
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a,</v>

1006
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 3>they weren't given any information from a doctor and that's why it's a medicine</v>

1007
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:36.771
<v Speaker 3>Alex,</v>

1008
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:38.900
<v Speaker 3>because you can tell someone,</v>

1009
00:25:38.901 --> 00:25:40.670
<v Speaker 3>you can tell a patient to take,</v>

1010
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1011
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of CBD every single day and when you take a certain amount</v>

1012
00:25:44.841 --> 00:25:45.650
<v Speaker 3>every single day,</v>

1013
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.890
<v Speaker 3>it can reduce your symptoms and sometimes you need to increase that and</v>

1014
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:50.200
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you need to decrease.</v>

1015
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I think we should do that with all medicines.</v>

1016
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 3>We should be really clear about the distinction though,</v>

1017
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 3>between CBD and marijuana.</v>

1018
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:55.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're,</v>

1019
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:58.190
<v Speaker 3>we're really talking about the psychoactive version of it.</v>

1020
00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.061
<v Speaker 3>This is where,</v>

1021
00:25:59.061 --> 00:26:00.380
<v Speaker 3>where you're saying it's negative,</v>

1022
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.130
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

1023
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.540
<v Speaker 3>you're not really arguing that CVD dr hardest talking about,</v>

1024
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about using this as a medicine.</v>

1025
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Certainly using the CVD.</v>

1026
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.370
<v Speaker 3>He's titrating his patients,</v>

1027
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 3>he's monitoring them.</v>

1028
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 3>He's not writing them an authorization and saint come back in a year when it,</v>

1029
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.673
<v Speaker 3>when it's up,</v>

1030
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.310
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1031
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1032
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 3>he's being a physician and you know,</v>

1033
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 3>and I think to the extent that marijuana is medicine,</v>

1034
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 3>we want people like him.</v>

1035
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.280
<v Speaker 3>So you were admitted it's medicine.</v>

1036
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:25.521
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1037
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:25.701
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1038
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1039
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't admit that.</v>

1040
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.753
<v Speaker 3>But you just said that.</v>

1041
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:29.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I just said that</v>

1042
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.500
<v Speaker 3>cause I think I said to the extent I'm trying to meet you,</v>

1043
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.260
<v Speaker 3>I'll stop doing that.</v>

1044
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1045
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:37.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1046
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.420
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1047
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 3>I think you said something else that was really interesting to me.</v>

1048
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 3>And this came up in the book too.</v>

1049
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 3>So you're a clinician,</v>

1050
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.380
<v Speaker 2>you see sick people and you know,</v>

1051
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:46.621
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

1052
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:47.940
<v Speaker 2>my wife's a doctor too.</v>

1053
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:48.810
<v Speaker 2>She's a psychiatrist.</v>

1054
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:49.890
<v Speaker 2>That's how I sort of got hidden this.</v>

1055
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 2>But my wife is a forensic psychiatrist less than a clinician these days.</v>

1056
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.290
<v Speaker 2>Her job is to evaluate people,</v>

1057
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.790
<v Speaker 2>not so much to treat people.</v>

1058
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Your job is to treat people.</v>

1059
00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 2>You see sick people.</v>

1060
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 2>You want to help them feel better and you don't want to tell them,</v>

1061
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing I can do for you.</v>

1062
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:05.830
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing,</v>

1063
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 2>there's no hope for your pain.</v>

1064
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 2>There's no hope for your PTSD.</v>

1065
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 2>You want to help them.</v>

1066
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 2>And I totally get that.</v>

1067
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 2>But if you're an epidemiologist or a researcher who's,</v>

1068
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.820
<v Speaker 2>who's trying to guide the,</v>

1069
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:17.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 2>the views on the medical practice of hundreds of thousands of doctors,</v>

1071
00:27:20.881 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 2>that's not good enough.</v>

1072
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.790
<v Speaker 2>So you need to step back.</v>

1073
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.923
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1074
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I think you know,</v>

1075
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:26.191
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1076
00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 2>this epidemiologist in in Britain who I talked to,</v>

1077
00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.311
<v Speaker 2>he said to me,</v>

1078
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:29.910
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1079
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:30.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1080
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I try not to draw conclusions because so often when I try to draw them,</v>

1081
00:27:34.411 --> 00:27:35.244
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong.</v>

1082
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 4>And we need to be careful about that.</v>

1084
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:38.791
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1085
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:39.070
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1086
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.751
<v Speaker 4>and Alex,</v>

1087
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:40.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1088
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1089
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 4>one thing that was mentioned in your book,</v>

1090
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1091
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1092
00:27:43.541 --> 00:27:44.010
<v Speaker 4>it was that,</v>

1093
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1094
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 4>you often,</v>

1095
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 4>you often cited the national academies of science and Engineering,</v>

1096
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.421
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1097
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1098
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:49.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1099
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Speaker 4>Ziva Cooper,</v>

1100
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:50.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1101
00:27:50.521 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 4>she's a member of that committee.</v>

1102
00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1103
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 4>she put out on our Twitter,</v>

1104
00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:54.631
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1105
00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:55.351
<v Speaker 4>you can go to it.</v>

1106
00:27:55.351 --> 00:28:00.351
<v Speaker 4>It's from January 9th of 2019 she says in response in the recent year times</v>

1107
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 4>editorial on cannabis and as a committee member,</v>

1108
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.743
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>

1109
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.013
<v Speaker 4>let me finish,</v>

1110
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.700
<v Speaker 4>let me finish finish context of where it came from,</v>

1111
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.140
<v Speaker 4>but this is someone you site,</v>

1112
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 4>Knight inside her excited,</v>

1113
00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 4>you cited the report and she's a member of that,</v>

1114
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.770
<v Speaker 4>all of that.</v>

1115
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1116
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 4>So she said in response to the recent New York Times editorial on cannabis as a</v>

1117
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 4>committee member on NASA,</v>

1118
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 4>which is that committee and cannabinoids support,</v>

1119
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.610
<v Speaker 4>we did not conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia.</v>

1120
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.680
<v Speaker 4>Then the drug alliance policy also said the report did not reach that</v>

1121
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:35.514
<v Speaker 4>conclusion.</v>

1122
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.610
<v Speaker 4>So those are pretty too authoritative.</v>

1123
00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1124
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:39.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1125
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 4>sources that are saying that,</v>

1126
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:41.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1127
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 4>in your book you didn't cite the research properly.</v>

1128
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1129
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.240
<v Speaker 4>And then also they're saying that you left a lot out,</v>

1130
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:48.781
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1131
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:53.400
<v Speaker 4>They said that they have found an association between marijuana use and improved</v>

1132
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.780
<v Speaker 4>cognitive outcomes and individuals with psychotic disorders that straight from</v>

1133
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:58.650
<v Speaker 4>the same report.</v>

1134
00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1135
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.350
<v Speaker 4>you failed to mention that.</v>

1136
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:01.591
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1137
00:29:01.591 --> 00:29:02.850
<v Speaker 4>So I think that,</v>

1138
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1139
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.090
<v Speaker 4>when we're writing books or when we're giving out information,</v>

1140
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:06.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1141
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.380
<v Speaker 4>you want to do it from a balanced approach and you don't want to just select,</v>

1142
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:10.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1143
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:14.730
<v Speaker 4>the small amount of material that's just going to support your study.</v>

1144
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.211
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1145
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:16.710
<v Speaker 4>we want to be truthful here.</v>

1146
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1147
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.670
<v Speaker 4>Joe's show is always been very,</v>

1148
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.523
<v Speaker 4>very truthful.</v>

1149
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1150
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:20.221
<v Speaker 4>Joe said,</v>

1151
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:20.430
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1152
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.091
<v Speaker 4>right at the beginning,</v>

1153
00:29:21.091 --> 00:29:21.960
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't think that,</v>

1154
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:22.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1155
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.610
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1156
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 4>that cannabis is perfect for everyone and I don't think that either.</v>

1157
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 4>And in Canada we have really strict guidelines to follow.</v>

1158
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1159
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1160
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.790
<v Speaker 4>basically no one prescribes chia seed,</v>

1161
00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:34.470
<v Speaker 4>anyone under the age of,</v>

1162
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.770
<v Speaker 4>of 25 and you know,</v>

1163
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.030
<v Speaker 4>all the conferences and stuff that I go to,</v>

1164
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:39.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1165
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 4>we don't really have too many discussions about that.</v>

1166
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Like the doctors don't really have many,</v>

1167
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1168
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.730
<v Speaker 4>much of a backlash about that.</v>

1169
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1170
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.930
<v Speaker 4>so why is the distinction the age of 25 or they've decided that age?</v>

1171
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.540
<v Speaker 4>So 25 basically is when you're,</v>

1172
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:53.310
<v Speaker 4>you're fighting it.</v>

1173
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1174
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:53.950
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>

1175
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:54.070
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1176
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1177
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 4>it's fully developed.</v>

1178
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 4>And when you do look at the studies that do show an association between,</v>

1179
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 4>between cannabis and psychosis,</v>

1180
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 4>it's almost all in adolescence.</v>

1181
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:04.751
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1182
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:07.600
<v Speaker 4>I think that Alex only has one study,</v>

1183
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.260
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1184
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:08.480
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1185
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 4>and his and his book that shows an extremely weak correlation between an adult</v>

1186
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:16.020
<v Speaker 4>using cannabis and then developing any type of,</v>

1187
00:30:16.021 --> 00:30:17.260
<v Speaker 4>of mental illness later.</v>

1188
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:17.830
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1189
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1190
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.120
<v Speaker 4>25,</v>

1191
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.100
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1192
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.330
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1193
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.561
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1194
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1195
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.551
<v Speaker 4>it's a good age,</v>

1196
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:22.540
<v Speaker 4>but it's definitely a,</v>

1197
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1198
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.330
<v Speaker 4>kind of a conservative ish,</v>

1199
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.193
<v Speaker 4>ish age.</v>

1200
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1201
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:26.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1202
00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:27.131
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1203
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:27.601
<v Speaker 4>it's something that,</v>

1204
00:30:27.601 --> 00:30:28.211
<v Speaker 4>that we follow.</v>

1205
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:28.950
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>

1206
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:29.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1207
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 4>we've done well with that in Canada.</v>

1208
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.031
<v Speaker 4>So Alex,</v>

1209
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:32.680
<v Speaker 4>why did you leave those conclusions?</v>

1210
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:34.780
<v Speaker 2>I need to push back here.</v>

1211
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1212
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.510
<v Speaker 2>So the National Academy of Medicine report was drawn up by committee of 16</v>

1213
00:30:40.701 --> 00:30:41.534
<v Speaker 2>researchers.</v>

1214
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1215
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Ziva Cooper is the one who's publicly said the reports said this.</v>

1216
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.033
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1217
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.330
<v Speaker 2>but I think that we should have,</v>

1218
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1219
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.180
<v Speaker 2>emphasize that it also said this.</v>

1220
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1221
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:54.800
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>

1222
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.930
<v Speaker 2>what I wrote in that New York Times op Ed.</v>

1223
00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.321
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1224
00:30:57.321 --> 00:31:01.280
<v Speaker 2>what I wrote in the book is the plain language of the report and the plain</v>

1225
00:31:01.281 --> 00:31:06.281
<v Speaker 2>language is this cannabis use is associated with a risk of developing</v>

1226
00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:08.090
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia and other psychosis.</v>

1227
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.290
<v Speaker 2>The higher the use,</v>

1228
00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.400
<v Speaker 2>the greater the risk.</v>

1229
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I may have a word or two wrong in that cause I'm doing it from memory,</v>

1230
00:31:12.861 --> 00:31:13.790
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it said.</v>

1231
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1232
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.180
<v Speaker 2>the committee was very clear.</v>

1233
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.090
<v Speaker 2>They separated a depression.</v>

1234
00:31:20.091 --> 00:31:23.420
<v Speaker 2>They said there we don't see as nearly as high risk for depression and</v>

1235
00:31:23.421 --> 00:31:24.254
<v Speaker 2>psychosis.</v>

1236
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1237
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:25.131
<v Speaker 2>even though,</v>

1238
00:31:25.131 --> 00:31:26.030
<v Speaker 2>by the way today,</v>

1239
00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:26.900
<v Speaker 2>just today,</v>

1240
00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.640
<v Speaker 2>a Jama Psychiatry,</v>

1241
00:31:28.641 --> 00:31:31.190
<v Speaker 2>the Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry,</v>

1242
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1243
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 2>put out a Meta analysis showing that cannabis is associated with depression and</v>

1244
00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:39.200
<v Speaker 2>suicidal thinking,</v>

1245
00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1246
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:43.070
<v Speaker 2>and actually suicide attempts at a three and a half to one rate.</v>

1247
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.341
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1248
00:31:43.341 --> 00:31:44.810
<v Speaker 2>this literally was released today.</v>

1249
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1250
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.130
<v Speaker 2>but to,</v>

1251
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.963
<v Speaker 2>but to go back,</v>

1252
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Ziva is one of 16 members of that committee.</v>

1253
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.630
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to talk,</v>

1254
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.580
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to say that I misquoted the report,</v>

1255
00:31:52.581 --> 00:31:53.001
<v Speaker 2>which I did,</v>

1256
00:31:53.001 --> 00:31:54.530
<v Speaker 2>and I quoted an entirely accurately,</v>

1257
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:55.401
<v Speaker 2>you need to say,</v>

1258
00:31:55.401 --> 00:31:56.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1259
00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.360
<v Speaker 2>why aren't the other 15 members of that committee saying that I misquoted.</v>

1260
00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Why is one person who works for the cannabis research initiative at Ucla,</v>

1261
00:32:03.831 --> 00:32:06.770
<v Speaker 2>which takes money from cannabis investors and users?</v>

1262
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.140
<v Speaker 2>She's the one who said that I misquoted it.</v>

1263
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she,</v>

1264
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should ask why the other members of the committee are not speaking out</v>

1265
00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:14.960
<v Speaker 2>against my book.</v>

1266
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1267
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.340
<v Speaker 4>I think that she was just one of the 16 members that that came out.</v>

1268
00:32:19.341 --> 00:32:19.761
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1269
00:32:19.761 --> 00:32:22.340
<v Speaker 4>you can't really expect a all the other members to,</v>

1270
00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:23.174
<v Speaker 4>to potentially,</v>

1271
00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:23.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1272
00:32:23.361 --> 00:32:24.194
<v Speaker 4>comb out with that.</v>

1273
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1274
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:25.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1275
00:32:25.711 --> 00:32:27.540
<v Speaker 2>some people did something wrong.</v>

1276
00:32:27.541 --> 00:32:28.374
<v Speaker 2>If I misquoted,</v>

1277
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:29.990
<v Speaker 4>some people will and some people won't.</v>

1278
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:30.171
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1279
00:32:30.171 --> 00:32:31.100
<v Speaker 4>some people have,</v>

1280
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1281
00:32:31.401 --> 00:32:32.211
<v Speaker 4>the personality.</v>

1282
00:32:32.211 --> 00:32:33.620
<v Speaker 4>Some people have the platform,</v>

1283
00:32:33.621 --> 00:32:36.500
<v Speaker 4>like Ziva has a bunch of followers on our Twitter.</v>

1284
00:32:36.501 --> 00:32:37.640
<v Speaker 4>People know who she is.</v>

1285
00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.001
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1286
00:32:38.001 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people who do research actually are not into social media at all.</v>

1287
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:42.021
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1288
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:44.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you were at all before you had your book.</v>

1289
00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:45.554
<v Speaker 4>Where are you?</v>

1290
00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1291
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1292
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1293
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 4>So you were an in a social media at all.</v>

1294
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:50.020
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1295
00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1296
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that most people on that committee are,</v>

1297
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 4>are into social media.</v>

1298
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:54.321
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1299
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Ziva just,</v>

1300
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.040
<v Speaker 4>just happens to be,</v>

1301
00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:56.420
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1302
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.620
<v Speaker 4>I even spoke to Ziva,</v>

1303
00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1304
00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.960
<v Speaker 4>on the phone about this and you know,</v>

1305
00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.180
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1306
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.411
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1307
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 4>and she said that,</v>

1308
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1309
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:02.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1310
00:33:02.291 --> 00:33:02.550
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1311
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.383
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1312
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1313
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 4>that she agrees with everything that was in the report,</v>

1314
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Speaker 4>but she doesn't agree with your conclusions.</v>

1315
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.750
<v Speaker 4>And to go back to what's quoted from the report,</v>

1316
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.580
<v Speaker 4>but you're only quoting there,</v>

1317
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.770
<v Speaker 4>but you're only quoting the parts that,</v>

1318
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.410
<v Speaker 4>that site or soy that back your,</v>

1319
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1320
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 4>your opinions.</v>

1321
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.330
<v Speaker 4>You're not quoting the entire part like you left.</v>

1322
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:23.690
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1323
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:27.530
<v Speaker 4>why did you leave out the part that said they have found an association between</v>

1324
00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 4>marijuana use and improved cognitive outcomes in individuals with psychotic</v>

1325
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:31.790
<v Speaker 4>disorders.</v>

1326
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.061
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1327
00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:33.260
<v Speaker 4>So you're leaving out that,</v>

1328
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.780
<v Speaker 3>why did you leave out that part?</v>

1329
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.290
<v Speaker 3>If you can find me a psychiatrist who thinks that it's a good idea for somebody</v>

1330
00:33:39.291 --> 00:33:40.860
<v Speaker 3>with an active psychotic disorder.</v>

1331
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 3>That part,</v>

1332
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.220
<v Speaker 3>why'd you leave out that part?</v>

1333
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:43.521
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1334
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.630
<v Speaker 3>my book presents,</v>

1335
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.430
<v Speaker 3>it makes a case,</v>

1336
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1337
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:52.150
<v Speaker 3>It makes a case that this is a big issue that we have not heard about at all and</v>

1338
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 3>the reasons that we haven't heard about it have a lot to do with the advocacy</v>

1339
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:58.070
<v Speaker 3>community and the way they've presented this data for 25 years.</v>

1340
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a book that is trying to break through a lot of noise,</v>

1341
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 3>so but still like to get a balanced approach.</v>

1342
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Did you decide that you were only going to write about things that confirm your</v>

1343
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:19.010
<v Speaker 3>belief that you held when you were writing this and what you were trying to push</v>

1344
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.310
<v Speaker 3>and the title of the book and then in the conclusion of the book?</v>

1345
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.570
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a really great question.</v>

1346
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I say in the introduction to the book,</v>

1347
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 3>this book is not balanced.</v>

1348
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of evidence in there.</v>

1349
00:34:28.791 --> 00:34:29.390
<v Speaker 3>If you want to fair,</v>

1350
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:32.750
<v Speaker 3>if you want to read about how indicas and sativas strains are different.</v>

1351
00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:33.584
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1352
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to read that in this book,</v>

1353
00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.913
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1354
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.460
<v Speaker 3>but I will also,</v>

1355
00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I also want to say this,</v>

1356
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.570
<v Speaker 3>I didn't come at this and I say this in the introduction of the book too,</v>

1357
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.400
<v Speaker 3>as an anti cannabis crusader.</v>

1358
00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:43.701
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1359
00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:48.350
<v Speaker 3>when my wife said to me and she said to me over and over again in 2014 and 15</v>

1360
00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 3>and 16,</v>

1361
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.480
<v Speaker 3>these are the cases that I'm seeing.</v>

1362
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.720
<v Speaker 3>These are the terrible things that people are doing after cannabis use.</v>

1363
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.880
<v Speaker 3>I sort of said to her at first of all,</v>

1364
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.850
<v Speaker 3>why do I always have to hear about this at the dinner table?</v>

1365
00:34:59.200 --> 00:34:59.471
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1366
00:34:59.471 --> 00:34:59.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1367
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.680
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly,</v>

1368
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:01.783
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1369
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1370
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:03.104
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

1371
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 3>why is it that maybe these people were using other drugs?</v>

1372
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

1373
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're seeing a slice of the population that it's not representative.</v>

1374
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that I should believe this?</v>

1375
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.080
<v Speaker 3>This sounds like reefer madness to me.</v>

1376
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:15.501
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1377
00:35:15.501 --> 00:35:15.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1378
00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:16.700
<v Speaker 3>ultimately my wife,</v>

1379
00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:17.600
<v Speaker 3>who's the one who went to,</v>

1380
00:35:17.601 --> 00:35:17.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1381
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:18.623
<v Speaker 3>she actually,</v>

1382
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.540
<v Speaker 3>as I was talking to doctor heart about this,</v>

1383
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.650
<v Speaker 3>she grew up in,</v>

1384
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1385
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 3>in Newfoundland to,</v>

1386
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.711
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1387
00:35:23.711 --> 00:35:27.320
<v Speaker 3>and she went to the Memorial University of Newfoundland Medical School and she</v>

1388
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:30.020
<v Speaker 3>went to Harvard and Columbia for her postgraduate training.</v>

1389
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.651
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1390
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:30.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1391
00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:33.890
<v Speaker 3>eventually she got tired of me yapping back at her and she said,</v>

1392
00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:35.510
<v Speaker 3>why don't you go read the studies yourself?</v>

1393
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 3>And it was that,</v>

1394
00:35:36.921 --> 00:35:37.754
<v Speaker 3>that led me to read,</v>

1395
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 3>to write</v>

1396
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.050
<v Speaker 5>this book because when I read the studies,</v>

1397
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:42.570
<v Speaker 5>I could not believe the strength of the evidence Joe.</v>

1398
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.390
<v Speaker 5>But you're still even in saying that you're,</v>

1399
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 5>you're still seeing positive results that you're,</v>

1400
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:49.830
<v Speaker 5>you're excluding.</v>

1401
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.031
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1402
00:35:51.031 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 5>there's this one,</v>

1403
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 5>there's this one sentence.</v>

1404
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:53.811
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1405
00:35:53.811 --> 00:35:54.490
<v Speaker 5>it's not just one sense,</v>

1406
00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1407
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.780
<v Speaker 5>but there are a few sentences about how it may be that cannabis helps people is</v>

1408
00:36:01.921 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 5>positive because it helps,</v>

1409
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 5>it helps cognition in people with psychosis.</v>

1410
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.571
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>

1411
00:36:06.571 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 5>maybe not.</v>

1412
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't that qualify as medicine?</v>

1413
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.103
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1414
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.830
<v Speaker 5>not if it's,</v>

1415
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.131
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1416
00:36:11.131 --> 00:36:12.330
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't be approved as medicine.</v>

1417
00:36:12.331 --> 00:36:14.250
<v Speaker 5>If it's causing you to have other psychotic episodes.</v>

1418
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 5>These people have psychotic breaks and improves cognitive function and people</v>

1419
00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Speaker 5>with psychotic breaks.</v>

1420
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.220
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1421
00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 5>so wouldn't that be something that you would prescribe to someone?</v>

1422
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.021
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1423
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1424
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.590
<v Speaker 5>you had need to think about how the FDA is looking at medicine.</v>

1425
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:27.721
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1426
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:29.430
<v Speaker 5>I understand the FDA's position.</v>

1427
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1428
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.470
<v Speaker 5>But I mean looking at it as medicine,</v>

1429
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean if we could prove this through studies and through some sort of clinical</v>

1430
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 5>trials,</v>

1431
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.460
<v Speaker 5>if it is improving your Iq two points on a test and I'm saying,</v>

1432
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.190
<v Speaker 5>oh it is,</v>

1433
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

1434
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:41.483
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

1435
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.411
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to look at that.</v>

1436
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:44.244
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

1437
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.330
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time it's making you no,</v>

1438
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:48.801
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1439
00:36:48.801 --> 00:36:49.160
<v Speaker 5>It's a few.</v>

1440
00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:49.950
<v Speaker 5>But it's time.</v>

1441
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.630
<v Speaker 5>It's making you floridly psychotic.</v>

1442
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Speaker 5>You're not,</v>

1443
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 5>that's not medicine.</v>

1444
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:53.341
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1445
00:36:53.341 --> 00:36:54.091
<v Speaker 5>it's not necessarily.</v>

1446
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:54.751
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>

1447
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that I read about schizophrenia and was that there's people</v>

1448
00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:00.630
<v Speaker 5>who are trying to make a correlation between marijuana use and schizophrenia.</v>

1449
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:02.310
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with that correlation,</v>

1450
00:37:02.311 --> 00:37:03.091
<v Speaker 5>and what I read,</v>

1451
00:37:03.091 --> 00:37:04.170
<v Speaker 5>and maybe you could help me on this,</v>

1452
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 5>was that it's the exact same number that you find the general population.</v>

1453
00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.150
<v Speaker 5>It's essentially 1% of the general population has schizophrenia,</v>

1454
00:37:12.151 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 5>which is one out of 100 people.</v>

1455
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.870
<v Speaker 5>And when you have marijuana users,</v>

1456
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.020
<v Speaker 5>you see it's essentially that same number mirrored.</v>

1457
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:20.730
<v Speaker 5>And so they're saying that a small number,</v>

1458
00:37:20.731 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 5>that's not true.</v>

1459
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.910
<v Speaker 5>Hold on,</v>

1460
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:24.930
<v Speaker 5>let me get in a small number of people.</v>

1461
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:29.160
<v Speaker 5>What they were saying essentially in what I read was that marijuana use was</v>

1462
00:37:29.161 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 5>associated with the onset of schizophrenia.</v>

1463
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 5>They were disputing this in this study because they were saying,</v>

1464
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:38.340
<v Speaker 5>but because then same number is mirrored in the general population.</v>

1465
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:38.701
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1466
00:37:38.701 --> 00:37:40.410
<v Speaker 5>correlation does not equal causation.</v>

1467
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.720
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1468
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 5>Dr Hard,</v>

1469
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 5>I think you got to tell him that's not true.</v>

1470
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.673
<v Speaker 5>So tell me,</v>

1471
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.411
<v Speaker 5>tell me what that means.</v>

1472
00:37:44.411 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 5>So traditionally,</v>

1473
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:45.911
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1474
00:37:45.911 --> 00:37:47.160
<v Speaker 5>when we look up the stats,</v>

1475
00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:50.460
<v Speaker 5>you'll see that you know the people who use cannabis versus the people who don't</v>

1476
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:52.500
<v Speaker 5>use cannabis have very similar rates.</v>

1477
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 5>But you're getting to the exact rates.</v>

1478
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Speaker 5>So in the u s they say that,</v>

1479
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:57.581
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1480
00:37:57.581 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 5>the range,</v>

1481
00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 5>if the for schizophrenia is between 0.25 to 0.64% globally,</v>

1482
00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:06.030
<v Speaker 5>they say it's 0.33 to 0.75%.</v>

1483
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:06.900
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1484
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.111
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1485
00:38:07.111 --> 00:38:07.651
<v Speaker 5>right there,</v>

1486
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:08.070
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1487
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:08.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1488
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.880
<v Speaker 5>apparently lower ain in the u s and the u s is,</v>

1489
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:12.360
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1490
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.020
<v Speaker 5>has the highest percentage of cannabis consumption in the world.</v>

1491
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.910
<v Speaker 5>And the US also has a lot of people that are using high potency THC.</v>

1492
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:21.510
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1493
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1494
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.771
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

1495
00:38:22.771 --> 00:38:22.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1496
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:23.940
<v Speaker 5>we really need to be,</v>

1497
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:27.120
<v Speaker 5>be careful about throwing out stats like that because you know,</v>

1498
00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 5>when you do look at the stats that we have,</v>

1499
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.200
<v Speaker 5>it shows that even though,</v>

1500
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1501
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:31.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1502
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:32.160
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1503
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1504
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.950
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of canvas use in the United States,</v>

1505
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 5>schizophrenia</v>

1506
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.200
<v Speaker 3>rates have remained the same.</v>

1507
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.660
<v Speaker 3>So I have to push back really hard on,</v>

1508
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the great myths of legalization.</v>

1509
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 3>No one knows what the schizophrenia or psychosis rate in the is in the u s a lot</v>

1510
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:47.734
<v Speaker 3>of people aren't treated,</v>

1511
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.410
<v Speaker 3>people are treated people.</v>

1512
00:38:49.411 --> 00:38:52.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll get different diagnoses at different times and we have,</v>

1513
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:56.050
<v Speaker 3>we have bad health care in this country and we have a lot of protections around</v>

1514
00:38:56.051 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 3>mental health.</v>

1515
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.281
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1516
00:38:57.281 --> 00:39:02.281
<v Speaker 3>in 2017 than national institutes of mental health suddenly changed its estimate</v>

1517
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:08.731
<v Speaker 3>for the percentage of people with schizophrenia in the US from 1.1% to 0.3% they</v>

1518
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:10.120
<v Speaker 3>did it with no public notice.</v>

1519
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.830
<v Speaker 3>And then this researcher said,</v>

1520
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.221
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1521
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 3>this is a miracle.</v>

1522
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 3>They just cured 2 million people with schizophrenia and the,</v>

1523
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 3>and then in response to that,</v>

1524
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:19.120
<v Speaker 3>the director of the NIH said,</v>

1525
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:19.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1526
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 3>well we actually don't know how many people have schizophrenia in the United</v>

1527
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:22.810
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

1528
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows,</v>

1529
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:25.300
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows if the rate is increasing.</v>

1530
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.590
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows if it's decreasing.</v>

1531
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.570
<v Speaker 3>The only countries where they can count noses on this with any accuracy.</v>

1532
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 3>Our northern Europe,</v>

1533
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.010
<v Speaker 3>because they have good healthcare because they have slightly less protections</v>

1534
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 3>around sort of individual privacy and mental health privacy.</v>

1535
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.200
<v Speaker 3>And so they are able to count cases and in Denmark and Finland,</v>

1536
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>

1537
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.700
<v Speaker 3>which are the two places where they've actually done this research in the last</v>

1538
00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:49.420
<v Speaker 3>20 years,</v>

1539
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.250
<v Speaker 3>they've shown increasing rates of schizophrenia between about 1995 and about</v>

1540
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:59.251
<v Speaker 3>2010 and that goes side by side with increasing rates of cannabis use in the</v>

1541
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:03.040
<v Speaker 3>nineties so the people who are saying that there's no evidence of population</v>

1542
00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:05.320
<v Speaker 3>wide increases in psychosis are just wrong.</v>

1543
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.300
<v Speaker 3>That's just possible that there's other factors.</v>

1544
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Environmental factors is a bunch of other different things.</v>

1545
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 3>But let me,</v>

1546
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.400
<v Speaker 3>let me sit here on this.</v>

1547
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.260
<v Speaker 3>We absolutely don't have the evidence at this point to say that cannabis use in</v>

1548
00:40:17.261 --> 00:40:21.760
<v Speaker 3>the u s is causing a population level increase in psychosis and schizophrenia,</v>

1549
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:22.091
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>

1550
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:22.571
<v Speaker 3>oh by the way,</v>

1551
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:24.850
<v Speaker 3>those are sort of different illnesses and we can,</v>

1552
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.110
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about that too.</v>

1553
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 3>So we don't have the evidence to say there's a definite increase.</v>

1554
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm saying is that what you have been told that there is no increase in</v>

1555
00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:36.850
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia or psychosis rates in the US.</v>

1556
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1557
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:39.610
<v Speaker 3>we don't know if that's true or not.</v>

1558
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 3>We just don't.</v>

1559
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:40.901
<v Speaker 3>Me Ask you this,</v>

1560
00:40:40.901 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 3>there has been proven that there's an increase in marijuana use.</v>

1561
00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>

1562
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1563
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.660
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1564
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:45.870
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

1565
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:46.271
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1566
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:48.310
<v Speaker 3>when did the increase began and how,</v>

1567
00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1568
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.940
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1569
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 3>what percentage increase?</v>

1570
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 3>So there was a,</v>

1571
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:56.190
<v Speaker 3>there was an increase in the 90s and increase in use and in potency use sort of</v>

1572
00:40:56.381 --> 00:41:01.381
<v Speaker 3>bottomed out around 1991 and then there was sort of a flat bottomed out me and</v>

1573
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:06.420
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't increased since 1950% since [inaudible] 92 that's a lot.</v>

1574
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot.</v>

1575
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.021
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

1576
00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 3>you expect a corresponding increase in schizophrenia.</v>

1577
00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:11.880
<v Speaker 3>If there was any sort of correlation,</v>

1578
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:12.461
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

1579
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 3>let me just,</v>

1580
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:13.660
<v Speaker 3>let me walk you through.</v>

1581
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1582
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 3>It bottomed out in the early nineties increased again,</v>

1583
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 3>increased in the 90s flattened out between about 2000 2006 and since then has</v>

1584
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:22.600
<v Speaker 3>been going up again,</v>

1585
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 3>especially in let's say the last three,</v>

1586
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:25.054
<v Speaker 3>four years.</v>

1587
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.360
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is that potency in the last 15 years has gone way up.</v>

1588
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody would dispute that,</v>

1589
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.700
<v Speaker 3>but okay.</v>

1590
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Has Schizophrenia,</v>

1591
00:41:31.571 --> 00:41:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Ghana.</v>

1592
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm saying to you is we don't know,</v>

1593
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 2>there is evidence,</v>

1594
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.040
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

1595
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 2>there is now evidence on a population level basis in those other countries that</v>

1596
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia and psychosis has gone up.</v>

1597
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 2>And there's for the first time in 2017,</v>

1598
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 2>there's data showing that serious mental illness,</v>

1599
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:53.090
<v Speaker 2>which is not the same as psychosis or schizophrenia in the u s doubled between</v>

1600
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:58.091
<v Speaker 2>2008 and 2017 in the and the e in people aged 18 to 25 and those are the people</v>

1601
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 2>who are most likely to be using.</v>

1602
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:02.990
<v Speaker 2>So for the first time,</v>

1603
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 2>there's actually evidence of what you're talking about,</v>

1604
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:08.030
<v Speaker 2>which is a population wide increase.</v>

1605
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>

1606
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say I'm not going to,</v>

1607
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 2>can I get you to clarify?</v>

1608
00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't say serious mental health.</v>

1609
00:42:12.591 --> 00:42:14.270
<v Speaker 2>So serious mental illness.</v>

1610
00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:15.590
<v Speaker 2>So this was defined.</v>

1611
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1612
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a study called the national survey on drug use and health.</v>

1613
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.000
<v Speaker 2>It's done every year,</v>

1614
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 2>cover 70,000 people,</v>

1615
00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:22.490
<v Speaker 2>federal government funds it,</v>

1616
00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.520
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of the best data source we have on all this stuff.</v>

1617
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1618
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:27.680
<v Speaker 2>it showed that,</v>

1619
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 2>and they're not counting cases either.</v>

1620
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1621
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Let me just be as clear as I can on this.</v>

1622
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's counting schizophrenia and cases on a national or even state level</v>

1623
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 2>basis in the u s but you say to people,</v>

1624
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 2>did you have depression so bad that you couldn't get out of bed?</v>

1625
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

1626
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:43.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1627
00:42:43.671 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 2>were you hospitalized this year for psycho,</v>

1628
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1629
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 2>for any inpatient psychiatric reason?</v>

1630
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1631
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.740
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at those numbers in 2008,</v>

1632
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:56.330
<v Speaker 2>3.7%,</v>

1633
00:42:56.331 --> 00:42:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I remember maybe it's 3.8% of Americans,</v>

1634
00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.530
<v Speaker 2>18 to 25 reported,</v>

1635
00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1636
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:02.930
<v Speaker 2>at least one symptom.</v>

1637
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:08.140
<v Speaker 2>So they were categorized as having serious mental illness that year in 2017 that</v>

1638
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 2>number was 7.5% so that's a double.</v>

1639
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:14.570
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1640
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I am not going to say that proves that the increase in cannabis use has caused</v>

1641
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.580
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1642
00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.361
<v Speaker 2>this population,</v>

1643
00:43:20.361 --> 00:43:21.194
<v Speaker 2>that's something phase.</v>

1644
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.090
<v Speaker 2>But something bad has happened.</v>

1645
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:26.240
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at kids 12 to 17,</v>

1646
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

1647
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 2>they over that time period,</v>

1648
00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.060
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a big increase in cannabis use in general.</v>

1649
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Teenagers are actually are pretty healthy now.</v>

1650
00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Although jewel in vaping may be undoing that and those kids didn't have a</v>

1651
00:43:39.141 --> 00:43:41.690
<v Speaker 2>population level increase in serious mental illness.</v>

1652
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Can I stop</v>

1653
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.340
<v Speaker 1>you for a second there because there's other factors.</v>

1654
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.540
<v Speaker 1>One of the big one is,</v>

1655
00:43:45.541 --> 00:43:47.510
<v Speaker 1>you've all know Herati has a great book,</v>

1656
00:43:47.511 --> 00:43:49.440
<v Speaker 1>a 21 lessons for the 21st century.</v>

1657
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I read that.</v>

1658
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:50.950
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

1659
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:51.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1660
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they talk about is the onset of social media.</v>

1661
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1662
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Haidt talked about that as well and,</v>

1663
00:43:56.461 --> 00:43:56.641
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1664
00:43:56.641 --> 00:43:58.410
<v Speaker 1>that the onset of social media,</v>

1665
00:43:58.411 --> 00:44:00.030
<v Speaker 1>it was actually more hate and then,</v>

1666
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1667
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Herati but the,</v>

1668
00:44:02.701 --> 00:44:03.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1669
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Haidt talks about it with young people.</v>

1670
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1671
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I think coddling of the American mind.</v>

1672
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1673
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that social media and the pressures of social media have led an</v>

1674
00:44:11.641 --> 00:44:13.460
<v Speaker 1>incredible amount of young people to,</v>

1675
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:14.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1676
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.870
<v Speaker 1>serious mental distress and,</v>

1677
00:44:15.871 --> 00:44:16.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1678
00:44:16.261 --> 00:44:17.190
<v Speaker 1>serious anxiety,</v>

1679
00:44:17.191 --> 00:44:22.191
<v Speaker 1>serious depression and suicide amongst young girls has increased some 50%</v>

1680
00:44:22.981 --> 00:44:23.814
<v Speaker 1>according to hate.</v>

1681
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1682
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:27.300
<v Speaker 1>over the period of 2007,</v>

1683
00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:27.481
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1684
00:44:27.481 --> 00:44:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I think 2000.</v>

1685
00:44:28.421 --> 00:44:30.180
<v Speaker 1>And whenever his book was written,</v>

1686
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:30.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1687
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:31.290
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1688
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>they're directly</v>

1689
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 4>correlating that to the pressures of social media and to,</v>

1690
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:35.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1691
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:39.000
<v Speaker 4>anonymous online bullying and all these different factors that are affecting</v>

1692
00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:39.400
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>

1693
00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1694
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:44.660
<v Speaker 4>So I think that that could be considered a far more significant new,</v>

1695
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1696
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.410
<v Speaker 4>form of,</v>

1697
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.951
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1698
00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 4>of distress to children and young people than even marijuana.</v>

1699
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 4>I think it does it twofold because I think that,</v>

1700
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1701
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:56.850
<v Speaker 4>what makes people really depressed,</v>

1702
00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 4>maybe more so than,</v>

1703
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.381
<v Speaker 4>than anxious,</v>

1704
00:44:58.381 --> 00:45:02.770
<v Speaker 4>but definitely both is that when you compare yourself to someone else and you</v>

1705
00:45:02.771 --> 00:45:02.950
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1706
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:03.720
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1707
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1708
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.430
<v Speaker 4>obviously that we've done that,</v>

1709
00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:05.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1710
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:06.201
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

1711
00:45:06.201 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 4>all humans have done that,</v>

1712
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:07.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1713
00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 4>since since history began.</v>

1714
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 4>But now everything is online.</v>

1715
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 4>You can compare your life to everyone and it,</v>

1716
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:15.660
<v Speaker 4>people are doing all the time.</v>

1717
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 4>And even worse than that,</v>

1718
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 4>and you know when we should talk about this too,</v>

1719
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:20.700
<v Speaker 4>is that the income gap is getting,</v>

1720
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 4>is getting water.</v>

1721
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.460
<v Speaker 4>So it's like people's lives,</v>

1722
00:45:23.461 --> 00:45:24.840
<v Speaker 4>not only are they getting,</v>

1723
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1724
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.210
<v Speaker 4>better than than,</v>

1725
00:45:26.211 --> 00:45:27.180
<v Speaker 4>than other people's lives,</v>

1726
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:28.560
<v Speaker 4>but it's what it now it's on,</v>

1727
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:29.401
<v Speaker 4>it's on display.</v>

1728
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 4>So everyone can see it.</v>

1729
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.560
<v Speaker 4>Whereas before,</v>

1730
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:31.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1731
00:45:31.861 --> 00:45:34.710
<v Speaker 4>maybe you wouldn't have seen it because it wasn't on social media,</v>

1732
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.540
<v Speaker 4>but now it's on social media.</v>

1733
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Speaker 4>So you had this huge income gap that just keeps getting bigger and bigger and</v>

1734
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 4>bigger.</v>

1735
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.720
<v Speaker 4>And then you have people going,</v>

1736
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.030
<v Speaker 4>going on social media and they're comparing themselves and you're absolutely</v>

1737
00:45:45.031 --> 00:45:45.271
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1738
00:45:45.271 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 4>especially in that,</v>

1739
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 4>in that age population mean people under under the age of 30.</v>

1740
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:50.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1741
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 4>they're definitely,</v>

1742
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:51.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1744
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 4>they're being bullied online.</v>

1745
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 4>Like I see it every day in my office.</v>

1746
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 4>Like literally every day people are being bullied online and that's,</v>

1747
00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1748
00:45:59.011 --> 00:46:02.070
<v Speaker 4>something that I never had to deal with growing up.</v>

1749
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1750
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:03.361
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1751
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Speaker 4>a lot of kids do have,</v>

1752
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:05.191
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1753
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 4>have to deal with that.</v>

1754
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.000
<v Speaker 4>Just one more note to on,</v>

1755
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:08.731
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:09.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1757
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:10.460
<v Speaker 4>since Colorado has,</v>

1758
00:46:10.461 --> 00:46:10.791
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>

1759
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:12.030
<v Speaker 4>has legalized cannabis,</v>

1760
00:46:12.031 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 4>is this important for,</v>

1761
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:13.151
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

1762
00:46:13.151 --> 00:46:13.621
<v Speaker 4>for this,</v>

1763
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1764
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.131
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1765
00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:15.330
<v Speaker 4>this subject in this topic?</v>

1766
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:16.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1767
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:19.500
<v Speaker 4>they've actually seen marijuana rates decrease.</v>

1768
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 4>So it's important for people to know that,</v>

1769
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:22.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1770
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:27.200
<v Speaker 4>just be knowing use or overall use or I use has gone up 10 years is flat overall</v>

1771
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 4>uses up.</v>

1772
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1773
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:30.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1774
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about teen years that that's the category that we're talking about</v>

1775
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:34.980
<v Speaker 4>under under 30.</v>

1776
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.461
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1777
00:46:35.461 --> 00:46:36.181
<v Speaker 4>So teen use,</v>

1778
00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:36.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1779
00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:38.550
<v Speaker 4>would classify as part of that category.</v>

1780
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:39.230
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1781
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1782
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:44.040
<v Speaker 4>in Colorado we have seen a decrease because of the lack of,</v>

1783
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 4>because it's not illegal,</v>

1784
00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:47.760
<v Speaker 4>it's not as exciting to them.</v>

1785
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Part of it for sure.</v>

1786
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:49.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1787
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:49.920
<v Speaker 4>and I mean,</v>

1788
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.320
<v Speaker 4>part of it like a one worry I had,</v>

1789
00:46:52.321 --> 00:46:52.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1790
00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:54.780
<v Speaker 4>I haven't looked into the statistics yet.</v>

1791
00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:55.380
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1792
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:55.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1793
00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1794
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.870
<v Speaker 4>when you're growing up and,</v>

1795
00:46:57.871 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1796
00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.100
<v Speaker 4>when you're in high school,</v>

1797
00:46:59.280 --> 00:46:59.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1798
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:02.340
<v Speaker 4>if you want to be part of the cool crowd,</v>

1799
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:02.851
<v Speaker 4>so to say,</v>

1800
00:47:02.851 --> 00:47:06.630
<v Speaker 4>what do you usually drink or you smoke pot,</v>

1801
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1802
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:07.980
<v Speaker 4>that's what some people do.</v>

1803
00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:08.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1804
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:13.740
<v Speaker 4>I hope that that doesn't change because pot scene as medicine,</v>

1805
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 4>I hope that,</v>

1806
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1807
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:15.640
<v Speaker 4>people don't,</v>

1808
00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:20.640
<v Speaker 4>you don't move on to or do something you'll harsher because they don't see pot</v>

1809
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:21.111
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

1810
00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:21.990
<v Speaker 4>as cool anymore.</v>

1811
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.630
<v Speaker 4>My attached to it because it's legal.</v>

1812
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1813
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:26.400
<v Speaker 4>I got to push back on it.</v>

1814
00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:26.541
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1815
00:47:26.541 --> 00:47:26.721
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

1816
00:47:26.721 --> 00:47:27.554
<v Speaker 4>Thanks please.</v>

1817
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 4>So everything you about social media sound,</v>

1818
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.320
<v Speaker 3>you know it's sort of intuitively sounds correct,</v>

1819
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1820
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the data doesn't support this at all.</v>

1821
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:40.380
<v Speaker 3>The data shows that teenagers another 12 to 17 those kids are healthier than</v>

1822
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:44.230
<v Speaker 3>they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.</v>

1823
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:45.280
<v Speaker 3>They drink less,</v>

1824
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:46.210
<v Speaker 3>they smoke less,</v>

1825
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 3>they have sex later,</v>

1826
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 3>that fewer abortions,</v>

1827
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:49.360
<v Speaker 3>they are healthier.</v>

1828
00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:49.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1829
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:50.403
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1830
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:55.140
<v Speaker 3>And their mental health doesn't seem to have changed that much based on the Ns</v>

1831
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.050
<v Speaker 3>D'you h data.</v>

1832
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1833
00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.680
<v Speaker 3>The data shows a big change in kids 18 to 25 they go to college.</v>

1834
00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Something goes wrong for a lot of those kids,</v>

1835
00:48:05.291 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Speaker 3>at least in the last few years now.</v>

1836
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.580
<v Speaker 3>But what do you mean when you're talking about suicide rates?</v>

1837
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Suicide rates are there,</v>

1838
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Speaker 3>especially with young girls who are apparently more effected by social media.</v>

1839
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.480
<v Speaker 3>They have gone up significantly since the rise of social media.</v>

1840
00:48:19.481 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 3>That is the big fan of people who are most likely a second more so than cannabis</v>

1841
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:23.860
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>

1842
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.730
<v Speaker 3>And then that's a fact.</v>

1843
00:48:24.731 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1844
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 3>so you're,</v>

1845
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 3>so you're talking about a tiny,</v>

1846
00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:27.920
<v Speaker 3>tiny number of people who not only,</v>

1847
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:28.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1848
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 3>it's not a tiny number,</v>

1849
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.140
<v Speaker 3>50% increase of people that commit suicide.</v>

1850
00:48:32.141 --> 00:48:34.960
<v Speaker 3>There are young girls that people who commit suicide in the United States are</v>

1851
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:35.910
<v Speaker 3>middle aged white men.</v>

1852
00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.153
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1853
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:38.111
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

1854
00:48:38.111 --> 00:48:41.350
<v Speaker 3>you're discounting these young girls that are committing suicide to fit your</v>

1855
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:43.510
<v Speaker 3>statistics or to fit your conclusions?</v>

1856
00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:43.751
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1857
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying is that's a tiny,</v>

1858
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:45.641
<v Speaker 3>tiny number,</v>

1859
00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's a 50% increase is not a tiny amount.</v>

1860
00:48:49.001 --> 00:48:50.230
<v Speaker 3>This is something that we can look up.</v>

1861
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:50.381
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1862
00:48:50.381 --> 00:48:52.090
<v Speaker 3>let's find out what the numbers are.</v>

1863
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:52.933
<v Speaker 3>But because the,</v>

1864
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.050
<v Speaker 3>when Jonathan Haidt was on the podcast and you discussed it,</v>

1865
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:56.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1866
00:48:56.471 --> 00:49:00.610
<v Speaker 3>he showed this chart and it's an alarming increase directly correlating with the</v>

1867
00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:02.230
<v Speaker 3>increasing use of social media.</v>

1868
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.273
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1869
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 3>I am probably,</v>

1870
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:06.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not such a pushback against that.</v>

1871
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 3>So it seems to be a factor.</v>

1872
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:08.833
<v Speaker 3>What I'm,</v>

1873
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:13.950
<v Speaker 3>when I'm pushing back against is the idea that kids 12 to 17 generally are less</v>

1874
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 3>healthy than they were 10 or 20 years.</v>

1875
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:17.710
<v Speaker 3>And no one's saying they're less healthy.</v>

1876
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.480
<v Speaker 3>You just said they're more health.</v>

1877
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:19.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1878
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:20.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying they're more healthy.</v>

1879
00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:21.041
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1880
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 3>and what we're saying that Kid's health has nothing to do with cardiovascular,</v>

1881
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 3>mentally healthy.</v>

1882
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're less likely to use drugs.</v>

1883
00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 3>They're less likely to have sex with them,</v>

1884
00:49:29.111 --> 00:49:30.580
<v Speaker 3>more likely to commit suicide.</v>

1885
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.260
<v Speaker 3>That is a tiny,</v>

1886
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:33.130
<v Speaker 3>tiny number.</v>

1887
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

1888
00:49:34.001 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 3>If it's 50% increase,</v>

1889
00:49:35.351 --> 00:49:36.550
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge difference.</v>

1890
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.820
<v Speaker 3>We should look up the number if we're gonna,</v>

1891
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:39.650
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to it.</v>

1892
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1893
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Jonathan hates work is like very well respected.</v>

1894
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:43.290
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1895
00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:46.690
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying to you is that there's a clear increase in psychological</v>

1896
00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:48.640
<v Speaker 3>distress in kids and young adults,</v>

1897
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.470
<v Speaker 3>18 to 25 okay.</v>

1898
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:55.120
<v Speaker 3>There's a clear increase and those are the people who are most likely to be</v>

1899
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:55.954
<v Speaker 3>using cannabis,</v>

1900
00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.600
<v Speaker 3>people that are most likely on social media as well,</v>

1901
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:00.660
<v Speaker 3>and that's a stressful period of your life.</v>

1902
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:05.290
<v Speaker 3>How [inaudible] 17 you should live in at home like 18 to 25 then you've got to</v>

1903
00:50:05.291 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 3>go to university.</v>

1904
00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:07.830
<v Speaker 3>You got to deal with all these core seed,</v>

1905
00:50:07.831 --> 00:50:08.261
<v Speaker 3>the wound.</v>

1906
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:08.901
<v Speaker 3>You can see the,</v>

1907
00:50:08.901 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 3>and I've said it at the beginning of the program that I think the marijuana with</v>

1908
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 3>some people is not beneficial and in fact could be negative,</v>

1909
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.950
<v Speaker 3>but I don't understand why you're not willing to admit that social media has a</v>

1910
00:50:20.171 --> 00:50:24.970
<v Speaker 3>significant and unprecedented impact on young people that we've never seen</v>

1911
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:25.451
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1912
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:26.510
<v Speaker 3>I would totally agree with that,</v>

1913
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that you can say</v>

1914
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 2>based on the population level data that the impact is all negative.</v>

1915
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 2>It may be,</v>

1916
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1917
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.880
<v Speaker 2>if maybe who is saying that the impact is all negative.</v>

1918
00:50:34.881 --> 00:50:35.431
<v Speaker 2>What we're saying is,</v>

1919
00:50:35.431 --> 00:50:37.700
<v Speaker 2>is it a 50% increase in suicide with young girls?</v>

1920
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1921
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 2>but that's huge.</v>

1922
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.321
<v Speaker 2>Let me hear it.</v>

1923
00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:40.021
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you an example.</v>

1924
00:50:40.021 --> 00:50:43.730
<v Speaker 2>When you were 15 or I was 15 maybe you got really drunk,</v>

1925
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.061
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1926
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:45.290
<v Speaker 2>And wound up in a bathtub.</v>

1927
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe kids today are less likely to do that because of social media because</v>

1928
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:52.010
<v Speaker 2>they know it's going to be on Instagram forever.</v>

1929
00:50:52.011 --> 00:50:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true.</v>

1930
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's proven and announce.</v>

1931
00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything that would point to that.</v>

1932
00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1933
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.890
<v Speaker 2>what I can tell you is proven is that kids,</v>

1934
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 2>today I'm talking about teens,</v>

1935
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:08.020
<v Speaker 2>12 to 17 have less psychological distress by all these measures I'm talking</v>

1936
00:51:08.511 --> 00:51:08.661
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1937
00:51:08.661 --> 00:51:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Their actual behaviors are better or a better or worse.</v>

1938
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:12.621
<v Speaker 2>That's a moral judgment,</v>

1939
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:16.130
<v Speaker 2>but they're healthier than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.</v>

1940
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:17.450
<v Speaker 2>They're less likely to have sex.</v>

1941
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.540
<v Speaker 2>They're less when they're 14 which I think most people say it's a good thing.</v>

1942
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>They're less likely to be drinking.</v>

1943
00:51:22.611 --> 00:51:23.900
<v Speaker 2>They're less likely to be smoking.</v>

1944
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Those are good things.</v>

1945
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1946
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.200
<v Speaker 2>less likely to</v>

1947
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:26.741
<v Speaker 1>be drinking,</v>

1948
00:51:26.741 --> 00:51:27.790
<v Speaker 1>less likely to be smoking,</v>

1949
00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:32.290
<v Speaker 1>less likely to have sex does not correlate to positive mental outlook and less</v>

1950
00:51:32.291 --> 00:51:33.080
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

1951
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1952
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.780
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1953
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.190
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1954
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:35.023
<v Speaker 2>I agreed there.</v>

1955
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.871
<v Speaker 2>We look.</v>

1956
00:51:35.871 --> 00:51:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at the numbers,</v>

1957
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.700
<v Speaker 2>but depression and suicide are the very difficult things to measure,</v>

1958
00:51:40.701 --> 00:51:41.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1959
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Depression,</v>

1960
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1961
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:42.991
<v Speaker 2>suicides,</v>

1962
00:51:42.991 --> 00:51:43.671
<v Speaker 2>actually suicides,</v>

1963
00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:44.504
<v Speaker 2>you're going to use it.</v>

1964
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:45.471
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard number.</v>

1965
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Depression is a is look at this spike</v>

1966
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.350
<v Speaker 2>bottom numbers in females.</v>

1967
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what I'm saying,</v>

1968
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:53.990
<v Speaker 2>that death rate,</v>

1969
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:54.471
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1970
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:54.920
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1971
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.030
<v Speaker 2>this is okay.</v>

1972
00:51:56.031 --> 00:52:01.031
<v Speaker 2>The death rate for girls age 15 to 19 is four per 100,000 Joe,</v>

1973
00:52:01.561 --> 00:52:03.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a 40 it's at a 40 year high.</v>

1974
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1975
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.470
<v Speaker 2>So I mean you,</v>

1976
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.610
<v Speaker 2>you'd be hard put to say that's a huge spike.</v>

1977
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It was three per hundred thousand in 1975 and it's a little bit over four and</v>

1978
00:52:12.591 --> 00:52:14.240
<v Speaker 2>2015 that's not,</v>

1979
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:17.480
<v Speaker 2>that's one case per 100,000 girls.</v>

1980
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:19.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1981
00:52:19.601 --> 00:52:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

1982
00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the actual facts are.</v>

1983
00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at this right now.</v>

1984
00:52:22.691 --> 00:52:25.870
<v Speaker 1>The suicide rates for teens 15 to 19 years off is this is something that we'd</v>

1985
00:52:25.871 --> 00:52:27.480
<v Speaker 1>have to study and to,</v>

1986
00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:27.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1987
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:28.533
<v Speaker 1>have this discussion.</v>

1988
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Giant spike for boys in the 1990s.</v>

1989
00:52:31.511 --> 00:52:32.291
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

1990
00:52:32.291 --> 00:52:32.561
<v Speaker 1>About?</v>

1991
00:52:32.561 --> 00:52:33.580
<v Speaker 1>95 what</v>

1992
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.620
<v Speaker 2>surprise,</v>

1993
00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.330
<v Speaker 2>if you put middle aged men on this chart,</v>

1994
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.080
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to,</v>

1995
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.490
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to blow out the ceiling.</v>

1996
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Like the suicide crisis is unfortunately a crisis of age.</v>

1997
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1998
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1999
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:44.111
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2000
00:52:44.111 --> 00:52:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with that.</v>

2001
00:52:45.131 --> 00:52:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I think we actually talked about that yesterday with Andrew Yang that a suicide</v>

2002
00:52:49.061 --> 00:52:53.200
<v Speaker 1>amongst men in their 50s and then they start to feel useless and especially if</v>

2003
00:52:53.201 --> 00:52:54.040
<v Speaker 1>they lose their jobs.</v>

2004
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2005
00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:59.110
<v Speaker 1>but what Jonathan Haidt is pointing to is a direct correlation between social</v>

2006
00:52:59.111 --> 00:52:59.831
<v Speaker 1>media use,</v>

2007
00:52:59.831 --> 00:53:02.200
<v Speaker 1>depression and suicide amongst young girls.</v>

2008
00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2009
00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:03.663
<v Speaker 1>thank you for finding,</v>

2010
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:04.500
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

2011
00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.291
<v Speaker 1>This is the article.</v>

2012
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:08.170
<v Speaker 1>It's from his suicide rate for teen girls.</v>

2013
00:53:08.171 --> 00:53:10.930
<v Speaker 1>The highest it's been in 40 years is social media to blame.</v>

2014
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2015
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:12.283
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2016
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.203
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2017
00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2018
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.653
<v Speaker 1>new data presented,</v>

2019
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:16.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2020
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:19.120
<v Speaker 1>released Thursday by the Atlanta based Centers for Disease Control and</v>

2021
00:53:19.121 --> 00:53:23.740
<v Speaker 1>prevention suicide rates amongst 15 to 19 year old girls doubled between 2007</v>

2022
00:53:23.741 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 1>and 2015 reaching a 40 year high.</v>

2023
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 5>I would say that's significant.</v>

2024
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:27.661
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2025
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:28.021
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

2026
00:53:28.021 --> 00:53:28.400
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2027
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 5>and it's obviously a terrible thing when anybody commits suicide,</v>

2028
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:33.340
<v Speaker 5>but we're talking about two per 100,000.</v>

2029
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:35.300
<v Speaker 5>It's five,</v>

2030
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:36.450
<v Speaker 5>well went from two to four.</v>

2031
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:36.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2032
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:39.930
<v Speaker 5>That means for every 100,000 American girls in 2015,</v>

2033
00:53:39.931 --> 00:53:41.100
<v Speaker 5>five committed suicide.</v>

2034
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.200
<v Speaker 5>That's not a very high number.</v>

2035
00:53:43.201 --> 00:53:43.680
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

2036
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.490
<v Speaker 5>that's also someone who's pushed to the extreme of taking their life.</v>

2037
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 5>How many girls are experiencing severe depression but don't commit suicide.</v>

2038
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:57.720
<v Speaker 5>That's the real factor because this is what hate directly connects to social</v>

2039
00:53:57.721 --> 00:53:58.260
<v Speaker 5>media.</v>

2040
00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:58.830
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2041
00:53:58.830 --> 00:53:59.970
<v Speaker 5>the 50% increase,</v>

2042
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:03.540
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about a relatively small number because not as many girls commit</v>

2043
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:04.440
<v Speaker 5>suicide as men,</v>

2044
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.510
<v Speaker 5>but still this could,</v>

2045
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:07.201
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about,</v>

2046
00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:10.590
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about depression and you were talking about these significant</v>

2047
00:54:10.591 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 5>factors that would lead people to be,</v>

2048
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.860
<v Speaker 5>to have poor mental health.</v>

2049
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 5>This could be a huge factor in this.</v>

2050
00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:17.520
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2051
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 5>And I think that too,</v>

2052
00:54:18.451 --> 00:54:19.560
<v Speaker 5>it leads people to,</v>

2053
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:19.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2054
00:54:19.831 --> 00:54:22.590
<v Speaker 5>suicidal ideations and depression and anxiety.</v>

2055
00:54:22.591 --> 00:54:22.830
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

2056
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:24.760
<v Speaker 5>right here we're just looking at CSI,</v>

2057
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 5>which is the worst possible,</v>

2058
00:54:27.811 --> 00:54:31.740
<v Speaker 5>which is very rare amongst girls periods or not or less.</v>

2059
00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2060
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:33.460
<v Speaker 5>men,</v>

2061
00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.940
<v Speaker 5>men do commit suicide more than women do.</v>

2062
00:54:35.941 --> 00:54:36.481
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2063
00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 5>we really have to be careful about that because,</v>

2064
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:39.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2065
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.420
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2066
00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 5>suicide is the aim.</v>

2067
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.220
<v Speaker 5>That's the worst thing that could possibly happen.</v>

2068
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:45.420
<v Speaker 5>So what about,</v>

2069
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:45.991
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2070
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:46.351
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

2071
00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:46.861
<v Speaker 5>all the,</v>

2072
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:47.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2073
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 5>all the things leading up to it,</v>

2074
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:48.841
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2075
00:54:48.841 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 5>are there people who are,</v>

2076
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:51.720
<v Speaker 5>who don't commit suicide but you know,</v>

2077
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.260
<v Speaker 5>suffer from terrible depression,</v>

2078
00:54:53.261 --> 00:54:56.670
<v Speaker 5>suffer from terrible anxiety software from terrible insomnia.</v>

2079
00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.090
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2080
00:54:57.090 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 5>those people are not accounted for in that graph.</v>

2081
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.260
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

2082
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:06.240
<v Speaker 5>And what I'm saying is that cannabis use has spiked in the United States in the</v>

2083
00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:07.470
<v Speaker 5>last 15 years.</v>

2084
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.680
<v Speaker 5>And teens not withstanding,</v>

2085
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 5>we've seen a large degradation in a number of these social outcomes.</v>

2086
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:17.790
<v Speaker 5>And now just today we have a Jama Psychiatry paper that looked at a bunch of</v>

2087
00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:22.791
<v Speaker 5>other studies that said cannabis use in teenagers is associated with depression,</v>

2088
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:24.630
<v Speaker 5>suicidal ideation,</v>

2089
00:55:24.631 --> 00:55:28.890
<v Speaker 5>and suicide attempts in people once they get to 18 to 30.</v>

2090
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:29.370
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2091
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.203
<v Speaker 5>So again,</v>

2092
00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:31.620
<v Speaker 5>maybe a factor.</v>

2093
00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:32.310
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

2094
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:33.690
<v Speaker 5>It could possibly be a factor,</v>

2095
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:34.111
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

2096
00:55:34.111 --> 00:55:34.740
<v Speaker 5>but it might,</v>

2097
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.670
<v Speaker 5>it might also be that these kids are depressed because of social media and</v>

2098
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:39.660
<v Speaker 5>they're using cannabis.</v>

2099
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.820
<v Speaker 5>They're depressed because their friends died from opioid overdose.</v>

2100
00:55:42.821 --> 00:55:43.740
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of potentials.</v>

2101
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:47.040
<v Speaker 5>We are conceding the fact that,</v>

2102
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:47.311
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2103
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:48.270
<v Speaker 5>you just said again,</v>

2104
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.760
<v Speaker 5>that study was done on adolescents.</v>

2105
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2106
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.330
<v Speaker 5>Joe and I have both concede it multiple times that,</v>

2107
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2108
00:55:54.721 --> 00:55:56.440
<v Speaker 5>we do not think high cheat.</v>

2109
00:55:56.441 --> 00:55:59.940
<v Speaker 5>See Cannabis is good for people in that age category.</v>

2110
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:00.990
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2111
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:01.411
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2112
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2113
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.300
<v Speaker 5>just to back up just a little bit again,</v>

2114
00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:03.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2115
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:04.411
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2116
00:56:04.411 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 5>like I said earlier that,</v>

2117
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2118
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't prescribe Cisi generally to anyone under the age of 25 and most other</v>

2119
00:56:09.781 --> 00:56:10.770
<v Speaker 5>doctors in Canada who don't.</v>

2120
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:14.400
<v Speaker 5>But I think that we should be prescribing CBD to these kids.</v>

2121
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:15.780
<v Speaker 5>Like a lot of those kids,</v>

2122
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:16.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2123
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 5>who have suicidal ideations,</v>

2124
00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:18.751
<v Speaker 5>depression,</v>

2125
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2126
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2127
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 5>you could never do a study on it,</v>

2128
00:56:21.121 --> 00:56:21.750
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2129
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 5>how many of those kids wouldn't have committed</v>

2130
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:29.310
<v Speaker 4>suicide or wouldn't be feeling this way if they were using CBD because we know</v>

2131
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Ssri,</v>

2132
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 4>selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors,</v>

2133
00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:32.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2134
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.770
<v Speaker 4>which are the most commonly prescribed a medication for depression and anxiety</v>

2135
00:56:35.771 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 4>even in,</v>

2136
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:36.731
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

2137
00:56:36.731 --> 00:56:37.564
<v Speaker 4>in adolescents.</v>

2138
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2139
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 4>we know that they can increase suicidal ideations that's been shown.</v>

2140
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:43.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2141
00:56:43.271 --> 00:56:44.380
<v Speaker 4>it's written right on,</v>

2142
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:45.400
<v Speaker 4>right on the package.</v>

2143
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:46.390
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

2144
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 4>like as a clinician you have to,</v>

2145
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2146
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 4>treat your patients.</v>

2147
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:55.410
<v Speaker 4>If you're just treating people with something that's it's not effective or the</v>

2148
00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:56.081
<v Speaker 4>there that has,</v>

2149
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:56.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2150
00:56:56.231 --> 00:56:57.250
<v Speaker 4>horrible side effects,</v>

2151
00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.740
<v Speaker 4>you're going to look at other alternative treatments.</v>

2152
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.600
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people have,</v>

2153
00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:01.930
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

2154
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:02.950
<v Speaker 4>have shown our,</v>

2155
00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 4>sorry have had excellent results with CBD in that age category.</v>

2156
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:07.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2157
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.630
<v Speaker 4>I've had had it done in my practice and lots of other,</v>

2158
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:10.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2159
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:12.180
<v Speaker 4>physicians have had it done in,</v>

2160
00:57:12.181 --> 00:57:13.060
<v Speaker 4>in their practice.</v>

2161
00:57:13.061 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 4>So it's really important that when we're talking about teenagers and we were</v>

2162
00:57:17.081 --> 00:57:18.310
<v Speaker 4>talking about that study,</v>

2163
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:23.140
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about high potency THC in adolescence.</v>

2164
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:26.320
<v Speaker 4>That's where Joe and I both can see that,</v>

2165
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2166
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:29.860
<v Speaker 4>THC is not a good medicine.</v>

2167
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.833
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2168
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:33.120
<v Speaker 3>look if Gw Pharma or somebody else can,</v>

2169
00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:37.770
<v Speaker 3>can do a study with CBD and depression or some other cannabinoids and non</v>

2170
00:57:37.771 --> 00:57:40.500
<v Speaker 3>intoxicating cannabinoid in depression and get it approved for that,</v>

2171
00:57:40.501 --> 00:57:41.250
<v Speaker 3>that'd be great.</v>

2172
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:42.083
<v Speaker 3>We need,</v>

2173
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:44.850
<v Speaker 3>we need all the treatments for depression and for,</v>

2174
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.880
<v Speaker 3>and boy do we need treatments for psychosis that we can get.</v>

2175
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:48.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2176
00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.810
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with it and I'm really glad to hear you say you don't think that</v>

2177
00:57:51.811 --> 00:57:55.170
<v Speaker 3>adolescents should be using high potency or any hard drugs,</v>

2178
00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:57.450
<v Speaker 3>especially alcohol.</v>

2179
00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:57.811
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2180
00:57:57.811 --> 00:57:58.081
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

2181
00:57:58.081 --> 00:58:02.230
<v Speaker 3>and they should try this also stay away from the other medications.</v>

2182
00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I want to push back on this,</v>

2183
00:58:03.781 --> 00:58:07.350
<v Speaker 3>on the alcohol versus a cannabis for teens thing and I know that this is a</v>

2184
00:58:07.351 --> 00:58:12.351
<v Speaker 3>common feeling among you among people in Brooklyn and among people in La and</v>

2185
00:58:12.481 --> 00:58:14.730
<v Speaker 3>sort of right when I mean right thinking,</v>

2186
00:58:14.731 --> 00:58:15.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2187
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2188
00:58:15.571 --> 00:58:19.890
<v Speaker 3>sort of the general center left to left you everywhere is that cannabis is</v>

2189
00:58:19.891 --> 00:58:21.330
<v Speaker 3>better for teens than alcohol.</v>

2190
00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.920
<v Speaker 3>I totally disagree with that.</v>

2191
00:58:22.921 --> 00:58:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Canvas alcohol would no one's saying that.</v>

2192
00:58:25.111 --> 00:58:26.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying alcohol's bad too.</v>

2193
00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:27.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2194
00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Then we agree.</v>

2195
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:28.890
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2196
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think you may have heard this right?</v>

2197
00:58:30.841 --> 00:58:30.961
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2198
00:58:30.961 --> 00:58:32.370
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have my kids smoking pot,</v>

2199
00:58:32.371 --> 00:58:33.151
<v Speaker 3>my 16 year olds.</v>

2200
00:58:33.151 --> 00:58:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I think that's crazy.</v>

2201
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:34.821
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2202
00:58:34.821 --> 00:58:39.821
<v Speaker 3>you have to really be careful with anything that's severely perturbs your sense</v>

2203
00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:45.390
<v Speaker 3>of reality when you're a young kid and you're trying to form your vision of the</v>

2204
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:46.224
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2205
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:51.090
<v Speaker 3>I think to unpack what we're saying here is that there is an increase in mental</v>

2206
00:58:51.091 --> 00:58:56.091
<v Speaker 3>health disorders amongst young kids that corresponds to the increased use of</v>

2207
00:58:56.281 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 3>social media and may correspond to the use of cannabis,</v>

2208
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:05.331
<v Speaker 3>but that's not necessarily proven what we'd guarantee almost universally because</v>

2209
00:59:05.771 --> 00:59:10.771
<v Speaker 3>these kids are on social media and also to think much more likely that they're</v>

2210
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:14.280
<v Speaker 3>on social media than use cannabis.</v>

2211
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:15.930
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of them use cannabis.</v>

2212
00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think all of them,</v>

2213
00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.350
<v Speaker 3>all of them are on social media.</v>

2214
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2215
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2216
00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2217
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:21.583
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2218
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2219
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 5>almost every single kid these days,</v>

2220
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:28.340
<v Speaker 5>these days has a cell phone and they have some type of social media account.</v>

2221
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:29.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm worried about kids use it,</v>

2222
00:59:29.841 --> 00:59:33.200
<v Speaker 5>everything I'm worried about them using value them.</v>

2223
00:59:33.201 --> 00:59:34.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm worried about the end user</v>

2224
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:40.910
<v Speaker 5>and using stimulants or Adderall and PROZAC.</v>

2225
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.550
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2226
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 5>I think psychiatrists give out add medicine much too frequently.</v>

2227
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:47.090
<v Speaker 5>100% agree.</v>

2228
00:59:47.091 --> 00:59:51.980
<v Speaker 5>And I think that it has a severe impact on kids when they're trying to study for</v>

2229
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:52.491
<v Speaker 5>tests,</v>

2230
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 5>when they're trying to take their sats,</v>

2231
00:59:54.681 --> 00:59:56.060
<v Speaker 5>when they're trying to get into a good college.</v>

2232
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.510
<v Speaker 5>I know so many people that are on that shit.</v>

2233
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.800
<v Speaker 5>I know so many people,</v>

2234
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:02.300
<v Speaker 5>whether they're journalists,</v>

2235
01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.800
<v Speaker 5>I know Comedians,</v>

2236
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:06.380
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of fucking people are on Adderall.</v>

2237
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.403
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2238
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 5>And you need to develop that kind of like toughness when you're young.</v>

2239
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:11.630
<v Speaker 5>Like you shouldn't just be like,</v>

2240
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.111
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2241
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 5>14 years old and then you run into your first,</v>

2242
01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:15.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2243
01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:15.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2244
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.790
<v Speaker 5>bit of trouble in your life and then you,</v>

2245
01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.041
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2246
01:00:18.041 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 5>you reach for a pill.</v>

2247
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.480
<v Speaker 5>That's terrible.</v>

2248
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.040
<v Speaker 5>That's a terrible coping,</v>

2249
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 5>coping mechanism.</v>

2250
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.480
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2251
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:23.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2252
01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:25.960
<v Speaker 5>when you teach that to kids at a,</v>

2253
01:00:25.961 --> 01:00:26.810
<v Speaker 5>at an early age,</v>

2254
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.750
<v Speaker 5>and when you tell them it's such a terrible thing to tell someone,</v>

2255
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:30.231
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2256
01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:31.460
<v Speaker 5>you're 14 years old,</v>

2257
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.380
<v Speaker 5>you have major depressive disorder,</v>

2258
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:34.790
<v Speaker 5>you're going to take this pill,</v>

2259
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 5>you need it for the rest of your life.</v>

2260
01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.720
<v Speaker 5>And that said to people all the time,</v>

2261
01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2262
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.350
<v Speaker 5>you have a bio chemical deficiency and this is what you need.</v>

2263
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.060
<v Speaker 5>We need kids to be tougher.</v>

2264
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.451
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2265
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:44.931
<v Speaker 5>So you need,</v>

2266
01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:46.640
<v Speaker 5>you need them to build up some,</v>

2267
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:48.510
<v Speaker 5>some resiliency so that you know,</v>

2268
01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 5>when they do go through hard times,</v>

2269
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.451
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2270
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:52.010
<v Speaker 5>they have better coping mechanisms.</v>

2271
01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:54.740
<v Speaker 5>Like Joe Talks about diet and exercise all the time.</v>

2272
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:59.660
<v Speaker 5>I talked about diet and exercise all the time and that's Kinda how I got my</v>

2273
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.520
<v Speaker 5>start on on social media.</v>

2274
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 5>It is through diet and exercise.</v>

2275
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:05.210
<v Speaker 5>Exercise is a big one for young.</v>

2276
01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was a gigantic factor for me personally.</v>

2277
01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:09.200
<v Speaker 5>When I was 15 years old,</v>

2278
01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 5>I really got into martial arts and it changed my life,</v>

2279
01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.240
<v Speaker 5>changed my life by alleviating so much anxiety,</v>

2280
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.440
<v Speaker 5>giving me so much more relaxed.</v>

2281
01:01:15.441 --> 01:01:18.560
<v Speaker 5>My parents talk about it to like there's to use theirs.</v>

2282
01:01:18.561 --> 01:01:20.550
<v Speaker 5>You before martial arts,</v>

2283
01:01:20.551 --> 01:01:20.890
<v Speaker 5>since you,</v>

2284
01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:21.723
<v Speaker 5>after martial arts.</v>

2285
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 5>Relatively young kids.</v>

2286
01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2287
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.171
<v Speaker 5>And so do I.</v>

2288
01:01:24.171 --> 01:01:25.070
<v Speaker 5>And boy,</v>

2289
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 5>they love the devices.</v>

2290
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:27.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2291
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:29.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean we have to fight and we,</v>

2292
01:01:29.131 --> 01:01:29.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2293
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.750
<v Speaker 5>our kids,</v>

2294
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.901
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2295
01:01:29.901 --> 01:01:31.160
<v Speaker 5>fortunately they're three and six at this point.</v>

2296
01:01:31.161 --> 01:01:33.860
<v Speaker 5>They don't have their own iPad or iPhone or any of that stuff,</v>

2297
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.490
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2298
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.250
<v Speaker 5>but you give it to them for five minutes.</v>

2299
01:01:37.251 --> 01:01:38.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like crack.</v>

2300
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:38.400
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2301
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:38.640
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

2302
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.680
<v Speaker 5>you gotta tear down to their hand.</v>

2303
01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:40.011
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2304
01:01:40.011 --> 01:01:40.250
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

2305
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:43.190
<v Speaker 5>my kid will just turn their shoulder when I try to get the iPad from her.</v>

2306
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:43.770
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

2307
01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:43.911
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2308
01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:44.021
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2309
01:01:44.021 --> 01:01:44.121
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2310
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:44.481
<v Speaker 5>One more.</v>

2311
01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:45.314
<v Speaker 5>One more.</v>

2312
01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:46.221
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2313
01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:46.731
<v Speaker 5>It's a little,</v>

2314
01:01:46.731 --> 01:01:49.370
<v Speaker 5>it made it very fun and exciting for them.</v>

2315
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:49.671
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2316
01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:50.450
<v Speaker 5>and look,</v>

2317
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 5>it's not entirely negative.</v>

2318
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:52.761
<v Speaker 5>Like we have this,</v>

2319
01:01:52.761 --> 01:01:53.594
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2320
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 5>this TV set up with this dance game that they play and they're sweating and</v>

2321
01:01:57.801 --> 01:02:00.260
<v Speaker 5>dancing and after it's over the giggling and laughing,</v>

2322
01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:02.810
<v Speaker 5>it's a massive alleviate or of,</v>

2323
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.520
<v Speaker 5>of physical stress because it's like they're constantly got to follow this thing</v>

2324
01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:07.810
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

2325
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:09.170
<v Speaker 5>it's an exercise routine.</v>

2326
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.741
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2327
01:02:09.741 --> 01:02:10.281
<v Speaker 5>they're really,</v>

2328
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:11.270
<v Speaker 5>their cardio there,</v>

2329
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.830
<v Speaker 5>their cardiovascular rate gets up and they really feel good afterwards.</v>

2330
01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:18.230
<v Speaker 5>So it's not entirely negative,</v>

2331
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:19.070
<v Speaker 5>but it's mostly,</v>

2332
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:19.951
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

2333
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:20.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2334
01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:20.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2335
01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>If you have like a,</v>

2336
01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

2337
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>is that Nintendo we are or whatever it is.</v>

2338
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:24.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:29.331
<v Speaker 1>You can do this little thing that scans it or you actually can use your phone</v>

2340
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>and if you hold a phone,</v>

2341
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>like I'll give them my phone.</v>

2342
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>My wife will give the other one the her phone.</v>

2343
01:02:36.061 --> 01:02:38.930
<v Speaker 1>And like the phone shows how you're moving.</v>

2344
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.073
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>

2345
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So like mimic this thing that the person on the screen is doing.</v>

2346
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>But that's one thing that could,</v>

2347
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>could be considered positive.</v>

2348
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I think for the most part the real issue is social pressure and anxiety that</v>

2349
01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>comes from kids talking shit about each other and they,</v>

2350
01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.490
<v Speaker 1>they push buttons,</v>

2351
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:02.730
<v Speaker 1>they push buttons on each other because they know that they can like this.</v>

2352
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:06.030
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand the consequences it has.</v>

2353
01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:08.580
<v Speaker 1>But you would get free from it when you went home.</v>

2354
01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.410
<v Speaker 1>You're not free from it ever.</v>

2355
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Now these kids are waking up in the middle of the night and checking their</v>

2356
01:03:12.991 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Twitter account and find it.</v>

2357
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Their friends are talking shit about them,</v>

2358
01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:17.550
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on Facebook or whatever.</v>

2359
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And this girl from school,</v>

2360
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.330
<v Speaker 1>that fucking bitch and she commented on my youtube video,</v>

2361
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:22.950
<v Speaker 1>this is what they're dealing with.</v>

2362
01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:23.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2363
01:03:23.491 --> 01:03:24.900
<v Speaker 1>look at her with her fat face,</v>

2364
01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:25.561
<v Speaker 1>lol.</v>

2365
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And then those little 12 year olds like,</v>

2366
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>oh that is,</v>

2367
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a severe,</v>

2368
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 1>severe factor that no one had to consider</v>

2369
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:34.020
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2370
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:36.370
<v Speaker 3>And it makes you almost not want to go to school like this.</v>

2372
01:03:36.371 --> 01:03:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Kids who don't go to school because of that cause they don't want to have to</v>

2373
01:03:39.341 --> 01:03:40.174
<v Speaker 3>deal with,</v>

2374
01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:40.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2375
01:03:40.481 --> 01:03:41.320
<v Speaker 3>someone said some,</v>

2376
01:03:41.321 --> 01:03:42.970
<v Speaker 3>I see it in my office all the time.</v>

2377
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Someone said something to them last night on social media,</v>

2378
01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.940
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't go to school today because they don't want to have to face that.</v>

2379
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Like that's something that you know,</v>

2380
01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:53.620
<v Speaker 3>my generation never ever had to face.</v>

2381
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.341
<v Speaker 3>But I do.</v>

2382
01:03:54.341 --> 01:03:54.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean I do.</v>

2383
01:03:54.971 --> 01:03:57.790
<v Speaker 3>I think we're a little bit off topic here in terms of,</v>

2384
01:03:57.791 --> 01:03:59.270
<v Speaker 3>so we're talking about depression and anxiety.</v>

2385
01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about a factor.</v>

2386
01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2387
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Could be considered as big if not bigger.</v>

2388
01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Social media does not,</v>

2389
01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.340
<v Speaker 3>was people that get psychotic.</v>

2390
01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

2391
01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't listen.</v>

2392
01:04:09.131 --> 01:04:10.510
<v Speaker 3>This is why I don't know about that.</v>

2393
01:04:10.511 --> 01:04:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Severe anxiety,</v>

2394
01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.060
<v Speaker 3>lack of sleep,</v>

2395
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:14.343
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>

2396
01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:15.580
<v Speaker 3>absolutely</v>

2397
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.260
<v Speaker 1>correlated with altercations on social media.</v>

2398
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2399
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:22.760
<v Speaker 1>But social interactions that are severely,</v>

2400
01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.300
<v Speaker 3>they're correlated with poor mental health.</v>

2401
01:04:25.301 --> 01:04:29.770
<v Speaker 3>The good news is the brain is a relatively strong and power for some people.</v>

2402
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.270
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at sort of,</v>

2403
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not for everybody.</v>

2404
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Some people that are in a really bad situation that of psychosis.</v>

2405
01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2406
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2407
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:38.081
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2408
01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:39.940
<v Speaker 3>it's less than 1% for schizophrenia,</v>

2409
01:04:39.941 --> 01:04:41.800
<v Speaker 3>which is the most severe version you had sort of,</v>

2410
01:04:41.801 --> 01:04:42.970
<v Speaker 3>you had bipolar disorder,</v>

2411
01:04:42.971 --> 01:04:43.511
<v Speaker 3>psychosis,</v>

2412
01:04:43.511 --> 01:04:44.620
<v Speaker 3>depressive psychosis,</v>

2413
01:04:44.621 --> 01:04:45.580
<v Speaker 3>other kinds of psychosis.</v>

2414
01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you get to about three to 4% of the population is going to be diagnosed</v>

2415
01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.340
<v Speaker 3>clinically with one of these illnesses over the course of their life.</v>

2416
01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:54.900
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2417
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:55.361
<v Speaker 3>so okay,</v>

2418
01:04:55.361 --> 01:04:56.030
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand that's a,</v>

2419
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.920
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of people.</v>

2420
01:04:56.921 --> 01:04:57.521
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

2421
01:04:57.521 --> 01:04:59.560
<v Speaker 3>most people are not going to get psychotic.</v>

2422
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.810
<v Speaker 3>And most of the time if they do,</v>

2423
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.660
<v Speaker 3>there's either a genetic component that's obvious cause psychosis and</v>

2424
01:05:04.661 --> 01:05:09.160
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia often do run in families or there's an environmental component</v>

2425
01:05:09.161 --> 01:05:09.550
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2426
01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:10.780
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty obvious.</v>

2427
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean people can get psychotic,</v>

2428
01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>they can get a brain tumor,</v>

2429
01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.410
<v Speaker 3>can make them psychotic,</v>

2430
01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:14.920
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

2431
01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2432
01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:15.911
<v Speaker 3>it late in life,</v>

2433
01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.650
<v Speaker 3>they can get dementia that makes psychotic.</v>

2434
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:19.570
<v Speaker 3>There's oftentimes a pretty clear,</v>

2435
01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:20.051
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2436
01:05:20.051 --> 01:05:21.220
<v Speaker 3>organic cause.</v>

2437
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2438
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 3>So when we're talking so,</v>

2439
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:27.990
<v Speaker 3>so the brain is a relatively strong and healthy Oregon and it takes a lot to</v>

2440
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 3>break it.</v>

2441
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.400
<v Speaker 3>And that's why,</v>

2442
01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a bold state.</v>

2443
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 3>It is a bold statement,</v>

2444
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 3>but I would not,</v>

2445
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I would not agree with that at all really.</v>

2446
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:37.270
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2447
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2448
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not saying that people don't get depressed,</v>

2449
01:05:40.601 --> 01:05:41.710
<v Speaker 3>takes a lot to break.</v>

2450
01:05:41.711 --> 01:05:42.491
<v Speaker 3>People are depressed.</v>

2451
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:43.324
<v Speaker 3>All loans.</v>

2452
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the title that that fucking antipsychotic medication was the</v>

2453
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:50.240
<v Speaker 3>number one prescribed medication.</v>

2454
01:05:50.241 --> 01:05:50.891
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2455
01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:51.970
<v Speaker 3>Like people say to me,</v>

2456
01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:52.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2457
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.051
<v Speaker 3>people used to say,</v>

2458
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:53.400
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

2459
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm on antidepressants,</v>

2460
01:05:54.641 --> 01:05:55.061
<v Speaker 3>I'm on,</v>

2461
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:59.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm on antianxiety medication now people like I hear them at parties and stuff</v>

2462
01:05:59.021 --> 01:05:59.411
<v Speaker 3>saying like,</v>

2463
01:05:59.411 --> 01:06:00.340
<v Speaker 3>oh I'm on Seroquel.</v>

2464
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking like,</v>

2465
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:03.860
<v Speaker 3>well that person just tell a bunch of people that like throw on an anti</v>

2466
01:06:03.861 --> 01:06:04.694
<v Speaker 3>psychotic.</v>

2467
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.310
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2468
01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:07.920
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that people don't know that Sarah Cohen at or below fire</v>

2469
01:06:07.921 --> 01:06:08.680
<v Speaker 3>anti-psychotics.</v>

2470
01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:08.861
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2471
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:12.290
<v Speaker 3>Cause they've been sort of marketed as outside the class when in reality they're</v>

2472
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:13.030
<v Speaker 3>part of the class.</v>

2473
01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 3>But I got to push back on you a little bit.</v>

2474
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Sales numbers for those drugs.</v>

2475
01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Those are expensive drugs.</v>

2476
01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 3>They're not the most prescribed drugs in the country.</v>

2477
01:06:20.321 --> 01:06:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2478
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Abilify was the most prescribed drug in the United States.</v>

2479
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:25.204
<v Speaker 3>Should look that up.</v>

2480
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 3>We have looked that up.</v>

2481
01:06:26.681 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about it on the podcast because it's insane.</v>

2482
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.740
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>

2483
01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:30.770
<v Speaker 3>And we do go to,</v>

2484
01:06:30.771 --> 01:06:31.810
<v Speaker 3>and this is a good time to,</v>

2485
01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:34.520
<v Speaker 3>to talk a little bit about genetics after we,</v>

2486
01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:34.720
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2487
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.800
<v Speaker 3>we kind of look at this cause we can tease out a few things by looking at</v>

2488
01:06:38.801 --> 01:06:39.620
<v Speaker 3>genetics.</v>

2489
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Anti-Psychotic Abilify is the biggest selling drug us to be a top seller drug</v>

2490
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:46.810
<v Speaker 3>has to be expensive and also widely use.</v>

2491
01:06:46.811 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Abilify is both.</v>

2492
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.100
<v Speaker 3>It's the 14th most prescribed brand name medication,</v>

2493
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:53.890
<v Speaker 3>so it's 40 stuff but fucking that's crazy.</v>

2494
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 3>All the people with actual diseases.</v>

2495
01:06:56.321 --> 01:07:00.880
<v Speaker 3>This is a 14th most prescribed brand name medication at retails for about $30 a</v>

2496
01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:01.191
<v Speaker 3>pill.</v>

2497
01:07:01.191 --> 01:07:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Well doctor,</v>

2498
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean doctor can probably tell you this is getting prescribed as an ant on</v>

2499
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:05.381
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant.</v>

2500
01:07:05.381 --> 01:07:05.981
<v Speaker 3>Fulsome people.</v>

2501
01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 3>What that means though too is that equal are struggling man.</v>

2502
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2503
01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.850
<v Speaker 3>like life is hard for a lot of people.</v>

2504
01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Like very hard,</v>

2505
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Alex.</v>

2506
01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 3>I very difficult.</v>

2507
01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2508
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:21.390
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of people need something sometimes at the end of the day or during the</v>

2509
01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 3>day to help them get through the day.</v>

2510
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Cannabis,</v>

2511
01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:25.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2512
01:07:25.391 --> 01:07:30.391
<v Speaker 3>especially if the CBD component and also the THC component when used properly is</v>

2513
01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:31.960
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2514
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Like I tell people all the time I've made,</v>

2515
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I've made social media posts about it that like,</v>

2516
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:36.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2517
01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:40.720
<v Speaker 3>if you need to use a little bit of cannabis at the end of the day just to help</v>

2518
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:41.350
<v Speaker 3>you sleep,</v>

2519
01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:41.591
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2520
01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:44.280
<v Speaker 3>you're doing great and you're staying away from drugs and like,</v>

2521
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2522
01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.030
<v Speaker 3>prostitution,</v>

2523
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:46.540
<v Speaker 3>gambling,</v>

2524
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.250
<v Speaker 3>all these other brutal habits.</v>

2525
01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:53.950
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing all that,</v>

2526
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.090
<v Speaker 3>they're like you're doing,</v>

2527
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.440
<v Speaker 3>you're doing pretty good overall.</v>

2528
01:07:56.441 --> 01:07:56.681
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2529
01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.150
<v Speaker 3>So gambling's not bad bro.</v>

2530
01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.113
<v Speaker 3>A little bit again,</v>

2531
01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.340
<v Speaker 3>what a bet on some fights you go.</v>

2532
01:08:02.341 --> 01:08:03.520
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely,</v>

2533
01:08:03.521 --> 01:08:03.971
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2534
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:06.080
<v Speaker 3>I think giving people handheld devices that,</v>

2535
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.870
<v Speaker 3>that are inherently addictive,</v>

2536
01:08:07.871 --> 01:08:12.080
<v Speaker 3>where they can bet on sports every 15 seconds is a super bad idea.</v>

2537
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:13.440
<v Speaker 3>I hundred percent agree.</v>

2538
01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Can talk about that too liquid.</v>

2539
01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:15.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2540
01:08:15.501 --> 01:08:16.060
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing</v>

2541
01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.440
<v Speaker 6>it's benefited me with social media is my eyesight is going,</v>

2542
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:19.530
<v Speaker 6>the god of the older,</v>

2543
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.500
<v Speaker 6>I can't even read my Twitter feed.</v>

2544
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:23.750
<v Speaker 6>I have fuck these people read it.</v>

2545
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:24.800
<v Speaker 6>If I don't put my glasses,</v>

2546
01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:25.970
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck they're saying.</v>

2547
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:26.751
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

2548
01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:27.241
<v Speaker 6>it's so,</v>

2549
01:08:27.241 --> 01:08:27.710
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

2550
01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:28.543
<v Speaker 6>so good.</v>

2551
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.200
<v Speaker 6>People don't get depressed and anxious.</v>

2552
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:34.340
<v Speaker 6>I'm swinging to say this is a different thing.</v>

2553
01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.270
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2554
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:35.601
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2555
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:36.440
<v Speaker 6>I think we're,</v>

2556
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.790
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

2557
01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:37.880
<v Speaker 6>we are dope though.</v>

2558
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:39.830
<v Speaker 6>Discussing overall mental health.</v>

2559
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2560
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.980
<v Speaker 6>I'll look,</v>

2561
01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've,</v>

2562
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.270
<v Speaker 6>I've made a big turn over the last few years,</v>

2563
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2564
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.440
<v Speaker 6>with myself that I don't quick bathroom break gone.</v>

2565
01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.880
<v Speaker 6>I don't think marijuana is a safe,</v>

2566
01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 6>as I used to think it is.</v>

2567
01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 6>I used to think it was benign.</v>

2568
01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:56.450
<v Speaker 6>I really used to think there was no big deal.</v>

2569
01:08:56.451 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 6>But I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident</v>

2570
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.570
<v Speaker 6>fucking muscular,</v>

2571
01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:07.070
<v Speaker 6>handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to</v>

2572
01:09:07.071 --> 01:09:07.490
<v Speaker 6>sleep.</v>

2573
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:09.170
<v Speaker 6>And for two weeks this guy was,</v>

2574
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:10.190
<v Speaker 6>this is a different guy.</v>

2575
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:11.090
<v Speaker 6>Not that I was talking to,</v>

2576
01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:12.110
<v Speaker 6>not not Rafi,</v>

2577
01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:12.351
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2578
01:09:12.351 --> 01:09:13.184
<v Speaker 6>a different guy.</v>

2579
01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.730
<v Speaker 6>He took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and all these.</v>

2580
01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:19.040
<v Speaker 6>He had like severe consequences.</v>

2581
01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:22.010
<v Speaker 6>I think that the human beings,</v>

2582
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:27.250
<v Speaker 6>we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement,</v>

2583
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:30.880
<v Speaker 6>what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been in a</v>

2584
01:09:30.881 --> 01:09:33.320
<v Speaker 6>responsible saying that well for one reason.</v>

2585
01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:34.101
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting,</v>

2586
01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:38.180
<v Speaker 6>one reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems</v>

2587
01:09:38.181 --> 01:09:38.721
<v Speaker 6>it causes,</v>

2588
01:09:38.721 --> 01:09:41.330
<v Speaker 6>and again alcohol can certainly cause problems,</v>

2589
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.350
<v Speaker 6>is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way.</v>

2590
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.190
<v Speaker 6>You know if,</v>

2591
01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:49.820
<v Speaker 6>and you sorta know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink,</v>

2592
01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:50.840
<v Speaker 6>when they have five drinks,</v>

2593
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:54.480
<v Speaker 6>you've got some trends that I've got some friends that get those juror belies</v>

2594
01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.180
<v Speaker 6>you ever see when people get sharp guys,</v>

2595
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:57.500
<v Speaker 6>they're just gone.</v>

2596
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:59.630
<v Speaker 6>They start talking crazy,</v>

2597
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.830
<v Speaker 6>but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's going to take to</v>

2598
01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:05.140
<v Speaker 6>clear your body and you,</v>

2599
01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:05.660
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

2600
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.550
<v Speaker 6>cannabis is so different.</v>

2601
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:11.150
<v Speaker 6>It's really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different</v>

2602
01:10:11.151 --> 01:10:11.720
<v Speaker 6>ways.</v>

2603
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.360
<v Speaker 6>And also the tolerance has changed radically.</v>

2604
01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:15.723
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

2605
01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:16.341
<v Speaker 6>people say,</v>

2606
01:10:16.341 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 6>well two and a half milligrams of Thc,</v>

2607
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:18.891
<v Speaker 6>you vape it.</v>

2608
01:10:18.891 --> 01:10:21.770
<v Speaker 6>That's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use.</v>

2609
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:23.110
<v Speaker 6>But then if you're on,</v>

2610
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.680
<v Speaker 6>if you're a tolerant user,</v>

2611
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.870
<v Speaker 6>you can use 200 milligrams in a day.</v>

2612
01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:28.160
<v Speaker 6>That's 80 drinks.</v>

2613
01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:28.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2614
01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 6>it's a weird drug.</v>

2615
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.720
<v Speaker 6>And then there's the issue of eating it.</v>

2616
01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:32.991
<v Speaker 6>When you eat it,</v>

2617
01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:36.410
<v Speaker 6>your body produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite.</v>

2618
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.470
<v Speaker 6>It's a far more psychoactive.</v>

2619
01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.370
<v Speaker 6>You were all along for the ride when that happens.</v>

2620
01:10:40.371 --> 01:10:41.660
<v Speaker 6>Yes you are.</v>

2621
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:42.081
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2622
01:10:42.081 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 6>And it can take days for it to get out of your system.</v>

2623
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 6>I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the</v>

2624
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:48.111
<v Speaker 6>next day like,</v>

2625
01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:48.321
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

2626
01:10:48.321 --> 01:10:48.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm still hot.</v>

2627
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:49.783
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2628
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.321
<v Speaker 6>it's true.</v>

2629
01:10:50.321 --> 01:10:50.720
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2630
01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.410
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

2631
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:52.310
<v Speaker 6>so I think,</v>

2632
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:56.540
<v Speaker 6>I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like,</v>

2633
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.721
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2634
01:10:56.721 --> 01:10:58.700
<v Speaker 6>there's basically no downsides to this.</v>

2635
01:10:58.710 --> 01:10:59.690
<v Speaker 6>There's only upsides.</v>

2636
01:10:59.691 --> 01:11:01.460
<v Speaker 6>The cops will bus smokers,</v>

2637
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 6>there'll be tax revenue.</v>

2638
01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.430
<v Speaker 6>All of these people have a way to get high.</v>

2639
01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Speaker 6>That's clearly safer than alcohol.</v>

2640
01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.330
<v Speaker 6>And unfortunately that's just not true.</v>

2641
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.380
<v Speaker 6>I think you're right.</v>

2642
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.290
<v Speaker 6>And I think the issue that people,</v>

2643
01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 6>from what I've read are</v>

2644
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.520
<v Speaker 5>having with your book are people that are marijuana advocates and think that</v>

2645
01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:22.410
<v Speaker 5>your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC</v>

2646
01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like what he was talking about,</v>

2647
01:11:24.271 --> 01:11:28.200
<v Speaker 5>cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you are only</v>

2648
01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.390
<v Speaker 5>focusing on the negative.</v>

2649
01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.930
<v Speaker 5>I'll plead guilty to them cause I think that for 20 years people have only heard</v>

2650
01:11:33.931 --> 01:11:34.470
<v Speaker 5>the positive.</v>

2651
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:35.070
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2652
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:36.590
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a,</v>

2653
01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:37.560
<v Speaker 5>I think that's also,</v>

2654
01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:41.250
<v Speaker 5>I'll plead guilty to up myself cause I think that I've only been discussing the</v>

2655
01:11:41.251 --> 01:11:45.060
<v Speaker 5>positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the</v>

2656
01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:48.100
<v Speaker 5>things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experience and</v>

2657
01:11:48.101 --> 01:11:50.640
<v Speaker 5>criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of</v>

2658
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:54.660
<v Speaker 5>different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out,</v>

2659
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:59.250
<v Speaker 5>am I coming at this from a truly balanced position or am I trying to support a</v>

2660
01:11:59.251 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 5>conclusion that I started out with?</v>

2661
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.400
<v Speaker 5>And I'm trying to,</v>

2662
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2663
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:05.650
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another backup my own work or back up my own,</v>

2664
01:12:05.651 --> 01:12:07.740
<v Speaker 5>just my own statements and,</v>

2665
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:08.081
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2666
01:12:08.081 --> 01:12:11.790
<v Speaker 5>and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective.</v>

2667
01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:13.530
<v Speaker 5>And it's very difficult to do.</v>

2668
01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:16.650
<v Speaker 5>I wrote a book called Tell Your children the truth about marijuana,</v>

2669
01:12:16.651 --> 01:12:17.670
<v Speaker 5>mental illness and violence.</v>

2670
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can,</v>

2671
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:25.130
<v Speaker 5>you can think that that book is going to be a compendium of the pros and cons</v>

2672
01:12:25.381 --> 01:12:25.481
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2673
01:12:25.481 --> 01:12:25.690
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2674
01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:27.750
<v Speaker 5>if you want to tell your children the truth though,</v>

2675
01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.480
<v Speaker 5>you really do want to tell them the pros and cons.</v>

2676
01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.890
<v Speaker 5>And then you did indicate,</v>

2677
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:32.341
<v Speaker 5>Alex,</v>

2678
01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:32.791
<v Speaker 5>you said,</v>

2679
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:33.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2680
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.550
<v Speaker 5>we should tell people the truth in the book,</v>

2681
01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:35.821
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2682
01:12:35.821 --> 01:12:36.440
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2683
01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2684
01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.970
<v Speaker 5>I think that when you're telling and you're saying that,</v>

2685
01:12:38.971 --> 01:12:39.810
<v Speaker 5>that you're telling the truth,</v>

2686
01:12:39.811 --> 01:12:40.321
<v Speaker 5>and Alex,</v>

2687
01:12:40.321 --> 01:12:43.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth,</v>

2688
01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2689
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.440
<v Speaker 5>But part of the truth is,</v>

2690
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:46.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2691
01:12:46.621 --> 01:12:49.290
<v Speaker 5>a little bit deceiving and deceptive in some ways,</v>

2692
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:49.501
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2693
01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 5>You want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth,</v>

2694
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:55.830
<v Speaker 5>then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know,</v>

2695
01:12:55.831 --> 01:12:58.110
<v Speaker 5>a good informed decision based upon that.</v>

2696
01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.370
<v Speaker 5>Like if people are going to just read one part of the story,</v>

2697
01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.390
<v Speaker 5>then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part.</v>

2698
01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:10.920
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to make an informed decision based upon all of the pots and</v>

2699
01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:11.754
<v Speaker 5>because of that,</v>

2700
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:13.140
<v Speaker 5>people are going to make you know,</v>

2701
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:14.880
<v Speaker 5>some very poor choices.</v>

2702
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:16.260
<v Speaker 5>I completely agree with that,</v>

2703
01:13:16.261 --> 01:13:20.760
<v Speaker 5>but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side,</v>

2704
01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:22.110
<v Speaker 5>in the legalization side,</v>

2705
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.340
<v Speaker 5>doing a very,</v>

2706
01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 5>very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's,</v>

2707
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.320
<v Speaker 5>there's almost nobody on the other side.</v>

2708
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 5>There's this one guy who's got on Jeff sessions,</v>

2709
01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 5>he had the fucking goddamn attorney general telling people that good people</v>

2710
01:13:35.491 --> 01:13:38.500
<v Speaker 5>don't smoke marijuana and that's literally a quote that says,</v>

2711
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.990
<v Speaker 5>and thank God that little more on,</v>

2712
01:13:40.991 --> 01:13:41.780
<v Speaker 5>it's not in an opposite,</v>

2713
01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm more,</v>

2714
01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.320
<v Speaker 5>but that's,</v>

2715
01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.640
<v Speaker 5>that's a terrible thing to say.</v>

2716
01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.930
<v Speaker 5>People don't smoke marijuana.</v>

2717
01:13:45.931 --> 01:13:46.150
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2718
01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:48.470
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke marijuana.</v>

2719
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:49.363
<v Speaker 5>That's just not true.</v>

2720
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.430
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

2721
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:52.020
<v Speaker 5>I think this is a personal choice,</v>

2722
01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:52.381
<v Speaker 5>okay?</v>

2723
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:54.250
<v Speaker 5>Especially for adults and,</v>

2724
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.460
<v Speaker 5>and you can make bad personal choices.</v>

2725
01:13:56.461 --> 01:13:56.990
<v Speaker 5>You Go,</v>

2726
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.211
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2727
01:13:57.211 --> 01:13:57.961
<v Speaker 5>I play cards.</v>

2728
01:13:57.961 --> 01:13:59.010
<v Speaker 5>I love to play poker.</v>

2729
01:13:59.160 --> 01:13:59.371
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2730
01:13:59.371 --> 01:14:00.720
<v Speaker 5>said that on this trip to La,</v>

2731
01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:02.070
<v Speaker 5>I didn't get to go to a poker room,</v>

2732
01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:05.400
<v Speaker 5>but you can go into casino and you can see people who've lost change your flight</v>

2733
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.890
<v Speaker 5>places close by.</v>

2734
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:09.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't incur Ari.</v>

2735
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 5>You used to make a living doing that and struggling with</v>

2736
01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:12.853
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>

2737
01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.530
<v Speaker 4>Don't encourage me,</v>

2738
01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.600
<v Speaker 4>but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses.</v>

2739
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.890
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal.</v>

2740
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.470
<v Speaker 4>It also means that there's less and more dangerous forms.</v>

2741
01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:26.740
<v Speaker 4>That device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is going to</v>

2742
01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:26.861
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

2743
01:14:26.861 --> 01:14:27.800
<v Speaker 4>If it's going to be a ball or strike.</v>

2744
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.390
<v Speaker 4>That's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there.</v>

2745
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.720
<v Speaker 4>And 100% or 98% THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5%</v>

2746
01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:39.701
<v Speaker 4>CBD,</v>

2747
01:14:39.701 --> 01:14:44.701
<v Speaker 4>15% THC product that doctor heart might suggest is patient uses once a night to</v>

2748
01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:45.680
<v Speaker 4>go to sleep.</v>

2749
01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.150
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>

2750
01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:47.290
<v Speaker 4>but that's the message that,</v>

2751
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2752
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 4>we should be putting out there,</v>

2753
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:49.481
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2754
01:14:49.481 --> 01:14:50.440
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't just be,</v>

2755
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2756
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:52.720
<v Speaker 4>focusing on one side of the story.</v>

2757
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:53.554
<v Speaker 4>Like that part,</v>

2758
01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:53.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2759
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:56.500
<v Speaker 4>should also be included in the book and like,</v>

2760
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:56.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2761
01:14:56.921 --> 01:14:57.620
<v Speaker 4>you're a book.</v>

2762
01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2763
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2764
01:14:58.241 --> 01:15:01.540
<v Speaker 4>in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write.</v>

2765
01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:01.991
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2766
01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 4>because my first book,</v>

2767
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2768
01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:05.770
<v Speaker 4>was coauthor with Jeremy Costs and call friendly fire.</v>

2769
01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:06.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2770
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.430
<v Speaker 4>my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PTG.</v>

2771
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.690
<v Speaker 4>So is how to transform posttraumatic stress into posttraumatic growth.</v>

2772
01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:14.231
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2773
01:15:14.231 --> 01:15:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Because I feel that,</v>

2774
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2775
01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:19.570
<v Speaker 4>we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult</v>

2776
01:15:19.571 --> 01:15:22.150
<v Speaker 4>obstacles in their life and some people have,</v>

2777
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:22.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2778
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:26.230
<v Speaker 4>succumb to that stress and they've gone down the wrong path kind of thing.</v>

2779
01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:29.680
<v Speaker 4>And then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've</v>

2780
01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:32.440
<v Speaker 4>actually become better because of it.</v>

2781
01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:33.900
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2782
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2783
01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 4>CBD and Thc can both help facilitate that process.</v>

2784
01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:39.701
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2785
01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 4>when you're looking at someone like a veteran,</v>

2786
01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:42.454
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2787
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.630
<v Speaker 4>you're the hallmark of someone with whose PTSD is someone who doesn't leave</v>

2788
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:48.910
<v Speaker 4>their home and they can't sleep at night.</v>

2789
01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:51.430
<v Speaker 4>So like when I see a vet in my office,</v>

2790
01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.700
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to 10 days a month,</v>

2791
01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:55.331
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2792
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:56.890
<v Speaker 4>So when you give them CBD,</v>

2793
01:15:56.891 --> 01:15:58.480
<v Speaker 4>and this is really important for people to understand,</v>

2794
01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:01.900
<v Speaker 4>CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear.</v>

2795
01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.340
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible,</v>

2796
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.821
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2797
01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:04.420
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2798
01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:04.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2799
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.940
<v Speaker 4>if you can get people outside of their home,</v>

2800
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:08.170
<v Speaker 4>because I'm not talking about,</v>

2801
01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:08.711
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2802
01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:08.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2803
01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:09.694
<v Speaker 4>someone who's,</v>

2804
01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2805
01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm too nervous to like go to,</v>

2806
01:16:12.421 --> 01:16:12.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2807
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:12.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2808
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:13.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2809
01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.093
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2810
01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.850
<v Speaker 4>the bar with like the friends or something like that.</v>

2811
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to people who were like,</v>

2812
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:17.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2813
01:16:17.321 --> 01:16:18.940
<v Speaker 4>it was difficult for them to go to the grocery store,</v>

2814
01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:20.320
<v Speaker 4>just like pick up a few things.</v>

2815
01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:21.483
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2816
01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:21.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2817
01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:24.820
<v Speaker 4>those are the type of people that I see in my practice of CBD is really</v>

2818
01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:25.654
<v Speaker 4>excellent for that.</v>

2819
01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.590
<v Speaker 4>Then when you look at,</v>

2820
01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:26.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2821
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:27.160
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2822
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.330
<v Speaker 4>the nighttime component,</v>

2823
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:29.130
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2824
01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:29.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2825
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.830
<v Speaker 4>THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares.</v>

2826
01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:36.820
<v Speaker 4>That's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug</v>

2827
01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:37.240
<v Speaker 4>nabilone.</v>

2828
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:37.510
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2829
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:42.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't really use nabilone very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do</v>

2830
01:16:43.001 --> 01:16:43.461
<v Speaker 4>believe in,</v>

2831
01:16:43.461 --> 01:16:43.591
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2832
01:16:43.591 --> 01:16:46.600
<v Speaker 4>in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids.</v>

2833
01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:47.950
<v Speaker 4>So I don't use it that much.</v>

2834
01:16:47.951 --> 01:16:49.450
<v Speaker 4>But that shows that she,</v>

2835
01:16:49.451 --> 01:16:51.580
<v Speaker 4>she came reduced nightmares and you know,</v>

2836
01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:52.310
<v Speaker 4>if you have,</v>

2837
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.630
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

2838
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:53.800
<v Speaker 4>if you have PTSD,</v>

2839
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:56.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD,</v>

2840
01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:57.640
<v Speaker 4>and again this is,</v>

2841
01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.590
<v Speaker 4>this comes from a clinician's point of view,</v>

2842
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.700
<v Speaker 4>they will tell you,</v>

2843
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.560
<v Speaker 4>I will try anything.</v>

2844
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.900
<v Speaker 4>And that's the same way when you get with like,</v>

2845
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:05.913
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2846
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.030
<v Speaker 4>the parents of,</v>

2847
01:17:07.031 --> 01:17:07.450
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2848
01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:07.850
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2849
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:09.740
<v Speaker 4>of kids who have seizures all day.</v>

2850
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.340
<v Speaker 4>Nobody</v>

2851
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.070
<v Speaker 5>wants to see that you like and like,</v>

2852
01:17:12.071 --> 01:17:12.770
<v Speaker 5>and like Alex,</v>

2853
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2854
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:13.880
<v Speaker 5>if your kids,</v>

2855
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:14.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2856
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:15.590
<v Speaker 5>ever started getting,</v>

2857
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 5>getting seizures,</v>

2858
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:17.150
<v Speaker 5>which you know,</v>

2859
01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:17.630
<v Speaker 5>I hope,</v>

2860
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:18.800
<v Speaker 5>I hope they don't because it's,</v>

2861
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.551
<v Speaker 5>it's terrible.</v>

2862
01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:19.881
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

2863
01:17:19.881 --> 01:17:20.930
<v Speaker 5>what it can do to people.</v>

2864
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.660
<v Speaker 5>But if that ever happened,</v>

2865
01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:24.201
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2866
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:25.760
<v Speaker 5>I would hope that you would consider,</v>

2867
01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:26.181
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2868
01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:28.640
<v Speaker 5>CBD as a potential treatment option.</v>

2869
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:30.261
<v Speaker 5>He's not against it.</v>

2870
01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:32.040
<v Speaker 5>I think we have to be really clear as a distinction.</v>

2871
01:17:32.041 --> 01:17:32.661
<v Speaker 5>Like CBD,</v>

2872
01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:34.270
<v Speaker 5>you're not against you at all and I don't,</v>

2873
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody is.</v>

2874
01:17:35.391 --> 01:17:39.020
<v Speaker 5>I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain</v>

2875
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.730
<v Speaker 5>levels is arguing against CBD.</v>

2876
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:43.250
<v Speaker 5>That's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry.</v>

2877
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.920
<v Speaker 5>The reality is CBD is proven to be,</v>

2878
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.170
<v Speaker 5>at least as far as I've read,</v>

2879
01:17:48.171 --> 01:17:51.920
<v Speaker 5>very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders,</v>

2880
01:17:51.921 --> 01:17:55.400
<v Speaker 5>especially those that are about reducing and have something to do with</v>

2881
01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:56.690
<v Speaker 5>inflammation or seizures.</v>

2882
01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:56.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2883
01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:57.920
<v Speaker 5>One of my good friends,</v>

2884
01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.910
<v Speaker 5>his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out,</v>

2885
01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:02.660
<v Speaker 5>just killed it,</v>

2886
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:03.493
<v Speaker 5>killed it on time.</v>

2887
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:04.540
<v Speaker 5>This is very recently,</v>

2888
01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2889
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:05.830
<v Speaker 5>you're somebody who's a,</v>

2890
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2891
01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:07.190
<v Speaker 5>who's a cannabis user,</v>

2892
01:18:07.191 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 5>you obviously know a lot of users.</v>

2893
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.520
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think it is it people,</v>

2894
01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2895
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:13.640
<v Speaker 5>in legal states where they can really express a preference,</v>

2896
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:14.660
<v Speaker 5>they can go into a dispensary,</v>

2897
01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:15.770
<v Speaker 5>know exactly what they're buying.</v>

2898
01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:20.390
<v Speaker 5>Why is it that they want such high potency THC product?</v>

2899
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:21.830
<v Speaker 5>Because they get used to it.</v>

2900
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2901
01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:22.930
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2902
01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:24.470
<v Speaker 5>your tolerance develops,</v>

2903
01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:25.803
<v Speaker 5>it builds up,</v>

2904
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:26.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2905
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.370
<v Speaker 5>every year we do this thing called sober October.</v>

2906
01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:28.521
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2907
01:18:28.521 --> 01:18:30.140
<v Speaker 5>we don't do any no drinking,</v>

2908
01:18:30.141 --> 01:18:30.770
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2909
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:31.371
<v Speaker 5>no pot.</v>

2910
01:18:31.371 --> 01:18:33.470
<v Speaker 5>And we do do some sort of crazy challenge,</v>

2911
01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:34.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2912
01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:35.930
<v Speaker 5>me and three of my buddies and,</v>

2913
01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:36.764
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2914
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:38.120
<v Speaker 5>when we do it,</v>

2915
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:38.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2916
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:38.810
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2917
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:41.840
<v Speaker 5>it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced.</v>

2918
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:42.560
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2919
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.780
<v Speaker 5>I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like,</v>

2920
01:18:44.781 --> 01:18:46.100
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

2921
01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:46.671
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2922
01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:49.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid sentence and I'm just</v>

2923
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.450
<v Speaker 5>blitzkrieg.</v>

2924
01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:51.201
<v Speaker 5>Whereas,</v>

2925
01:18:51.201 --> 01:18:51.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2926
01:18:51.471 --> 01:18:52.281
<v Speaker 5>now like,</v>

2927
01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:52.491
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2928
01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:53.870
<v Speaker 5>I smoked a little weed last night,</v>

2929
01:18:53.871 --> 01:18:54.561
<v Speaker 5>did some stand up,</v>

2930
01:18:54.561 --> 01:18:55.311
<v Speaker 5>had a great old time.</v>

2931
01:18:55.311 --> 01:18:55.611
<v Speaker 5>There was no,</v>

2932
01:18:55.611 --> 01:18:56.720
<v Speaker 5>no issues with it at all.</v>

2933
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:57.830
<v Speaker 5>But I'm used to it.</v>

2934
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:59.870
<v Speaker 5>And if the weed that I smoked last night,</v>

2935
01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:01.040
<v Speaker 5>I assume you don't smoke.</v>

2936
01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 5>I do not.</v>

2937
01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:02.421
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2938
01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:05.390
<v Speaker 5>If you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint,</v>

2939
01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 5>you'd beat still there in the corner,</v>

2940
01:19:07.401 --> 01:19:08.420
<v Speaker 5>in the fetal position going,</v>

2941
01:19:08.421 --> 01:19:10.100
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck is going on?</v>

2942
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:12.470
<v Speaker 5>Because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful.</v>

2943
01:19:12.471 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Speaker 5>But once you're accustomed to it,</v>

2944
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:14.900
<v Speaker 5>once your body acclimates,</v>

2945
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:16.250
<v Speaker 5>it's really not that big of a deal.</v>

2946
01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.480
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>

2947
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:18.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2948
01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:18.420
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2949
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users.</v>

2950
01:19:22.101 --> 01:19:22.940
<v Speaker 5>And for those people,</v>

2951
01:19:22.941 --> 01:19:24.420
<v Speaker 5>like my friend Joey Diaz,</v>

2952
01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:27.440
<v Speaker 5>if there's a video of him giving this a other comedian,</v>

2953
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2954
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.710
<v Speaker 5>w how many milligrams of those stars with death?</v>

2955
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.843
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2956
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:33.870
<v Speaker 5>like when we give Owen,</v>

2957
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:34.680
<v Speaker 5>what did he give all them?</v>

2958
01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.540
<v Speaker 5>I think just one.</v>

2959
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.850
<v Speaker 5>He ruined his life would have been about 200 to 250,</v>

2960
01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.500
<v Speaker 5>two 54 and went out.</v>

2961
01:19:41.501 --> 01:19:41.690
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2962
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:42.800
<v Speaker 5>Joey made a video,</v>

2963
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:45.080
<v Speaker 5>but the day it changed Owen's life,</v>

2964
01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.510
<v Speaker 5>like literally fucked the guy's head up.</v>

2965
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:49.640
<v Speaker 5>Like he went outside and he vanished.</v>

2966
01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:50.553
<v Speaker 5>He's gone.</v>

2967
01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.253
<v Speaker 5>That's cannabis.</v>

2968
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.650
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2969
01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:54.483
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2970
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:55.311
<v Speaker 5>well I think,</v>

2971
01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:57.140
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a real argument to be made.</v>

2972
01:19:57.141 --> 01:19:58.130
<v Speaker 5>It's particularly with him.</v>

2973
01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.190
<v Speaker 5>Well it's like it was going to make two points on that.</v>

2974
01:20:01.191 --> 01:20:06.191
<v Speaker 5>So you definitely came develop a tolerance seal and I tell people all the time,</v>

2975
01:20:06.321 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 5>try and take at one three week break.</v>

2976
01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:09.300
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2977
01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Speaker 5>but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks,</v>

2978
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:17.520
<v Speaker 5>generally all your sectors return and will be like you've never used cannabis</v>

2979
01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:18.354
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

2980
01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 5>She saw it.</v>

2981
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 5>And that's even with people who are really,</v>

2982
01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 5>really heavy users.</v>

2983
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 5>I can go back and get the study.</v>

2984
01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:25.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2985
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:27.450
<v Speaker 5>but I mean these people are you using,</v>

2986
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:29.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day.</v>

2987
01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:33.040
<v Speaker 5>Well really heavy users and snoop Dogg's a good example of that.</v>

2988
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.050
<v Speaker 5>My friend Tony Hinchcliffe is good buddies with snoop Dogg and he said Snoop</v>

2989
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:40.740
<v Speaker 5>Dogg just smokes all day and he just like,</v>

2990
01:20:40.741 --> 01:20:42.640
<v Speaker 5>he's always high and you know,</v>

2991
01:20:42.641 --> 01:20:42.961
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

2992
01:20:42.961 --> 01:20:44.070
<v Speaker 5>well what do you do when you're not high?</v>

2993
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.431
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2994
01:20:44.431 --> 01:20:45.264
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2995
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.081
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2996
01:20:46.081 --> 01:20:47.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm never not high.</v>

2997
01:20:47.290 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 5>So everything he does,</v>

2998
01:20:48.661 --> 01:20:49.920
<v Speaker 5>he is high as fuck.</v>

2999
01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Everything he does.</v>

3000
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:51.721
<v Speaker 5>Like for that guy,</v>

3001
01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:52.800
<v Speaker 5>it's not that big of a deal.</v>

3002
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.720
<v Speaker 5>And for the way he lives his life,</v>

3003
01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.490
<v Speaker 5>like he's just a relaxed,</v>

3004
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:57.450
<v Speaker 5>easy going guy.</v>

3005
01:20:57.451 --> 01:20:58.290
<v Speaker 5>It's no problem.</v>

3006
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:02.100
<v Speaker 5>You can be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful</v>

3007
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:02.940
<v Speaker 5>with this strategy.</v>

3008
01:21:03.010 --> 01:21:03.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3009
01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:04.323
<v Speaker 5>Worldly success.</v>

3010
01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:09.660
<v Speaker 5>The second point I was gonna I was going to make on that too though was there</v>

3011
01:21:09.811 --> 01:21:13.790
<v Speaker 5>does not appear to be any tolerance at the CB two receptors.</v>

3012
01:21:13.791 --> 01:21:16.530
<v Speaker 5>So cheesy attaches to the CB one receptor and that's,</v>

3013
01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.300
<v Speaker 5>and that's where we know we can get tolerance.</v>

3014
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:18.660
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3015
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.493
<v Speaker 5>some people,</v>

3016
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:19.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3017
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.161
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3018
01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:23.700
<v Speaker 5>they have some pain that use some TFC and sometimes they need a little bit more.</v>

3019
01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Same sometimes asleep,</v>

3020
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:25.381
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3021
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.070
<v Speaker 5>the use TC,</v>

3022
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:28.980
<v Speaker 5>it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD to,</v>

3023
01:21:28.981 --> 01:21:30.060
<v Speaker 5>we haven't seen that.</v>

3024
01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 5>Meaning like the people who,</v>

3025
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.251
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3026
01:21:32.251 --> 01:21:32.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3027
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:33.060
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>

3028
01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.140
<v Speaker 5>get seizure control.</v>

3029
01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:36.960
<v Speaker 5>Generally they don't need to increase the dose.</v>

3030
01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:38.730
<v Speaker 5>Like the girl I was talking about earlier,</v>

3031
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:39.450
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3032
01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:39.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3033
01:21:39.811 --> 01:21:40.500
<v Speaker 5>at first described,</v>

3034
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.370
<v Speaker 5>I think when she was 20,</v>

3035
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 5>when she was about in 20,</v>

3036
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:43.320
<v Speaker 5>she's 25 now.</v>

3037
01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 5>She's never increased her dose.</v>

3038
01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:45.961
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3039
01:21:45.961 --> 01:21:48.900
<v Speaker 5>she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last five years.</v>

3040
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:49.640
<v Speaker 5>Medicine.</v>

3041
01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:49.940
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3042
01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:50.773
<v Speaker 5>Like it works.</v>

3043
01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:54.700
<v Speaker 5>I think we should really stop talking about CBD.</v>

3044
01:21:55.150 --> 01:21:57.330
<v Speaker 5>I just wanted to make a note on the,</v>

3045
01:21:57.331 --> 01:21:57.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3046
01:21:57.690 --> 01:21:59.550
<v Speaker 5>on the tolerance of the CPU on,</v>

3047
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.780
<v Speaker 5>I just wanted to make a note that CBT there doesn't appear to be tolerance.</v>

3048
01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.470
<v Speaker 5>And so it's just,</v>

3049
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:06.630
<v Speaker 5>there's just such a significant impact,</v>

3050
01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:07.140
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3051
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:07.500
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

3052
01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.800
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to especially edible THC,</v>

3053
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3054
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.070
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

3055
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:16.440
<v Speaker 5>there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good.</v>

3056
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:17.970
<v Speaker 5>That's just a fact.</v>

3057
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.280
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

3058
01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:18.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3059
01:22:18.481 --> 01:22:19.370
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this when,</v>

3060
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:20.640
<v Speaker 2>when you were were out,</v>

3061
01:22:20.641 --> 01:22:21.400
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3062
01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:21.931
<v Speaker 2>that's why I,</v>

3063
01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:22.980
<v Speaker 2>so I had an interview.</v>

3064
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I was that guy who was doing the radio interview on the Slo from,</v>

3065
01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.120
<v Speaker 2>from DC to New York last month.</v>

3066
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.751
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3067
01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3068
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:32.670
<v Speaker 2>this woman came in and it was Baltimore.</v>

3069
01:22:32.671 --> 01:22:36.300
<v Speaker 2>She sat down next to me and I finished the interview and she said,</v>

3070
01:22:36.301 --> 01:22:37.500
<v Speaker 2>she said I couldn't help overhearing.</v>

3071
01:22:37.501 --> 01:22:37.741
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

3072
01:22:37.741 --> 01:22:37.861
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3073
01:22:37.861 --> 01:22:38.341
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

3074
01:22:38.341 --> 01:22:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Like she's,</v>

3075
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.690
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

3076
01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:42.060
<v Speaker 2>she's a pothead or she's just annoyed that I was doing this.</v>

3077
01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:43.051
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

3078
01:22:43.051 --> 01:22:43.531
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

3079
01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:43.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3080
01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I was in Seattle last month.</v>

3081
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:45.750
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

3082
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.340
<v Speaker 2>this woman was in her early thirties.</v>

3083
01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:48.174
<v Speaker 2>She was a lawyer,</v>

3084
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:49.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3085
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:49.973
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>

3086
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:50.640
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

3087
01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.500
<v Speaker 2>and a friend of mine said to me,</v>

3088
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:53.160
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

3089
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:53.720
<v Speaker 2>let's have,</v>

3090
01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.553
<v Speaker 2>let's do an edible.</v>

3091
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3092
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:55.411
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

3093
01:22:55.411 --> 01:22:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I took it,</v>

3094
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.240
<v Speaker 2>we bought a small dose.</v>

3095
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:58.440
<v Speaker 2>We asked them for a small dose.</v>

3096
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:59.490
<v Speaker 2>I took half of it.</v>

3097
01:22:59.491 --> 01:23:01.950
<v Speaker 2>So I think she took like five milligrams if that.</v>

3098
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:03.390
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

3099
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.493
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

3100
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I got so paranoid.</v>

3101
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.810
<v Speaker 5>She said I couldn't sleep all night.</v>

3102
01:23:07.811 --> 01:23:08.171
<v Speaker 5>Fortunately,</v>

3103
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:11.890
<v Speaker 5>my friend took and didn't have any problem and sort of watched over me,</v>

3104
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:12.731
<v Speaker 5>but she said,</v>

3105
01:23:12.731 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 5>the worst part was it took me weeks,</v>

3106
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.340
<v Speaker 5>weeks for the anxiety to faith.</v>

3107
01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:17.980
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

3108
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:18.341
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3109
01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:18.850
<v Speaker 5>do you have,</v>

3110
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:20.260
<v Speaker 5>do you have a history of mental health problems?</v>

3111
01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:20.651
<v Speaker 5>And she said,</v>

3112
01:23:20.651 --> 01:23:20.921
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3113
01:23:20.921 --> 01:23:21.461
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

3114
01:23:21.461 --> 01:23:22.210
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

3115
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:22.571
<v Speaker 5>she said,</v>

3116
01:23:22.571 --> 01:23:23.321
<v Speaker 5>and I'd used,</v>

3117
01:23:23.321 --> 01:23:23.531
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3118
01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:25.300
<v Speaker 5>I'd smoked in college and,</v>

3119
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:26.143
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3120
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:28.420
<v Speaker 5>but this was just a totally different experience.</v>

3121
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.370
<v Speaker 5>There's a big problem with education,</v>

3122
01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.100
<v Speaker 5>a big problem with the education that edible marijuana,</v>

3123
01:23:33.101 --> 01:23:34.090
<v Speaker 5>as we talked about before,</v>

3124
01:23:34.091 --> 01:23:35.230
<v Speaker 5>I think you were in the bathroom,</v>

3125
01:23:35.231 --> 01:23:38.290
<v Speaker 5>the 11 hydroxy metabolite as it's processed by the liver,</v>

3126
01:23:38.291 --> 01:23:39.700
<v Speaker 5>it's a radically different truck,</v>

3127
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.270
<v Speaker 5>radically different and it's really a psychedelic and in a very,</v>

3128
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.920
<v Speaker 5>for me personally,</v>

3129
01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:48.700
<v Speaker 5>edible marijuana and flotation tanks,</v>

3130
01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.980
<v Speaker 5>I might as well be taking a fucking bucket of acid</v>

3131
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:54.700
<v Speaker 5>crazy God experience.</v>

3132
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:59.590
<v Speaker 5>Now I personally enjoy being paranoid and I know this sounds crazy,</v>

3133
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.080
<v Speaker 5>but I think with me it gives me an,</v>

3134
01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:07.100
<v Speaker 5>I think I live a pretty blessed life and I like,</v>

3135
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:12.190
<v Speaker 5>I liked the feeling of paranoia because it allows me to explore maybe some area</v>

3136
01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:14.840
<v Speaker 5>like maybe a specific paranoia that you have.</v>

3137
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:15.940
<v Speaker 5>It's a freak out man.</v>

3138
01:24:16.530 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 5>I think I have maybe an abundance of confidence.</v>

3139
01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:22.060
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I have too much,</v>

3140
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:22.540
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3141
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.800
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm too successful.</v>

3142
01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:28.980
<v Speaker 5>What I like about the paranoia that comes with edible marijuana is it allows me</v>

3143
01:24:29.801 --> 01:24:30.790
<v Speaker 5>to check myself.</v>

3144
01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.290
<v Speaker 5>It allows me to put myself,</v>

3145
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.440
<v Speaker 5>examine all of my behavior in the darkest recesses of my mind and my thoughts</v>

3146
01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:40.150
<v Speaker 5>and and gives me a purse.</v>

3147
01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.890
<v Speaker 5>And it makes me a nicer person might go just a little tiny,</v>

3148
01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.570
<v Speaker 5>just like the other psychedelics were thing.</v>

3149
01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:47.260
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

3150
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:49.260
<v Speaker 5>it gives you just a little knock stone,</v>

3151
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.571
<v Speaker 5>an eagle,</v>

3152
01:24:49.571 --> 01:24:49.991
<v Speaker 5>just little,</v>

3153
01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:54.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean some people use it and like at the end of the day and then you know like,</v>

3154
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.331
<v Speaker 5>like Joe said,</v>

3155
01:24:55.331 --> 01:25:00.070
<v Speaker 5>I think it makes you reflect sometimes better and more objectively.</v>

3156
01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.093
<v Speaker 5>Meaning that like,</v>

3157
01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:01.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3158
01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.850
<v Speaker 5>maybe you hadn't encountered with someone early on the day and then you know</v>

3159
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:07.120
<v Speaker 5>late at night or you toke up a bit and you're like,</v>

3160
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:07.750
<v Speaker 5>oh man,</v>

3161
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 5>I probably should have done things a little bit different.</v>

3162
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.211
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3163
01:25:10.211 --> 01:25:12.340
<v Speaker 5>like that happens to people all,</v>

3164
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:12.941
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

3165
01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:13.330
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

3166
01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:18.330
<v Speaker 5>it forces you to reflect in a different state and sometimes when you reflect in</v>

3167
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:19.510
<v Speaker 5>that state,</v>

3168
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:21.310
<v Speaker 5>you come up with thoughts that,</v>

3169
01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 5>that you just want to come up with before.</v>

3170
01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:23.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3171
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:25.570
<v Speaker 5>like my patients say to me all the time,</v>

3172
01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:29.380
<v Speaker 5>like it just kind of breaks this negative state that I have.</v>

3173
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:30.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm just able to,</v>

3174
01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:31.180
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

3175
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:31.440
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

3176
01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.760
<v Speaker 5>to break out of a negative state and think logically,</v>

3177
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:34.773
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3178
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.440
<v Speaker 5>people say that to me all the time,</v>

3179
01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.061
<v Speaker 5>but let's see.</v>

3180
01:25:37.061 --> 01:25:37.720
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

3181
01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.051
<v Speaker 5>to me,</v>

3182
01:25:38.051 --> 01:25:41.320
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about something different and it works for you,</v>

3183
01:25:41.321 --> 01:25:41.600
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3184
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Your,</v>

3185
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.210
<v Speaker 5>your paranoia is,</v>

3186
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:44.111
<v Speaker 5>it sounds more,</v>

3187
01:25:44.111 --> 01:25:45.280
<v Speaker 5>almost existential.</v>

3188
01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.050
<v Speaker 5>It's how can I be a better person?</v>

3189
01:25:47.051 --> 01:25:48.610
<v Speaker 5>What am I doing wrong in my life?</v>

3190
01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.190
<v Speaker 5>It's not my wife is poisoning me.</v>

3191
01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:51.880
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3192
01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.290
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3193
01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:53.123
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3194
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.770
<v Speaker 5>no joke.</v>

3195
01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:55.961
<v Speaker 5>This is funny.</v>

3196
01:25:55.961 --> 01:25:57.090
<v Speaker 5>And your schizophrenia,</v>

3197
01:25:57.790 --> 01:25:58.061
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3198
01:25:58.061 --> 01:25:58.301
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3199
01:25:58.301 --> 01:26:00.310
<v Speaker 5>I used to have or you know,</v>

3200
01:26:00.311 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 5>or the cops aren't going to bust through the fucking door then shoot me.</v>

3201
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:04.723
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3202
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:05.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a different thing.</v>

3203
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 4>And that's why,</v>

3204
01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:12.080
<v Speaker 4>that's why Marin marijuana drives this extreme violence in some people.</v>

3205
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:15.260
<v Speaker 4>Or those people need to get their fucking shit together when that's possible</v>

3206
01:26:15.261 --> 01:26:15.560
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

3207
01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3208
01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:16.773
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3209
01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:18.973
<v Speaker 4>they may need,</v>

3210
01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:20.630
<v Speaker 4>aliens aren't really common bro,</v>

3211
01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.690
<v Speaker 4>but they may need to be intervened before and,</v>

3212
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:25.220
<v Speaker 4>and to Joe's point though,</v>

3213
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:30.370
<v Speaker 4>they have shown in studies that if you make an intervention other outside of the</v>

3214
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:33.290
<v Speaker 4>psychotic symptoms,</v>

3215
01:26:33.291 --> 01:26:35.840
<v Speaker 4>you can actually reduce the incidents of violence.</v>

3216
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:36.741
<v Speaker 4>And also too,</v>

3217
01:26:36.741 --> 01:26:37.251
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

3218
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:37.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3219
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:41.870
<v Speaker 4>a good point I was going to mention earlier to bring up genetics because we are</v>

3220
01:26:41.871 --> 01:26:45.950
<v Speaker 4>teasing out genetics for people and we are discovering that certain people do</v>

3221
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:50.951
<v Speaker 4>have certain genetics that do predispose them to certain cannabis disorders.</v>

3222
01:26:51.261 --> 01:26:51.501
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3223
01:26:51.501 --> 01:26:51.990
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3224
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3225
01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm involved with,</v>

3226
01:26:54.111 --> 01:26:54.231
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

3227
01:26:54.231 --> 01:26:56.900
<v Speaker 4>with the company that's doing that right now and we're trying to create,</v>

3228
01:26:57.150 --> 01:26:57.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3229
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:59.360
<v Speaker 4>cannabis genetic tests for people.</v>

3230
01:26:59.540 --> 01:26:59.751
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3231
01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:03.650
<v Speaker 4>And there's three genes that we've identified so far,</v>

3232
01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3233
01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:09.050
<v Speaker 4>one of them is that Amy p k 14 geno type and that has been shown to be</v>

3234
01:27:09.051 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 4>associated with,</v>

3235
01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:10.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3236
01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:10.810
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3237
01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:11.320
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3238
01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.120
<v Speaker 4>a deficit and brain volume when you do use cannabis.</v>

3239
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:15.590
<v Speaker 4>And then there's two other genes,</v>

3240
01:27:15.591 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 4>the akt one and the ca d and M to Geno type.</v>

3241
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:19.851
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3242
01:27:19.851 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 4>both of those have also been shown to be associated with cannabis.</v>

3243
01:27:23.211 --> 01:27:24.044
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

3244
01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:24.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3245
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.760
<v Speaker 4>how many people have them?</v>

3246
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3247
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:30.260
<v Speaker 4>BMAP K 14 it's roughly about 8% is what we're seeing.</v>

3248
01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:34.940
<v Speaker 4>The akt one is around 4% and the ca DM two is around,</v>

3249
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:35.960
<v Speaker 4>is around 5%.</v>

3250
01:27:35.961 --> 01:27:39.380
<v Speaker 4>So there's so many that up that's almost 20% of the population,</v>

3251
01:27:39.381 --> 01:27:39.710
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3252
01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:40.100
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3253
01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:40.933
<v Speaker 4>but we're seeing,</v>

3254
01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.650
<v Speaker 4>but if we can identify,</v>

3255
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:43.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3256
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.910
<v Speaker 4>I love that stuff lines me.</v>

3257
01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:45.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3258
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:46.620
<v Speaker 4>it's wicked.</v>

3259
01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3260
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:49.490
<v Speaker 4>so if we can identify,</v>

3261
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:49.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3262
01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.190
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3263
01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:51.860
<v Speaker 4>the people who are at risk,</v>

3264
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 4>then we can maybe potentially,</v>

3265
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3266
01:27:54.711 --> 01:27:59.270
<v Speaker 4>you use the medicine in a way where only the people who don't have these</v>

3267
01:27:59.271 --> 01:28:00.740
<v Speaker 4>genetics are using the medicine.</v>

3268
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:01.430
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

3269
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3270
01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 4>for the people who do have these genetics,</v>

3271
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:04.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3272
01:28:04.401 --> 01:28:06.560
<v Speaker 4>they stick mostly to CBD.</v>

3273
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I just think you know,</v>

3274
01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.130
<v Speaker 4>that that's a better approach then,</v>

3275
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:10.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3276
01:28:10.521 --> 01:28:11.030
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

3277
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:13.670
<v Speaker 4>just kind of prohibiting cannabis are saying that,</v>

3278
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:14.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3279
01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:14.720
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't,</v>

3280
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.740
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't use it at all,</v>

3281
01:28:15.741 --> 01:28:17.570
<v Speaker 4>are saying that it's not medicine.</v>

3282
01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that it should be held to the same standard as any other medicine.</v>

3283
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:25.400
<v Speaker 4>And I think that if we had an incredible medicine that worked for some people</v>

3284
01:28:25.401 --> 01:28:28.970
<v Speaker 4>and that didn't work for others than what we would do is we would try to figure</v>

3285
01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:29.804
<v Speaker 4>out why.</v>

3286
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:30.703
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3287
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:31.760
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing that.</v>

3288
01:28:31.761 --> 01:28:33.020
<v Speaker 4>My companies have been doing that.</v>

3289
01:28:33.021 --> 01:28:34.070
<v Speaker 4>It's called a net life.</v>

3290
01:28:34.071 --> 01:28:34.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3291
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:35.241
<v Speaker 4>full disclosure,</v>

3292
01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:36.320
<v Speaker 4>I am on the board,</v>

3293
01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:36.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3294
01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.200
<v Speaker 4>and that life t.com and you know,</v>

3295
01:28:39.330 --> 01:28:40.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3296
01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.080
<v Speaker 4>and when we use these different,</v>

3297
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:43.730
<v Speaker 4>these different strategies,</v>

3298
01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:46.310
<v Speaker 4>then we can actually reduce the overall harm.</v>

3299
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:50.030
<v Speaker 4>And that should be another thing that we can add into the mix because for sure</v>

3300
01:28:50.031 --> 01:28:53.560
<v Speaker 4>there's people who are definitely more predisposed to mental illness and</v>

3301
01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:55.610
<v Speaker 4>definitely more predisposed to,</v>

3302
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:57.080
<v Speaker 4>to a psychosis.</v>

3303
01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:57.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3304
01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:57.860
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

3305
01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.540
<v Speaker 4>there do seem to be some people who just,</v>

3306
01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.010
<v Speaker 4>it breaks really.</v>

3307
01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not sure</v>

3308
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.370
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

3309
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:02.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3310
01:29:02.611 --> 01:29:02.851
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3311
01:29:02.851 --> 01:29:04.080
<v Speaker 2>it's probably genetic.</v>

3312
01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3313
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:04.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3314
01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's you,</v>

3315
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:07.770
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned,</v>

3316
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3317
01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:08.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3318
01:29:08.881 --> 01:29:09.451
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3319
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:10.320
<v Speaker 2>your friend who's,</v>

3320
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3321
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:12.090
<v Speaker 2>who's child has autism and,</v>

3322
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.781
<v Speaker 2>and you said,</v>

3323
01:29:12.781 --> 01:29:13.051
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3324
01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:13.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3325
01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:13.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3326
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:14.431
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>

3327
01:29:14.431 --> 01:29:15.210
<v Speaker 2>if that were my child,</v>

3328
01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:17.520
<v Speaker 2>of course I would want to do anything possible.</v>

3329
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.980
<v Speaker 2>But I have to tell you in the last month since the book came out,</v>

3330
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the other side of this.</v>

3331
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3332
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I've heard from so many parents whose children and in many cases,</v>

3333
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:28.560
<v Speaker 2>high functioning children,</v>

3334
01:29:28.561 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 2>college graduates.</v>

3335
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:29.941
<v Speaker 2>Because by the way,</v>

3336
01:29:29.941 --> 01:29:30.940
<v Speaker 2>those are the people you know,</v>

3337
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.510
<v Speaker 2>read the book or heard about the book.</v>

3338
01:29:32.511 --> 01:29:32.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3339
01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:35.970
<v Speaker 2>and who have the resources to stay involved with their kids when they have these</v>

3340
01:29:35.971 --> 01:29:36.804
<v Speaker 2>terrible breaks.</v>

3341
01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

3342
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:37.870
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

3343
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 2>who've gone completely off the rails.</v>

3344
01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:42.360
<v Speaker 2>And the worst story that I've heard so far,</v>

3345
01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:43.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3346
01:29:43.230 --> 01:29:47.580
<v Speaker 2>came from a woman in Connecticut whose son graduated from high referred,</v>

3347
01:29:47.581 --> 01:29:47.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3348
01:29:47.791 --> 01:29:50.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a college in the east and um,</v>

3349
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3350
01:29:51.031 --> 01:29:52.650
<v Speaker 2>sounds like a really good guy.</v>

3351
01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:53.483
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to,</v>

3352
01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

3353
01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:54.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3354
01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 2>teach disadvantaged kids.</v>

3355
01:29:55.771 --> 01:29:59.310
<v Speaker 2>He had a girlfriend who was going to met or it was a premed trying to go to med</v>

3356
01:29:59.311 --> 01:29:59.820
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

3357
01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:03.330
<v Speaker 2>They moved to New Mexico and for some reason the guy decided to start smoking.</v>

3358
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.140
<v Speaker 2>And this was 2012 and within a few months he lost everything.</v>

3359
01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3360
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:09.090
<v Speaker 2>The girlfriend had left,</v>

3361
01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.050
<v Speaker 2>he lost his job.</v>

3362
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.000
<v Speaker 2>He had his first inpatient hospitalization.</v>

3363
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a family with money.</v>

3364
01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:13.951
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3365
01:30:13.951 --> 01:30:15.570
<v Speaker 2>this is Connecticut's a bourbon.</v>

3366
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3367
01:30:16.590 --> 01:30:21.590
<v Speaker 2>and they have spent the last six years trying to save their son and they have</v>

3368
01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:22.681
<v Speaker 2>failed that.</v>

3369
01:30:22.681 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 2>She told me that they've spent more than half a million dollars.</v>

3370
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:27.510
<v Speaker 2>He was hospitalized at Harvard,</v>

3371
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:27.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3372
01:30:27.991 --> 01:30:28.141
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3373
01:30:28.141 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Speaker 2>he had the best treatment.</v>

3374
01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:32.370
<v Speaker 2>None of it's made a difference to him and what is sort of the symptoms.</v>

3375
01:30:32.371 --> 01:30:32.700
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3376
01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.001
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3377
01:30:33.001 --> 01:30:33.570
<v Speaker 2>so he's,</v>

3378
01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:37.020
<v Speaker 2>he's completely schizophrenia now and he's completely paranoid and he believes,</v>

3379
01:30:37.021 --> 01:30:37.670
<v Speaker 2>and this is the,</v>

3380
01:30:37.670 --> 01:30:38.190
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>

3381
01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:38.490
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>

3382
01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:38.940
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

3383
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.230
<v Speaker 2>his girlfriend is long gone,</v>

3384
01:30:40.231 --> 01:30:41.280
<v Speaker 2>but she's tried CBD.</v>

3385
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:42.663
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3386
01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

3387
01:30:43.741 --> 01:30:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I think he's continued to use cannabis.</v>

3388
01:30:45.661 --> 01:30:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's used CBD,</v>

3389
01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:47.700
<v Speaker 2>but let me,</v>

3390
01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.800
<v Speaker 2>let me just tell you where he is now.</v>

3391
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3392
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:53.190
<v Speaker 2>So he's one of these guys who has a really bad delusion.</v>

3393
01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:57.030
<v Speaker 2>His delusion is that his girlfriend has died and been replaced by a robot.</v>

3394
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's the kind of delusion that leads you to kill people.</v>

3395
01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:00.923
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3396
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:04.080
<v Speaker 2>and so this guy has been now hospital as 17 times.</v>

3397
01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.060
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3398
01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:05.850
<v Speaker 2>he's gone.</v>

3399
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:06.091
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3400
01:31:06.091 --> 01:31:07.530
<v Speaker 2>he's on the streets of Houston.</v>

3401
01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:09.030
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't know where he is.</v>

3402
01:31:09.031 --> 01:31:09.571
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you,</v>

3403
01:31:09.571 --> 01:31:09.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the one I'm not familiar.</v>

3408
01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.100

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:16.711
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3414
01:31:16.711 --> 01:31:16.831

<v Speaker 2>Beautiful boy is the,</v>

3416
01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.730
<v Speaker 2>is a book that came out I think a couple of years ago and got turned into a</v>

3417
01:31:20.731 --> 01:31:21.300
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

3418
01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.730
<v Speaker 2>You should have him on a nic Sheff and David Sheff,</v>

3419
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:24.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3420
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:29.060
<v Speaker 2>father and son and the son became a meth addict and essentially almost died.</v>

3421
01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.200

3425
01:31:35.011 --> 01:31:37.920
<v Speaker 2>and within a couple of years it had all gone completely downhill for him.</v>

3426
01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3427

01:31:50.281 --> 01:31:52.440
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing is your,</v>

3443
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.610
<v Speaker 2>your child becomes an opioid addict and you wait for the call that he overdosed</v>

3444
01:31:56.611 --> 01:31:57.270
<v Speaker 2>and died.</v>

3445
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:59.010
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that that's the second worst.</v>

3446
01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:02.110
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing that can happen is your son,</v>

3447
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>the college graduate,</v>

3448
01:32:04.090 --> 01:32:05.200
<v Speaker 2>the want to be,</v>

3449
01:32:05.201 --> 01:32:10.000
<v Speaker 2>do good or becomes a schizophrenia living on the streets and then you're waiting</v>

3450
01:32:10.001 --> 01:32:12.910
<v Speaker 2>for the call that he killed himself or he killed somebody else.</v>

3451
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:13.953
<v Speaker 2>And so my,</v>

3452
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:14.260
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3453
01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:14.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3454
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:15.410
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3455
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:17.860
<v Speaker 2>my view of this is in a couple more years probably,</v>

3456
01:32:17.861 --> 01:32:18.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3457
01:32:18.101 --> 01:32:20.110
<v Speaker 2>this book has taken over my life obviously,</v>

3458
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:22.840
<v Speaker 2>but in a couple of years I'm going to be back to writing novels.</v>

3459
01:32:22.841 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be,</v>

3460
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:23.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3461
01:32:23.461 --> 01:32:23.741
<v Speaker 2>I'll still,</v>

3462
01:32:23.741 --> 01:32:25.030
<v Speaker 2>but this will still be part of my life.</v>

3463
01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.110
<v Speaker 2>But this woman,</v>

3464
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.100
<v Speaker 2>these parents,</v>

3465
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:31.210
<v Speaker 2>they are going to spend their lives trying to destroy the cannabis industry and</v>

3466
01:32:31.211 --> 01:32:32.044
<v Speaker 2>that is real.</v>

3467
01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:32.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3468
01:32:32.730 --> 01:32:33.421
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3469
01:32:33.421 --> 01:32:33.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3470
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:36.090
<v Speaker 5>that would be a foolish thing to do.</v>

3471
01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:36.630
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3472
01:32:36.630 --> 01:32:40.620
<v Speaker 5>but I think there is a real possibility that some people who have a tendency to</v>

3473
01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.900
<v Speaker 5>schizophrenia could be triggered by cannabis.</v>

3474
01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:43.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3475
01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.360
<v Speaker 5>there's no need to know Ashton about that,</v>

3476
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:48.360
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's also possible that guy would've gotten schizophrenia anyway.</v>

3477
01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:48.961
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

3478
01:32:48.961 --> 01:32:49.651
<v Speaker 5>it's possible.</v>

3479
01:32:49.651 --> 01:32:52.880
<v Speaker 5>But he was sort of at the outer edge of the window and he had no other,</v>

3480
01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:55.830
<v Speaker 5>the other edge of the window and watch for boys.</v>

3481
01:32:55.831 --> 01:33:00.390
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of 17 to 2124 was he showing any issues before it all according to</v>

3482
01:33:00.391 --> 01:33:00.541
<v Speaker 5>her?</v>

3483
01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:01.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is from her,</v>

3484
01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.393
<v Speaker 5>so she's the mother,</v>

3485
01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:05.070
<v Speaker 5>but I'm sure she'd be the one who knows the most.</v>

3486
01:33:05.071 --> 01:33:06.300
<v Speaker 5>There are people though too,</v>

3487
01:33:06.301 --> 01:33:10.700
<v Speaker 5>who just kind of have a decline with or without cannabis and you do here.</v>

3488
01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's schizophrenia just to break up.</v>

3489
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:15.010
<v Speaker 5>They just can't handle life.</v>

3490
01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:16.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3491
01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:17.490
<v Speaker 5>I know people,</v>

3492
01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.570
<v Speaker 5>you know that we've gotten a medical and stuff,</v>

3493
01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:23.490
<v Speaker 5>have gone to medical school and then one semester they just can't handle the</v>

3494
01:33:23.491 --> 01:33:26.250
<v Speaker 5>course load and then their life just goes to shit.</v>

3495
01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:28.320
<v Speaker 5>They drop out of school.</v>

3496
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:29.970
<v Speaker 5>No one ever hears from them again.</v>

3497
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.880
<v Speaker 5>They don't read,</v>

3498
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3499
01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:31.770
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>

3500
01:33:31.770 --> 01:33:32.940
<v Speaker 5>get back into school.</v>

3501
01:33:33.090 --> 01:33:33.630
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

3502
01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:34.060
<v Speaker 5>But that,</v>

3503
01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.730
<v Speaker 5>that does happen all the time.</v>

3504
01:33:35.731 --> 01:33:38.310
<v Speaker 5>That speaks to the fragility of the human mind.</v>

3505
01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:39.693
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3506
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.850
<v Speaker 5>it's a terrible,</v>

3507
01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:42.683
<v Speaker 5>it is to have,</v>

3508
01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:46.410
<v Speaker 5>it has and it affects a certain percentage of the population regardless of</v>

3509
01:33:46.411 --> 01:33:47.244
<v Speaker 5>cannabis use.</v>

3510
01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.060
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3511
01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.490
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people out there that have schizophrenia that I've never used</v>

3512
01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:54.690
<v Speaker 5>cannabis ever and they've gone completely off off the edge.</v>

3513
01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:55.800
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3514
01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:58.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you can necessarily blame cannabis for that.</v>

3515
01:33:58.890 --> 01:33:59.340
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3516
01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:02.970
<v Speaker 5>and it would be really interesting to find out if there was some form of a</v>

3517
01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:03.570
<v Speaker 5>treatment,</v>

3518
01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:05.910
<v Speaker 5>like you were saying with CBD that uh,</v>

3519
01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:10.940
<v Speaker 5>could counteract that or it has been shown in early stage studies to have some</v>

3520
01:34:11.581 --> 01:34:13.140
<v Speaker 5>moderate impact on psychosis.</v>

3521
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't think from the,</v>

3522
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:17.970
<v Speaker 5>the numbers that I've seen suggest it really isn't that strong as an anti</v>

3523
01:34:17.971 --> 01:34:18.391
<v Speaker 5>psychotic.</v>

3524
01:34:18.391 --> 01:34:22.590
<v Speaker 5>But I do think that if I were a researcher and schizophrenia,</v>

3525
01:34:22.591 --> 01:34:24.660
<v Speaker 5>I would be looking at the endocannabinoid system.</v>

3526
01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:24.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3527
01:34:24.881 --> 01:34:26.100
<v Speaker 5>you have to look at this.</v>

3528
01:34:26.101 --> 01:34:26.341
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

3529
01:34:26.341 --> 01:34:29.490
<v Speaker 5>I look at it from a clinical perspective.</v>

3530
01:34:29.491 --> 01:34:32.940
<v Speaker 5>Like the Anti psychotics that we have out there are not good,</v>

3531
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.810
<v Speaker 5>terrible.</v>

3532
01:34:33.810 --> 01:34:38.540
<v Speaker 5>They have terrible side effects and most of them do have some initial benefit</v>

3533
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.571
<v Speaker 5>benefit.</v>

3534
01:34:39.571 --> 01:34:40.770
<v Speaker 5>But after two to three years,</v>

3535
01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:42.600
<v Speaker 5>it was almost no benefit one way.</v>

3536
01:34:42.601 --> 01:34:43.370
<v Speaker 5>And they have a,</v>

3537
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:44.203
<v Speaker 5>as you said,</v>

3538
01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:45.810
<v Speaker 5>really bad side effects,</v>

3539
01:34:45.811 --> 01:34:46.470
<v Speaker 5>weight gain,</v>

3540
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:47.610
<v Speaker 5>metabolic disturbances,</v>

3541
01:34:47.611 --> 01:34:49.270
<v Speaker 5>like people want to get off of them.</v>

3542
01:34:49.271 --> 01:34:54.120
<v Speaker 5>So if you have something like CBD that doesn't have any of those side effects,</v>

3543
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:55.680
<v Speaker 5>of course as a clinician,</v>

3544
01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:56.760
<v Speaker 5>you're going to want to try it,</v>

3545
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:57.171
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3546
01:34:57.171 --> 01:34:58.004
<v Speaker 5>Because you know that</v>

3547
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 4>the other tools that you have are not really that effective.</v>

3548
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:01.041
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3549
01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:01.550
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3550
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3551
01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:02.600
<v Speaker 4>CBD can,</v>

3552
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:02.830
<v Speaker 4>should,</v>

3553
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:03.860
<v Speaker 4>should definitely be,</v>

3554
01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:04.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3555
01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:04.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3556
01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:05.690
<v Speaker 4>utilize for people who have,</v>

3557
01:35:05.691 --> 01:35:07.280
<v Speaker 4>who have psychosis and schizophrenia.</v>

3558
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3559
01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:07.940
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3560
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:08.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3561
01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.100
<v Speaker 4>we talked about life changes,</v>

3562
01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:12.980
<v Speaker 4>like things that happen badly and you live losing your job,</v>

3563
01:35:12.981 --> 01:35:14.180
<v Speaker 4>losing your girlfriend.</v>

3564
01:35:14.181 --> 01:35:14.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3565
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:15.980
<v Speaker 4>deaths in the family can,</v>

3566
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.970
<v Speaker 4>can trigger these breaks,</v>

3567
01:35:16.971 --> 01:35:17.804
<v Speaker 4>but some folks,</v>

3568
01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.730
<v Speaker 4>but psychedelic drugs can as well.</v>

3569
01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:19.941
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3570
01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Speaker 4>it's a fact for some people.</v>

3571
01:35:21.501 --> 01:35:24.650
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelic drugs have tremendous benefits for PTSD.</v>

3572
01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3573
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:26.300
<v Speaker 4>quitting alcohol.</v>

3574
01:35:26.301 --> 01:35:29.930
<v Speaker 4>Quitting a hard drugs is a lot of people that have used mushrooms.</v>

3575
01:35:29.931 --> 01:35:34.310
<v Speaker 4>Mtma for PTSD is a huge thing that maps is studying right now.</v>

3576
01:35:34.670 --> 01:35:39.140
<v Speaker 4>But you can't deny that there's other people and well documented that have taken</v>

3577
01:35:39.141 --> 01:35:39.831
<v Speaker 4>LSD,</v>

3578
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:44.300
<v Speaker 4>that have taken psilocybin and taking them in large doses and then gone and</v>

3579
01:35:44.301 --> 01:35:45.134
<v Speaker 4>never recovered.</v>

3580
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:46.700
<v Speaker 4>And that's why too,</v>

3581
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:47.720
<v Speaker 4>I forget who it was.</v>

3582
01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:48.351
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was,</v>

3583
01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:48.740
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3584
01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:49.790
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna who is on,</v>

3585
01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:51.410
<v Speaker 4>and you guys were saying that like,</v>

3586
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:52.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3587
01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:53.330
<v Speaker 4>we need to use,</v>

3588
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3589
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:54.770
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic medicines,</v>

3590
01:35:54.771 --> 01:35:56.780
<v Speaker 4>but we need to use them properly.</v>

3591
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:58.910
<v Speaker 4>And that's the same way with,</v>

3592
01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:59.241
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

3593
01:35:59.241 --> 01:35:59.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3594
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.560
<v Speaker 4>with cannabis as well.</v>

3595
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:02.520
<v Speaker 4>I considered cannabis a psychedelic,</v>

3596
01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:03.680
<v Speaker 4>particularly when you eat it.</v>

3597
01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely it is,</v>

3598
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.920
<v Speaker 4>it is a mild psychedelic and you know,</v>

3599
01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:07.181
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3600
01:36:07.181 --> 01:36:08.720
<v Speaker 4>so there's risks and benefits to that.</v>

3601
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:09.111
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3602
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:12.200
<v Speaker 4>we need to tease out the rest and tease out the benefits and making sure that</v>

3603
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:13.363
<v Speaker 4>people are,</v>

3604
01:36:13.410 --> 01:36:13.790
<v Speaker 4>we make,</v>

3605
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:14.241
<v Speaker 4>but Alex,</v>

3606
01:36:14.241 --> 01:36:17.510
<v Speaker 4>we need to make sure that people are informed and they get the entire picture.</v>

3607
01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:17.901
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3608
01:36:17.901 --> 01:36:18.410
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3609
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:19.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3610
01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 4>does your book have some truth in it?</v>

3611
01:36:21.141 --> 01:36:21.471
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3612
01:36:21.471 --> 01:36:22.310
<v Speaker 4>of course it does.</v>

3613
01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:23.930
<v Speaker 4>But does it tell the whole truth?</v>

3614
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:25.100
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely not.</v>

3615
01:36:25.101 --> 01:36:25.341
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3616
01:36:25.341 --> 01:36:26.540
<v Speaker 4>And that's the message that,</v>

3617
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3618
01:36:26.961 --> 01:36:28.280
<v Speaker 4>I think people should be hearing,</v>

3619
01:36:28.281 --> 01:36:30.740
<v Speaker 4>people shouldn't be hearing just part of the truth.</v>

3620
01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 4>They should be hearing the whole truth.</v>

3621
01:36:32.031 --> 01:36:32.720
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

3622
01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3623
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.861
<v Speaker 4>like in your book,</v>

3624
01:36:33.861 --> 01:36:34.694
<v Speaker 4>like you compared,</v>

3625
01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:35.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3626
01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:35.330
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3627
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:37.100
<v Speaker 4>the met Mexico and in India,</v>

3628
01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3629
01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:38.450
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3630
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:39.141
<v Speaker 4>I talked to,</v>

3631
01:36:39.141 --> 01:36:41.600
<v Speaker 4>to German Lopez on the phone about this and you know,</v>

3632
01:36:41.601 --> 01:36:43.100
<v Speaker 4>who talked to Isaac Cam shows,</v>

3633
01:36:43.101 --> 01:36:43.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3634
01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:44.473
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

3635
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3636
01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:46.460
<v Speaker 4>so Isaac came post,</v>

3637
01:36:46.461 --> 01:36:46.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3638
01:36:46.641 --> 01:36:47.480
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy who,</v>

3639
01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:48.493
<v Speaker 4>who basically,</v>

3640
01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:49.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3641
01:36:49.050 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 4>it was told the story of how,</v>

3642
01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.530
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3643
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:52.610
<v Speaker 4>how in Mexico,</v>

3644
01:36:52.730 --> 01:36:52.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3645
01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:53.960
<v Speaker 4>people were blaming,</v>

3646
01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:54.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3647
01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:55.440
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>

3648
01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.480
<v Speaker 4>People were blaming,</v>

3649
01:36:56.670 --> 01:36:57.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3650
01:36:57.490 --> 01:37:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Ma marijuana on causing psychosis during kind of like the early 19 hundreds.</v>

3651
01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:02.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3652
01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:05.570
<v Speaker 4>and then there was some evidence as well in India at that time.</v>

3653
01:37:05.571 --> 01:37:06.950
<v Speaker 4>So I was kind of made the connection,</v>

3654
01:37:06.951 --> 01:37:07.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3655
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:08.900
<v Speaker 4>9,000 miles apart.</v>

3656
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.360
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3657
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.180
<v Speaker 4>they're both saying the same thing,</v>

3658
01:37:11.181 --> 01:37:12.020
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3659
01:37:12.021 --> 01:37:12.890
<v Speaker 4>he said that,</v>

3660
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:13.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3661
01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:15.620
<v Speaker 4>you did misinterpret the evidence on it.</v>

3662
01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:15.861
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3663
01:37:15.861 --> 01:37:16.051
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3664
01:37:16.051 --> 01:37:17.560
<v Speaker 4>and in German told me that on the,</v>

3665
01:37:17.561 --> 01:37:18.770
<v Speaker 4>on the phone and I mean,</v>

3666
01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.040
<v Speaker 4>all the cannabis that was used in Mexico at that time was in,</v>

3667
01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:22.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3668
01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:24.290
<v Speaker 4>really marginalized environments.</v>

3669
01:37:24.291 --> 01:37:25.124
<v Speaker 4>And then when you look at,</v>

3670
01:37:25.330 --> 01:37:25.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3671
01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:26.720
<v Speaker 4>the India study,</v>

3672
01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:27.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3673
01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:28.010
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3674
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:30.530
<v Speaker 4>and I know that you addressed this in your book out because I did read your</v>

3675
01:37:30.531 --> 01:37:30.761
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>

3676
01:37:30.761 --> 01:37:32.630
<v Speaker 4>so I bought your book.</v>

3677
01:37:32.631 --> 01:37:32.931
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3678
01:37:32.931 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3679
01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.920
<v Speaker 4>in some ways I did get support here.</v>

3680
01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:36.693
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3681
01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:37.461
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

3682
01:37:37.461 --> 01:37:37.731
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3683
01:37:37.731 --> 01:37:39.380
<v Speaker 4>I read your book and like I said,</v>

3684
01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:39.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3685
01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:42.990
<v Speaker 4>you did address in the part on India that um,</v>

3686
01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:43.340
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3687
01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:43.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3688
01:37:43.731 --> 01:37:44.331
<v Speaker 4>some of the,</v>

3689
01:37:44.331 --> 01:37:44.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3690
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.280
<v Speaker 4>report was wrong,</v>

3691
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:48.210
<v Speaker 4>but I mean the fact is that all,</v>

3692
01:37:48.211 --> 01:37:50.810
<v Speaker 4>almost a lot of those cases in India were,</v>

3693
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:54.320
<v Speaker 4>were actually attributed to alcohol or opiates or other things.</v>

3694
01:37:54.321 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 4>And then the other thing in,</v>

3695
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:56.250
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3696
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3697
01:37:56.730 --> 01:37:58.800
<v Speaker 4>in Mexico is that it was in those environments.</v>

3698
01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.220
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3699
01:37:59.220 --> 01:37:59.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3700
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:02.100
<v Speaker 4>basically what I'm kinda getting and I hear is like,</v>

3701
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:02.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3702
01:38:02.611 --> 01:38:02.791
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3703
01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:05.490
<v Speaker 4>the National Academy of Sciences and Engineering,</v>

3704
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:05.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3705
01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3706
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3707
01:38:06.751 --> 01:38:09.210
<v Speaker 4>disagree with how you interpret it,</v>

3708
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:11.910
<v Speaker 4>their findings and then these people,</v>

3709
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:14.250
<v Speaker 4>how you interpreted their fines.</v>

3710
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:15.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3711
01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 4>But Ziva is only one of the 16 members.</v>

3712
01:38:18.151 --> 01:38:18.984
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>

3713
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:20.700
<v Speaker 4>But if we asked other members,</v>

3714
01:38:20.701 --> 01:38:23.550
<v Speaker 4>I think that they would all say the same thing because Alex,</v>

3715
01:38:23.670 --> 01:38:28.670
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you be upset if someone just quoted one part of your book and then left</v>

3716
01:38:30.031 --> 01:38:31.050
<v Speaker 4>out all the other parts?</v>

3717
01:38:31.051 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3718
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:34.560
<v Speaker 4>I would think that would be a huge disservice to my work.</v>

3719
01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.830
<v Speaker 4>I would not want,</v>

3720
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:38.760
<v Speaker 4>I would not have put what they put in a ton of effort into something.</v>

3721
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:40.590
<v Speaker 4>And then for someone to only have,</v>

3722
01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:40.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3723
01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:42.990
<v Speaker 4>the judge just to pick up the part that,</v>

3724
01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:43.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3725
01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:45.720
<v Speaker 4>I pet facilities ignores nuanced,</v>

3726
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.261
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>

3727
01:38:46.261 --> 01:38:47.094
<v Speaker 4>if I'd written</v>

3728
01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.100
<v Speaker 2>the Nis,</v>

3729
01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:48.371
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3730
01:38:48.371 --> 01:38:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm reporting the NAM report and came out in 2017 and nobody had paid any</v>

3731
01:38:52.661 --> 01:38:53.261
<v Speaker 2>attention to it,</v>

3732
01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:56.860
<v Speaker 2>which nobody did and nobody did for two years and suddenly people were paying</v>

3733
01:38:56.861 --> 01:38:57.461
<v Speaker 2>attention to it.</v>

3734
01:38:57.461 --> 01:38:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pretty happy about that.</v>

3735
01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.900
<v Speaker 2>But what a,</v>

3736
01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:02.500
<v Speaker 2>what Dr. Hart is talking about is in the first chapter of the book,</v>

3737
01:39:02.501 --> 01:39:06.150
<v Speaker 2>which I guess you haven't read and I really should have a copy for it.</v>

3738
01:39:06.730 --> 01:39:07.563
<v Speaker 2>Stupid of me.</v>

3739
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:08.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3740
01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:09.910
<v Speaker 2>I've got a copy of my bag</v>

3741
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:14.010
<v Speaker 2>so it's marked off.</v>

3742
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:16.583
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3743
01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.550
<v Speaker 2>so this is fascinating to me.</v>

3744
01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:19.860
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3745
01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:20.710
<v Speaker 2>the British,</v>

3746
01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:21.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3747
01:39:21.011 --> 01:39:25.090
<v Speaker 2>they colonized India and they set up what they called lunatic asylum was really</v>

3748
01:39:25.091 --> 01:39:26.190
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric hospitals,</v>

3749
01:39:26.191 --> 01:39:28.030
<v Speaker 2>sort of very primitive psychiatric hospitals.</v>

3750
01:39:28.031 --> 01:39:31.780
<v Speaker 2>And they were really initially for soldiers in the Indian army and they were run</v>

3751
01:39:31.781 --> 01:39:32.890
<v Speaker 2>by British doctors.</v>

3752
01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.840
<v Speaker 2>And what these doctors really as early as like the lead 1850s and sixties</v>

3753
01:39:37.841 --> 01:39:41.620
<v Speaker 2>noticed was that a lot of the people who showed up in these hospitals were</v>

3754
01:39:41.621 --> 01:39:42.730
<v Speaker 2>showing up with candidate.</v>

3755
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:46.840
<v Speaker 2>What they called Ganja actually in India is called Ganja or Bong,</v>

3756
01:39:46.930 --> 01:39:49.050
<v Speaker 2>which is a very weak preparation of a,</v>

3757
01:39:49.051 --> 01:39:49.480
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3758
01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:50.960
<v Speaker 2>of basically uh,</v>

3759
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:52.143
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3760
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:53.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3761
01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Indian hemp,</v>

3762
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:55.390
<v Speaker 2>just sort of low grade cannabis.</v>

3763
01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3764
01:39:56.410 --> 01:39:57.220
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

3765
01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:01.780
<v Speaker 2>and so they started counting and they realized the 20 to 30% of the people who</v>

3766
01:40:01.781 --> 01:40:05.260
<v Speaker 2>were coming to asylums were heavy cannabis users.</v>

3767
01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:07.180
<v Speaker 2>And that was way more than alcohol.</v>

3768
01:40:07.181 --> 01:40:08.014
<v Speaker 2>It's more than opium.</v>

3769
01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:09.790
<v Speaker 2>And it's really fascinating.</v>

3770
01:40:09.791 --> 01:40:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Doctor named George Francis.</v>

3771
01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:16.420
<v Speaker 2>William Ewans wrote a book in 1908 and he looked at the evidence and,</v>

3772
01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:20.020
<v Speaker 2>and it is amazing to hear how he described schizophrenia,</v>

3773
01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:21.490
<v Speaker 2>how he describes cannabis,</v>

3774
01:40:21.491 --> 01:40:23.950
<v Speaker 2>how he describes the cases of violence around cannabis.</v>

3775
01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.053
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3776
01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like any psychiatrist today.</v>

3777
01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Certainly any forensic psychiatrists like my wife would,</v>

3778
01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.420
<v Speaker 2>would like,</v>

3779
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:34.180
<v Speaker 2>everything in the book would ring completely true.</v>

3780
01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:38.410
<v Speaker 2>And it was so fascinating to me to stumble on this and realize this is something</v>

3781
01:40:38.411 --> 01:40:40.780
<v Speaker 2>people have been talking about for more than a hundred years.</v>

3782
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3783
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:43.630
<v Speaker 2>So could we,</v>

3784
01:40:43.770 --> 01:40:43.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3785
01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:48.910
<v Speaker 4>agreed that there are some people where cannabis is not a good idea.</v>

3786
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:49.833
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

3787
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:50.590
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3788
01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:52.580
<v Speaker 4>We can agree that I think we all agree.</v>

3789
01:40:52.810 --> 01:40:53.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3790
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 4>we're also</v>

3791
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.750
<v Speaker 6>agree that some people can't eat peanuts.</v>

3792
01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:56.981
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

3793
01:40:56.981 --> 01:40:57.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3794
01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:57.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3795
01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:58.330
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3796
01:40:58.330 --> 01:41:00.050
<v Speaker 6>And it's not the same thing though,</v>

3797
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:00.751
<v Speaker 6>but yet,</v>

3798
01:41:00.751 --> 01:41:02.110
<v Speaker 6>you know why peanuts kill you?</v>

3799
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:03.160
<v Speaker 6>That's w yeah,</v>

3800
01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.120
<v Speaker 6>it's more dangerous.</v>

3801
01:41:04.410 --> 01:41:07.510
<v Speaker 6>So these 600 a year people die from peanuts.</v>

3802
01:41:07.511 --> 01:41:11.200
<v Speaker 6>So I think more people die from cannabis as a result of that homicide and the</v>

3803
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:11.770
<v Speaker 6>suicide.</v>

3804
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:12.220
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3805
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:12.461
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3806
01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 6>there's no correlation.</v>

3807
01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:17.150
<v Speaker 6>There's no paper that they know somebody has got to do the work.</v>

3808
01:41:17.151 --> 01:41:17.620
<v Speaker 6>Blame a minute.</v>

3809
01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:18.790
<v Speaker 6>But why are you saying that then?</v>

3810
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:21.610
<v Speaker 6>Because I've looked at enough data to tell me,</v>

3811
01:41:21.611 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 6>you think marijuana is causing homicides.</v>

3812
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.580
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3813
01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:25.690
<v Speaker 6>This is what the book is about,</v>

3814
01:41:25.691 --> 01:41:26.040
<v Speaker 6>but it didn't.</v>

3815
01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:26.850
<v Speaker 6>How so?</v>

3816
01:41:26.850 --> 01:41:27.461
<v Speaker 6>And what was,</v>

3817
01:41:27.461 --> 01:41:29.710
<v Speaker 6>it causes paranoia and psychosis in people.</v>

3818
01:41:29.711 --> 01:41:32.970
<v Speaker 6>And paranoid psychosis are huge risks for homicide and schizophrenia.</v>

3819
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:36.400
<v Speaker 6>Studies that refute that was starting.</v>

3820
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.780
<v Speaker 6>No studies that refute that.</v>

3821
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:40.030
<v Speaker 6>Paranoia and psychosis are huge risks for homicide.</v>

3822
01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:43.180
<v Speaker 6>Schizophrenia is a 20 x 20 times Joe.</v>

3823
01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:43.690
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3824
01:41:43.690 --> 01:41:44.051
<v Speaker 6>Jamie,</v>

3825
01:41:44.051 --> 01:41:45.820
<v Speaker 6>I sent you a document,</v>

3826
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:46.540
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3827
01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:47.261
<v Speaker 6>yesterday.</v>

3828
01:41:47.261 --> 01:41:47.831
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's,</v>

3829
01:41:47.831 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 6>there's multiple studies that show that,</v>

3830
01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:50.411
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3831
01:41:50.411 --> 01:41:53.860
<v Speaker 6>marijuana laws are not associated with any type of violence.</v>

3832
01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.450
<v Speaker 6>This was just talking about the drug.</v>

3833
01:41:58.690 --> 01:41:59.770
<v Speaker 6>So the use of the drug,</v>

3834
01:41:59.771 --> 01:42:01.720
<v Speaker 6>which could possibly trigger psychosis,</v>

3835
01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:03.460
<v Speaker 6>psychosis and schizophrenia,</v>

3836
01:42:03.670 --> 01:42:05.620
<v Speaker 6>which are correlated with murder.</v>

3837
01:42:05.621 --> 01:42:06.190
<v Speaker 6>So what you're saying,</v>

3838
01:42:06.190 --> 01:42:07.390
<v Speaker 6>they're not correlated their triggers.</v>

3839
01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.740
<v Speaker 6>That's an absolute fact.</v>

3840
01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:12.820
<v Speaker 6>Triggers because of the paranoia and delusions and you think that someone's out</v>

3841
01:42:12.821 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 6>to get you and they're not absolutely.</v>

3842
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:15.121
<v Speaker 6>I mean the,</v>

3843
01:42:15.121 --> 01:42:16.090
<v Speaker 6>the out of the numbers.</v>

3844
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:16.601
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3845
01:42:16.601 --> 01:42:17.680
<v Speaker 2>So the numbers are,</v>

3846
01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:18.340
<v Speaker 2>if you are,</v>

3847
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:20.230
<v Speaker 2>if you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia,</v>

3848
01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:21.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3849
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:23.140
<v Speaker 2>you are 20 times as likely to commit.</v>

3850
01:42:23.141 --> 01:42:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Homicide is somebody who's healthy.</v>

3851
01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3852
01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:26.890
<v Speaker 2>It's actually worse than that for cannabis.</v>

3853
01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:27.131
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3854
01:42:27.131 --> 01:42:27.964
<v Speaker 2>And here's why.</v>

3855
01:42:28.230 --> 01:42:28.640
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3856
01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.810
<v Speaker 2>so the National Alliance for mental illness and the mental illness,</v>

3857
01:42:31.811 --> 01:42:32.380
<v Speaker 2>advocacy,</v>

3858
01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:34.180
<v Speaker 2>advocacy groups hate talking about this.</v>

3859
01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Why do they hate talking about it?</v>

3860
01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:35.501
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

3861
01:42:35.501 --> 01:42:37.780
<v Speaker 2>because it stigmatizes people with mental illness.</v>

3862
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.430
<v Speaker 2>So what they say,</v>

3863
01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:40.330
<v Speaker 2>and this is true,</v>

3864
01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.460
<v Speaker 2>is if you have a diagnosis,</v>

3865
01:42:42.461 --> 01:42:44.230
<v Speaker 2>but you're taking your anti psychotics,</v>

3866
01:42:44.250 --> 01:42:46.150
<v Speaker 2>even though the side effects might be unpleasant,</v>

3867
01:42:46.151 --> 01:42:46.984
<v Speaker 2>you're in treatment,</v>

3868
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:47.980
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3869
01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:48.813
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3870
01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.740
<v Speaker 2>you're not using recreational drugs.</v>

3871
01:42:51.010 --> 01:42:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Your risk for violence isn't that high.</v>

3872
01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not that much higher than a healthy person.</v>

3873
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3874
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:56.471
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3875
01:42:56.471 --> 01:42:59.140
<v Speaker 2>fortunately healthy people don't commit murder that often.</v>

3876
01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:01.330
<v Speaker 2>The problem is if you've,</v>

3877
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:03.940
<v Speaker 2>if you think about the math for half a second,</v>

3878
01:43:04.330 --> 01:43:08.320
<v Speaker 2>if there's this one group of people who don't have a very high risk for murder</v>

3879
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.790
<v Speaker 2>or serious violence,</v>

3880
01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:10.211
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

3881
01:43:10.211 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 2>because they're not using,</v>

3882
01:43:11.471 --> 01:43:12.750
<v Speaker 2>because they are on antipsychotics,</v>

3883
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:18.130
<v Speaker 2>it means that the excess risk in the people who are using and who's untrue</v>

3884
01:43:18.131 --> 01:43:19.540
<v Speaker 2>psychosis is untreated.</v>

3885
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 2>It must be spectacularly high.</v>

3886
01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.310
<v Speaker 2>And the numbers bear that out.</v>

3887
01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:25.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3888
01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:28.120
<v Speaker 2>so there's a really good study from last year,</v>

3889
01:43:28.121 --> 01:43:30.760
<v Speaker 2>2018 it's small group of patients in,</v>

3890
01:43:30.761 --> 01:43:31.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3891
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:32.103
<v Speaker 2>in Switzerland.</v>

3892
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland is a safe country as a low base crime rate,</v>

3893
01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:40.000
<v Speaker 2>but 50% of the people who were using cannabis and had psychosis over a three</v>

3894
01:43:40.001 --> 01:43:43.090
<v Speaker 2>year period committed violence in that group of people.</v>

3895
01:43:43.091 --> 01:43:44.620
<v Speaker 2>That's mostly twentysomething men.</v>

3896
01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:45.460
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3897
01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:45.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3898
01:43:45.701 --> 01:43:46.051
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

3899
01:43:46.051 --> 01:43:48.270
<v Speaker 6>there's a study here and I just sent it to uh,</v>

3900
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:49.270
<v Speaker 6>Jamie and it's,</v>

3901
01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:50.403
<v Speaker 6>it's titled,</v>

3902
01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:51.050
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3903
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 6>risk factors for</v>

3904
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.120
<v Speaker 3>violence in psychosis,</v>

3905
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 3>a systemic review and Meta analysis of 110 studies.</v>

3906
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.770
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3907
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:58.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3908
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:59.660
<v Speaker 3>that's quite a few studies.</v>

3909
01:43:59.661 --> 01:43:59.931
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3910
01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:00.590
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3911
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:01.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3912
01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:01.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3913
01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 3>let me just,</v>

3914
01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:04.040
<v Speaker 3>just read a part of it out too.</v>

3915
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:07.880
<v Speaker 3>So if violence was strongly associated with a history of polysubstance abuse,</v>

3916
01:44:07.881 --> 01:44:09.230
<v Speaker 3>strongly associated with diagnosis,</v>

3917
01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:13.610
<v Speaker 3>cooperated substance use disorder and recent substance misuse and moderately</v>

3918
01:44:13.630 --> 01:44:14.463
<v Speaker 3>associated with it,</v>

3919
01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.160
<v Speaker 3>history of alcohol misuse,</v>

3920
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:18.350
<v Speaker 3>a history of substance misuse,</v>

3921
01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:19.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3922
01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:20.720
<v Speaker 3>recent alcohol misuse,</v>

3923
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:22.100
<v Speaker 3>recent drug misuse,</v>

3924
01:44:22.101 --> 01:44:23.450
<v Speaker 3>and a history of drug abuse.</v>

3925
01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:28.660
<v Speaker 3>It was on clear if there was an association between violence and history of</v>

3926
01:44:29.001 --> 01:44:30.050
<v Speaker 3>cannabis misuse.</v>

3927
01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:31.100
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

3928
01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.620
<v Speaker 3>this is 110 studies.</v>

3929
01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3930
01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:38.780
<v Speaker 3>they very carefully looked at all of the different risk factors as to what could</v>

3931
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:39.681
<v Speaker 3>trigger violence.</v>

3932
01:44:39.681 --> 01:44:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Just let me finish aocs and what they said,</v>

3933
01:44:42.261 --> 01:44:42.890
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3934
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:47.840
<v Speaker 3>it was unclear if there was an association between violence and a history of</v>

3935
01:44:47.841 --> 01:44:48.920
<v Speaker 3>cannabis misuse.</v>

3936
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.251
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3937
01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 3>So that's 110 studies.</v>

3938
01:44:51.111 --> 01:44:55.040
<v Speaker 3>So cannabis use in there is going to get locked in with polysubstance use</v>

3939
01:44:55.530 --> 01:44:56.510
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of people will use,</v>

3940
01:44:56.511 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 3>are going to be using other drugs.</v>

3941
01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Poly substance means multiple substances,</v>

3942
01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:00.831
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

3943
01:45:00.831 --> 01:45:01.664
<v Speaker 3>cannabis,</v>

3944
01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:02.541
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3945
01:45:02.541 --> 01:45:03.080
<v Speaker 3>So on.</v>

3946
01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Everything else was found to have significant statistical significance.</v>

3947
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:08.210
<v Speaker 3>And I have not,</v>

3948
01:45:08.210 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 3>not just mine that a doctor heard assignment.</v>

3949
01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:13.730
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to look at it without looking at it.</v>

3950
01:45:13.731 --> 01:45:16.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't push back as hard as I would like.</v>

3951
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:21.940
<v Speaker 3>What I can tell you is that I have many studies in the book that show that</v>

3952
01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:26.420
<v Speaker 3>cannabis use is associated with violence in people with psychosis.</v>

3953
01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3954
01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:28.700
<v Speaker 3>And more broadly,</v>

3955
01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:32.960
<v Speaker 3>it's associated with violence in the general population in large studies,</v>

3956
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:37.880
<v Speaker 3>in studies of high school students and bullying in studies of people who were</v>

3957
01:45:37.881 --> 01:45:39.920
<v Speaker 3>vacationing in a visa in,</v>

3958
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:40.550
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3959
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:44.390
<v Speaker 3>in studies of young men in China and the UK.</v>

3960
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.290
<v Speaker 3>There are big studies out there that show cannabis use is associated with</v>

3961
01:45:48.291 --> 01:45:49.124
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

3962
01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:50.750
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3963
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:52.100
<v Speaker 6>Beazer Ibiza</v>

3964
01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.710
<v Speaker 6>and I got grilled over there for that.</v>

3965
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:01.623
<v Speaker 6>They get manager,</v>

3966
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:04.240
<v Speaker 6>I suppose to kill people just said it.</v>

3967
01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:04.571
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3968
01:46:04.571 --> 01:46:08.230
<v Speaker 6>So some dignitary or royal person had a list,</v>

3969
01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:08.681
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3970
01:46:08.681 --> 01:46:10.160
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that how it all starts at true?</v>

3971
01:46:10.210 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3972
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:11.020
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3973
01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:11.853
<v Speaker 6>I believe so.</v>

3974
01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:12.700
<v Speaker 6>Noted.</v>

3975
01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:13.001
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3976
01:46:13.001 --> 01:46:18.001
<v Speaker 6>The way the people in Spain pronounce words was directly affected by this one</v>

3977
01:46:18.251 --> 01:46:19.084
<v Speaker 6>person apparently.</v>

3978
01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:20.351
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

3979
01:46:20.351 --> 01:46:21.184
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3980
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:21.881
<v Speaker 6>so this,</v>

3981
01:46:21.881 --> 01:46:22.121
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3982
01:46:22.121 --> 01:46:22.420
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>

3983
01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.680
<v Speaker 6>this correlation,</v>

3984
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:24.760
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3985
01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:29.260
<v Speaker 6>between people that have schizophrenia and using cannabis,</v>

3986
01:46:29.770 --> 01:46:31.030
<v Speaker 6>how do you,</v>

3987
01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.810
<v Speaker 6>is is schizophrenia a diagnosis?</v>

3988
01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:36.310
<v Speaker 6>It's purely based on behavior basically.</v>

3989
01:46:36.311 --> 01:46:36.630
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3990
01:46:36.630 --> 01:46:36.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3991
01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.361
<v Speaker 6>It's a clinic.</v>

3992
01:46:37.361 --> 01:46:39.460
<v Speaker 6>There is no blood tests and do a brain scan.</v>

3993
01:46:39.490 --> 01:46:42.510
<v Speaker 6>It's basically how you behave and what you tell the doctor about how you're</v>

3994
01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:43.353
<v Speaker 6>feeling.</v>

3995
01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.300
<v Speaker 6>Charise or it's very subjective,</v>

3996
01:46:46.301 --> 01:46:48.120
<v Speaker 6>how so big because you're,</v>

3997
01:46:48.121 --> 01:46:48.670
<v Speaker 6>you're asking</v>

3998
01:46:48.670 --> 01:46:50.520
<v Speaker 4>skin someone basically a series of questions.</v>

3999
01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:50.731
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4000
01:46:50.731 --> 01:46:51.900
<v Speaker 4>it's no different than,</v>

4001
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4002
01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:54.060
<v Speaker 4>depression really.</v>

4003
01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:54.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4004
01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:54.811
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

4005
01:46:54.811 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 4>just asking someone a series of questions and then based upon that,</v>

4006
01:46:58.440 --> 01:46:58.771
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4007
01:46:58.771 --> 01:47:00.030
<v Speaker 4>which is very subjective,</v>

4008
01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to make,</v>

4009
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:01.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4010
01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:02.100
<v Speaker 4>a clinical decision.</v>

4011
01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:04.110
<v Speaker 4>Whereas when it's like a blood test,</v>

4012
01:47:04.111 --> 01:47:05.050
<v Speaker 4>like if someone you know,</v>

4013
01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:05.851
<v Speaker 4>passes,</v>

4014
01:47:05.851 --> 01:47:06.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4015
01:47:06.210 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4016
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.710
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of,</v>

4017
01:47:07.711 --> 01:47:08.910
<v Speaker 4>of hemoglobin a one C,</v>

4018
01:47:08.911 --> 01:47:09.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4019
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:10.500
<v Speaker 4>depending on which chart you're looking at,</v>

4020
01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.260
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to call that person prediabetic or diabetic.</v>

4021
01:47:13.261 --> 01:47:13.610
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4022
01:47:13.610 --> 01:47:13.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4023
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.560
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately we just don't have those objective measurements.</v>

4024
01:47:16.561 --> 01:47:17.071
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

4025
01:47:17.071 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 4>that's why,</v>

4026
01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:18.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4027
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:19.650
<v Speaker 4>Alex was saying earlier that,</v>

4028
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4029
01:47:20.610 --> 01:47:20.791
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4030
01:47:20.791 --> 01:47:21.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4031
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:21.241
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4032
01:47:21.241 --> 01:47:21.331
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4033
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:22.350
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't really figure out,</v>

4034
01:47:22.351 --> 01:47:22.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4035
01:47:22.501 --> 01:47:25.200
<v Speaker 4>how many people in the United States had had schizophrenia.</v>

4036
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 4>And I understand that,</v>

4037
01:47:26.641 --> 01:47:28.350
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time too,</v>

4038
01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:28.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4039
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:30.300
<v Speaker 4>it's okay to,</v>

4040
01:47:30.301 --> 01:47:31.170
<v Speaker 4>to adjust,</v>

4041
01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:31.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4042
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:35.880
<v Speaker 4>the way that you diagnose someone over the course of the years and you learn</v>

4043
01:47:35.881 --> 01:47:36.714
<v Speaker 4>things because,</v>

4044
01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:36.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4045
01:47:36.961 --> 01:47:41.580
<v Speaker 4>you could easily say that almost everyone has some type of mental illness.</v>

4046
01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.210
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

4047
01:47:42.210 --> 01:47:43.800
<v Speaker 4>people should understand that,</v>

4048
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4049
01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:46.830
<v Speaker 4>there's seven different basic human emotions.</v>

4050
01:47:46.831 --> 01:47:46.951
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4051
01:47:46.951 --> 01:47:47.641
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to is for,</v>

4052
01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:48.000
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4053
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:48.271
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

4054
01:47:48.271 --> 01:47:49.104
<v Speaker 4>there's anger,</v>

4055
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.033
<v Speaker 4>there's contempt,</v>

4056
01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:50.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4057
01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:51.030
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

4058
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:52.020
<v Speaker 4>there's discuss,</v>

4059
01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:52.890
<v Speaker 4>there's fear,</v>

4060
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:53.491
<v Speaker 4>sadness,</v>

4061
01:47:53.491 --> 01:47:54.360
<v Speaker 4>surprise and happiness.</v>

4062
01:47:54.361 --> 01:47:54.811
<v Speaker 4>That's seven.</v>

4063
01:47:54.811 --> 01:47:55.470
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4064
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4065
01:47:55.651 --> 01:47:57.990
<v Speaker 4>depending on which way surprise goes.</v>

4066
01:47:58.170 --> 01:47:58.471
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4067
01:47:58.471 --> 01:48:01.140
<v Speaker 4>six out of those seven are negative,</v>

4068
01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:01.411
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4069
01:48:01.411 --> 01:48:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Because we're wired to basically detect threats.</v>

4070
01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:05.430
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4071
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:06.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4072
01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:06.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4073
01:48:06.490 --> 01:48:06.650
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

4074
01:48:06.650 --> 01:48:06.800
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

4075
01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:06.971
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

4076
01:48:06.971 --> 01:48:07.681
<v Speaker 4>we're making,</v>

4077
01:48:07.681 --> 01:48:07.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4078
01:48:07.891 --> 01:48:08.071
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4079
01:48:08.071 --> 01:48:09.060
<v Speaker 4>all these diagnosis,</v>

4080
01:48:09.061 --> 01:48:11.030
<v Speaker 4>I think we have to be careful because you have,</v>

4081
01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.380
<v Speaker 4>some people are calling themselves depressed and some people are calling</v>

4082
01:48:13.381 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 4>themselves anxious when really,</v>

4083
01:48:15.091 --> 01:48:15.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4084
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:20.280
<v Speaker 4>they're just not dealing with basic human emotions that they need to understand</v>

4085
01:48:20.281 --> 01:48:21.330
<v Speaker 4>and need to deal with.</v>

4086
01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:25.230
<v Speaker 4>Like people are getting angry about being angry or like depressed about being</v>

4087
01:48:25.231 --> 01:48:26.064
<v Speaker 4>depressed.</v>

4088
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 4>Like if you feel one of these emotions just kind of sit with it and just kind of</v>

4089
01:48:29.551 --> 01:48:30.384
<v Speaker 4>reflect on it.</v>

4090
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:31.230
<v Speaker 4>And I think you know,</v>

4091
01:48:31.290 --> 01:48:32.101
<v Speaker 4>that that's a much,</v>

4092
01:48:32.101 --> 01:48:35.010
<v Speaker 4>much better way to kind of kind of tea to tease things out.</v>

4093
01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:37.560
<v Speaker 4>But you want to come back to my original point.</v>

4094
01:48:37.561 --> 01:48:38.340
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

4095
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:38.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4096
01:48:38.521 --> 01:48:41.310
<v Speaker 4>more people are understanding that um,</v>

4097
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:41.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4098
01:48:41.551 --> 01:48:45.090
<v Speaker 4>we don't just need to give out a pill for everything and that everyone shouldn't</v>

4099
01:48:45.091 --> 01:48:49.320
<v Speaker 4>just be labeled as having a mental health diagnosis because if things just keep</v>

4100
01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:50.640
<v Speaker 4>going the way they are,</v>

4101
01:48:50.850 --> 01:48:51.683
<v Speaker 4>you know what's,</v>

4102
01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.110
<v Speaker 4>by 2040 it's going to be like 50% of people are going to have like a mental</v>

4103
01:48:55.111 --> 01:48:55.830
<v Speaker 4>health disorder.</v>

4104
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:58.530
<v Speaker 4>So like people just need to understand that life is hard.</v>

4105
01:48:58.590 --> 01:48:59.820
<v Speaker 4>You got to deal with these emotions.</v>

4106
01:48:59.821 --> 01:49:01.680
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's not that big of a deal.</v>

4107
01:49:01.681 --> 01:49:03.820
<v Speaker 4>And that's why for some fun and that's what some folks,</v>

4108
01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:04.501
<v Speaker 4>for some folks,</v>

4109
01:49:04.501 --> 01:49:06.040
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I'm such a big thing of,</v>

4110
01:49:06.041 --> 01:49:08.460
<v Speaker 4>of Jordan Peterson because you know he's,</v>

4111
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:09.061
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4112
01:49:09.061 --> 01:49:10.470
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of tough on people.</v>

4113
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:11.640
<v Speaker 6>Don't let me stop.</v>

4114
01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:11.880
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

4115
01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.590
<v Speaker 6>Cause Jordan Peterson was on Ssri is for years we got,</v>

4116
01:49:16.210 --> 01:49:17.500
<v Speaker 6>it was a long,</v>

4117
01:49:17.501 --> 01:49:19.690
<v Speaker 6>long time like for a long,</v>

4118
01:49:19.691 --> 01:49:21.400
<v Speaker 6>long time as was his family.</v>

4119
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:26.720
<v Speaker 6>And what's crazy about him is what got him off is a carnivore diet elimination</v>

4120
01:49:27.131 --> 01:49:31.980
<v Speaker 6>diet where he only eats meat with salt and drinks water and the healthier than</v>

4121
01:49:31.981 --> 01:49:32.860
<v Speaker 6>he's ever been in his life.</v>

4122
01:49:33.130 --> 01:49:37.000
<v Speaker 6>And that is another massively controversial subject.</v>

4123
01:49:37.810 --> 01:49:41.740
<v Speaker 6>Let me push back a little bit cause I think people,</v>

4124
01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:42.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4125
01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:44.710
<v Speaker 6>as controversial as the book has been about,</v>

4126
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:45.120
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4127
01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.900
<v Speaker 6>about cannabis in psychosis,</v>

4128
01:49:46.901 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 6>this issue is even</v>

4129
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.030
<v Speaker 3>more controversial.</v>

4130
01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:50.380
<v Speaker 3>And obviously for,</v>

4131
01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:51.640
<v Speaker 3>for for a fair number of people,</v>

4132
01:49:51.641 --> 01:49:52.810
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really,</v>

4133
01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:54.500
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sync with the stereotype.</v>

4134
01:49:54.501 --> 01:49:55.070
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't say,</v>

4135
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:57.490
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't say with how they've experienced cannabis use.</v>

4136
01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4137
01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:58.691
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>

4138
01:49:58.691 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I think alcohol's a really interesting comparison.</v>

4139
01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:02.990
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

4140
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.823
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4141
01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm the Canadian.</v>

4142
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4143
01:50:08.210 --> 01:50:09.460
<v Speaker 3>well you have to go national.</v>

4144
01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:11.801
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about,</v>

4145
01:50:11.801 --> 01:50:13.240
<v Speaker 3>my wife's actually from new family,</v>

4146
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:17.910
<v Speaker 3>new familiar as in understand marijuana.</v>

4147
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:22.870
<v Speaker 3>A Newfoundland trained myself to say that what you're telling me I'm wrong.</v>

4148
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Liquid Jamie just pulled up.</v>

4149
01:50:24.930 --> 01:50:27.770
<v Speaker 1>While marijuana use increases violent behavior,</v>

4150
01:50:27.771 --> 01:50:32.630
<v Speaker 1>50 year study finds casual link between cannabis and subsequent violent</v>

4151
01:50:32.631 --> 01:50:33.464
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

4152
01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:38.390
<v Speaker 1>A new research published online in advance of print of the journal.</v>

4153
01:50:38.391 --> 01:50:40.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like a psychological medicine concludes.</v>

4154
01:50:40.461 --> 01:50:44.270
<v Speaker 1>The continued use of cannabis causes violent behavior as a direct result of</v>

4155
01:50:44.271 --> 01:50:47.180
<v Speaker 1>changes in brain function that are caused by smoking weed.</v>

4156
01:50:47.181 --> 01:50:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Over many years,</v>

4157
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:52.070
<v Speaker 1>researchers have long debated a possible link between the use of marijuana and</v>

4158
01:50:52.071 --> 01:50:54.230
<v Speaker 1>violent crime in contrast to alcohol,</v>

4159
01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:54.711
<v Speaker 1>meth,</v>

4160
01:50:54.711 --> 01:50:56.060
<v Speaker 1>and many other illegal drugs.</v>

4161
01:50:56.061 --> 01:51:00.110
<v Speaker 1>The metabolic effects of cannabis scene unsuited to promoting violent behavior.</v>

4162
01:51:00.111 --> 01:51:00.531
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

4163
01:51:00.531 --> 01:51:01.280
<v Speaker 1>ample,</v>

4164
01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:05.810
<v Speaker 1>ample previous research has linked marijuana use to increased violent behavior.</v>

4165
01:51:05.811 --> 01:51:10.310
<v Speaker 1>The sticky problem in such studies are that many confounding factors,</v>

4166
01:51:10.311 --> 01:51:11.390
<v Speaker 1>cofounding factors,</v>

4167
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:12.021
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4168
01:51:12.021 --> 01:51:14.530
<v Speaker 1>involved in interpreting this correlation.</v>

4169
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4170
01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:16.200
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4171
01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:16.790
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4172
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:17.420
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4173
01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:20.660
<v Speaker 1>It is very difficult to determine whether or not any statistical correlation</v>

4174
01:51:20.661 --> 01:51:22.790
<v Speaker 1>between marijuana use and violent behavior are,</v>

4175
01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:23.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4176
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:28.750
<v Speaker 1>cash causally linked or instead the two associated,</v>

4177
01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:29.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4178
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:33.710
<v Speaker 1>or instead the two are associated through some other factors such as</v>

4179
01:51:33.711 --> 01:51:35.000
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status,</v>

4180
01:51:35.001 --> 01:51:38.600
<v Speaker 1>personality traits are many other variables that are related to the propensity</v>

4181
01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:39.740
<v Speaker 1>to use marijuana.</v>

4182
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4183
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:43.140
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's a fairly good summary of,</v>

4184
01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:43.790
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

4185
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:44.623
<v Speaker 1>of the issues.</v>

4186
01:51:44.650 --> 01:51:44.961
<v Speaker 1>What's up.</v>

4187
01:51:44.961 --> 01:51:45.990
<v Speaker 1>James Study</v>

4188
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:50.990
<v Speaker 7>came from a 411 boys who were born in 1953 in London,</v>

4189
01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:54.330
<v Speaker 7>97% of which were Caucasian.</v>

4190
01:51:54.810 --> 01:51:56.880
<v Speaker 7>And all of them are raised in two parent households.</v>

4191
01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:57.690
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

4192
01:51:57.690 --> 01:51:58.251
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

4193
01:51:58.251 --> 01:52:01.590
<v Speaker 3>so those people are relatively stable if they're two family,</v>

4194
01:52:01.650 --> 01:52:03.530
<v Speaker 3>two parent households to hand parents beat to shit.</v>

4195
01:52:03.531 --> 01:52:04.280
<v Speaker 3>And Dad's also,</v>

4196
01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:04.650
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4197
01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:05.440
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>

4198
01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:05.910
<v Speaker 3>But so,</v>

4199
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:07.110
<v Speaker 3>so let me so,</v>

4200
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.780
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

4201
01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:11.610
<v Speaker 3>so I think the alcohol comparison is again a good one because anybody who's ever</v>

4202
01:52:11.611 --> 01:52:16.320
<v Speaker 3>been in a bar at 9:00 PM and gone back at 2:00 AM knows that alcohol does</v>

4203
01:52:16.321 --> 01:52:17.070
<v Speaker 3>inhibits people.</v>

4204
01:52:17.070 --> 01:52:17.461
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4205
01:52:17.461 --> 01:52:18.510
<v Speaker 3>It causes fights,</v>

4206
01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:19.240
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4207
01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:20.730
<v Speaker 3>It makes people loud.</v>

4208
01:52:20.731 --> 01:52:22.660
<v Speaker 3>It makes a lot of fucking does.</v>

4209
01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:23.913
<v Speaker 3>Does</v>

4210
01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:26.310
<v Speaker 3>it's good and bad.</v>

4211
01:52:26.730 --> 01:52:27.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's good.</v>

4212
01:52:27.661 --> 01:52:28.494
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4213
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:30.480
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it makes people,</v>

4214
01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:32.700
<v Speaker 3>it's alcohol and sex are a terrible idea.</v>

4215
01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:35.850
<v Speaker 3>It certainly causes some sexual violence.</v>

4216
01:52:35.851 --> 01:52:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4217
01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4218
01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.640
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

4219
01:52:38.730 --> 01:52:40.830
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows that you can have a drink.</v>

4220
01:52:41.010 --> 01:52:41.311
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4221
01:52:41.311 --> 01:52:43.050
<v Speaker 3>you can have a beer at the backyard barbecue,</v>

4222
01:52:43.051 --> 01:52:44.590
<v Speaker 3>you can enter.</v>

4223
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean</v>

4224
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.320
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to get in a fight and you actually might enhance your</v>

4225
01:52:48.321 --> 01:52:49.340
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

4226
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:50.420
<v Speaker 2>social lubricants,</v>

4227
01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:51.313
<v Speaker 2>all that good stuff,</v>

4228
01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>good stuff.</v>

4229
01:52:52.190 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 2>And you might even know people.</v>

4230
01:52:53.631 --> 01:52:53.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4231
01:52:53.841 --> 01:52:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I do know people who I would say have a problem with drinking.</v>

4232
01:52:56.690 --> 01:52:56.961
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4233
01:52:56.961 --> 01:53:00.050
<v Speaker 2>But it's mostly they're sitting at home drinking scotch,</v>

4234
01:53:00.051 --> 01:53:02.750
<v Speaker 2>watching baseball until they fall asleep that night.</v>

4235
01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Now that's obviously not a healthy way to use alcohol,</v>

4236
01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make them violent.</v>

4237
01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:11.600
<v Speaker 2>But we know on a population basis that alcohol causes violence.</v>

4238
01:53:11.630 --> 01:53:12.920
<v Speaker 2>It causes drunk driving,</v>

4239
01:53:12.921 --> 01:53:14.300
<v Speaker 2>it causes problems.</v>

4240
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:17.180
<v Speaker 2>And it said that in this study that I quoted earlier,</v>

4241
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:17.621
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

4242
01:53:17.621 --> 01:53:18.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4243
01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:18.980
<v Speaker 2>that alcohol,</v>

4244
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

4245
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.530
<v Speaker 2>they didn't their soy cannabis,</v>

4246
01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:22.400
<v Speaker 2>they weren't sure.</v>

4247
01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:22.611
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4248
01:53:22.611 --> 01:53:22.761
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4249
01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:23.001
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4250
01:53:23.001 --> 01:53:24.290
<v Speaker 2>But so this is again,</v>

4251
01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:27.680
<v Speaker 2>I would like to read the paper that you're quoting from because I have so much</v>

4252
01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:28.580
<v Speaker 2>other research,</v>

4253
01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:29.360
<v Speaker 2>but here's,</v>

4254
01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.890
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'm saying about cannabis.</v>

4255
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:31.753
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4256
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis for a lot of people.</v>

4257
01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:33.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4258
01:53:33.651 --> 01:53:34.700
<v Speaker 2>They can just smoke it.</v>

4259
01:53:34.701 --> 01:53:35.241
<v Speaker 2>And as people,</v>

4260
01:53:35.241 --> 01:53:35.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4261
01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:36.920
<v Speaker 2>as many people have tweeted at me,</v>

4262
01:53:36.921 --> 01:53:39.320
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I attacked was a bowl of Nachos.</v>

4263
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4264
01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:42.420
<v Speaker 2>And so and so that's true for some people,</v>

4265
01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:44.090
<v Speaker 2>but that could be sent with the alcohol as well.</v>

4266
01:53:44.091 --> 01:53:45.520
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly logical variable.</v>

4267
01:53:45.521 --> 01:53:47.420
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many studies that say that,</v>

4268
01:53:47.490 --> 01:53:50.040
<v Speaker 2>that the cannabis laws have actually decreased crime.</v>

4269
01:53:50.250 --> 01:53:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Looking at studying.</v>

4270
01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:53.241
<v Speaker 2>She gotta.</v>

4271
01:53:53.241 --> 01:53:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Let me finish.</v>

4272
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:54.441
<v Speaker 2>Let me finish.</v>

4273
01:53:54.441 --> 01:53:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Let him finish.</v>

4274
01:53:55.190 --> 01:53:56.023
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

4275
01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:57.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4276
01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:57.973
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

4277
01:53:59.150 --> 01:54:01.400
<v Speaker 2>even though for many people,</v>

4278
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:03.320
<v Speaker 2>cannabis isn't going to cause violence,</v>

4279
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:07.160
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean it can't cause violence in some people especially,</v>

4280
01:54:07.161 --> 01:54:09.350
<v Speaker 2>or at least could be affected at least could be a factor,</v>

4281
01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:12.470
<v Speaker 2>especially with the kind of violence that I am talking about.</v>

4282
01:54:12.471 --> 01:54:14.060
<v Speaker 2>And then I write about in the book,</v>

4283
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.051
<v Speaker 2>which is again,</v>

4284
01:54:15.051 --> 01:54:16.040
<v Speaker 2>so alcohol,</v>

4285
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:17.331
<v Speaker 2>it may be,</v>

4286
01:54:17.331 --> 01:54:19.220
<v Speaker 2>makes argument into a brawl.</v>

4287
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:21.890
<v Speaker 2>It makes a brawl into something where somebody picks up a stick.</v>

4288
01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:24.650
<v Speaker 2>It makes that into something where somebody pulls out a knife,</v>

4289
01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:25.513
<v Speaker 2>it escalates.</v>

4290
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis is different.</v>

4291
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis Causes Paranoia and psychosis.</v>

4292
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:32.600
<v Speaker 2>And it certainly causes us things temporarily,</v>

4293
01:54:32.601 --> 01:54:34.070
<v Speaker 2>even if it doesn't cause them permanently.</v>

4294
01:54:34.071 --> 01:54:38.180
<v Speaker 2>So a distortion in reality that could lead to you doing something terrible.</v>

4295
01:54:38.181 --> 01:54:41.630
<v Speaker 2>And it's usually to somebody you're not actually fighting with.</v>

4296
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:43.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a family member.</v>

4297
01:54:43.410 --> 01:54:44.900
<v Speaker 2>The worst cases that I've,</v>

4298
01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:49.640
<v Speaker 2>and I've really seen a lot of these cases are basically innocent family members</v>

4299
01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:50.990
<v Speaker 2>who are just in the way.</v>

4300
01:54:50.991 --> 01:54:55.940
<v Speaker 2>When somebody loses touch with reality and literally thinks like this,</v>

4301
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:59.060
<v Speaker 2>my 85 year old grandmother is going to kill me,</v>

4302
01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:01.370
<v Speaker 2>so I better stab her to death first.</v>

4303
01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:02.690
<v Speaker 2>That happens.</v>

4304
01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:04.400
<v Speaker 2>It happens a lot.</v>

4305
01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:08.480
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the amount of violence that people with psychosis command on</v>

4306
01:55:08.481 --> 01:55:10.130
<v Speaker 2>a population level basis,</v>

4307
01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:14.810
<v Speaker 2>it looks like people with schizophrenia commit about six to 10% of all the</v>

4308
01:55:14.811 --> 01:55:18.200
<v Speaker 2>murders in this country and it looks like people would sort of broader diff,</v>

4309
01:55:18.230 --> 01:55:19.700
<v Speaker 2>more broadly defined psychosis.</v>

4310
01:55:19.701 --> 01:55:19.941
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

4311
01:55:19.941 --> 01:55:21.530
<v Speaker 2>bipolar with psychosis,</v>

4312
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:22.790
<v Speaker 2>other psychotic conditions,</v>

4313
01:55:22.791 --> 01:55:23.960
<v Speaker 2>temporary psychosis,</v>

4314
01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:28.820
<v Speaker 2>they might be responsible for as much as 20% of the violent crime in the United</v>

4315
01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:28.821
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

4316
01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of violent crime.</v>

4317
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.780
<v Speaker 2>And what I am saying is that it is quite clear that drug use mediates that</v>

4318
01:55:35.781 --> 01:55:36.500
<v Speaker 2>violent crime.</v>

4319
01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:36.860
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

4320
01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:38.120
<v Speaker 2>if you're not using,</v>

4321
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:40.280
<v Speaker 2>you can keep your impulses in check,</v>

4322
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:41.720
<v Speaker 2>but when you do use,</v>

4323
01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.440
<v Speaker 2>you become dangerous.</v>

4324
01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>So when</v>

4325
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.990
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about biological variability,</v>

4326
01:55:45.991 --> 01:55:47.670
<v Speaker 6>if we factor in schizophrenia,</v>

4327
01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:50.700
<v Speaker 6>essentially what you're saying is that there are people that have schizophrenia</v>

4328
01:55:50.701 --> 01:55:52.320
<v Speaker 6>that don't commit violence,</v>

4329
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:57.300
<v Speaker 6>but that they're much more likely to commit violence if you add some sort of</v>

4330
01:55:57.301 --> 01:55:58.380
<v Speaker 6>psych medication,</v>

4331
01:55:58.381 --> 01:55:59.460
<v Speaker 6>whether it's marijuana,</v>

4332
01:55:59.461 --> 01:56:00.360
<v Speaker 6>whether it's something else,</v>

4333
01:56:00.361 --> 01:56:02.040
<v Speaker 6>it perturbs reality for them.</v>

4334
01:56:02.041 --> 01:56:04.630
<v Speaker 6>And particularly marijuana because hotbox bring down the</v>

4335
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:07.880
<v Speaker 6>recreational drugs,</v>

4336
01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 6>the worst cases of all our cannabis and a stimulant.</v>

4337
01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:14.640
<v Speaker 6>Because to the they both like cocaine or meth.</v>

4338
01:56:14.670 --> 01:56:15.181
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

4339
01:56:15.181 --> 01:56:15.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4340
01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.320
<v Speaker 6>So when you get that,</v>

4341
01:56:16.321 --> 01:56:20.880
<v Speaker 6>you get paranoid from two sources and you get the only good thing about cannabis</v>

4342
01:56:20.881 --> 01:56:23.100
<v Speaker 6>from this point of view as it kind of knocks people down a little bit,</v>

4343
01:56:23.101 --> 01:56:24.750
<v Speaker 6>but meth brings them right back.</v>

4344
01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:29.370
<v Speaker 6>So is it fair to say that what we don't know is that we don't know whether or</v>

4345
01:56:29.371 --> 01:56:33.000
<v Speaker 6>not these people like this young band with his terrible story from Connecticut?</v>

4346
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.360
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4347
01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:38.360
<v Speaker 6>We don't know whether or not he would have become a schizophrenia and exhibited</v>

4348
01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:40.170
<v Speaker 6>those symptoms without the marijuana.</v>

4349
01:56:40.171 --> 01:56:40.920
<v Speaker 6>We really don't know.</v>

4350
01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.330
<v Speaker 6>But we do know he did with it.</v>

4351
01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:42.741
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

4352
01:56:42.741 --> 01:56:43.440
<v Speaker 6>that's correct.</v>

4353
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.200
<v Speaker 6>And what I would also say is that for somebody like that,</v>

4354
01:56:46.201 --> 01:56:49.770
<v Speaker 6>and this is quite clear on a population level basis with people with</v>

4355
01:56:49.771 --> 01:56:52.110
<v Speaker 6>schizophrenia is you've got to discourage them from using,</v>

4356
01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:55.110
<v Speaker 6>really have to be disclosed because it brings out the worst.</v>

4357
01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:55.850
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4358
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:56.120
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4359
01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.150
<v Speaker 6>and you know somebody said this,</v>

4360
01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:58.230
<v Speaker 6>a a friend of mine,</v>

4361
01:56:58.530 --> 01:56:59.970
<v Speaker 6>old friend of mine from the New York Times said,</v>

4362
01:57:00.210 --> 01:57:02.340
<v Speaker 6>so every time there's a hurricane people,</v>

4363
01:57:02.370 --> 01:57:03.600
<v Speaker 6>some people on the right say,</v>

4364
01:57:03.601 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 6>well you can't prove that global warming cause that one hurricane that would've</v>

4365
01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:08.730
<v Speaker 6>happened anyway and he and there,</v>

4366
01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:09.060
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

4367
01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:13.800
<v Speaker 6>you can't prove it and you can't prove that any one case of psychosis was caused</v>

4368
01:57:13.801 --> 01:57:14.634
<v Speaker 6>by marijuana.</v>

4369
01:57:14.730 --> 01:57:18.240
<v Speaker 6>But when you look at the big studies at the population level data,</v>

4370
01:57:18.241 --> 01:57:22.800
<v Speaker 6>the association is really clear and everything points the same way and the</v>

4371
01:57:22.801 --> 01:57:24.810
<v Speaker 6>synthetic cannabinoids k two and spice,</v>

4372
01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.490
<v Speaker 6>those can clearly produce psychosis in people and people with psychosis tend to</v>

4373
01:57:29.491 --> 01:57:33.150
<v Speaker 6>slip back into it if they use at some point you got to start to say to yourself,</v>

4374
01:57:33.151 --> 01:57:35.010
<v Speaker 6>why does everything go the same way?</v>

4375
01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:38.670
<v Speaker 6>I also have a personal friend and I'd really didn't think about this guy,</v>

4376
01:57:38.671 --> 01:57:41.370
<v Speaker 6>but there's another personal friend that I know that it is a martial arts</v>

4377
01:57:41.371 --> 01:57:43.830
<v Speaker 6>instructor that had a psychotic break.</v>

4378
01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:47.460
<v Speaker 6>He became schizophrenia and he's a regular marijuana user.</v>

4379
01:57:47.461 --> 01:57:50.130
<v Speaker 6>And the people around him associated that with that.</v>

4380
01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:53.340
<v Speaker 6>And in fact people that are regular cannabis users,</v>

4381
01:57:53.341 --> 01:57:57.780
<v Speaker 6>we're trying to get them to stop using marijuana or close to being on the edge.</v>

4382
01:57:57.810 --> 01:58:01.350
<v Speaker 6>Any use a little bit of of cannabis for sure it be Tyson.</v>

4383
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:03.900
<v Speaker 6>And this guy was not on the edge when I knew him,</v>

4384
01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:05.610
<v Speaker 6>when I knew him,</v>

4385
01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:06.660
<v Speaker 6>he was very rational,</v>

4386
01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:07.381
<v Speaker 6>very rational.</v>

4387
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:09.960
<v Speaker 6>But something happened somewhere along the line was he,</v>

4388
01:58:10.090 --> 01:58:12.180
<v Speaker 6>did he become a pretty heavy smoker over time?</v>

4389
01:58:12.210 --> 01:58:15.000
<v Speaker 6>I do not know because we don't live in the same area anymore,</v>

4390
01:58:15.210 --> 01:58:17.910
<v Speaker 6>but he got really heavily,</v>

4391
01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:18.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4392
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:22.710
<v Speaker 6>really heavily medicated and did some really crazy shit and want to be in</v>

4393
01:58:22.711 --> 01:58:23.544
<v Speaker 6>hospitalized.</v>

4394
01:58:23.790 --> 01:58:25.560
<v Speaker 6>And this was not the case before.</v>

4395
01:58:25.561 --> 01:58:25.831
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4396
01:58:25.831 --> 01:58:27.990
<v Speaker 6>whatever it was that triggered him.</v>

4397
01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:28.853
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4398
01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 6>when I was around him when he was younger,</v>

4399
01:58:30.931 --> 01:58:32.790
<v Speaker 6>I would have said he's a total normal guy.</v>

4400
01:58:32.791 --> 01:58:34.260
<v Speaker 6>And I would have never saw that coming.</v>

4401
01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:36.420
<v Speaker 6>He was a heavy marijuana user,</v>

4402
01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:36.990
<v Speaker 6>heavy,</v>

4403
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.500
<v Speaker 6>heavy.</v>

4404
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:37.911
<v Speaker 6>But I don't,</v>

4405
01:58:37.911 --> 01:58:38.910
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how he's doing now.</v>

4406
01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:39.691
<v Speaker 6>I hope he's okay.</v>

4407
01:58:39.691 --> 01:58:40.230
<v Speaker 6>But we're,</v>

4408
01:58:40.230 --> 01:58:40.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4409
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:41.740
<v Speaker 6>we have mutual friends.</v>

4410
01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4411
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:42.940
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4412
01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:44.770
<v Speaker 5>he became,</v>

4413
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.891
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4414
01:58:44.891 --> 01:58:46.270
<v Speaker 5>schizophrenia and,</v>

4415
01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:46.811
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4416
01:58:46.811 --> 01:58:47.710
<v Speaker 5>you will see,</v>

4417
01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:48.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4418
01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.390
<v Speaker 5>cases like that.</v>

4419
01:58:49.391 --> 01:58:49.970
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

4420
01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:52.870
<v Speaker 5>when you do look at a lot of the larger data on,</v>

4421
01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:54.280
<v Speaker 5>on cannabis and violence,</v>

4422
01:58:54.281 --> 01:58:55.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just,</v>

4423
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:56.410
<v Speaker 5>it's just not there.</v>

4424
01:58:56.411 --> 01:58:58.420
<v Speaker 5>Like there's lots of data that suggests that,</v>

4425
01:58:58.600 --> 01:58:58.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4426
01:58:58.810 --> 01:59:00.760
<v Speaker 5>medical marijuana laws for example,</v>

4427
01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:03.560
<v Speaker 5>can actually have a decrease in overall.</v>

4428
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4429
01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:08.860
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a study that says that no comfort to the people who lose their</v>

4430
01:59:08.861 --> 01:59:11.020
<v Speaker 5>children because of the psychotropics.</v>

4431
01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:11.530
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

4432
01:59:11.530 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 5>And those studies are really bad.</v>

4433
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:15.580
<v Speaker 5>So the place that you can criticize the bad though,</v>

4434
01:59:15.610 --> 01:59:16.330
<v Speaker 5>because there,</v>

4435
01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:17.800
<v Speaker 5>because state level data is not great.</v>

4436
01:59:17.801 --> 01:59:19.920
<v Speaker 5>The place the book has been criticized for Andra,</v>

4437
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:22.210
<v Speaker 5>there was a rand review though in 2013.</v>

4438
01:59:22.211 --> 01:59:22.731
<v Speaker 5>And I mean that,</v>

4439
01:59:22.731 --> 01:59:27.731
<v Speaker 5>that's again that stated that include marijuana use does not induce violent</v>

4440
01:59:28.031 --> 01:59:32.870
<v Speaker 5>crime and the links between marijuana use and property crime are thin there.</v>

4441
01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:37.060
<v Speaker 5>I think we all agree that marijuana use by itself with people that aren't</v>

4442
01:59:37.061 --> 01:59:39.400
<v Speaker 5>schizophrenia probably does it induce violent crime.</v>

4443
01:59:39.610 --> 01:59:42.790
<v Speaker 5>But with people that are schizophrenia or people where it triggers</v>

4444
01:59:42.791 --> 01:59:43.451
<v Speaker 5>schizophrenia,</v>

4445
01:59:43.451 --> 01:59:45.940
<v Speaker 5>it could potentially induced violent crime.</v>

4446
01:59:45.941 --> 01:59:47.320
<v Speaker 5>My friend did not get violent,</v>

4447
01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.090
<v Speaker 5>although he did do a violent thing.</v>

4448
01:59:49.091 --> 01:59:50.110
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't to a person.</v>

4449
01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.160
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4450
01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:51.970
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

4451
01:59:51.970 --> 01:59:55.150
<v Speaker 5>I think we have to be really careful because there's no,</v>

4452
01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:56.740
<v Speaker 5>just like with diet,</v>

4453
01:59:56.770 --> 01:59:59.500
<v Speaker 5>just like with food and you know,</v>

4454
01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:00.850
<v Speaker 5>like a allergies,</v>

4455
02:00:00.851 --> 02:00:03.430
<v Speaker 5>all these different variabilities when it comes to human beings.</v>

4456
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:05.680
<v Speaker 5>I think we have to be really,</v>

4457
02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:10.800
<v Speaker 5>really careful about lumping all people together when it comes to how they get</v>

4458
02:00:11.141 --> 02:00:12.730
<v Speaker 5>affected by various compounds.</v>

4459
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:14.500
<v Speaker 5>So the state level,</v>

4460
02:00:14.890 --> 02:00:15.371
<v Speaker 5>if you want,</v>

4461
02:00:15.371 --> 02:00:15.670
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

4462
02:00:15.670 --> 02:00:16.280
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

4463
02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:16.781
<v Speaker 5>the police,</v>

4464
02:00:16.781 --> 02:00:18.910
<v Speaker 5>the book has been criticized in my mind,</v>

4465
02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:23.140
<v Speaker 5>sort of the most fairly is it points out that in the four states that legalized</v>

4466
02:00:23.141 --> 02:00:23.650
<v Speaker 5>first,</v>

4467
02:00:23.650 --> 02:00:24.730
<v Speaker 5>which is Alaska,</v>

4468
02:00:24.731 --> 02:00:25.450
<v Speaker 5>Washington,</v>

4469
02:00:25.450 --> 02:00:25.871
<v Speaker 5>Oregon,</v>

4470
02:00:25.871 --> 02:00:26.704
<v Speaker 5>Colorado.</v>

4471
02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:27.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4472
02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:32.580
<v Speaker 5>if you look at 2013 and then you compare that to 2017 murders and agg assault,</v>

4473
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:34.210
<v Speaker 5>violent crime,</v>

4474
02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:35.050
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4475
02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:39.520
<v Speaker 5>are up substantially in those states and substantially more than in the u s can</v>

4476
02:00:39.521 --> 02:00:40.240
<v Speaker 5>I stop you there?</v>

4477
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.300
<v Speaker 5>But is there a possibility there's a correlation between organized crime?</v>

4478
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.781
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

4479
02:00:43.781 --> 02:00:47.350
<v Speaker 5>one of the things about selling marijuana is the people that have always been</v>

4480
02:00:47.351 --> 02:00:48.880
<v Speaker 5>selling marijuana have been criminals.</v>

4481
02:00:49.150 --> 02:00:51.490
<v Speaker 5>When you make things legal and estate,</v>

4482
02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:54.940
<v Speaker 5>the people that were selling it illegal flock to that state.</v>

4483
02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:56.530
<v Speaker 5>And that's been proven to be true,</v>

4484
02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:57.310
<v Speaker 5>that there's,</v>

4485
02:00:57.310 --> 02:01:01.090
<v Speaker 5>there's a direct correlation between people being robbed,</v>

4486
02:01:01.091 --> 02:01:05.590
<v Speaker 5>that there was also a significant problem with credit cards and banks where</v>

4487
02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:08.250
<v Speaker 5>everyone was having to do all their transactions with cash.</v>

4488
02:01:08.251 --> 02:01:12.250
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of violences was associated with marijuana in regards to that</v>

4489
02:01:12.251 --> 02:01:15.220
<v Speaker 5>and also massive increase in population.</v>

4490
02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.520
<v Speaker 5>And so the reason why Trump has actually not really against cannabis in some</v>

4491
02:01:21.371 --> 02:01:25.960
<v Speaker 5>ways it's because he feels that if we have medical marijuana laws that</v>

4492
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:27.340
<v Speaker 5>especially the states that are,</v>

4493
02:01:27.370 --> 02:01:27.760
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4494
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:28.630
<v Speaker 5>that are border states,</v>

4495
02:01:28.810 --> 02:01:31.450
<v Speaker 5>that the crime's gonna drop drops a lot tremendously.</v>

4496
02:01:31.630 --> 02:01:32.530
<v Speaker 5>And it has dropped.</v>

4497
02:01:32.531 --> 02:01:37.531
<v Speaker 5>They did a study last year and it dropped over 50% is all around 7% in Arizona.</v>

4498
02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:39.633
<v Speaker 5>And then again,</v>

4499
02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:41.210
<v Speaker 5>you know Benjamin Hanson</v>

4500
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:41.600
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

4501
02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:41.841
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

4502
02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:42.820
<v Speaker 3>who's an economist,</v>

4503
02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:43.970
<v Speaker 3>the wrong data.</v>

4504
02:01:43.971 --> 02:01:46.620
<v Speaker 3>So first let's talk over each other.</v>

4505
02:01:46.770 --> 02:01:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4506
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:47.990
<v Speaker 3>so he,</v>

4507
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:52.490
<v Speaker 3>he said that the murder rate did not demonstrate that marijuana legalization and</v>

4508
02:01:52.570 --> 02:01:56.090
<v Speaker 3>increases violence and then it may have actually demonstrated that legalization</v>

4509
02:01:56.091 --> 02:01:59.660
<v Speaker 3>is slightly decreased fonts and he thinks that that the reason that there was an</v>

4510
02:01:59.661 --> 02:02:01.220
<v Speaker 3>increase in the murder rate,</v>

4511
02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:04.820
<v Speaker 3>particularly in Washington is because there was a large income gap.</v>

4512
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:09.440
<v Speaker 3>They say that Washington has the 10th largest income gap in the United States.</v>

4513
02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:10.111
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

4514
02:02:10.111 --> 02:02:12.700
<v Speaker 3>How did that change how that corresponds to the murderer?</v>

4515
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:13.603
<v Speaker 3>Good question though.</v>

4516
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm so,</v>

4517
02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:15.390
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

4518
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4519
02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to speak with Benjamin to about this,</v>

4520
02:02:18.630 --> 02:02:20.030
<v Speaker 3>but sounds like confirmation bias.</v>

4521
02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Well he,</v>

4522
02:02:21.170 --> 02:02:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is one thing that has been shown to increase mental illness like</v>

4523
02:02:26.571 --> 02:02:30.350
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about and can definitely increase violence is when you have an</v>

4524
02:02:30.351 --> 02:02:31.170
<v Speaker 3>income gap.</v>

4525
02:02:31.170 --> 02:02:35.960
<v Speaker 3>And how's the income gap shifted that directly correlates to the legalization of</v>

4526
02:02:35.961 --> 02:02:37.820
<v Speaker 3>marijuana because during the scene,</v>

4527
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:39.260
<v Speaker 3>because during the same period,</v>

4528
02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.251
<v Speaker 3>the income gap,</v>

4529
02:02:40.251 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 3>particularly in Washington increased.</v>

4530
02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:44.180
<v Speaker 3>So he feels that,</v>

4531
02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:44.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4532
02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:45.680
<v Speaker 3>it's corresponding number,</v>

4533
02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:46.250
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4534
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:48.770
<v Speaker 3>So he feels that it's likely more,</v>

4535
02:02:48.771 --> 02:02:49.500
<v Speaker 3>more to that.</v>

4536
02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:50.150
<v Speaker 3>And I mean he,</v>

4537
02:02:50.150 --> 02:02:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4538
02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>

4539
02:02:51.441 --> 02:02:53.270
<v Speaker 3>but I mean you have to respect this guy,</v>

4540
02:02:53.271 --> 02:02:53.480
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4541
02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:56.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't respect him because I know what he did with his data.</v>

4542
02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:57.113
<v Speaker 3>And tell me</v>

4543
02:02:58.630 --> 02:02:58.940
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4544
02:02:58.940 --> 02:02:59.960
<v Speaker 3>this is maddening to me.</v>

4545
02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Violent crime in those four states increased more rapidly than in the u s period</v>

4546
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:11.120
<v Speaker 3>between 2013 and 2017 Jamie just posted this,</v>

4547
02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 3>conjecture aside,</v>

4548
02:03:12.381 --> 02:03:13.490
<v Speaker 3>no credible data exists.</v>

4549
02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:16.520
<v Speaker 3>It supports a significant association between the increase in violent crime and</v>

4550
02:03:16.521 --> 02:03:17.690
<v Speaker 3>marijuana legalization.</v>

4551
02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:18.411
<v Speaker 3>Furthermore,</v>

4552
02:03:18.411 --> 02:03:22.790
<v Speaker 3>studies suggest that so far violent crime decreases in states with legalized</v>

4553
02:03:22.791 --> 02:03:26.510
<v Speaker 3>medical marijuana until new research credibly suggest otherwise.</v>

4554
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:31.070
<v Speaker 3>The claim that a demonstratable link between the two exists will remain</v>

4555
02:03:31.071 --> 02:03:32.440
<v Speaker 3>classified as false.</v>

4556
02:03:32.441 --> 02:03:34.190
<v Speaker 3>So that's just not true.</v>

4557
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.731
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

4558
02:03:34.731 --> 02:03:35.810
<v Speaker 3>I know it's Snopes.</v>

4559
02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:36.171
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4560
02:03:36.171 --> 02:03:37.610
<v Speaker 3>And I know we trust Snopes.</v>

4561
02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust them that</v>

4562
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:41.181
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna say that too.</v>

4563
02:03:41.181 --> 02:03:41.630
<v Speaker 3>But they're,</v>

4564
02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:42.480
<v Speaker 3>they give all of their,</v>

4565
02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:43.403
<v Speaker 3>their source.</v>

4566
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.823
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

4567
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.341
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

4568
02:03:46.341 --> 02:03:47.174
<v Speaker 3>are you,</v>

4569
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:48.500
<v Speaker 3>where are these sources?</v>

4570
02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:51.040
<v Speaker 3>I've read this stuff and what's wrong with them here?</v>

4571
02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Let me just go back to what I'm saying.</v>

4572
02:03:53.050 --> 02:03:53.883
<v Speaker 3>Please do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There are 30,000 agg assault period.</v>

02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:13.490
<v Speaker 3>That's an almost 40% increase.</v>

4586
02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:15.140
<v Speaker 3>There are 38,000 agg assaults.</v>

4587
02:04:15.141 --> 02:04:16.610
<v Speaker 3>That's a 25% increase.</v>

4588
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:18.320
<v Speaker 3>If you adjust for population,</v>

4589
02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.990
<v Speaker 3>you still get big increases in Denver,</v>

4590
02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:23.270
<v Speaker 3>2018 almost 70 murders.</v>

4591
02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:25.370
<v Speaker 3>There were about 35 and 2013.</v>

4592
02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Seattle 27 2018 there were 34 35 murders.</v>

4593
02:04:30.231 --> 02:04:30.471
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>

4594
02:04:30.471 --> 02:04:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I think 19 in 2013 these increases are real.</v>

4595
02:04:34.610 --> 02:04:35.443
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4596
02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:35.840
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

4597
02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:36.110
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

4598
02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:36.790
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

4599
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:37.110
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4600
02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Can we say</v>

4601
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 2>that marijuana legalization caused those increases?</v>

4602
02:04:41.730 --> 02:04:42.960
<v Speaker 2>We cannot yet.</v>

4603
02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:44.730
<v Speaker 2>There are other possibilities.</v>

4604
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:45.441
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>

4605
02:04:45.441 --> 02:04:46.274
<v Speaker 2>what are those?</v>

4606
02:04:46.290 --> 02:04:47.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4607
02:04:47.370 --> 02:04:47.671
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4608
02:04:47.671 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 2>one positive first of all,</v>

4609
02:04:48.751 --> 02:04:50.070
<v Speaker 2>population did increase.</v>

4610
02:04:50.071 --> 02:04:51.690
<v Speaker 2>It's also possible that these states,</v>

4611
02:04:51.691 --> 02:04:53.670
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote imported violent crime.</v>

4612
02:04:53.671 --> 02:04:57.300
<v Speaker 2>And other ones that you've got a population of transients coming in in part</v>

4613
02:04:57.330 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 2>because marijuana was legal and those people are likely to commit violent crime</v>

4614
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:03.540
<v Speaker 2>and on top of that organized crime people that are selling.</v>

4615
02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:04.471
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

4616
02:05:04.471 --> 02:05:08.130
<v Speaker 2>There may have been some people who are exporting to to Nebraska,</v>

4617
02:05:08.131 --> 02:05:08.911
<v Speaker 2>to Minnesota,</v>

4618
02:05:08.911 --> 02:05:09.691
<v Speaker 2>to other states.</v>

4619
02:05:09.691 --> 02:05:11.070
<v Speaker 2>There's crime associated with that,</v>

4620
02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:14.400
<v Speaker 2>but what I am saying is that unequivocally,</v>

4621
02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:15.571
<v Speaker 2>unequivocally,</v>

4622
02:05:15.571 --> 02:05:19.680
<v Speaker 2>the people who said legalization is going to decrease violent crime and people</v>

4623
02:05:19.681 --> 02:05:20.610
<v Speaker 2>did say that.</v>

4624
02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:23.340
<v Speaker 2>And Cory booker in 2010 17 said it,</v>

4625
02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:27.210
<v Speaker 2>he said that it actually had decreased violent crime in states that legalized</v>

4626
02:05:27.211 --> 02:05:28.680
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't say it randomly.</v>

4627
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:32.730
<v Speaker 2>He said it when he was introducing legislation to legalize marijuana on the</v>

4628
02:05:32.731 --> 02:05:33.564
<v Speaker 2>federal level.</v>

4629
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Those people are wrong and they need to stop saying it.</v>

4630
02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:37.231
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

4631
02:05:37.231 --> 02:05:39.630
<v Speaker 2>And by the way that Oregon economists used,</v>

4632
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.990
<v Speaker 2>he used the wrong data set for his charts.</v>

4633
02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4634
02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:44.010
<v Speaker 2>He used,</v>

4635
02:05:44.010 --> 02:05:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I used the real numbers.</v>

4636
02:05:45.421 --> 02:05:45.721
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4637
02:05:45.721 --> 02:05:48.120
<v Speaker 2>The FBI homicide numbers.</v>

4638
02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:50.760
<v Speaker 2>He used numbers that include justifiable homicides,</v>

4639
02:05:50.970 --> 02:05:51.803
<v Speaker 2>police,</v>

4640
02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>the FBI report that the murder rate went up 1% from 2015 to 2016 as compared to</v>

4641
02:05:57.541 --> 02:05:58.470
<v Speaker 2>the nationwide,</v>

4642
02:05:58.471 --> 02:05:58.741
<v Speaker 2>which one?</v>

4643
02:05:58.741 --> 02:06:03.741
<v Speaker 2>It was 3.9% and then it dropped by 11.6% between 2016 and 20 seconds.</v>

4644
02:06:05.370 --> 02:06:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I do not know what you're talking about.</v>

4645
02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Those are FBI numbers of breeding,</v>

4646
02:06:09.730 --> 02:06:11.610
<v Speaker 2>not know what you're talking about.</v>

4647
02:06:11.790 --> 02:06:13.860
<v Speaker 2>The numbers are clear.</v>

4648
02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4649
02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I use them reading them right now.</v>

4650
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:20.100
<v Speaker 2>2016 release of FBI uniform crime reports from Oregon.</v>

4651
02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4652
02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4653
02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>

4654
02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:24.690
<v Speaker 2>You're not reading the reports from the United States.</v>

4655
02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:28.200
<v Speaker 2>You're picking one state for women showing something will state that has</v>

4656
02:06:28.201 --> 02:06:32.070
<v Speaker 2>legalized medical cannabis over the entire country from that time period too.</v>

4657
02:06:32.071 --> 02:06:35.130
<v Speaker 2>So to pick those four states where marijuana was legalized,</v>

4658
02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:36.293
<v Speaker 2>sort of cherry picking,</v>

4659
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:39.870
<v Speaker 2>picking every state where there were legalized and comparing it to the whole</v>

4660
02:06:39.871 --> 02:06:40.231
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

4661
02:06:40.231 --> 02:06:41.064
<v Speaker 2>the whole country,</v>

4662
02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:42.280
<v Speaker 2>the whole country.</v>

4663
02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:43.500
<v Speaker 2>You'll see a similar,</v>

4664
02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:44.680
<v Speaker 2>is it a similar increase?</v>

4665
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:46.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm trying to</v>

4666
02:06:48.630 --> 02:06:50.000
<v Speaker 2>pull back so we can see the whole stuff.</v>

4667
02:06:50.530 --> 02:06:50.860
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4668
02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:51.270
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4669
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:54.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a violent crime coordinators and ag out crime,</v>

4670
02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:57.870
<v Speaker 2>violent crime and that ag assaults,</v>

4671
02:06:57.871 --> 02:06:58.560
<v Speaker 2>aren't they?</v>

4672
02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:58.861
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4673
02:06:58.861 --> 02:06:59.670
<v Speaker 2>So so,</v>

4674
02:06:59.670 --> 02:07:02.760
<v Speaker 2>so the four categories of violent crime or murder,</v>

4675
02:07:02.761 --> 02:07:03.331
<v Speaker 2>agg assault,</v>

4676
02:07:03.331 --> 02:07:04.740
<v Speaker 2>robbery and rape.</v>

4677
02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Rape has sort of gone sideways the last few years.</v>

4678
02:07:07.051 --> 02:07:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Robberies actually have gone down.</v>

4679
02:07:08.610 --> 02:07:12.810
<v Speaker 2>It's murders and ag assaults that are interpersonal violent crime.</v>

4680
02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4681
02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Just to go back to this Oregon economist,</v>

4682
02:07:15.451 --> 02:07:16.770
<v Speaker 2>because this maddens me,</v>

4683
02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:21.790
<v Speaker 2>he used a Dataset that is not the standard data set to report murder rate.</v>

4684
02:07:21.790 --> 02:07:22.623
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference?</v>

4685
02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:25.710
<v Speaker 2>He used the data set that includes justifiable homicides,</v>

4686
02:07:25.711 --> 02:07:27.240
<v Speaker 2>meaning I'm in my house,</v>

4687
02:07:27.241 --> 02:07:28.074
<v Speaker 2>you come in,</v>

4688
02:07:28.110 --> 02:07:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I shoot you and kill you.</v>

4689
02:07:29.071 --> 02:07:32.430
<v Speaker 2>The police don't charge me with anything and police homicides,</v>

4690
02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:35.130
<v Speaker 2>but you use your book published.</v>

4691
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's not let it interrupt.</v>

4692
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:37.083
<v Speaker 2>Let me finish.</v>

4693
02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Those two categories of crime are not likely to be impacted by cannabis use.</v>

4694
02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Cops are not smoking when they're on patrol eyes.</v>

4695
02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Hope.</v>

4696
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:47.050
<v Speaker 2>And if you are using,</v>

4697
02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you're very unlikely to have your murder viewed as justifiable homicide.</v>

4698
02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:55.530
<v Speaker 2>The fair comparison is the base murder rate in the u s and that's the number</v>

4699
02:07:56.471 --> 02:07:57.700
<v Speaker 2>that I used.</v>

4700
02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:59.020
<v Speaker 2>And I am telling you,</v>

4701
02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know these numbers,</v>

4702
02:08:01.150 --> 02:08:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I sleep,</v>

4703
02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:03.130
<v Speaker 2>I wake up with these numbers,</v>

4704
02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:04.293
<v Speaker 2>cannabis,</v>

4705
02:08:04.570 --> 02:08:08.170
<v Speaker 2>the for cannabis legal states on a per capita basis,</v>

4706
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:13.350
<v Speaker 2>crime murders rose 31% on a per capita basis in those four states over the 2013,</v>

4707
02:08:15.281 --> 02:08:16.330
<v Speaker 2>2017 period.</v>

4708
02:08:17.050 --> 02:08:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

4709
02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:18.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I said 31.</v>

4710
02:08:18.431 --> 02:08:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's 29%.</v>

4711
02:08:19.481 --> 02:08:21.790
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I say I woke up anyway.</v>

4712
02:08:21.791 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 2>The the,</v>

4713
02:08:22.330 --> 02:08:26.950
<v Speaker 2>for the US it's 18% 29% versus 18%.</v>

4714
02:08:27.190 --> 02:08:28.360
<v Speaker 2>That's the gap.</v>

4715
02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:33.160
<v Speaker 2>And I am not saying that I know that cannabis legalization cause that gap,</v>

4716
02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:38.170
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is people need to stop claiming that cannabis legalization</v>

4717
02:08:38.171 --> 02:08:39.340
<v Speaker 2>reduces violent crime.</v>

4718
02:08:39.341 --> 02:08:40.090
<v Speaker 2>It in,</v>

4719
02:08:40.090 --> 02:08:41.950
<v Speaker 2>it has increased in those tasks.</v>

4720
02:08:41.951 --> 02:08:43.360
<v Speaker 2>You in those states was at universal,</v>

4721
02:08:43.361 --> 02:08:43.931
<v Speaker 2>the increase,</v>

4722
02:08:43.931 --> 02:08:45.340
<v Speaker 2>was it almost identical?</v>

4723
02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4724
02:08:45.730 --> 02:08:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Alaska was the most,</v>

4725
02:08:47.170 --> 02:08:47.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4726
02:08:47.650 --> 02:08:51.370
<v Speaker 2>then I think murders went up more in college in Washington.</v>

4727
02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4728
02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:53.590
<v Speaker 2>and what's also interesting,</v>

4729
02:08:53.591 --> 02:08:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

4730
02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:54.071
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

4731
02:08:54.071 --> 02:08:56.230
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to go into the numbers,</v>

4732
02:08:56.231 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 2>is the gap actually widens year by year.</v>

4733
02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:02.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of what you would expect if this is the result of a psychometric</v>

4734
02:09:02.591 --> 02:09:02.981
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

4735
02:09:02.981 --> 02:09:03.341
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

4736
02:09:03.341 --> 02:09:07.390
<v Speaker 2>a psychosis causing effect because cannabis doesn't cause psychosis right away.</v>

4737
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:08.390
<v Speaker 2>People break down.</v>

4738
02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:13.680
<v Speaker 2>But if it's causing heavy use and some of those people are sliding into paranoia</v>

4739
02:09:14.321 --> 02:09:15.160
<v Speaker 2>and psychosis,</v>

4740
02:09:15.370 --> 02:09:18.070
<v Speaker 2>you'd sort of expect the gap to increase over time.</v>

4741
02:09:18.071 --> 02:09:19.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's happened.</v>

4742
02:09:20.290 --> 02:09:20.741
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4743
02:09:20.741 --> 02:09:21.100
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4744
02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:21.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4745
02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go back again to the Netherlands.</v>

4746
02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:24.761
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4747
02:09:24.761 --> 02:09:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Because they've had,</v>

4748
02:09:25.930 --> 02:09:26.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4749
02:09:26.171 --> 02:09:30.820
<v Speaker 2>cannabis legalized forever and they have one fifth of the homicide rate that the</v>

4750
02:09:30.821 --> 02:09:31.840
<v Speaker 2>United States does.</v>

4751
02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:34.630
<v Speaker 2>And they also have a lower cannabis use.</v>

4752
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:35.523
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

4753
02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:36.633
<v Speaker 2>They also very,</v>

4754
02:09:37.450 --> 02:09:38.140
<v Speaker 2>but still,</v>

4755
02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:38.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4756
02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:40.710
<v Speaker 2>one warrior kick boxers,</v>

4757
02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:43.443
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4758
02:09:43.670 --> 02:09:44.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4759
02:09:44.170 --> 02:09:44.620
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

4760
02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:45.311
<v Speaker 2>one fifth.</v>

4761
02:09:45.311 --> 02:09:45.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4762
02:09:45.551 --> 02:09:46.091
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>

4763
02:09:46.091 --> 02:09:46.251
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4764
02:09:46.251 --> 02:09:47.650
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty drastic overall.</v>

4765
02:09:47.651 --> 02:09:48.371
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

4766
02:09:48.371 --> 02:09:48.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4767
02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Alex,</v>

4768
02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:49.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4769
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4770
02:09:49.721 --> 02:09:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate some of the reason we're talking about the correlation between</v>

4771
02:09:52.301 --> 02:09:52.901
<v Speaker 2>cannabis use.</v>

4772
02:09:52.901 --> 02:09:53.491
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that,</v>

4773
02:09:53.491 --> 02:09:53.551
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4774
02:09:53.551 --> 02:09:53.700
<v Speaker 2>we</v>

4775
02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>have to accept it in America is that when you're in a place like the Netherlands</v>

4776
02:09:58.410 --> 02:10:01.830
<v Speaker 1>has a long and accepted history of use,</v>

4777
02:10:02.130 --> 02:10:03.360
<v Speaker 1>people are accustomed to it.</v>

4778
02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:04.920
<v Speaker 1>So I think things kind of even out.</v>

4779
02:10:04.921 --> 02:10:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that we're dealing with with the United States is</v>

4780
02:10:07.201 --> 02:10:08.670
<v Speaker 1>people that have just,</v>

4781
02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

4782
02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:12.930
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a long history of experience and it becomes legal and then they</v>

4783
02:10:12.931 --> 02:10:13.411
<v Speaker 1>use it.</v>

4784
02:10:13.411 --> 02:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And maybe some of them like we're talking about don't have a tolerance for it,</v>

4785
02:10:17.490 --> 02:10:18.510
<v Speaker 1>have too much.</v>

4786
02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:22.940
<v Speaker 1>And I was talking about with my friend who's like this really cotton,</v>

4787
02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:24.330
<v Speaker 1>the one who,</v>

4788
02:10:24.331 --> 02:10:24.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4789
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:27.960
<v Speaker 1>had an edible and became suicidal and was fucked up for weeks.</v>

4790
02:10:28.210 --> 02:10:29.790
<v Speaker 1>You guys very confident,</v>

4791
02:10:29.791 --> 02:10:30.750
<v Speaker 1>very articulate,</v>

4792
02:10:30.751 --> 02:10:31.770
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent.</v>

4793
02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:32.873
<v Speaker 1>He's not a,</v>

4794
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 1>not a Weirdo,</v>

4795
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>not</v>

4796
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:35.510
<v Speaker 5>a non transient extreme,</v>

4797
02:10:35.511 --> 02:10:36.890
<v Speaker 5>extremely successful.</v>

4798
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:38.121
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4799
02:10:38.121 --> 02:10:39.440
<v Speaker 5>I think there are,</v>

4800
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:42.650
<v Speaker 5>there are variables that we need to take into consideration and there's certain</v>

4801
02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:46.630
<v Speaker 5>human beings that exhibit a pattern of behavior that's directly correlated to</v>

4802
02:10:46.650 --> 02:10:49.580
<v Speaker 5>cannabis use that I don't experience.</v>

4803
02:10:49.670 --> 02:10:50.341
<v Speaker 5>So if I,</v>

4804
02:10:50.341 --> 02:10:53.780
<v Speaker 5>I could say from my own personal biases that that's bullshit.</v>

4805
02:10:53.781 --> 02:10:54.501
<v Speaker 5>That's nothing.</v>

4806
02:10:54.501 --> 02:10:55.221
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't do anything.</v>

4807
02:10:55.221 --> 02:10:56.240
<v Speaker 5>I've been smoking for years,</v>

4808
02:10:56.241 --> 02:10:56.960
<v Speaker 5>doesn't do shit.</v>

4809
02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:00.440
<v Speaker 5>Well you probably don't have one of those three genes that we were talking about</v>

4810
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:04.280
<v Speaker 5>and you probably also to,</v>

4811
02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:05.120
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4812
02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:05.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4813
02:11:05.361 --> 02:11:07.970
<v Speaker 5>don't overuse or you have some type of,</v>

4814
02:11:08.210 --> 02:11:08.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4815
02:11:08.710 --> 02:11:09.050
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4816
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:11.240
<v Speaker 5>legitimacy as to why you are,</v>

4817
02:11:11.250 --> 02:11:12.140
<v Speaker 5>you are using it.</v>

4818
02:11:12.141 --> 02:11:13.070
<v Speaker 5>And you know what,</v>

4819
02:11:13.130 --> 02:11:14.390
<v Speaker 5>I want to keep going with this.</v>

4820
02:11:14.391 --> 02:11:15.224
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

4821
02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:16.041
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the show,</v>

4822
02:11:16.041 --> 02:11:21.041
<v Speaker 5>I think that we should make some type of like recommendations for people just</v>

4823
02:11:21.471 --> 02:11:23.060
<v Speaker 5>because I hate when,</v>

4824
02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:23.301
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4825
02:11:23.301 --> 02:11:27.980
<v Speaker 5>you have this big three hour podcasts and then at the end of it it's just like,</v>

4826
02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:28.581
<v Speaker 5>hey guys,</v>

4827
02:11:28.581 --> 02:11:29.480
<v Speaker 5>just be safe.</v>

4828
02:11:31.090 --> 02:11:31.923
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>

4829
02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:34.380
<v Speaker 8>it's like,</v>

4830
02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:35.213
<v Speaker 8>let's have</v>

4831
02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:38.713
<v Speaker 8>fun.</v>

4832
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:40.833
<v Speaker 8>Let's have</v>

4833
02:11:41.590 --> 02:11:42.310
<v Speaker 5>type of like,</v>

4834
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.810
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4835
02:11:42.810 --> 02:11:43.550
<v Speaker 5>recommendations.</v>

4836
02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:44.980
<v Speaker 5>Like I love the podcast with,</v>

4837
02:11:45.010 --> 02:11:45.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4838
02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:45.520
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

4839
02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:47.140
<v Speaker 5>with Chris Kresser and Joel.</v>

4840
02:11:47.170 --> 02:11:47.710
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4841
02:11:47.710 --> 02:11:48.041
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

4842
02:11:48.041 --> 02:11:48.730
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4843
02:11:48.730 --> 02:11:49.241
<v Speaker 5>at the,</v>

4844
02:11:49.241 --> 02:11:50.680
<v Speaker 5>at the end of it was just sort of like,</v>

4845
02:11:50.681 --> 02:11:51.514
<v Speaker 5>hey guys,</v>

4846
02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:52.690
<v Speaker 5>do anything there can die.</v>

4847
02:11:53.410 --> 02:11:57.580
<v Speaker 5>Most people realize that one person was going on data and the other person was</v>

4848
02:11:58.580 --> 02:11:59.413
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

4849
02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:03.070
<v Speaker 5>I find it so fascinating that now when you think back through your,</v>

4850
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:04.031
<v Speaker 5>through your life,</v>

4851
02:12:04.031 --> 02:12:04.210
<v Speaker 5>you've,</v>

4852
02:12:04.210 --> 02:12:06.220
<v Speaker 5>you've thought of somebody who was affected,</v>

4853
02:12:06.221 --> 02:12:07.360
<v Speaker 5>that there were several people.</v>

4854
02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:09.670
<v Speaker 5>I'll bet I'll bet as you think about it,</v>

4855
02:12:09.671 --> 02:12:11.980
<v Speaker 5>you'll think of more people maybe.</v>

4856
02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:13.300
<v Speaker 5>But those are the big ones.</v>

4857
02:12:13.301 --> 02:12:14.170
<v Speaker 5>And like I said,</v>

4858
02:12:14.171 --> 02:12:17.290
<v Speaker 5>my friend who is a martial arts instructor was a pretty significant issue with a</v>

4859
02:12:17.291 --> 02:12:18.041
<v Speaker 5>lot of our friends.</v>

4860
02:12:18.041 --> 02:12:20.140
<v Speaker 5>We were trying to figure out what was wrong with him beforehand.</v>

4861
02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:23.230
<v Speaker 5>He was sending me these videos that didn't make any sense.</v>

4862
02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:24.031
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4863
02:12:24.031 --> 02:12:24.521
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4864
02:12:24.521 --> 02:12:25.930
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck is this?</v>

4865
02:12:25.931 --> 02:12:26.590
<v Speaker 5>Like I'll,</v>

4866
02:12:26.590 --> 02:12:29.920
<v Speaker 5>I'll explain to you more often Arabic so I don't have to uh,</v>

4867
02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:30.873
<v Speaker 5>out this guy.</v>

4868
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:32.380
<v Speaker 5>But what will the,</v>

4869
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:35.680
<v Speaker 5>all a lot of people that were close to him were really seriously concerned.</v>

4870
02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:38.770
<v Speaker 5>Now is it something that would have happened anyway?</v>

4871
02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:39.753
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4872
02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:41.770
<v Speaker 5>He's in his twenties.</v>

4873
02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:43.390
<v Speaker 5>How old is that?</v>

4874
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:44.590
<v Speaker 5>Late twenties 20.</v>

4875
02:12:44.591 --> 02:12:45.070
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4876
02:12:45.070 --> 02:12:46.240
<v Speaker 5>that's right around the age.</v>

4877
02:12:46.241 --> 02:12:47.600
<v Speaker 5>So it is,</v>

4878
02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:48.641
<v Speaker 5>it's a little,</v>

4879
02:12:48.641 --> 02:12:50.140
<v Speaker 5>a little bit late Ish.</v>

4880
02:12:50.170 --> 02:12:50.680
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4881
02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:51.401
<v Speaker 5>cause like I said,</v>

4882
02:12:51.401 --> 02:12:52.211
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the studies,</v>

4883
02:12:52.211 --> 02:12:54.640
<v Speaker 5>even when you look at the ones on adolescents,</v>

4884
02:12:54.641 --> 02:12:56.920
<v Speaker 5>like for sure it's below,</v>

4885
02:12:56.921 --> 02:12:57.521
<v Speaker 5>like they've,</v>

4886
02:12:57.521 --> 02:13:02.521
<v Speaker 5>they have done studies like blow 18 is worse than say below 25 blow 15 is worse</v>

4887
02:13:03.041 --> 02:13:03.761
<v Speaker 5>than say 18.</v>

4888
02:13:03.761 --> 02:13:07.900
<v Speaker 5>Like the younger you go the worst and he seems to be fine now.</v>

4889
02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:08.260
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

4890
02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:08.700
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

4891
02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:08.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4892
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:09.491
<v Speaker 5>Using now,</v>

4893
02:13:09.491 --> 02:13:10.324
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4894
02:13:10.690 --> 02:13:11.171
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

4895
02:13:11.171 --> 02:13:11.800
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4896
02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:12.011
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4897
02:13:12.011 --> 02:13:13.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an expert on the subject,</v>

4898
02:13:13.361 --> 02:13:13.550
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

4899
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:14.680
<v Speaker 5>it's because of this,</v>

4900
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:15.550
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4901
02:13:15.550 --> 02:13:17.260
<v Speaker 5>if somebody called pruning that we go through,</v>

4902
02:13:17.261 --> 02:13:21.730
<v Speaker 5>so everyone goes through this and basically if your adolescents,</v>

4903
02:13:21.731 --> 02:13:22.990
<v Speaker 5>you're going to drop off some,</v>

4904
02:13:22.991 --> 02:13:26.330
<v Speaker 5>some weak neuroconnections to kind of pick up some stronger ones.</v>

4905
02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:26.371
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4906
02:13:26.371 --> 02:13:26.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4907
02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:28.090
<v Speaker 5>it's the best way to kind of explain it.</v>

4908
02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:29.353
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4909
02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:30.550
<v Speaker 5>when you use cannabis,</v>

4910
02:13:30.551 --> 02:13:32.250
<v Speaker 5>you can potentially accelerate</v>

4911
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:33.390
<v Speaker 4>that process.</v>

4912
02:13:33.630 --> 02:13:36.120
<v Speaker 4>And then because you accelerate that process,</v>

4913
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:39.060
<v Speaker 4>you don't get those good neuro connections.</v>

4914
02:13:39.061 --> 02:13:39.480
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

4915
02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:39.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4916
02:13:39.691 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 4>people unfortunately,</v>

4917
02:13:40.771 --> 02:13:41.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4918
02:13:41.041 --> 02:13:41.950
<v Speaker 4>develop things like,</v>

4919
02:13:41.951 --> 02:13:43.020
<v Speaker 4>like psychosis and,</v>

4920
02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:43.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4921
02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:44.170
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4922
02:13:44.170 --> 02:13:45.090
<v Speaker 4>and schizophrenia.</v>

4923
02:13:45.091 --> 02:13:45.510
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4924
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4925
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:47.000
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of where they were,</v>

4926
02:13:47.001 --> 02:13:47.880
<v Speaker 4>where the issue lies.</v>

4927
02:13:47.881 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4928
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:48.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4929
02:13:48.481 --> 02:13:50.730
<v Speaker 4>one thing that I am very happy,</v>

4930
02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:51.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4931
02:13:51.210 --> 02:13:53.430
<v Speaker 4>that we're talking about and I know Alex will be too,</v>

4932
02:13:53.431 --> 02:13:53.910
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

4933
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:54.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4934
02:13:54.090 --> 02:13:57.360
<v Speaker 4>we want to discuss the benefits and in this podcast,</v>

4935
02:13:57.361 --> 02:13:59.400
<v Speaker 4>make sure that people understand that,</v>

4936
02:13:59.520 --> 02:13:59.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4937
02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:01.830
<v Speaker 4>I believe that marijuana is Madison.</v>

4938
02:14:01.831 --> 02:14:03.060
<v Speaker 4>It's an excellent medicine.</v>

4939
02:14:03.330 --> 02:14:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4940
02:14:03.690 --> 02:14:08.690
<v Speaker 4>but the other thing though too is we do want to mitigate the risks because there</v>

4941
02:14:08.821 --> 02:14:10.350
<v Speaker 4>are real risks out there.</v>

4942
02:14:10.351 --> 02:14:10.800
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4943
02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:11.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4944
02:14:11.071 --> 02:14:12.300
<v Speaker 4>I do appreciate,</v>

4945
02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:12.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4946
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:13.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4947
02:14:13.230 --> 02:14:16.950
<v Speaker 4>US talking about adolescence and making sure that they do stay away from Canton.</v>

4948
02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:18.490
<v Speaker 2>This especially,</v>

4949
02:14:18.491 --> 02:14:19.960
<v Speaker 2>that's why I read these,</v>

4950
02:14:19.961 --> 02:14:20.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4951
02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:22.920
<v Speaker 2>these cases is a case file sometimes.</v>

4952
02:14:22.921 --> 02:14:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

4953
02:14:23.290 --> 02:14:24.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4954
02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:26.950
<v Speaker 2>the kids started using when he was 11 and you know,</v>

4955
02:14:26.951 --> 02:14:28.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like that kid never had a chance.</v>

4956
02:14:28.690 --> 02:14:28.861
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4957
02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:29.051
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4958
02:14:29.051 --> 02:14:29.930
<v Speaker 2>and obviously the,</v>

4959
02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:33.610
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes these are kids coming from disadvantaged backgrounds anyway,</v>

4960
02:14:33.611 --> 02:14:34.630
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4961
02:14:34.631 --> 02:14:36.250
<v Speaker 2>they're using by 11 and it's 16.</v>

4962
02:14:36.251 --> 02:14:36.720
<v Speaker 2>They put,</v>

4963
02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:37.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4964
02:14:37.001 --> 02:14:38.650
<v Speaker 2>put a gun to somebody's head and pull the trigger.</v>

4965
02:14:38.651 --> 02:14:39.484
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

4966
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:43.450
<v Speaker 4>the pre adolescent and early teen news,</v>

4967
02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.190
<v Speaker 4>we got to do everything we can to stop.</v>

4968
02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:46.061
<v Speaker 4>The problem is,</v>

4969
02:14:46.061 --> 02:14:46.241
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4970
02:14:46.241 --> 02:14:46.781
<v Speaker 4>like if you,</v>

4971
02:14:46.781 --> 02:14:48.790
<v Speaker 4>if you smoke pot in junior high,</v>

4972
02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:49.511
<v Speaker 4>like say seven,</v>

4973
02:14:49.511 --> 02:14:49.661
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>

4974
02:14:49.661 --> 02:14:49.991
<v Speaker 4>nine,</v>

4975
02:14:49.991 --> 02:14:51.970
<v Speaker 4>like you're probably going to smoke pot in high school.</v>

4976
02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:53.003
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the,</v>

4977
02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:53.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4978
02:14:53.381 --> 02:14:56.670
<v Speaker 4>that's what I saw when we went out when I was growing up and you know,</v>

4979
02:14:56.830 --> 02:14:59.710
<v Speaker 4>even when I was a home for Christmas for,</v>

4980
02:14:59.711 --> 02:15:00.580
<v Speaker 4>for a few days,</v>

4981
02:15:00.581 --> 02:15:01.210
<v Speaker 4>like yeah,</v>

4982
02:15:01.210 --> 02:15:03.010
<v Speaker 4>a couple of my friends even talked about,</v>

4983
02:15:03.011 --> 02:15:03.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4984
02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:03.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4985
02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:05.050
<v Speaker 4>some people that we knew,</v>

4986
02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:05.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4987
02:15:05.330 --> 02:15:09.550
<v Speaker 4>smoked pot in high school and like now like they're there,</v>

4988
02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:11.740
<v Speaker 4>they're crazy or they're not really doing too too much,</v>

4989
02:15:11.741 --> 02:15:12.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4990
02:15:12.041 --> 02:15:14.200
<v Speaker 4>so you do have to be careful with that.</v>

4991
02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:17.140
<v Speaker 4>I think we're dealing with a lot of ignorance.</v>

4992
02:15:17.141 --> 02:15:20.860
<v Speaker 4>We're dealing with a lot of ignorance and occur when it comes to biological</v>

4993
02:15:20.861 --> 02:15:21.694
<v Speaker 4>variability,</v>

4994
02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:21.940
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4995
02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:22.071
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

4996
02:15:22.071 --> 02:15:22.450
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

4997
02:15:22.450 --> 02:15:25.840
<v Speaker 4>we don't really understand how a lot of these different things affect people,</v>

4998
02:15:26.110 --> 02:15:28.770
<v Speaker 4>including like just diet and what,</v>

4999
02:15:28.771 --> 02:15:29.041
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

5000
02:15:29.041 --> 02:15:30.340
<v Speaker 4>what causes depression.</v>

5001
02:15:30.341 --> 02:15:30.580
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

5002
02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:31.060
<v Speaker 4>how much,</v>

5003
02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:34.900
<v Speaker 4>how much of what we constitute or what we decide is depression.</v>

5004
02:15:34.901 --> 02:15:37.780
<v Speaker 4>Is Inflammation a poor gut health?</v>

5005
02:15:37.781 --> 02:15:38.800
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of variables.</v>

5006
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:39.670
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of them.</v>

5007
02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:42.100
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana is absolutely one of those variables.</v>

5008
02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:43.061
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

5009
02:15:43.061 --> 02:15:43.750
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

5010
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:44.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an issue with it.</v>

5011
02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:45.191
<v Speaker 4>I liked it.</v>

5012
02:15:45.191 --> 02:15:46.024
<v Speaker 4>I love this stuff,</v>

5013
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.960
<v Speaker 4>but it does,</v>

5014
02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:47.920
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't fuck with me,</v>

5015
02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:53.110
<v Speaker 4>but I'm also honest and so I see these people where it's pretty obvious to me</v>

5016
02:15:53.111 --> 02:15:56.620
<v Speaker 4>that something's going on and that marijuana is not a good idea for them.</v>

5017
02:15:56.621 --> 02:15:57.880
<v Speaker 4>And I just think,</v>

5018
02:15:58.440 --> 02:15:58.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5019
02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:00.010
<v Speaker 4>like I said in the past,</v>

5020
02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:03.850
<v Speaker 4>I myself have been guilty of using this,</v>

5021
02:16:03.851 --> 02:16:04.241
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5022
02:16:04.241 --> 02:16:08.920
<v Speaker 4>this sort of a blanket description of it as being a positive influence and that</v>

5023
02:16:08.921 --> 02:16:10.060
<v Speaker 4>it's a good thing for people.</v>

5024
02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:11.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a good thing for everybody.</v>

5025
02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:12.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5026
02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:14.920
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely not a good thing for everybody and it's definitely not a good</v>

5027
02:16:14.921 --> 02:16:17.810
<v Speaker 4>thing for the people who have those genetics that I,</v>

5028
02:16:17.890 --> 02:16:19.090
<v Speaker 4>that I discussed earlier.</v>

5029
02:16:19.091 --> 02:16:19.871
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

5030
02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:20.651
<v Speaker 4>also too,</v>

5031
02:16:20.651 --> 02:16:21.160
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

5032
02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:21.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5033
02:16:21.341 --> 02:16:22.030
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

5034
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:25.090
<v Speaker 4>you need to have some type of like self awareness,</v>

5035
02:16:25.091 --> 02:16:28.120
<v Speaker 4>like the people who you know don't do well with cannabis,</v>

5036
02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:29.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5037
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.863
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't have</v>

5038
02:16:30.230 --> 02:16:34.140
<v Speaker 6>to have your friends tell you that he came in like you're not doing too well.</v>

5039
02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:36.130
<v Speaker 6>You should be able to figure out yourself.</v>

5040
02:16:36.390 --> 02:16:37.570
<v Speaker 6>But that's hard for people.</v>

5041
02:16:37.571 --> 02:16:39.900
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's one of the most difficult things for people to do as itself.</v>

5042
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:40.450
<v Speaker 6>Upset,</v>

5043
02:16:40.450 --> 02:16:42.880
<v Speaker 6>self assess to be objective,</v>

5044
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:43.291
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

5045
02:16:43.291 --> 02:16:43.480
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5046
02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:44.290
<v Speaker 6>and that it's,</v>

5047
02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:47.410
<v Speaker 6>I've obviously I've heard from a lot of people who used heavily and seen other</v>

5048
02:16:47.411 --> 02:16:50.590
<v Speaker 6>people who've used heavily in the last month and I think is very interesting why</v>

5049
02:16:50.591 --> 02:16:53.810
<v Speaker 6>people continue to use when they're getting paranoid and,</v>

5050
02:16:54.310 --> 02:16:55.210
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

5051
02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:57.130
<v Speaker 6>the most cogent argument,</v>

5052
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.551
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>

5053
02:16:57.551 --> 02:16:58.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

5054
02:16:58.170 --> 02:16:58.680
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

5055
02:16:58.680 --> 02:16:58.901
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5056
02:16:58.901 --> 02:17:01.250
<v Speaker 6>I've smoked a handful of times in college and African,</v>

5057
02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:04.960
<v Speaker 6>I actually don't think I'd be comfortable using high THC cannabis now knowing</v>

5058
02:17:04.961 --> 02:17:05.794
<v Speaker 6>what I know.</v>

5059
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:06.471
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

5060
02:17:06.471 --> 02:17:07.100
<v Speaker 6>so the p the,</v>

5061
02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:07.870
<v Speaker 6>the people,</v>

5062
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:08.560
<v Speaker 6>the most Godson,</v>

5063
02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:09.393
<v Speaker 6>Ryan here,</v>

5064
02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:13.430
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5065
02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:14.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get hot box.</v>

5066
02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:19.100
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you this shit to put [inaudible] on the</v>

5067
02:17:22.090 --> 02:17:22.720
<v Speaker 6>with the most,</v>

5068
02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:24.040
<v Speaker 6>the most cogent argument.</v>

5069
02:17:24.390 --> 02:17:25.570
<v Speaker 6>W I thought it was so interesting.</v>

5070
02:17:25.571 --> 02:17:25.961
<v Speaker 6>This guy said,</v>

5071
02:17:25.961 --> 02:17:26.711
<v Speaker 6>well you know my friends,</v>

5072
02:17:26.711 --> 02:17:27.544
<v Speaker 6>I would talk to them and say,</v>

5073
02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:30.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm paranoid now but I'm going to smoke through it.</v>

5074
02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:35.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to smoke so much that I'm almost comfortable being paranoid and I</v>

5075
02:17:35.171 --> 02:17:38.890
<v Speaker 6>think that's a dangerous thing to do to your mind cause you're,</v>

5076
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:43.480
<v Speaker 6>you're sort of counting on being able to step back from that and stop using you.</v>

5077
02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:43.930
<v Speaker 6>That's a,</v>

5078
02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:46.450
<v Speaker 6>that's a silly way of looking at it.</v>

5079
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:50.770
<v Speaker 6>I think that some of what we call paranoia,</v>

5080
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:55.830
<v Speaker 6>just normal paranoia is hypersensitivity and hyper awareness and awareness to a</v>

5081
02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:59.770
<v Speaker 6>lot of things that you're putting off in the back of your head because in order</v>

5082
02:17:59.771 --> 02:18:02.470
<v Speaker 6>to function as a normal person and get through this life,</v>

5083
02:18:02.471 --> 02:18:04.420
<v Speaker 6>you can't really be aware of everything.</v>

5084
02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:06.910
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise you'd be paralyzed by fear.</v>

5085
02:18:06.911 --> 02:18:07.990
<v Speaker 6>We're in space.</v>

5086
02:18:08.350 --> 02:18:08.651
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

5087
02:18:08.651 --> 02:18:10.510
<v Speaker 6>we are on a gigantic ball.</v>

5088
02:18:10.511 --> 02:18:13.900
<v Speaker 6>It's spinning a thousand miles an hour hurling through infinity.</v>

5089
02:18:13.930 --> 02:18:14.171
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>

5090
02:18:14.171 --> 02:18:15.430
<v Speaker 6>this is reality,</v>

5091
02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:18.700
<v Speaker 6>this and take us out thin layer of gas.</v>

5092
02:18:18.701 --> 02:18:22.340
<v Speaker 6>It's protecting us from everything that's flying around in our solar system.</v>

5093
02:18:22.350 --> 02:18:22.710
<v Speaker 6>By the way.</v>

5094
02:18:22.710 --> 02:18:26.740
<v Speaker 6>At best you get me five years and then it's all right and even if you make it to</v>

5095
02:18:26.741 --> 02:18:27.790
<v Speaker 6>a hundred the last 15</v>

5096
02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:33.380
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] stem cells and stuff.</v>

5097
02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:34.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5098
02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:38.800
<v Speaker 6>maybe a little live to be 300 what do you do with the universe is infinite like</v>

5099
02:18:38.850 --> 02:18:39.550
<v Speaker 6>you're going to die.</v>

5100
02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:42.010
<v Speaker 6>Like the sun is going to end like at the end.</v>

5101
02:18:42.011 --> 02:18:45.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean imagine if people do live to an infinite number where we realized that</v>

5102
02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:46.510
<v Speaker 6>fucking son is dying.</v>

5103
02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:48.070
<v Speaker 6>You're going to freak out about that.</v>

5104
02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:49.480
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's all relative,</v>

5105
02:18:49.481 --> 02:18:49.960
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5106
02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:50.601
<v Speaker 6>So there,</v>

5107
02:18:50.601 --> 02:18:55.510
<v Speaker 6>there's only so much you really can think about it and some of what paranoia is</v>

5108
02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:58.810
<v Speaker 6>is this hyper awareness of all these variables that you really haven't,</v>

5109
02:18:58.990 --> 02:18:59.823
<v Speaker 6>haven't considered.</v>

5110
02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.410
<v Speaker 6>And then also we were talking about before,</v>

5111
02:19:02.411 --> 02:19:06.040
<v Speaker 6>the things that can be beneficial to the hyper awareness of how you communicated</v>

5112
02:19:06.041 --> 02:19:06.530
<v Speaker 6>with people.</v>

5113
02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:08.050
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you could have done a better job with that.</v>

5114
02:19:08.051 --> 02:19:08.620
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you,</v>

5115
02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:09.670
<v Speaker 6>you came in hot,</v>

5116
02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:11.800
<v Speaker 6>maybe you were upset about something else when you ran into them.</v>

5117
02:19:11.801 --> 02:19:15.280
<v Speaker 6>You already had a seven and they brought you to a 10 it was totally unnecessary.</v>

5118
02:19:15.281 --> 02:19:19.780
<v Speaker 6>Within a normal situation you would have only been at a too that those things</v>

5119
02:19:19.781 --> 02:19:23.980
<v Speaker 6>are real and sometimes marijuana helps highlight all the errors in your way.</v>

5120
02:19:23.981 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 6>I think it can be a tool but my description of it is like any other tool</v>

5121
02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:29.233
<v Speaker 4>like a hammer,</v>

5122
02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:32.180
<v Speaker 4>you can build a house with a hammer or you can just hit yourself in the Dick if</v>

5123
02:19:32.181 --> 02:19:34.250
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking crazy and this,</v>

5124
02:19:34.251 --> 02:19:38.930
<v Speaker 4>this is something that I think we should consider when we're discussing almost</v>

5125
02:19:38.931 --> 02:19:41.000
<v Speaker 4>any psychedelic medicine and I think that,</v>

5126
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:44.420
<v Speaker 4>I really do believe that marijuana is a psychedelic and I don't even think it's</v>

5127
02:19:44.421 --> 02:19:45.254
<v Speaker 4>a mild one,</v>

5128
02:19:45.350 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 4>especially when it's an edible form.</v>

5129
02:19:47.271 --> 02:19:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's mild at all.</v>

5130
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:48.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5131
02:19:48.891 --> 02:19:49.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>

5132
02:19:49.271 --> 02:19:54.271
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that that come in to my office for example and like just</v>

5133
02:19:54.471 --> 02:19:55.191
<v Speaker 4>when I meet them,</v>

5134
02:19:55.191 --> 02:19:57.050
<v Speaker 4>like after one or two minutes I was just,</v>

5135
02:19:57.100 --> 02:19:58.280
<v Speaker 4>I just got it the side of my head,</v>

5136
02:19:58.310 --> 02:20:01.820
<v Speaker 4>this person's not using THC like this.</v>

5137
02:20:01.821 --> 02:20:04.600
<v Speaker 4>This person is anxious with gives you that.</v>

5138
02:20:04.601 --> 02:20:04.641
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

5139
02:20:04.641 --> 02:20:05.091
<v Speaker 4>was that what it is?</v>

5140
02:20:05.091 --> 02:20:05.750
<v Speaker 4>Anxious.</v>

5141
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:06.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5142
02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:07.910
<v Speaker 4>It's just a feeling of,</v>

5143
02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:08.773
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5144
02:20:08.930 --> 02:20:09.830
<v Speaker 4>they're not really,</v>

5145
02:20:09.831 --> 02:20:13.940
<v Speaker 4>they're not someone who can just sit and kind of like be by themself,</v>

5146
02:20:13.970 --> 02:20:14.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5147
02:20:14.151 --> 02:20:15.950
<v Speaker 4>they just kind of give me the impression that,</v>

5148
02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:16.960
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5149
02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:17.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5150
02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:17.350
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

5151
02:20:17.350 --> 02:20:18.900
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to do well with,</v>

5152
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:23.690
<v Speaker 4>with cannabis because if they have any type of change in their,</v>

5153
02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:24.530
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5154
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:25.460
<v Speaker 4>in their psyche,</v>

5155
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:26.750
<v Speaker 4>they're going to see that as bad.</v>

5156
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:27.560
<v Speaker 4>That's bad.</v>

5157
02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:28.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5158
02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.710
<v Speaker 4>and like you got it when you're using cannabis,</v>

5159
02:20:30.730 --> 02:20:31.080
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

5160
02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:32.780
<v Speaker 4>you have to be sewn and who,</v>

5161
02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:34.160
<v Speaker 4>who knows that okay.</v>

5162
02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Are going to get a little bit of maybe paranoia and out or at least my psyche is</v>

5163
02:20:38.301 --> 02:20:39.200
<v Speaker 4>going to change a little bit.</v>

5164
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I am using,</v>

5165
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5166
02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:43.580
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive substance and not be able to freak out.</v>

5167
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:44.031
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5168
02:20:44.031 --> 02:20:44.930
<v Speaker 4>But some people,</v>

5169
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.950
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5170
02:20:45.950 --> 02:20:46.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5171
02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:49.100
<v Speaker 4>I know that if they used a little bit of Thc,</v>

5172
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:50.570
<v Speaker 4>they probably would have a freak out.</v>

5173
02:20:50.571 --> 02:20:51.860
<v Speaker 4>They probably would have a bad experience.</v>

5174
02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:53.300
<v Speaker 4>Generally it's people who are,</v>

5175
02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:53.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5176
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:53.901
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

5177
02:20:53.901 --> 02:20:55.010
<v Speaker 4>very fearful.</v>

5178
02:20:55.250 --> 02:20:55.400
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

5179
02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:59.720
<v Speaker 4>the other side of that coin though is that if you CBD and like we discussed</v>

5180
02:20:59.721 --> 02:21:00.020
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>

5181
02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:01.490
<v Speaker 4>that could decrease learned fear,</v>

5182
02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:01.791
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5183
02:21:01.791 --> 02:21:02.210
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5184
02:21:02.210 --> 02:21:02.571
<v Speaker 4>so that,</v>

5185
02:21:02.571 --> 02:21:03.870
<v Speaker 4>so that's something that's,</v>

5186
02:21:03.871 --> 02:21:05.690
<v Speaker 4>that's really helpful for those patients.</v>

5187
02:21:05.691 --> 02:21:06.370
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

5188
02:21:06.370 --> 02:21:07.340
<v Speaker 4>I do agree that,</v>

5189
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:07.820
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5190
02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:07.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5191
02:21:07.971 --> 02:21:12.971
<v Speaker 4>we have to be careful about using high THC and certain groups of people.</v>

5192
02:21:13.431 --> 02:21:14.264
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

5193
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:16.310
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

5194
02:21:16.310 --> 02:21:16.570
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

5195
02:21:16.570 --> 02:21:18.120
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the,</v>

5196
02:21:18.121 --> 02:21:20.550
<v Speaker 2>and it's great to hear a doctor heart say this,</v>

5197
02:21:20.551 --> 02:21:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5198
02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:24.420
<v Speaker 2>one of the real disappointments for me with this book has been really the</v>

5199
02:21:24.421 --> 02:21:26.790
<v Speaker 2>biggest disappointing for me has been that the DPA,</v>

5200
02:21:26.791 --> 02:21:27.810
<v Speaker 2>the drug policy alliance,</v>

5201
02:21:27.811 --> 02:21:29.280
<v Speaker 2>and that some of the other advocates,</v>

5202
02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:31.110
<v Speaker 2>they just want to yell at me.</v>

5203
02:21:31.290 --> 02:21:34.320
<v Speaker 2>And I want to say that I don't understand correlation and causation and that I'm</v>

5204
02:21:34.321 --> 02:21:35.340
<v Speaker 2>cherry picking studies.</v>

5205
02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

5206
02:21:36.510 --> 02:21:40.410
<v Speaker 2>let's acknowledge that a lot of people use this drug and that's true,</v>

5207
02:21:40.411 --> 02:21:42.060
<v Speaker 2>whether it's legal or not.</v>

5208
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:43.260
<v Speaker 2>And let's acknowledge that.</v>

5209
02:21:43.261 --> 02:21:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Probably in 2020 certainly if there's a democrat elected,</v>

5210
02:21:46.111 --> 02:21:47.960
<v Speaker 2>most of the Democratic candidates have said they,</v>

5211
02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:49.290
<v Speaker 2>they favor legalization.</v>

5212
02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:53.430
<v Speaker 2>There will legalize cannabis will probably be the law in the United States.</v>

5213
02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5214
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:57.790
<v Speaker 2>And let's talk about what we're going to tell people who are using and,</v>

5215
02:21:57.850 --> 02:21:58.380
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

5216
02:21:58.380 --> 02:21:58.831
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

5217
02:21:58.831 --> 02:22:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I had this round table with,</v>

5218
02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:00.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5219
02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:03.600
<v Speaker 2>the executive director of the DPA and some other people.</v>

5220
02:22:03.601 --> 02:22:04.200
<v Speaker 2>This was a,</v>

5221
02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:05.340
<v Speaker 2>this is about a month ago,</v>

5222
02:22:05.370 --> 02:22:05.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5223
02:22:05.570 --> 02:22:07.110
<v Speaker 2>short of shortly after the book came out.</v>

5224
02:22:07.350 --> 02:22:12.030
<v Speaker 2>And I propose what I thought were really common sense warnings and she basically</v>

5225
02:22:12.031 --> 02:22:12.601
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't agree.</v>

5226
02:22:12.601 --> 02:22:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean she agreed to like one of the five of them or what were the warnings you</v>

5227
02:22:15.811 --> 02:22:16.230
<v Speaker 2>proposed?</v>

5228
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:17.040
<v Speaker 2>It was stuff like,</v>

5229
02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:17.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5230
02:22:17.370 --> 02:22:18.300
<v Speaker 2>if cannabis,</v>

5231
02:22:18.301 --> 02:22:20.490
<v Speaker 2>if you have a family history of severe mental illness,</v>

5232
02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:22.170
<v Speaker 2>you probably should not use cannabis.</v>

5233
02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5234
02:22:23.010 --> 02:22:23.611
<v Speaker 2>you probably,</v>

5235
02:22:23.611 --> 02:22:25.890
<v Speaker 2>you should not use camp or try to your use</v>

5236
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:27.270
<v Speaker 5>until you're in your 20s,</v>

5237
02:22:27.271 --> 02:22:28.104
<v Speaker 5>I think was one of them.</v>

5238
02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:29.640
<v Speaker 5>And one of them I thought,</v>

5239
02:22:29.650 --> 02:22:32.010
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't believe I was getting pushed back on this was,</v>

5240
02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:33.270
<v Speaker 5>was something like,</v>

5241
02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:34.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5242
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.680
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

5243
02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:36.630
<v Speaker 5>if you're having strange,</v>

5244
02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:37.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5245
02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:37.680
<v Speaker 5>thoughts,</v>

5246
02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:39.180
<v Speaker 5>especially paranoid thoughts,</v>

5247
02:22:39.181 --> 02:22:40.320
<v Speaker 5>will using cannabis,</v>

5248
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:41.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5249
02:22:41.310 --> 02:22:44.640
<v Speaker 5>the drug may be increasing your risk for severe mental illness and you should</v>

5250
02:22:44.641 --> 02:22:45.474
<v Speaker 5>not use it.</v>

5251
02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:45.661
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5252
02:22:45.661 --> 02:22:46.494
<v Speaker 5>I think that's,</v>

5253
02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:47.550
<v Speaker 5>I think if you know,</v>

5254
02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:47.911
<v Speaker 5>now look,</v>

5255
02:22:47.911 --> 02:22:50.430
<v Speaker 5>we can argue about how severe severe is,</v>

5256
02:22:50.431 --> 02:22:50.701
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5257
02:22:50.701 --> 02:22:52.980
<v Speaker 5>But certainly if you wind up in the er,</v>

5258
02:22:53.130 --> 02:22:53.963
<v Speaker 5>even once,</v>

5259
02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:56.190
<v Speaker 5>that's a bad sign and I just,</v>

5260
02:22:56.370 --> 02:22:58.550
<v Speaker 5>I just don't understand why the legalization can be,</v>

5261
02:22:58.600 --> 02:22:58.801
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5262
02:22:58.801 --> 02:23:02.010
<v Speaker 5>I can understand why people who are selling this drug don't care.</v>

5263
02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:02.251
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5264
02:23:02.251 --> 02:23:03.720
<v Speaker 5>We know if you know,</v>

5265
02:23:03.810 --> 02:23:05.070
<v Speaker 5>if tobacco is taught us,</v>

5266
02:23:05.071 --> 02:23:06.900
<v Speaker 5>one thing is that when you're selling a product,</v>

5267
02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:09.240
<v Speaker 5>you will sell it to people even if it kills them.</v>

5268
02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5269
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:14.610
<v Speaker 5>But I don't understand why these people who are supposed to be science driven</v>

5270
02:23:14.670 --> 02:23:18.660
<v Speaker 5>and supposed to be thinking about the greater good won't agree to reasonable</v>

5271
02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:21.210
<v Speaker 5>discussions about the what the warnings should be on this.</v>

5272
02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:25.200
<v Speaker 5>I think you did yourself a slight disservice by not including some of the</v>

5273
02:23:25.201 --> 02:23:26.940
<v Speaker 5>beneficial aspects of cannabis.</v>

5274
02:23:26.941 --> 02:23:28.140
<v Speaker 5>I understand your perspective.</v>

5275
02:23:28.141 --> 02:23:30.660
<v Speaker 5>I understand why you were doing that because you really wanted to highlight the</v>

5276
02:23:30.661 --> 02:23:31.111
<v Speaker 5>dangerous,</v>

5277
02:23:31.111 --> 02:23:34.050
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's one of the things that they can point to when they say you</v>

5278
02:23:34.051 --> 02:23:34.980
<v Speaker 5>cherry picked data.</v>

5279
02:23:35.550 --> 02:23:39.870
<v Speaker 5>But I think that also it's really important to when you're having these kinds of</v>

5280
02:23:39.871 --> 02:23:41.580
<v Speaker 5>conversations to have a long one.</v>

5281
02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:42.421
<v Speaker 5>I mean this,</v>

5282
02:23:42.421 --> 02:23:44.640
<v Speaker 5>we've really covered the full gamut.</v>

5283
02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:44.980
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5284
02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5285
02:23:45.390 --> 02:23:48.090
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's probably one of the reasons why bill Maher didn't want to</v>

5286
02:23:48.091 --> 02:23:50.700
<v Speaker 5>have you on because he's got five other people on the panel.</v>

5287
02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:53.730
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's talking over everybody and you have five minutes to get your case</v>

5288
02:23:53.731 --> 02:23:53.971
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

5289
02:23:53.971 --> 02:23:55.110
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think it's possible.</v>

5290
02:23:55.350 --> 02:23:56.280
<v Speaker 5>I think this is a really,</v>

5291
02:23:56.700 --> 02:24:01.700
<v Speaker 5>this is a long complicated discussion that has to do with biological variability</v>

5292
02:24:01.891 --> 02:24:04.860
<v Speaker 5>is it has to do with unique situations with human,</v>

5293
02:24:04.890 --> 02:24:05.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5294
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:07.110
<v Speaker 5>the human psychology,</v>

5295
02:24:07.111 --> 02:24:08.610
<v Speaker 5>the way the brain functions,</v>

5296
02:24:08.611 --> 02:24:13.140
<v Speaker 5>whether or not it can act as a trigger to schizophrenia where someone may not</v>

5297
02:24:13.141 --> 02:24:14.790
<v Speaker 5>have ever experienced that trigger without it.</v>

5298
02:24:14.940 --> 02:24:18.180
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if they just became a long distance runner and they would have lived a</v>

5299
02:24:18.181 --> 02:24:20.160
<v Speaker 5>healthy life with no psychotic breaks at all,</v>

5300
02:24:20.161 --> 02:24:21.180
<v Speaker 5>we don't really know.</v>

5301
02:24:21.330 --> 02:24:22.081
<v Speaker 5>And unfortunately,</v>

5302
02:24:22.081 --> 02:24:23.670
<v Speaker 5>once someone goes off the deep end,</v>

5303
02:24:23.671 --> 02:24:24.840
<v Speaker 5>we might never find out.</v>

5304
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:26.370
<v Speaker 5>And sorry,</v>

5305
02:24:26.371 --> 02:24:26.700
<v Speaker 5>go on.</v>

5306
02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:26.881
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5307
02:24:26.881 --> 02:24:27.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying,</v>

5308
02:24:27.450 --> 02:24:32.450
<v Speaker 5>I think we have to be very careful in saying we know what it does.</v>

5309
02:24:33.091 --> 02:24:34.320
<v Speaker 5>We know what anything does.</v>

5310
02:24:34.321 --> 02:24:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Cause you don't know,</v>

5311
02:24:35.370 --> 02:24:36.660
<v Speaker 5>you know what it does for you.</v>

5312
02:24:36.930 --> 02:24:37.171
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5313
02:24:37.171 --> 02:24:37.530
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

5314
02:24:37.530 --> 02:24:39.300
<v Speaker 5>some people can't eat fish,</v>

5315
02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:39.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5316
02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:40.061
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

5317
02:24:40.061 --> 02:24:40.301
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

5318
02:24:40.301 --> 02:24:41.820
<v Speaker 5>they fucking shellfish and their,</v>

5319
02:24:41.821 --> 02:24:43.110
<v Speaker 5>their throats seizes up.</v>

5320
02:24:43.350 --> 02:24:43.621
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

5321
02:24:43.621 --> 02:24:47.130
<v Speaker 5>there's so many variables when it comes to the human body,</v>

5322
02:24:47.310 --> 02:24:50.130
<v Speaker 5>whether it's your genetics or you know,</v>

5323
02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:54.150
<v Speaker 5>w what you've eaten in the past and how it's shaped your gut biome.</v>

5324
02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:59.190
<v Speaker 5>There's so much that we don't know and don't understand about how we interact</v>

5325
02:24:59.191 --> 02:25:01.710
<v Speaker 5>with all the various substances that we take into our body.</v>

5326
02:25:01.770 --> 02:25:02.150
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5327
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5328
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:03.940
<v Speaker 5>What one thing though too,</v>

5329
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:04.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5330
02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:05.220
<v Speaker 5>I noticed in your book,</v>

5331
02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:05.581
<v Speaker 5>Alex,</v>

5332
02:25:05.581 --> 02:25:06.000
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

5333
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:06.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5334
02:25:06.211 --> 02:25:09.840
<v Speaker 5>you said that you didn't think that cannabis can help the opioid epidemic.</v>

5335
02:25:09.841 --> 02:25:10.290
<v Speaker 5>Is that true?</v>

5336
02:25:10.290 --> 02:25:14.460
<v Speaker 5>I certainly don't think it's a good idea for people who are at risk of opioid</v>

5337
02:25:14.461 --> 02:25:15.240
<v Speaker 5>use.</v>

5338
02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:15.571
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5339
02:25:15.571 --> 02:25:16.140
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

5340
02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:16.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5341
02:25:16.470 --> 02:25:19.200
<v Speaker 5>I have seen a lot of people in my practice,</v>

5342
02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:19.470
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5343
02:25:19.470 --> 02:25:22.350
<v Speaker 5>come off of opioids with cannabis use and there are,</v>

5344
02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:22.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5345
02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 5>various medical studies</v>

5346
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:26.470
<v Speaker 4>that do show that people who use cannabis,</v>

5347
02:25:26.471 --> 02:25:29.080
<v Speaker 4>Kane came replace opioids,</v>

5348
02:25:29.290 --> 02:25:29.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5349
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:30.340
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

5350
02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:31.490
<v Speaker 4>with the cannabis space.</v>

5351
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:33.540
<v Speaker 4>Folks feel though that that's a pen in,</v>

5352
02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:33.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5353
02:25:33.770 --> 02:25:37.600
<v Speaker 4>in defense of that does just a patch and they're really the best way to get off</v>

5354
02:25:37.601 --> 02:25:38.890
<v Speaker 4>of opiates as a game.</v>

5355
02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:41.520
<v Speaker 4>And then I became w w the,</v>

5356
02:25:41.550 --> 02:25:46.240
<v Speaker 4>the repeat rate of addiction where people try it again afterwards is really low.</v>

5357
02:25:46.390 --> 02:25:47.223
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

5358
02:25:47.470 --> 02:25:47.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5359
02:25:47.741 --> 02:25:50.500
<v Speaker 4>one of the things with that is just the accessibility,</v>

5360
02:25:50.530 --> 02:25:51.460
<v Speaker 4>the affordability.</v>

5361
02:25:51.461 --> 02:25:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Like I've never administered Ibogaine before.</v>

5362
02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:55.493
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5363
02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:57.280
<v Speaker 4>it's illegal in the United States,</v>

5364
02:25:57.281 --> 02:25:58.330
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

5365
02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:01.900
<v Speaker 4>and it's a particularly ruthless medication that I've never tried personally,</v>

5366
02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:03.580
<v Speaker 4>but the people that I know that have tried it,</v>

5367
02:26:03.581 --> 02:26:05.080
<v Speaker 4>I've had spectacular results,</v>

5368
02:26:05.081 --> 02:26:08.460
<v Speaker 4>especially people that have had problems with pills and fracked.</v>

5369
02:26:08.470 --> 02:26:09.131
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine,</v>

5370
02:26:09.131 --> 02:26:09.941
<v Speaker 4>my friend Ed Clay,</v>

5371
02:26:09.941 --> 02:26:13.420
<v Speaker 4>he opened up a clinic in Mexico based on his own interaction with,</v>

5372
02:26:13.421 --> 02:26:13.631
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5373
02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:14.464
<v Speaker 4>with pills.</v>

5374
02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:15.670
<v Speaker 4>He had an injury.</v>

5375
02:26:15.671 --> 02:26:18.880
<v Speaker 4>He got hooked on the pills and a really had a fucking problem.</v>

5376
02:26:18.881 --> 02:26:22.900
<v Speaker 4>So went down to Mexico and went through an Ibogaine a session and cured him.</v>

5377
02:26:22.930 --> 02:26:23.770
<v Speaker 4>Just whacked it out.</v>

5378
02:26:23.771 --> 02:26:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Did it change,</v>

5379
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:28.060
<v Speaker 4>literally changes the way your brain interfaces with your addiction?</v>

5380
02:26:28.061 --> 02:26:28.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

5381
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:30.970
<v Speaker 4>it's not simply a prospective enhancer.</v>

5382
02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:31.710
<v Speaker 4>It looks,</v>

5383
02:26:31.710 --> 02:26:31.881
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

5384
02:26:31.881 --> 02:26:33.580
<v Speaker 4>it changes how you,</v>

5385
02:26:33.610 --> 02:26:35.800
<v Speaker 4>your body and your brain deal with,</v>

5386
02:26:36.010 --> 02:26:36.843
<v Speaker 4>with opiates.</v>

5387
02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:40.600
<v Speaker 4>I think a Tim Ferriss is actually talked about that before as well.</v>

5388
02:26:40.780 --> 02:26:41.613
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5389
02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:42.461
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

5390
02:26:42.461 --> 02:26:42.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5391
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:46.030
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it in my practice and there are medical studies,</v>

5392
02:26:46.031 --> 02:26:48.670
<v Speaker 4>so I don't think that we should throw out the fact that,</v>

5393
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:49.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5394
02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:49.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5395
02:26:49.421 --> 02:26:52.000
<v Speaker 4>cannabis can can help the opioid crisis.</v>

5396
02:26:52.001 --> 02:26:52.950
<v Speaker 4>And then also too,</v>

5397
02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:53.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5398
02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:56.140
<v Speaker 4>you want to look at it from a clinical perspective,</v>

5399
02:26:56.141 --> 02:26:56.351
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5400
02:26:56.351 --> 02:26:58.780
<v Speaker 4>So we know that opioids can kill people,</v>

5401
02:26:58.781 --> 02:26:59.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5402
02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:00.070
<v Speaker 4>Because it acts on the brain.</v>

5403
02:27:00.071 --> 02:27:00.730
<v Speaker 4>Stann whereas,</v>

5404
02:27:00.730 --> 02:27:01.210
<v Speaker 4>whereas,</v>

5405
02:27:01.210 --> 02:27:01.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5406
02:27:01.391 --> 02:27:02.380
<v Speaker 4>cannabis doesn't,</v>

5407
02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:03.220
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

5408
02:27:03.220 --> 02:27:03.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5409
02:27:03.551 --> 02:27:04.540
<v Speaker 4>you might be saying,</v>

5410
02:27:04.541 --> 02:27:04.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5411
02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:07.090
<v Speaker 4>you're just substituting one for the other.</v>

5412
02:27:07.330 --> 02:27:07.631
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

5413
02:27:07.631 --> 02:27:09.190
<v Speaker 4>sometimes that is true,</v>

5414
02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:12.190
<v Speaker 4>but if you're using a less harmful substance,</v>

5415
02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:12.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5416
02:27:12.551 --> 02:27:14.440
<v Speaker 4>to me that's like a huge win,</v>

5417
02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:14.891
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5418
02:27:14.891 --> 02:27:16.250
<v Speaker 4>So if someone you know,</v>

5419
02:27:16.270 --> 02:27:21.270
<v Speaker 4>has to drink 12 beers a night versus smoking like one joint,</v>

5420
02:27:21.430 --> 02:27:21.761
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5421
02:27:21.761 --> 02:27:23.050
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>

5422
02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:23.351
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5423
02:27:23.351 --> 02:27:24.011
<v Speaker 4>you look at all,</v>

5424
02:27:24.011 --> 02:27:26.650
<v Speaker 4>all these clinics like you look at like Methadone clinics.</v>

5425
02:27:26.651 --> 02:27:26.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5426
02:27:26.891 --> 02:27:27.780
<v Speaker 4>what are they doing there?</v>

5427
02:27:27.781 --> 02:27:30.640
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to get people off one substance to,</v>

5428
02:27:30.670 --> 02:27:30.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5429
02:27:30.881 --> 02:27:33.520
<v Speaker 4>a substance that is a little bit less harmful.</v>

5430
02:27:33.790 --> 02:27:34.960
<v Speaker 4>And I think that when you,</v>

5431
02:27:34.961 --> 02:27:36.070
<v Speaker 4>when you use cannabis,</v>

5432
02:27:36.210 --> 02:27:36.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5433
02:27:36.431 --> 02:27:37.540
<v Speaker 4>it can be effective,</v>

5434
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5435
02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:38.050
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

5436
02:27:38.050 --> 02:27:38.883
<v Speaker 4>for opioids.</v>

5437
02:27:39.010 --> 02:27:40.170
<v Speaker 4>It can also be effective for,</v>

5438
02:27:40.171 --> 02:27:42.790
<v Speaker 4>for benzodiazepines and for other medicines as well.</v>

5439
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:43.390
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5440
02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:44.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5441
02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:46.690
<v Speaker 4>I would it be awesome if everyone would just,</v>

5442
02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:46.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5443
02:27:46.931 --> 02:27:51.700
<v Speaker 4>feel happy and great all the time by just exercise and nutrition and you know,</v>

5444
02:27:51.701 --> 02:27:54.880
<v Speaker 4>that's what I advocate and that's what I try to do personally.</v>

5445
02:27:54.881 --> 02:27:55.840
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I try to,</v>

5446
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:56.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5447
02:27:56.170 --> 02:27:58.210
<v Speaker 4>say to my patients all the time.</v>

5448
02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:00.280
<v Speaker 4>But I understand though that,</v>

5449
02:28:00.310 --> 02:28:00.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5450
02:28:00.521 --> 02:28:02.320
<v Speaker 4>sometimes life is hard.</v>

5451
02:28:02.321 --> 02:28:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes,</v>

5452
02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:03.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5453
02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:04.360
<v Speaker 4>if things hit you,</v>

5454
02:28:04.510 --> 02:28:04.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5455
02:28:04.721 --> 02:28:05.171
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

5456
02:28:05.171 --> 02:28:06.280
<v Speaker 4>you have crisis in your life,</v>

5457
02:28:06.281 --> 02:28:06.760
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

5458
02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:06.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5459
02:28:06.971 --> 02:28:10.780
<v Speaker 4>personal crisis that can throw off your mental health and then you have your get</v>

5460
02:28:10.781 --> 02:28:11.920
<v Speaker 4>into a car accident,</v>

5461
02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:12.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5462
02:28:12.430 --> 02:28:14.230
<v Speaker 4>and you could be in really severe pain.</v>

5463
02:28:14.231 --> 02:28:14.541
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5464
02:28:14.541 --> 02:28:15.730
<v Speaker 4>and in those times,</v>

5465
02:28:16.090 --> 02:28:16.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5466
02:28:16.301 --> 02:28:17.650
<v Speaker 4>sometimes diet,</v>

5467
02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:18.580
<v Speaker 4>exercise,</v>

5468
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:19.780
<v Speaker 4>meditation,</v>

5469
02:28:19.810 --> 02:28:23.000
<v Speaker 4>doing all the right things just isn't quite enough.</v>

5470
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:23.841
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

5471
02:28:23.841 --> 02:28:28.310
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's great that we have cannabis for those situations because it</v>

5472
02:28:28.311 --> 02:28:29.420
<v Speaker 4>does seem to be,</v>

5473
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:29.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5474
02:28:29.811 --> 02:28:34.730
<v Speaker 4>very effective and has less side effects compared to some of the other metals is</v>

5475
02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:38.570
<v Speaker 4>compared to some of the other medicines that we have traditionally used.</v>

5476
02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:39.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5477
02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:39.861
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

5478
02:28:39.861 --> 02:28:40.430
<v Speaker 4>even though,</v>

5479
02:28:40.430 --> 02:28:40.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5480
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about opiates and deaths,</v>

5481
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:43.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5482
02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:45.100
<v Speaker 4>we can also talk about insets,</v>

5483
02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:45.351
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5484
02:28:45.351 --> 02:28:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Like nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.</v>

5485
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:49.880
<v Speaker 4>So these drugs can also,</v>

5486
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:50.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5487
02:28:50.181 --> 02:28:51.950
<v Speaker 4>wreck havoc on your GI system.</v>

5488
02:28:52.210 --> 02:28:52.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5489
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:53.540
<v Speaker 4>I saw one study,</v>

5490
02:28:53.541 --> 02:28:53.811
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

5491
02:28:53.811 --> 02:28:54.644
<v Speaker 4>I tweeted out,</v>

5492
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:55.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5493
02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda Patrick tweeted out said that if you use a and sets,</v>

5494
02:28:58.821 --> 02:28:59.750
<v Speaker 4>it was really short.</v>

5495
02:28:59.751 --> 02:29:00.860
<v Speaker 4>I got to look it up again,</v>

5496
02:29:00.861 --> 02:29:02.180
<v Speaker 4>but it was like two weeks.</v>

5497
02:29:02.181 --> 02:29:03.410
<v Speaker 4>It can decrease your,</v>

5498
02:29:03.411 --> 02:29:03.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5499
02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:04.700
<v Speaker 4>your gonadotropins,</v>

5500
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:08.000
<v Speaker 4>which can stimulate your testosterone level by like 25%.</v>

5501
02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:09.320
<v Speaker 4>And on that note too,</v>

5502
02:29:09.321 --> 02:29:10.154
<v Speaker 4>we should talk about,</v>

5503
02:29:10.290 --> 02:29:11.630
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I forgot to talk about this,</v>

5504
02:29:11.631 --> 02:29:14.180
<v Speaker 4>but opioids can drastically,</v>

5505
02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:15.020
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5506
02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:15.801
<v Speaker 4>inhibit your,</v>

5507
02:29:15.801 --> 02:29:16.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5508
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.441
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

5509
02:29:16.441 --> 02:29:16.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5510
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:17.660
<v Speaker 4>testosterone production.</v>

5511
02:29:17.690 --> 02:29:18.110
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5512
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:23.110
<v Speaker 4>Which is a huge thing for depression because I've had guys come in to me before,</v>

5513
02:29:23.350 --> 02:29:23.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5514
02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:25.220
<v Speaker 4>that have been a really,</v>

5515
02:29:25.221 --> 02:29:26.054
<v Speaker 4>really depressed,</v>

5516
02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:28.460
<v Speaker 4>you just give them a small amount of testosterone in men.</v>

5517
02:29:28.490 --> 02:29:30.620
<v Speaker 4>They're off their antidepressants and they're off to the races.</v>

5518
02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:31.633
<v Speaker 4>They're doing great.</v>

5519
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:32.510
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5520
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:32.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5521
02:29:32.781 --> 02:29:35.000
<v Speaker 4>are we creating a lot of people who are,</v>

5522
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:39.380
<v Speaker 4>who are depressed because they're using opiates and their testosterone levels</v>

5523
02:29:39.381 --> 02:29:40.190
<v Speaker 4>are low.</v>

5524
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.581
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

5525
02:29:40.581 --> 02:29:41.270
<v Speaker 4>for men,</v>

5526
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:42.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean having low testosterone,</v>

5527
02:29:42.421 --> 02:29:43.251
<v Speaker 4>it's horrible.</v>

5528
02:29:43.251 --> 02:29:43.431
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5529
02:29:43.431 --> 02:29:44.900
<v Speaker 4>your libido goes,</v>

5530
02:29:44.901 --> 02:29:45.171
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

5531
02:29:45.171 --> 02:29:46.700
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have low motivation.</v>

5532
02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5533
02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:47.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5534
02:29:47.421 --> 02:29:48.560
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to feel as well,</v>

5535
02:29:48.561 --> 02:29:49.670
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna want to do things.</v>

5536
02:29:49.850 --> 02:29:50.300
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5537
02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:50.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5538
02:29:50.690 --> 02:29:51.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5539
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:53.110
<v Speaker 4>if you're giving someone a medicine that,</v>

5540
02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:53.630
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

5541
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:54.341
<v Speaker 4>that nails there,</v>

5542
02:29:54.341 --> 02:29:55.730
<v Speaker 4>their testosterone levels down,</v>

5543
02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:58.610
<v Speaker 4>that's gonna really wreck wreck,</v>

5544
02:29:58.611 --> 02:29:59.900
<v Speaker 4>wreck havoc on their mental health.</v>

5545
02:30:00.270 --> 02:30:04.010
<v Speaker 4>And I just want to make a note to cause Ben Greenfield who again,</v>

5546
02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:04.401
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>

5547
02:30:04.401 --> 02:30:05.061
<v Speaker 4>really respect.</v>

5548
02:30:05.061 --> 02:30:05.990
<v Speaker 4>I like that guy a lot.</v>

5549
02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:06.830
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5550
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:07.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5551
02:30:07.101 --> 02:30:10.120
<v Speaker 4>it was talking a little bit with you about testosterone and um,</v>

5552
02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:11.570
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

5553
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:11.820
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5554
02:30:11.820 --> 02:30:12.081
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5555
02:30:12.081 --> 02:30:13.430
<v Speaker 4>and cannabis and how it can drop it.</v>

5556
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:16.820
<v Speaker 4>So I think there was three studies I saw done on,</v>

5557
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:17.703
<v Speaker 4>on humans,</v>

5558
02:30:17.930 --> 02:30:18.590
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5559
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:23.590
<v Speaker 4>and two of them a note at no statistical difference and drop into Saas and</v>

5560
02:30:24.191 --> 02:30:26.030
<v Speaker 4>levels and one study.</v>

5561
02:30:26.031 --> 02:30:28.940
<v Speaker 4>The other study noted a small statistical difference.</v>

5562
02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5563
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:30.430
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

5564
02:30:30.430 --> 02:30:30.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5565
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:31.490
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

5566
02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:31.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5567
02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:34.670
<v Speaker 4>it may drop your testosterone levels a little bit,</v>

5568
02:30:34.671 --> 02:30:35.700
<v Speaker 4>but it's not gonna,</v>

5569
02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:35.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5570
02:30:35.991 --> 02:30:37.700
<v Speaker 4>substantially drop them.</v>

5571
02:30:37.701 --> 02:30:38.720
<v Speaker 4>So just so people,</v>

5572
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:40.910
<v Speaker 4>people know know that because I know that comes up,</v>

5573
02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:41.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5574
02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:42.590
<v Speaker 4>all the time,</v>

5575
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:43.423
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

5576
02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:44.041
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5577
02:30:44.041 --> 02:30:44.540
<v Speaker 2>There's the,</v>

5578
02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:45.290
<v Speaker 2>as the,</v>

5579
02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:48.530
<v Speaker 2>as the dumb anti drug advocates like to say doobies caused boobies.</v>

5580
02:30:52.390 --> 02:30:53.850
<v Speaker 2>That is not right.</v>

5581
02:30:54.170 --> 02:30:57.460
<v Speaker 2>There's no goal associated with that.</v>

5582
02:30:57.680 --> 02:30:58.513
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5583
02:30:58.820 --> 02:30:59.653
<v Speaker 2>I'm joking.</v>

5584
02:31:00.010 --> 02:31:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5585
02:31:00.530 --> 02:31:01.740
<v Speaker 2>risperdol causes,</v>

5586
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:03.620
<v Speaker 2>that's a different issue.</v>

5587
02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Respire Dawson anti psychotic,</v>

5588
02:31:05.730 --> 02:31:06.563
<v Speaker 2>but spirits.</v>

5589
02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:07.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5590
02:31:07.850 --> 02:31:08.780
<v Speaker 2>so look,</v>

5591
02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:10.513
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

5592
02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I think the issue of whether cannabis is a gateway drug,</v>

5593
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.810
<v Speaker 2>it's 100% clear that cannabis is a gateway drug.</v>

5594
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:20.730
<v Speaker 2>The argument is we say has a hundred percent a hundred percent clear.</v>

5595
02:31:20.850 --> 02:31:21.750
<v Speaker 2>The argument is why.</v>

5596
02:31:21.810 --> 02:31:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5597
02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:23.130
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

5598
02:31:23.130 --> 02:31:28.130
<v Speaker 2>so it's quite clear that cannabis use oftentimes proceeds other drug use,</v>

5599
02:31:28.650 --> 02:31:29.461
<v Speaker 2>whether it's opioids,</v>

5600
02:31:29.461 --> 02:31:29.970
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>

5601
02:31:29.970 --> 02:31:30.803
<v Speaker 2>other drugs.</v>

5602
02:31:30.810 --> 02:31:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Now one argument,</v>

5603
02:31:32.581 --> 02:31:34.500
<v Speaker 2>and this is actually a pro legalization argument,</v>

5604
02:31:34.501 --> 02:31:38.910
<v Speaker 2>is one reason it's a gateway is that if it's illegal,</v>

5605
02:31:38.911 --> 02:31:40.980
<v Speaker 2>you got to buy it from your friendly neighborhood dealer.</v>

5606
02:31:41.130 --> 02:31:43.380
<v Speaker 2>He might have access to heroin or cocaine,</v>

5607
02:31:43.381 --> 02:31:44.214
<v Speaker 2>other drugs.</v>

5608
02:31:44.370 --> 02:31:47.850
<v Speaker 2>And so eventually maybe you decide to try one of those other drugs.</v>

5609
02:31:47.850 --> 02:31:49.720
<v Speaker 2>So actually that's really why the Dutch legalized,</v>

5610
02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:54.120
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to create an avenue for people to use cannabis that wasn't connected</v>

5611
02:31:54.121 --> 02:31:55.500
<v Speaker 2>to other drugs.</v>

5612
02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:56.393
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5613
02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Another possibility is that using an addictive intoxicating substance,</v>

5614
02:32:00.580 --> 02:32:03.270
<v Speaker 2>you might like it and you might want to try other addictive,</v>

5615
02:32:03.271 --> 02:32:05.610
<v Speaker 2>intoxicating substances and it might prime your brain.</v>

5616
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.420
<v Speaker 2>And then the third possibility really is that they're just some people who are</v>

5617
02:32:09.421 --> 02:32:10.410
<v Speaker 2>risk takers out there,</v>

5618
02:32:10.440 --> 02:32:10.741
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5619
02:32:10.741 --> 02:32:11.520
<v Speaker 2>They use,</v>

5620
02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:12.660
<v Speaker 2>they're going to use cannabis,</v>

5621
02:32:12.661 --> 02:32:13.530
<v Speaker 2>they're going to gamble,</v>

5622
02:32:13.531 --> 02:32:17.340
<v Speaker 2>they're going to in cannabis is a little bit easier to access than other drugs.</v>

5623
02:32:17.341 --> 02:32:19.380
<v Speaker 2>So they're probably going to try cannabis first.</v>

5624
02:32:19.410 --> 02:32:22.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's not really that that cannabis drives the use,</v>

5625
02:32:22.711 --> 02:32:24.150
<v Speaker 2>it's just the cannabis is first.</v>

5626
02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:25.260
<v Speaker 2>They're just curious people.</v>

5627
02:32:25.430 --> 02:32:26.570
<v Speaker 2>What's your thoughts on,</v>

5628
02:32:26.730 --> 02:32:27.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5629
02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:27.991
<v Speaker 2>what I will say,</v>

5630
02:32:27.991 --> 02:32:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm just going to go back to the NAM report,</v>

5631
02:32:30.331 --> 02:32:30.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5632
02:32:30.600 --> 02:32:30.990
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

5633
02:32:30.990 --> 02:32:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean you quoted these people in your book,</v>

5634
02:32:33.970 --> 02:32:34.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5635
02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:34.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5636
02:32:34.681 --> 02:32:38.820
<v Speaker 2>so this committee couldn't find sufficient data demonstrating an association</v>

5637
02:32:38.821 --> 02:32:41.040
<v Speaker 2>between cannabis use and initially the opioid use,</v>

5638
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:44.670
<v Speaker 2>they found no compelling evidence to support the gateway drug theory.</v>

5639
02:32:44.671 --> 02:32:45.210
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5640
02:32:45.210 --> 02:32:46.043
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>

5641
02:32:46.290 --> 02:32:48.750
<v Speaker 2>but that's the goal was the people that you quoted in your book.</v>

5642
02:32:48.751 --> 02:32:50.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's been more research done since then,</v>

5643
02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:53.340
<v Speaker 2>but what is have radically changed?</v>

5644
02:32:53.370 --> 02:32:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I would say things have changed some,</v>

5645
02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:55.321
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

5646
02:32:55.321 --> 02:32:55.681
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

5647
02:32:55.681 --> 02:32:56.550
<v Speaker 2>here's what I would rather say.</v>

5648
02:32:56.551 --> 02:32:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that probably it's a combination of these things,</v>

5649
02:32:59.251 --> 02:32:59.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5650
02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:01.830
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly an environmental factor where again,</v>

5651
02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:05.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're buying from somebody who's got an access to other illegal drugs,</v>

5652
02:33:05.401 --> 02:33:09.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe you try those drugs at the same time getting high,</v>

5653
02:33:09.271 --> 02:33:12.690
<v Speaker 2>it feels good and maybe you want to try other drugs and at the same time you're</v>

5654
02:33:12.691 --> 02:33:13.524
<v Speaker 2>just a risk taker.</v>

5655
02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5656
02:33:14.430 --> 02:33:15.210
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

5657
02:33:15.210 --> 02:33:20.210
<v Speaker 2>what nobody seriously ever said until about the last five years is that cannabis</v>

5658
02:33:20.491 --> 02:33:22.410
<v Speaker 2>could be an off ramp for opioids.</v>

5659
02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

5660
02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:25.650
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of reasons to believe that's a really bad idea.</v>

5661
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:26.663
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

5662
02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:27.211
<v Speaker 2>cannabis,</v>

5663
02:33:27.211 --> 02:33:29.100
<v Speaker 2>if you actually need opioids for pain relief,</v>

5664
02:33:29.101 --> 02:33:31.020
<v Speaker 2>canvas is not a good enough pain reliever.</v>

5665
02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:31.801
<v Speaker 2>It's like alcohol.</v>

5666
02:33:31.801 --> 02:33:33.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a mild pain reliever.</v>

5667
02:33:33.181 --> 02:33:34.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not strong enough.</v>

5668
02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:35.370
<v Speaker 2>You're dying from cancer.</v>

5669
02:33:35.610 --> 02:33:38.850
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis probably is not the pain reliever that you need.</v>

5670
02:33:38.851 --> 02:33:39.780
<v Speaker 2>You need opioids,</v>

5671
02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:40.530
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5672
02:33:40.530 --> 02:33:41.910
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

5673
02:33:41.911 --> 02:33:43.890
<v Speaker 2>the state level data is not as good.</v>

5674
02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:47.250
<v Speaker 2>If you want to really figure out what's happening to an individual,</v>

5675
02:33:47.370 --> 02:33:50.070
<v Speaker 2>the best way to do that is to follow that individual.</v>

5676
02:33:50.130 --> 02:33:53.970
<v Speaker 2>And there's a really good paper that came out in 2017 after the NAM reports that</v>

5677
02:33:53.971 --> 02:33:54.870
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have it.</v>

5678
02:33:55.320 --> 02:34:00.320
<v Speaker 2>That shows that people who used cannabis in 2001 this is based on a large</v>

5679
02:34:00.661 --> 02:34:05.661
<v Speaker 2>national study in the U S we're three times as likely to be using opioids three</v>

5680
02:34:06.151 --> 02:34:06.984
<v Speaker 2>years later.</v>

5681
02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:07.351
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5682
02:34:07.351 --> 02:34:09.240
<v Speaker 2>And that just intuitively makes sense to me.</v>

5683
02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:12.990
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that people on the legalization side don't ever talk about</v>

5684
02:34:12.991 --> 02:34:16.980
<v Speaker 2>is who are the two countries that have the most cannabis use in the west,</v>

5685
02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:18.340
<v Speaker 2>the US and Canada?</v>

5686
02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:19.353
<v Speaker 3>Where are the two?</v>

5687
02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:20.590
<v Speaker 3>Who are the two countries that have,</v>

5688
02:34:20.591 --> 02:34:22.630
<v Speaker 3>by far the worst opiod epidemic?</v>

5689
02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:24.100
<v Speaker 3>The U S and Canada.</v>

5690
02:34:24.130 --> 02:34:24.371
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5691
02:34:24.371 --> 02:34:27.280
<v Speaker 3>But there's a real issue with that because the United States is also the only</v>

5692
02:34:27.281 --> 02:34:31.450
<v Speaker 3>country other than New Zealand that allows pharmaceutical companies advertise.</v>

5693
02:34:31.451 --> 02:34:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a,</v>

5694
02:34:32.321 --> 02:34:33.760
<v Speaker 3>there's the amount,</v>

5695
02:34:33.761 --> 02:34:34.270
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

5696
02:34:34.270 --> 02:34:37.180
<v Speaker 3>the amount of opiates that are prescribed the United States is fucking</v>

5697
02:34:37.181 --> 02:34:37.930
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>

5698
02:34:37.930 --> 02:34:38.471
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

5699
02:34:38.471 --> 02:34:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Particularly if he,</v>

5700
02:34:39.810 --> 02:34:41.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you ever saw the documentary,</v>

5701
02:34:41.111 --> 02:34:42.310
<v Speaker 3>the Oxycontin Express,</v>

5702
02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:45.400
<v Speaker 3>but the way Florida used to be structured where they didn't have a database,</v>

5703
02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:48.880
<v Speaker 3>you could just literally go from pharmacy to pharmacy.</v>

5704
02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Yet we have a problem with the way we prescribed drugs in this country.</v>

5705
02:34:52.811 --> 02:34:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Opioids add drugs,</v>

5706
02:34:54.311 --> 02:34:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Benzos,</v>

5707
02:34:54.930 --> 02:34:55.760
<v Speaker 3>ssrs,</v>

5708
02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:57.190
<v Speaker 3>all were connected to Canada.</v>

5709
02:34:57.240 --> 02:34:59.200
<v Speaker 3>So it makes sense that it would filter over there.</v>

5710
02:34:59.260 --> 02:34:59.651
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5711
02:34:59.651 --> 02:35:03.550
<v Speaker 3>But what I would say is the people who think that cannabis is not part of that</v>

5712
02:35:03.551 --> 02:35:06.790
<v Speaker 3>overprescribing problem are deluding themselves.</v>

5713
02:35:07.290 --> 02:35:08.140
<v Speaker 3>And what do you think to that?</v>

5714
02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:08.951
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

5715
02:35:08.951 --> 02:35:10.030
<v Speaker 3>can you repeat the question again?</v>

5716
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

5717
02:35:10.350 --> 02:35:11.030
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

5718
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.691
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

5719
02:35:11.691 --> 02:35:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I agree with Joe the way that the access to opioids in the US.</v>

5720
02:35:16.510 --> 02:35:18.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean certainly it's come down a little bit in the last couple of years,</v>

5721
02:35:18.791 --> 02:35:19.330
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5722
02:35:19.330 --> 02:35:20.141
<v Speaker 3>Purdue Pharma,</v>

5723
02:35:20.141 --> 02:35:22.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a special place in hell for those guys,</v>

5724
02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:22.810
<v Speaker 3>but not,</v>

5725
02:35:22.810 --> 02:35:23.621
<v Speaker 3>it's not just opioids.</v>

5726
02:35:23.621 --> 02:35:24.910
<v Speaker 3>We prescribed too many benzos.</v>

5727
02:35:24.911 --> 02:35:26.950
<v Speaker 3>We prescribed too many add drugs.</v>

5728
02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:29.230
<v Speaker 3>We probably prescribed too many ssrs.</v>

5729
02:35:29.231 --> 02:35:31.300
<v Speaker 3>We prescribed too much in this country.</v>

5730
02:35:31.301 --> 02:35:32.140
<v Speaker 3>I think we all agree on,</v>

5731
02:35:32.290 --> 02:35:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

5732
02:35:33.311 --> 02:35:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

5733
02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:39.140
<v Speaker 4>that cannabis is another example of us looking for a drug to solve our problem.</v>

5734
02:35:39.450 --> 02:35:39.931
<v Speaker 4>But what,</v>

5735
02:35:39.931 --> 02:35:40.830
<v Speaker 4>what I'm okay,</v>

5736
02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:41.191
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

5737
02:35:41.191 --> 02:35:43.410
<v Speaker 4>just from a clinical perspective,</v>

5738
02:35:43.650 --> 02:35:44.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5739
02:35:44.220 --> 02:35:44.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5740
02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:47.070
<v Speaker 4>I can't just rely on,</v>

5741
02:35:47.130 --> 02:35:49.290
<v Speaker 4>on Diet and exercise for all my patients.</v>

5742
02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:50.910
<v Speaker 4>I have to use other tools.</v>

5743
02:35:50.911 --> 02:35:51.331
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

5744
02:35:51.331 --> 02:35:52.860
<v Speaker 4>like everyone here in this room,</v>

5745
02:35:52.861 --> 02:35:54.420
<v Speaker 4>like we're all pretty healthy.</v>

5746
02:35:54.421 --> 02:35:56.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a bad back or you know,</v>

5747
02:35:56.970 --> 02:35:59.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a mental health diagnosis or anything going on.</v>

5748
02:35:59.791 --> 02:36:00.300
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5749
02:36:00.300 --> 02:36:00.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5750
02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:03.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll have to look at patients that are coming to me.</v>

5751
02:36:03.210 --> 02:36:03.481
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5752
02:36:03.481 --> 02:36:05.460
<v Speaker 4>So the way I see it is that,</v>

5753
02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:06.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5754
02:36:06.061 --> 02:36:07.920
<v Speaker 4>we just mentioned a bunch of other drugs,</v>

5755
02:36:07.921 --> 02:36:08.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5756
02:36:08.041 --> 02:36:08.821
<v Speaker 4>antidepressants,</v>

5757
02:36:08.821 --> 02:36:09.361
<v Speaker 4>amphetamines,</v>

5758
02:36:09.361 --> 02:36:10.194
<v Speaker 4>all these sorts of things,</v>

5759
02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:10.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5760
02:36:10.801 --> 02:36:11.970
<v Speaker 4>cannabis and again,</v>

5761
02:36:11.971 --> 02:36:12.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5762
02:36:12.300 --> 02:36:14.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to separate the chiefs and the CBD.</v>

5763
02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:19.290
<v Speaker 4>It's an incredible medicine and it doesn't kill people,</v>

5764
02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:19.771
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5765
02:36:19.771 --> 02:36:21.330
<v Speaker 4>So as a clinician,</v>

5766
02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:22.221
<v Speaker 4>you know that,</v>

5767
02:36:22.221 --> 02:36:26.940
<v Speaker 4>that's so comforting for me to know that every single night I go to bed,</v>

5768
02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:28.470
<v Speaker 4>I killed zero people.</v>

5769
02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:29.220
<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>

5770
02:36:29.220 --> 02:36:29.551
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5771
02:36:29.551 --> 02:36:30.510
<v Speaker 4>So that's really,</v>

5772
02:36:30.511 --> 02:36:31.830
<v Speaker 4>really comforting for me to know.</v>

5773
02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:32.873
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

5774
02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:33.391
<v Speaker 4>I feel,</v>

5775
02:36:33.391 --> 02:36:33.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5776
02:36:33.601 --> 02:36:35.130
<v Speaker 4>we just talking about amphetamines,</v>

5777
02:36:35.131 --> 02:36:36.120
<v Speaker 4>so we were just talking about,</v>

5778
02:36:36.270 --> 02:36:36.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5779
02:36:36.490 --> 02:36:37.323
<v Speaker 4>ssrs.</v>

5780
02:36:37.530 --> 02:36:38.700
<v Speaker 4>I feel that cannabis,</v>

5781
02:36:38.701 --> 02:36:38.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5782
02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:42.420
<v Speaker 4>particularly the CBD component can actually be more effective.</v>

5783
02:36:42.450 --> 02:36:42.661
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5784
02:36:42.661 --> 02:36:45.720
<v Speaker 4>that's what I've seen a lot in my practice and other people have seen that as</v>

5785
02:36:45.721 --> 02:36:46.350
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

5786
02:36:46.350 --> 02:36:46.770
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5787
02:36:46.770 --> 02:36:46.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5788
02:36:46.951 --> 02:36:50.670
<v Speaker 4>I think that we need to need to take that into consideration when we're using</v>

5789
02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:51.691
<v Speaker 4>all these drugs.</v>

5790
02:36:51.691 --> 02:36:51.861
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5791
02:36:51.861 --> 02:36:52.261
<v Speaker 4>and Alex,</v>

5792
02:36:52.261 --> 02:36:52.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5793
02:36:52.530 --> 02:36:53.760
<v Speaker 4>some of the things that you're saying,</v>

5794
02:36:53.970 --> 02:36:54.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5795
02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:55.261
<v Speaker 4>they're quite,</v>

5796
02:36:55.261 --> 02:36:55.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5797
02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:56.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5798
02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Aderville and,</v>

5799
02:36:57.081 --> 02:36:59.430
<v Speaker 4>and in a lot of things like researchers say,</v>

5800
02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:00.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5801
02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:01.740
<v Speaker 4>are quite admirable as well.</v>

5802
02:37:01.741 --> 02:37:01.911
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5803
02:37:01.911 --> 02:37:02.371
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

5804
02:37:02.371 --> 02:37:02.820
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

5805
02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:03.690
<v Speaker 4>they feel that they can,</v>

5806
02:37:03.691 --> 02:37:03.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5807
02:37:03.871 --> 02:37:04.920
<v Speaker 4>tell clinicians,</v>

5808
02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:05.521
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5809
02:37:05.521 --> 02:37:05.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5810
02:37:05.731 --> 02:37:06.930
<v Speaker 4>give them really good advice,</v>

5811
02:37:06.931 --> 02:37:09.240
<v Speaker 4>but they're not the ones in the trenches.</v>

5812
02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:10.860
<v Speaker 4>They're not the ones in front of the people.</v>

5813
02:37:10.861 --> 02:37:13.950
<v Speaker 4>They're not the ones that have to have to chat with patients.</v>

5814
02:37:14.130 --> 02:37:14.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5815
02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:18.620
<v Speaker 4>I have obligation to do something for my patients to make them better.</v>

5816
02:37:18.890 --> 02:37:20.060
<v Speaker 4>I really feel,</v>

5817
02:37:20.061 --> 02:37:20.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5818
02:37:20.241 --> 02:37:24.230
<v Speaker 4>we just listed a bunch of drugs that cannabis is a really,</v>

5819
02:37:24.231 --> 02:37:27.830
<v Speaker 4>really effective tool and it doesn't kill anybody.</v>

5820
02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:28.400
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5821
02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:28.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5822
02:37:28.641 --> 02:37:29.474
<v Speaker 4>because of that,</v>

5823
02:37:29.570 --> 02:37:29.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5824
02:37:29.811 --> 02:37:30.410
<v Speaker 4>aren't gonna,</v>

5825
02:37:30.410 --> 02:37:31.243
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna keep,</v>

5826
02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:32.173
<v Speaker 4>keep using it.</v>

5827
02:37:32.270 --> 02:37:32.931
<v Speaker 4>But like I said,</v>

5828
02:37:32.931 --> 02:37:34.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm always looking for other drugs.</v>

5829
02:37:34.611 --> 02:37:35.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm always looking for other,</v>

5830
02:37:35.930 --> 02:37:36.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5831
02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:39.410
<v Speaker 4>alternatives to also help my patients.</v>

5832
02:37:39.411 --> 02:37:40.550
<v Speaker 4>But I think that,</v>

5833
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:41.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5834
02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:46.540
<v Speaker 4>using cannabis is a really effective tool for a lot of clinicians and it's</v>

5835
02:37:47.331 --> 02:37:48.470
<v Speaker 4>helped a lot of patients.</v>

5836
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:51.230
<v Speaker 4>But what do you think about his argument about it being a gateway drug?</v>

5837
02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Other than what these people said in the study,</v>

5838
02:37:53.271 --> 02:37:55.700
<v Speaker 4>that there's no evidence that supports it to gateway drug?</v>

5839
02:37:55.730 --> 02:37:58.130
<v Speaker 4>What are your personal feelings about that argument?</v>

5840
02:37:58.310 --> 02:38:00.080
<v Speaker 4>So I don't feel that,</v>

5841
02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:00.351
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5842
02:38:00.351 --> 02:38:01.940
<v Speaker 4>that cannabis is a gateway drug.</v>

5843
02:38:01.941 --> 02:38:03.050
<v Speaker 4>I do feel that,</v>

5844
02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:03.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5845
02:38:03.381 --> 02:38:03.951
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>

5846
02:38:03.951 --> 02:38:04.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5847
02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:05.990
<v Speaker 4>things that you mentioned earlier is that,</v>

5848
02:38:06.170 --> 02:38:06.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5849
02:38:06.351 --> 02:38:09.950
<v Speaker 4>some people kind of had this personality where they're like an experiment,</v>

5850
02:38:10.170 --> 02:38:10.700
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5851
02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:11.533
<v Speaker 4>And they just,</v>

5852
02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:12.160
<v Speaker 4>they just want,</v>

5853
02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:13.100
<v Speaker 4>I want to try something.</v>

5854
02:38:13.101 --> 02:38:13.640
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5855
02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:14.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5856
02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:14.821
<v Speaker 4>the fact is,</v>

5857
02:38:14.821 --> 02:38:18.290
<v Speaker 4>is that alcohol and cannabis just get introduced first.</v>

5858
02:38:18.291 --> 02:38:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time,</v>

5859
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:21.370
<v Speaker 4>most people don't do,</v>

5860
02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:21.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5861
02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:22.420
<v Speaker 4>coke or,</v>

5862
02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:23.121
<v Speaker 4>or LSD.</v>

5863
02:38:23.121 --> 02:38:24.590
<v Speaker 4>And then he say,</v>

5864
02:38:24.591 --> 02:38:25.011
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

5865
02:38:25.011 --> 02:38:26.030
<v Speaker 4>let us try some,</v>

5866
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:26.811
<v Speaker 4>some cannabis.</v>

5867
02:38:26.811 --> 02:38:27.200
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5868
02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:28.033
<v Speaker 4>So it's just that,</v>

5869
02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:29.960
<v Speaker 4>that's the very first one there.</v>

5870
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:31.040
<v Speaker 4>So if we,</v>

5871
02:38:31.041 --> 02:38:32.950
<v Speaker 4>so you could say anything that,</v>

5872
02:38:32.951 --> 02:38:34.310
<v Speaker 4>that that was easier access.</v>

5873
02:38:34.311 --> 02:38:36.470
<v Speaker 4>If there were some new drug that you know,</v>

5874
02:38:36.490 --> 02:38:40.250
<v Speaker 4>did something similar to alcohol or similar to cannabis and that was introduced</v>

5875
02:38:40.251 --> 02:38:40.380
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

5876
02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:41.240
<v Speaker 4>in our society,</v>

5877
02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:43.070
<v Speaker 4>you'd be calling that the gateway drug.</v>

5878
02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:44.630
<v Speaker 4>And I do feel,</v>

5879
02:38:44.631 --> 02:38:45.050
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

5880
02:38:45.050 --> 02:38:49.280
<v Speaker 4>I do believe that nearly been demonstrated as being the gateway drug to almost</v>

5881
02:38:49.281 --> 02:38:52.190
<v Speaker 4>all the loosening of inhibitions.</v>

5882
02:38:52.191 --> 02:38:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the opposite could be said about cannabis,</v>

5883
02:38:54.350 --> 02:38:55.350
<v Speaker 4>that it makes you paranoid.</v>

5884
02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:58.760
<v Speaker 4>You might actually be less likely to try cocaine afterwards.</v>

5885
02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:00.410
<v Speaker 4>And I know that the name,</v>

5886
02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:00.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5887
02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:01.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5888
02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:01.730
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

5889
02:39:01.730 --> 02:39:04.400
<v Speaker 4>they don't feel that the cannabis is a gateway drug either.</v>

5890
02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:04.641
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5891
02:39:04.641 --> 02:39:05.001
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

5892
02:39:05.001 --> 02:39:09.500
<v Speaker 4>they said they found no compelling evidence to support the gateway theory.</v>

5893
02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:10.191
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

5894
02:39:10.191 --> 02:39:13.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean these are the people that you are growing and your book out.</v>

5895
02:39:13.470 --> 02:39:14.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5896
02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:15.620
<v Speaker 4>Let me just go a little bit further.</v>

5897
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:18.220
<v Speaker 4>They said in a retrospective cohort study,</v>

5898
02:39:18.470 --> 02:39:19.340
<v Speaker 4>it may,</v>

5899
02:39:19.341 --> 02:39:23.930
<v Speaker 4>it from e t a l and the 2016 examine that transition from cannabis use to the</v>

5900
02:39:23.931 --> 02:39:25.250
<v Speaker 4>use of other elicit drugs.</v>

5901
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:29.330
<v Speaker 4>They found that the probability of initiating other elicit drugs after cannabis</v>

5902
02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:34.370
<v Speaker 4>did not differ significantly from the probability of starting with other illicit</v>

5903
02:39:34.371 --> 02:39:34.850
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>

5904
02:39:34.850 --> 02:39:37.340
<v Speaker 4>So it's just that cannabis is there first.</v>

5905
02:39:37.341 --> 02:39:40.970
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely not a gateway drug in any stretch of the imagination.</v>

5906
02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:41.871
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

5907
02:39:41.871 --> 02:39:43.040
<v Speaker 4>I totally disagree.</v>

5908
02:39:43.041 --> 02:39:43.521
<v Speaker 4>And there again,</v>

5909
02:39:43.521 --> 02:39:45.230
<v Speaker 4>there's 50 years of data on this.</v>

5910
02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:47.870
<v Speaker 4>I know the studies that he's quoting,</v>

5911
02:39:47.871 --> 02:39:48.470
<v Speaker 4>but there are,</v>

5912
02:39:48.470 --> 02:39:49.760
<v Speaker 4>there are many others.</v>

5913
02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:52.070
<v Speaker 4>And I think the argument is as to why.</v>

5914
02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:52.641
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

5915
02:39:52.641 --> 02:39:57.641
<v Speaker 4>I think the argument that that to some extent having access to this drug via it</v>

5916
02:39:58.830 --> 02:40:02.150
<v Speaker 4>illegally tends to open you up to other illegal stuff,</v>

5917
02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:04.310
<v Speaker 4>which to me is an argument for legalization.</v>

5918
02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:05.110
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5919
02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:05.420
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

5920
02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:07.040
<v Speaker 4>I do want to throw one thing out there,</v>

5921
02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:08.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5922
02:40:08.061 --> 02:40:11.630
<v Speaker 4>I dunno how many of your viewers have teenage kids or you know,</v>

5923
02:40:11.631 --> 02:40:12.150
<v Speaker 4>it's probably,</v>

5924
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:14.000
<v Speaker 4>they're probably more likely be teenage kids and</v>

5925
02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:14.880
<v Speaker 2>to have teenage kids.</v>

5926
02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:15.953
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5927
02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:17.970
<v Speaker 2>the book has,</v>

5928
02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:22.530
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that really worries me in the,</v>

5929
02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:24.210
<v Speaker 2>if we're talking about gateway drugs,</v>

5930
02:40:24.211 --> 02:40:29.211
<v Speaker 2>is that jewel and vaping are really a gateway to THC.</v>

5931
02:40:29.311 --> 02:40:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Vaping.</v>

5932
02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:30.721
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>

5933
02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:30.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5934
02:40:30.931 --> 02:40:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you can run to that because,</v>

5935
02:40:32.401 --> 02:40:32.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5936
02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:33.151
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

5937
02:40:33.151 --> 02:40:33.721
<v Speaker 2>it gets people,</v>

5938
02:40:33.721 --> 02:40:34.590
<v Speaker 2>it gets kids,</v>

5939
02:40:34.591 --> 02:40:39.591
<v Speaker 2>teenagers used to inhaling this illicit substance and you can actually retrofit</v>

5940
02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.570
<v Speaker 2>a jewel pod with THC.</v>

5941
02:40:42.571 --> 02:40:43.321
<v Speaker 2>They don't sell them,</v>

5942
02:40:43.321 --> 02:40:43.800
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

5943
02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:44.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5944
02:40:44.041 --> 02:40:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you can easily go online and look up how to do it.</v>

5945
02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:51.800
<v Speaker 2>And I think it really worries me and I've heard from a lot of parents in the</v>

5946
02:40:52.050 --> 02:40:54.810
<v Speaker 2>last month that there is an epidemic of Nicotine,</v>

5947
02:40:54.811 --> 02:40:59.190
<v Speaker 2>vaping and TAC vaping going on right now and that I think,</v>

5948
02:40:59.210 --> 02:40:59.370
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

5949
02:40:59.370 --> 02:41:00.630
<v Speaker 2>and we're talking about 15,</v>

5950
02:41:00.631 --> 02:41:01.081
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>

5951
02:41:01.081 --> 02:41:03.690
<v Speaker 2>17 year olds inhaling pure THC,</v>

5952
02:41:03.691 --> 02:41:05.490
<v Speaker 2>the most dangerous form of this drug.</v>

5953
02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:07.710
<v Speaker 2>And I think unfortunately,</v>

5954
02:41:08.130 --> 02:41:11.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to take long before the mental health consequences of that become</v>

5955
02:41:11.551 --> 02:41:11.990
<v Speaker 2>apparent.</v>

5956
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5957
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:16.350
<v Speaker 2>and I really do hope that the book gives parents some tools to talk to their</v>

5958
02:41:16.351 --> 02:41:17.184
<v Speaker 2>kids about that.</v>

5959
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.360
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

5960
02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:18.510
<v Speaker 2>if nothing else,</v>

5961
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:20.663
<v Speaker 2>last words.</v>

5962
02:41:21.270 --> 02:41:21.870
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5963
02:41:21.870 --> 02:41:25.230
<v Speaker 4>I was actually wanting to go over a few things that maybe I thought you might be</v>

5964
02:41:25.290 --> 02:41:26.070
<v Speaker 4>interested in.</v>

5965
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.430
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5966
02:41:26.430 --> 02:41:26.761
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5967
02:41:26.761 --> 02:41:27.420
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5968
02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:28.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5969
02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:28.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5970
02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:29.011
<v Speaker 4>you're a dude,</v>

5971
02:41:29.011 --> 02:41:29.970
<v Speaker 4>you're over 50,</v>

5972
02:41:29.971 --> 02:41:31.200
<v Speaker 4>so prostate cancer.</v>

5973
02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:31.950
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5974
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:32.221
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5975
02:41:32.221 --> 02:41:32.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5976
02:41:32.401 --> 02:41:36.360
<v Speaker 4>it's been shown that CBD may actually be beneficial for prostate cancer.</v>

5977
02:41:36.570 --> 02:41:37.980
<v Speaker 4>And one thing within that too,</v>

5978
02:41:37.981 --> 02:41:38.761
<v Speaker 4>in the same study,</v>

5979
02:41:38.761 --> 02:41:43.400
<v Speaker 4>they actually found that people who use CBD and we're on Chemotherapeutics is</v>

5980
02:41:43.401 --> 02:41:44.790
<v Speaker 4>actually augment it.</v>

5981
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:45.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5982
02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:45.781
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5983
02:41:45.781 --> 02:41:45.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5984
02:41:45.930 --> 02:41:47.120
<v Speaker 4>efficacy of what you said,</v>

5985
02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:48.480
<v Speaker 4>they're good for prostate cancer.</v>

5986
02:41:48.481 --> 02:41:51.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean to prevent it or treat it?</v>

5987
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.870
<v Speaker 4>Prevent and treat?</v>

5988
02:41:52.170 --> 02:41:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5989
02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:53.290
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

5990
02:41:53.290 --> 02:41:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5991
02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:54.421
<v Speaker 4>and then they say,</v>

5992
02:41:54.421 --> 02:41:54.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5993
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:58.620
<v Speaker 4>THC may actually be a little bit effective because it can,</v>

5994
02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:00.540
<v Speaker 4>and this comes back to to stuff's a little bit,</v>

5995
02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:02.160
<v Speaker 4>it can antagonize Dha,</v>

5996
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:02.731
<v Speaker 4>DHT.</v>

5997
02:42:02.731 --> 02:42:05.400
<v Speaker 4>So DHT is another testosterone,</v>

5998
02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:06.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5999
02:42:06.010 --> 02:42:06.841
<v Speaker 4>hormone as you know,</v>

6000
02:42:06.841 --> 02:42:07.410
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

6001
02:42:07.410 --> 02:42:07.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6002
02:42:07.621 --> 02:42:07.981
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

6003
02:42:07.981 --> 02:42:08.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6004
02:42:08.250 --> 02:42:10.320
<v Speaker 4>more linked to prostate cancer.</v>

6005
02:42:10.650 --> 02:42:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6006
02:42:11.130 --> 02:42:11.791
<v Speaker 4>one thing too,</v>

6007
02:42:11.791 --> 02:42:11.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6008
02:42:11.941 --> 02:42:16.420
<v Speaker 4>we didn't get really get to talk about was a c t a n n a concussion is the oil.</v>

6009
02:42:16.530 --> 02:42:19.530
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of your viewers are in a MMA and all about that.</v>

6010
02:42:19.531 --> 02:42:21.810
<v Speaker 4>And I tweet allowed to study other day that you retweeted and I really</v>

6011
02:42:21.811 --> 02:42:22.644
<v Speaker 4>appreciate that.</v>

6012
02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:23.310
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6013
02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:23.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6014
02:42:23.491 --> 02:42:23.631
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

6015
02:42:23.631 --> 02:42:24.001
<v Speaker 4>and just,</v>

6016
02:42:24.001 --> 02:42:24.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6017
02:42:24.121 --> 02:42:27.520
<v Speaker 4>it was a three year study showed that the mortality rate overall was,</v>

6018
02:42:27.521 --> 02:42:30.630
<v Speaker 4>it was nine and a half percent for people who had suffered a Tbi.</v>

6019
02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6020
02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:32.251
<v Speaker 4>people who test it.</v>

6021
02:42:32.251 --> 02:42:34.440
<v Speaker 4>I know we talked about correlation causation,</v>

6022
02:42:34.441 --> 02:42:34.910
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

6023
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:39.180
<v Speaker 4>the THC users only had a 2.4% were tolerated.</v>

6024
02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:39.880
<v Speaker 4>The non,</v>

6025
02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:41.960
<v Speaker 4>she was just had 11.5% were telling me.</v>

6026
02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:43.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's really,</v>

6027
02:42:43.141 --> 02:42:44.160
<v Speaker 4>really significant,</v>

6028
02:42:44.161 --> 02:42:44.371
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6029
02:42:44.371 --> 02:42:48.330
<v Speaker 4>Like I suppose it's just THC and not CBD because CBD has been shown to be very</v>

6030
02:42:48.331 --> 02:42:50.760
<v Speaker 4>beneficial for people with traumatic brain injuries.</v>

6031
02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

6032
02:42:51.270 --> 02:42:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

6033
02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:52.313
<v Speaker 4>It's actually the,</v>

6034
02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:54.120
<v Speaker 4>the are both beneficial.</v>

6035
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

6036
02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:55.560
<v Speaker 4>So that was,</v>

6037
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6038
02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:57.630
<v Speaker 4>again a correlation you can causation,</v>

6039
02:42:57.631 --> 02:43:00.270
<v Speaker 4>but I mean that the statute so over overwhelming,</v>

6040
02:43:00.271 --> 02:43:01.050
<v Speaker 4>like if it was,</v>

6041
02:43:01.050 --> 02:43:01.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6042
02:43:01.321 --> 02:43:03.900
<v Speaker 4>non cheesy was like 3.5% of what to bring it up,</v>

6043
02:43:03.901 --> 02:43:08.340
<v Speaker 4>but it's 11.5 11.5% compared to 2.4%.</v>

6044
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:09.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6045
02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:09.521
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

6046
02:43:09.521 --> 02:43:10.201
<v Speaker 4>CBD,</v>

6047
02:43:10.201 --> 02:43:10.740
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

6048
02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:14.320
<v Speaker 4>And even yo mechanisms of action have even been identified with that.</v>

6049
02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:19.150
<v Speaker 4>It decreases inflammation in your brain post concussion.</v>

6050
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:20.343
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6051
02:43:20.530 --> 02:43:20.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6052
02:43:20.771 --> 02:43:21.191
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

6053
02:43:21.191 --> 02:43:21.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6054
02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:22.331
<v Speaker 4>last thing too,</v>

6055
02:43:22.331 --> 02:43:22.571
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

6056
02:43:22.571 --> 02:43:24.340
<v Speaker 4>there's only one study on it,</v>

6057
02:43:24.341 --> 02:43:24.750
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

6058
02:43:24.750 --> 02:43:25.810
<v Speaker 4>and it was done on rats.</v>

6059
02:43:25.811 --> 02:43:26.411
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

6060
02:43:26.411 --> 02:43:26.791
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

6061
02:43:26.791 --> 02:43:27.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm a kito guy too.</v>

6062
02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6063
02:43:28.690 --> 02:43:30.460
<v Speaker 4>but the study on rats,</v>

6064
02:43:30.461 --> 02:43:30.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6065
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:33.220
<v Speaker 4>interestingly show that if you have,</v>

6066
02:43:33.250 --> 02:43:34.083
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6067
02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:36.070
<v Speaker 4>if you do have a high fat diet,</v>

6068
02:43:36.370 --> 02:43:36.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6069
02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:40.930
<v Speaker 4>that you can actually decrease sensitivity at the CB one receptor and they think</v>

6070
02:43:40.931 --> 02:43:45.550
<v Speaker 4>that that's just because there's an increase in your endogenous cannabinoids to</v>

6071
02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Hg and inanimate when you,</v>

6072
02:43:47.621 --> 02:43:48.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6073
02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:50.860
<v Speaker 4>w w when you do have a high fat diet,</v>

6074
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6075
02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:52.391
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

6076
02:43:52.391 --> 02:43:53.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6077
02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:54.400
<v Speaker 4>kind of go,</v>

6078
02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:54.941
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6079
02:43:54.941 --> 02:43:55.640
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

6080
02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6081
02:43:56.050 --> 02:43:57.340
<v Speaker 4>and then all of the timers,</v>

6082
02:43:57.341 --> 02:43:57.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6083
02:43:57.760 --> 02:43:58.593
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6084
02:43:58.600 --> 02:43:58.961
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

6085
02:43:58.961 --> 02:44:01.240
<v Speaker 4>I know you're plus a plus 50,</v>

6086
02:44:01.241 --> 02:44:02.021
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

6087
02:44:02.021 --> 02:44:04.830
<v Speaker 4>cheeks see Saint Jo has Alzheimer's.</v>

6088
02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:09.560
<v Speaker 4>I know that he wants to keep doing this podcast for,</v>

6089
02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:10.713
<v Speaker 4>for forever.</v>

6090
02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:16.840
<v Speaker 4>So THC has been shown to inhibit the formation of Beta amyloid plaques.</v>

6091
02:44:16.841 --> 02:44:17.480
<v Speaker 4>So that's the,</v>

6092
02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:17.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6093
02:44:17.641 --> 02:44:19.840
<v Speaker 4>the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.</v>

6094
02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:20.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6095
02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:24.580
<v Speaker 4>and then CBD CBD has also been shown to be effective for,</v>

6096
02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:25.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6097
02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:26.660
<v Speaker 4>for Alzheimer's disease as well.</v>

6098
02:44:26.661 --> 02:44:26.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6099
02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:29.410
<v Speaker 4>it was a rat study that was going to get into,</v>

6100
02:44:29.411 --> 02:44:30.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's fairly fairly,</v>

6101
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:31.960
<v Speaker 4>it's fairly detailed.</v>

6102
02:44:31.961 --> 02:44:32.560
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

6103
02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:34.260
<v Speaker 4>it might be best just to say that it cane,</v>

6104
02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:34.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6105
02:44:34.850 --> 02:44:35.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6106
02:44:35.410 --> 02:44:37.690
<v Speaker 4>help with rescue memory in patients.</v>

6107
02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:42.520
<v Speaker 4>If you do use CBD meaning and that it may actually reverse and that's been shown</v>

6108
02:44:42.521 --> 02:44:43.330
<v Speaker 4>before to,</v>

6109
02:44:43.330 --> 02:44:44.440
<v Speaker 4>they've done that in mice.</v>

6110
02:44:44.470 --> 02:44:46.120
<v Speaker 4>I got to interrupt you for one second.</v>

6111
02:44:46.121 --> 02:44:46.401
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6112
02:44:46.401 --> 02:44:48.520
<v Speaker 4>And I think you would agree this data is,</v>

6113
02:44:49.330 --> 02:44:50.163
<v Speaker 4>some of it's,</v>

6114
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:51.970
<v Speaker 4>some of it sort of epidemiological,</v>

6115
02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:53.380
<v Speaker 4>some of it's preclinical,</v>

6116
02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:54.640
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

6117
02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:55.720
<v Speaker 4>very early.</v>

6118
02:44:55.720 --> 02:44:57.610
<v Speaker 4>None of it really proves my game.</v>

6119
02:44:58.230 --> 02:45:00.790
<v Speaker 4>But let me say I'm a clinician.</v>

6120
02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6121
02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:03.820
<v Speaker 4>If someone comes to me and they have a concussion,</v>

6122
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:05.950
<v Speaker 4>it's very frustrating just to say to them,</v>

6123
02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:06.491
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

6124
02:45:06.491 --> 02:45:07.061
<v Speaker 4>physical,</v>

6125
02:45:07.061 --> 02:45:08.020
<v Speaker 4>cognitive rest,</v>

6126
02:45:08.050 --> 02:45:08.680
<v Speaker 4>go home.</v>

6127
02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:08.951
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6128
02:45:08.951 --> 02:45:11.650
<v Speaker 4>It's really frustrating to say that to someone and also to,</v>

6129
02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:12.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6130
02:45:12.011 --> 02:45:12.600
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

6131
02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:13.750
<v Speaker 4>the high fat diet thing.</v>

6132
02:45:13.751 --> 02:45:14.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6133
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:15.350
<v Speaker 4>Joe and I both fall,</v>

6134
02:45:15.351 --> 02:45:15.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6135
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.881
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

6136
02:45:15.881 --> 02:45:17.650
<v Speaker 4>very similar die.</v>

6137
02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:20.200
<v Speaker 4>So that's something that I want to share with regards to,</v>

6138
02:45:20.350 --> 02:45:20.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6139
02:45:20.621 --> 02:45:20.830
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

6140
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:22.000
<v Speaker 4>the Alzheimer's disease,</v>

6141
02:45:22.150 --> 02:45:23.020
<v Speaker 4>we have really,</v>

6142
02:45:23.021 --> 02:45:25.030
<v Speaker 4>really poor medications for that.</v>

6143
02:45:25.210 --> 02:45:27.040
<v Speaker 4>And we have an aging population.</v>

6144
02:45:27.041 --> 02:45:27.874
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

6145
02:45:27.970 --> 02:45:28.481
<v Speaker 4>like Alex,</v>

6146
02:45:28.481 --> 02:45:29.890
<v Speaker 4>like you want to look at everything,</v>

6147
02:45:29.891 --> 02:45:30.760
<v Speaker 4>which is what I'm doing.</v>

6148
02:45:30.761 --> 02:45:34.240
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm looking at everything and I'm trying to make a clinical decision.</v>

6149
02:45:34.450 --> 02:45:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Am I using some things like without,</v>

6150
02:45:36.940 --> 02:45:37.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6151
02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:38.860
<v Speaker 4>randomized controlled trials?</v>

6152
02:45:38.861 --> 02:45:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Of course I am.</v>

6153
02:45:39.610 --> 02:45:40.300
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

6154
02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm a clinician so I'm using,</v>

6155
02:45:41.831 --> 02:45:42.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6156
02:45:42.250 --> 02:45:43.360
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms of action.</v>

6157
02:45:43.361 --> 02:45:47.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm using what I've see and clinic and I'm using epidemiological studies and I'm</v>

6158
02:45:47.591 --> 02:45:51.670
<v Speaker 4>also taking into account what other medicines do I have you base upon all the</v>

6159
02:45:51.671 --> 02:45:53.500
<v Speaker 4>data at this seems to be an effective treatment.</v>

6160
02:45:53.501 --> 02:45:56.650
<v Speaker 4>And I am absolutely not saying that you as a clinician shouldn't do that.</v>

6161
02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:59.560
<v Speaker 4>Especially you're in Canada at t it cannabis is legal.</v>

6162
02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:00.520
<v Speaker 4>You should,</v>

6163
02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:02.200
<v Speaker 4>you should use your best judgment.</v>

6164
02:46:02.350 --> 02:46:06.460
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is that when we're talking about policy decisions around</v>

6165
02:46:06.461 --> 02:46:09.620
<v Speaker 4>cannabis and THC and to a much lesser,</v>

6166
02:46:09.621 --> 02:46:10.454
<v Speaker 4>since CBD,</v>

6167
02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:13.640
<v Speaker 2>the advocacy groups have seized on this very,</v>

6168
02:46:13.641 --> 02:46:18.380
<v Speaker 2>very preliminary data to to say a lot of things about cannabis and THC that have</v>

6169
02:46:18.381 --> 02:46:19.460
<v Speaker 2>not been proven.</v>

6170
02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:20.451
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

6171
02:46:20.451 --> 02:46:22.040
<v Speaker 2>a guy I know named Peter Bock,</v>

6172
02:46:22.041 --> 02:46:23.390
<v Speaker 2>who very smart,</v>

6173
02:46:23.410 --> 02:46:24.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6174
02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:25.010
<v Speaker 2>he's a pulmonologist,</v>

6175
02:46:25.011 --> 02:46:29.060
<v Speaker 2>is at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York and he wrote a piece in the Wall</v>

6176
02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:29.893
<v Speaker 2>Street Journal a few,</v>

6177
02:46:29.910 --> 02:46:33.590
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weeks ago talking about cannabis is limits as medicine.</v>

6178
02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:36.380
<v Speaker 2>And he said something that I thought was so well put,</v>

6179
02:46:36.381 --> 02:46:41.381
<v Speaker 2>which is the reason why people want cannabis to work for Alzheimer's and cancer</v>

6180
02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:42.381
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of things.</v>

6181
02:46:42.381 --> 02:46:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Where does,</v>

6182
02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:45.830
<v Speaker 2>where there's really no evidence that it works is that we don't have good</v>

6183
02:46:45.831 --> 02:46:46.664
<v Speaker 2>treatments.</v>

6184
02:46:46.820 --> 02:46:48.200
<v Speaker 2>We want cures.</v>

6185
02:46:48.290 --> 02:46:49.550
<v Speaker 2>We want help.</v>

6186
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:50.151
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

6187
02:46:50.151 --> 02:46:51.020
<v Speaker 2>if we're clinicians,</v>

6188
02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:51.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6189
02:46:51.471 --> 02:46:52.161
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a clinician.</v>

6190
02:46:52.161 --> 02:46:52.910
<v Speaker 2>You're a clinician.</v>

6191
02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Want to be able to give people who come into our offices something.</v>

6192
02:46:55.730 --> 02:46:58.460
<v Speaker 2>But that hope is not a substitute for science.</v>

6193
02:46:58.461 --> 02:47:00.290
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that it works.</v>

6194
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:02.510
<v Speaker 2>And even you want,</v>

6195
02:47:02.511 --> 02:47:03.950
<v Speaker 2>you want your patients to have hope,</v>

6196
02:47:04.130 --> 02:47:04.940
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

6197
02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:06.470
<v Speaker 2>But that advocates,</v>

6198
02:47:06.471 --> 02:47:08.840
<v Speaker 2>the people who are using this to push,</v>

6199
02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:13.490
<v Speaker 2>especially to push THC and to capitalize on the public confusion around THC and</v>

6200
02:47:13.491 --> 02:47:14.300
<v Speaker 2>CBD,</v>

6201
02:47:14.300 --> 02:47:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a real,</v>

6202
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:18.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a real disservice to people.</v>

6203
02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:20.273
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6204
02:47:20.310 --> 02:47:21.090
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

6205
02:47:21.090 --> 02:47:21.650
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

6206
02:47:21.650 --> 02:47:21.811
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6207
02:47:21.811 --> 02:47:22.890
<v Speaker 6>I think we covered everything.</v>

6208
02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:25.200
<v Speaker 6>It's complicated subject.</v>

6209
02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:26.034
<v Speaker 6>It really is.</v>

6210
02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:26.611
<v Speaker 6>And a,</v>

6211
02:47:26.611 --> 02:47:29.730
<v Speaker 6>I think it's really important to discuss how complicated it is.</v>

6212
02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:30.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

6213
02:47:30.510 --> 02:47:31.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's,</v>

6214
02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:32.510
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

6215
02:47:32.510 --> 02:47:36.460
<v Speaker 6>I've never heard such a detailed analysis of all this stuff in,</v>

6216
02:47:36.490 --> 02:47:39.450
<v Speaker 6>in a way where you can get two opposing people that are,</v>

6217
02:47:39.540 --> 02:47:39.841
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6218
02:47:39.841 --> 02:47:40.830
<v Speaker 6>very civil about it,</v>

6219
02:47:40.831 --> 02:47:43.020
<v Speaker 6>but agree on certain aspects of it.</v>

6220
02:47:43.021 --> 02:47:43.590
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

6221
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:45.300
<v Speaker 6>I think we really highlighted all those things.</v>

6222
02:47:45.330 --> 02:47:45.541
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>
