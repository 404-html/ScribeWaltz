00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of people still clinging onto the old,</v>

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>you know how things you like,</v>

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.191
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

5
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>people need to watch a show at a certain time or listen to the radio,</v>

6
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>like drive time.</v>

7
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:12.061
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

8
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

9
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Who listens to radio on the fucking drive and the will,</v>

10
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that switched it up with Sirius Xm,</v>

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>cause when serious,</v>

12
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>when it was at Sam,</v>

13
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>and a opie and Anthony were on and Howard stern is on what they figured out when</v>

15
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>they were doing this or it's like,</v>

16
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

17
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to have any censorship.</v>

18
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>We could say whatever the fuck we want.</v>

19
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>But they started getting in trouble too.</v>

20
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Like opie and Anthony got banned off the air wants because they brought in a</v>

21
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>homeless guy and he started talking about banging Condoleezza Rice.</v>

22
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

23
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I did open think they were cool.</v>

24
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't one of them,</v>

25
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not opening Anthony now.</v>

26
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Topian Jimmy Anthony,</v>

27
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>he's got his own thing now.</v>

28
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>He's got a radio.</v>

29
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>But I remember it was funny too,</v>

30
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>because I think you're right about that.</v>

31
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Sirius Xm was one a big thing.</v>

32
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause I remember when hat Owen's stern who I used to listen to,</v>

33
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.111
<v Speaker 1>who by the way,</v>

34
00:00:58.111 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I listen,</v>

35
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>let's do later because Kentucky,</v>

36
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>my hometown didn't have started going on,</v>

37
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>but I started listening to them and I loved him and said,</v>

38
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>he's going to sell that radio.</v>

39
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>We can say wherever he wants.</v>

40
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

41
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to be as funny.</v>

43
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Half the fun is listen to him trying to talk around and then you listen and you</v>

44
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

45
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>that's such a fucking hoe.</v>

46
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so much fucking fun here when he's not.</v>

47
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>He's just saying it.</v>

48
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>That idea that it's,</v>

49
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>it's more fun to be censored when people proof theory's wrong.</v>

50
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>You know that's a dump theory though.</v>

51
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.983
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

52
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>didn't you hear that all the time?</v>

53
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I heard that all the fucking time.</v>

54
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.013
<v Speaker 1>I never heard that.</v>

55
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I see here that about comedy,</v>

56
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>but I was always like whatever.</v>

57
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kinison and Richard Pryor,</v>

58
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>my all time favorites.</v>

59
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck can you tell me who's funnier?</v>

60
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:36.421
<v Speaker 1>And Richard Pryor,</v>

61
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:37.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was funny.</v>

62
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>The Richard Pryor and how can you tell me that beating around the Bush would be</v>

63
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.690
<v Speaker 1>better than what prior was doing?</v>

64
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

65
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you can't say you have to be quiet and maybe it was more in the south,</v>

66
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:45.421
<v Speaker 1>but I kept hearing,</v>

67
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>now that he's not got like the FCC to fight against and he can,</v>

69
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>the fun was him trying to get around the census and he really listened to it and</v>

71
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:53.281
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

72
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>it's so much fucking better now that you know,</v>

73
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit just to be free.</v>

74
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Completely free to express yourself without any worry about a word that's going</v>

75
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>to get you fine for hundreds of thousands of dollars.</v>

76
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta remember like he got,</v>

77
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>he got sued by the FCC,</v>

78
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Like healed making the task.</v>

80
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>He had to go to court over that shit and they wound up finding him like ungodly</v>

81
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money and there was nobody out there with him when he was doing that.</v>

82
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Like he's this,</v>

83
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why I'll never criticize that guy.</v>

84
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.391
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

85
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>he's like one of the most important pioneers when it comes to radio.</v>

86
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Like if it wasn't for that guy and going out there like that and getting sued</v>

87
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>and and having,</v>

88
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 1>that was all during the fucking Bush administration man when they were those</v>

89
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>John and Jack fucking time.</v>

90
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

91
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>those John Ashcroft fucks man.</v>

92
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>That guy was scary though.</v>

93
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>All these people that were trying,</v>

94
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:42.121
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

95
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of religious shit behind it.</v>

96
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.731
<v Speaker 1>That'd be shit.</v>

97
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Their shit in their boots over this fucking record too.</v>

98
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Well they would be dying over that record but he got sued.</v>

99
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

100
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>he actually had to spend real money and real stress.</v>

101
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the government trying to take you out all you are as a dirty morning</v>

102
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>radio guy and the fucking government is trying take you out.</v>

103
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>You fucking probably get paranoid as shit.</v>

104
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You should get paranoid.</v>

105
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>You fucking should be paranoid.</v>

106
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>What does it say here Jamie?</v>

107
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>There all the different fines he had to pay for 1999</v>

108
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.300
<v Speaker 1>he paid them.</v>

109
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

110
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.293
<v Speaker 1>some of them got paid.</v>

111
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>This isn't probably the initial finds that they started as either,</v>

112
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is what they got whittled down to,</v>

113
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.480
<v Speaker 1>or let's read them off.</v>

114
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>That'll 1990 he got fined $6,000 from the FCC.</v>

115
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>1992 we got fined $105,000 from the FCC.</v>

116
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>1992 again,</v>

117
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:28.961
<v Speaker 1>he got fined.</v>

118
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:33.961
<v Speaker 1>600,000 1993 got five find 500,000 1993 got fined.</v>

119
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:40.351
<v Speaker 1>Seventy three thousand thirty seven thousand four hundred thousand in 94 200,094</v>

120
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.453
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck.</v>

121
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.160
<v Speaker 1>And then it just keeps going on and on.</v>

122
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:44.340
<v Speaker 1>And on.</v>

123
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.173
<v Speaker 1>The last one right there,</v>

124
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.270
<v Speaker 1>495,000 in 2004 2000 and fucking four and that fucking insane.</v>

125
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>That's during the Bush administration.</v>

126
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>After nine 11 he got fined $1 million.</v>

127
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>$95,000 half a million dollars in fines for saying bad words.</v>

128
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't even saying bad words.</v>

129
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even say bad words.</v>

130
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>He didn't swear.</v>

131
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what was crazy.</v>

132
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Just top it subject matter.</v>

133
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>The d like talking about farts or Piss or shit or something like that.</v>

134
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>It was so crazy though.</v>

135
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Such a crazy time.</v>

136
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>If I were to say that to someone who didn't know,</v>

137
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>they would think,</v>

138
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>oh you mean that the 50s or the 40 this is fucking 2000 thousand four and if he</v>

139
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>didn't go through that,</v>

140
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>if there wasn't this backlash from the public finding out about it,</v>

141
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 1>cause everybody I know that heard about it was like what?</v>

142
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.840
<v Speaker 1>How would they wasting our fucking money suing him over a radio show that by the</v>

143
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>way has 20 million people listening to it every morning.</v>

144
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty obvious that people were enjoying this radio show and when they stop</v>

145
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>enjoying it it'll go off the air.</v>

146
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what the fucking free market is about.</v>

147
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't about that.</v>

148
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>What it was about is controlling somewhat cause it wasn't just his dirty shit.</v>

149
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 1>That's not what concerned them as much as his,</v>

150
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 1>his criticism of the Bush administration,</v>

151
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>his criticism,</v>

152
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>political political policies and his willingness to say whatever the fuck he</v>

153
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:56.561
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>

154
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>He's a dangerous guy.</v>

155
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>He said too much power.</v>

156
00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.733
<v Speaker 1>You think him?</v>

157
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.190
<v Speaker 1>You think that's what Kinda started podcasts.</v>

158
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:03.024
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that?</v>

159
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

160
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's what started podcasts.</v>

161
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

162
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>but I think that for him that started the,</v>

163
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

164
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 1>the journey eventually to Xm,</v>

165
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>like he had to,</v>

166
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>to serious whatever it was at the time.</v>

167
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>He had to like,</v>

168
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>they were fucking with him constantly all the time.</v>

169
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he gets enough credit for that.</v>

170
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>It's insanity man.</v>

171
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Well he's,</v>

173
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

174
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>he loses,</v>

175
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>he said he's a hero of mine that in 2040 got fine for those that cock for spink</v>

176
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>during a product for maintaining anal and genital hygiene.</v>

177
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Thompson was going after him.</v>

178
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>He was doing those things after video games and stuff too.</v>

179
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're from the Tennessee guy,</v>

180
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.200
<v Speaker 1>he got Davis and attorney Jack Thompson supplied.</v>

181
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>The FCC was show transcripts.</v>

182
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

183
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And listen,</v>

184
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't need,</v>

185
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I,</v>

186
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I pay my fucking,</v>

187
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.761
<v Speaker 1>well nobody did,</v>

188
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:49.594
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't official.</v>

189
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you a lot of it was about controlling a powerful guy cause he had</v>

190
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>talked about running for governor member,</v>

191
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.460
<v Speaker 1>remember?</v>

192
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>But he would have got to have to disclose how much money he made and that's when</v>

194
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>he decided not to do it.</v>

195
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you would do that now because now everybody knows he's got a</v>

196
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>

197
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it even the people run now.</v>

198
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>They haven't disclosed shit.</v>

199
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Trump has.</v>

201
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Trump says he's worth more than he actually is.</v>

202
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what's hilarious about him.</v>

203
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.121
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

204
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:14.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying has he,</v>

205
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>have we seen the actual like,</v>

206
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

207
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders just released his tax returns in his tax turn.</v>

208
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Said that he made less money last year than Hillary Clinton did for one single</v>

209
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.014
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

213
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask you to negotiate.</v>

228
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I think memory,</v>

229
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that pearl jam,</v>

230
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>fighting over ticket prices,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well that is uh,</v>

236
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>obviously just bribery money.</v>

237
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just bizarre that she won't release the transcripts of the bribery money</v>

238
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:06.160
<v Speaker 1>teachers.</v>

239
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you don't want to release something,</v>

240
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:09.160
<v Speaker 1>it's always good.</v>

241
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what she said.</v>

242
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.593
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

243

244
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>We probably had an effigy and the war was probably all over them papers</v>

245
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.711
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

246
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>He was probably one of the reasons why she kept her mouth shut.</v>

247
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.911
<v Speaker 1>If it keeps,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

253
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that need to be shot,</v>

254
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

255
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.650

260
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>he's taking out enemies of the state.</v>

276
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.564
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of crazy.</v>

277
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I was half out of it and watching that movie in a hotel room in Vegas and I know</v>

278
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I remember like falling asleep from memory.</v>

00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It was a cry,</v>

280

<v Speaker 1>He thought he was worried for the gun that was,</v>

282
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:02.960
<v Speaker 1>but it was really weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what is this like?</v>

285
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading it like reading a passage from it too,</v>

286
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.360
<v Speaker 1>like it's a book and I remember reading the passage going,</v>

287
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

288
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.721
<v Speaker 1>Is this fake?</v>

289
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:12.471
<v Speaker 1>Was he on drugs?</v>

290
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:13.304
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this?</v>

291
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I never got into it.</v>

292
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>We were talking you speaking of that Shit,</v>

293
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.260
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

294
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>First Amendment,</v>

296
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

297
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>freedom fighters,</v>

298
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:20.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

299
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>he a major hero and people don't know about it from Kentucky Zone.</v>

300
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Mr Larry Flynt,</v>

301
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>he did a lot of fun.</v>

302
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people realize how I'm putting it.</v>

303
00:08:29.281 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>There was that movie made out,</v>

304
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think,</v>

305
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.060
<v Speaker 1>and he's um,</v>

306
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>and people you get laughed at when you say Larry Flint,</v>

307
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Flint is a hero of yours.</v>

308
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's like,</v>

309
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:37.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

310
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>cause you love hustler.</v>

311
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.711
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

312
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:40.251
<v Speaker 1>I love Nikki,</v>

313
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's not what I'm talking about.</v>

314
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:41.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

315
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>no freedom speech.</v>

316
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

317
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 1>he did more for freedom of speech than probably anyone alive right now that you</v>

318
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:54.170
<v Speaker 1>had to be as fucking crazy as he took that shit to the supreme court because he</v>

319
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 1>was fucking insane and he's rich as fuck.</v>

320
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't get,</v>

321
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

322
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>the was the perfect amount.</v>

323
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:00.080
<v Speaker 1>It was a perfect timing to these.</v>

324
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 1>This is before porn hit the internet and the money kind of eroded.</v>

325
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

326
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

327
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 1>back then he was selling those magazines.</v>

328
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 1>He was rich from selling magazine.</v>

329
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 1>He was going to lose everything because of a fucking Joe when I was,</v>

330
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

331
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.323
<v Speaker 1>he really was.</v>

332
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>When I first came to la,</v>

333
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing that building,</v>

334
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 1>that flip publications building.</v>

335
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.893
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

336
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>The norm is fucking huge.</v>

337
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I knew some of the,</v>

338
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>the his,</v>

339
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

340
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

341
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I've met him briefly.</v>

342
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:25.870
<v Speaker 1>I know some of the hit,</v>

343
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>family members back in Kentucky.</v>

345
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.484
<v Speaker 1>But yeah they got,</v>

346
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.863
<v Speaker 1>they um,</v>

347
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.510
<v Speaker 1>it's an empire but also I think when he dies it'll come up.</v>

348
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>It'll be talking about it,</v>

349
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:35.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>they'll be,</v>

351
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.281
<v Speaker 1>they'll be the joke,</v>

352
00:09:37.281 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>he national news shit,</v>

353
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:43.521
<v Speaker 1>but there'll be some really interesting fucking pieces written about what he</v>

354
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>actually did cause he really changed everything.</v>

355
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 1>And like this album,</v>

356
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 1>literally I couldn't make this album without lyrics.</v>

357
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

358
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what was going on with him at the same time as what was going</v>

359
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.170
<v Speaker 1>on with a Howard Stern,</v>

360
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 1>there were all real similar.</v>

361
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I was real similar and the government was trying to decide what people could and</v>

362
00:09:59.541 --> 00:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do and the people that didn't get defended where the dirty ones tell</v>

363
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 1>dirty magazine guy,</v>

364
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>the dirty radio guy,</v>

365
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason we didn't,</v>

366
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get defended.</v>

367
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.513
<v Speaker 1>Where a journalist,</v>

368
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>if a journalist is getting attacked like that for revealing the truth about</v>

369
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:11.581
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

370
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 1>people would be up in arms,</v>

371
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 1>the intellectuals be up in arms.</v>

372
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 1>But nobody recognized that.</v>

373
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just as dangerous to tell people that they can't jerk off to hustler as it</v>

374
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:24.381
<v Speaker 1>is to tell like a political dissident that that's they said at the trial.</v>

375
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Ed Norton Guy Played Him.</v>

376
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.693
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

377
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.540
<v Speaker 1>this has nothing to do with whether you like hustler and has to,</v>

378
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than any free speech trial anywhere.</v>

379
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.381
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

380
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:35.214
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

381
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:35.881
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

383
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 1>if you rule against this,</v>

384
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 1>that it could lead to people being censored in all,</v>

385
00:10:40.981 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 1>in all different forms.</v>

386
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>

387
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>it took something that fall that crazy to get it to the supreme court and</v>

388
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 1>someone that fucking crazy.</v>

389
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just too problematic when you,</v>

390
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:53.010
<v Speaker 1>when you tell people what they can and can't talk about,</v>

391
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>it's too problematic.</v>

392
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:54.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

393
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:55.081
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

394
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>if you censor someone for a specialty,</v>

395
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>like sexual stuff,</v>

396
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.140
<v Speaker 1>like you sensor someone for putting out a magazine where people have sex and it,</v>

397
00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:02.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

398
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>obviously people have liked that forever.</v>

399
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 1>You do know what the,</v>

400
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 1>what the actual trial was.</v>

401
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

402
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

403
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll repeat it if it was an obscenity trial.</v>

404
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

405
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

406
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>he did it.</v>

407
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.201
<v Speaker 1>He actually,</v>

408
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:15.201
<v Speaker 1>they had comic pieces in the magazine and he did a piece where he said that this</v>

409
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:15.721
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

410
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:16.421
<v Speaker 1>I may need help,</v>

411
00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:17.254
<v Speaker 1>but Jerry,</v>

412
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.451

413
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:19.080

423
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Swaggart cried on TV.</v>

424
00:11:39.341 --> 00:11:40.174
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

425
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.033
<v Speaker 1>You don't remember that?</v>

426

00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch that shit all the time.</v>

432
00:11:44.081 --> 00:11:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

433
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing because we all knew that he was a crazy fuck.</v>

434
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.870
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>

435
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not cherry fall.</v>

436
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a Larry Flynt and,</v>

437
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.004
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

438
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 1>just Google Larry Flynt Supreme Court.</v>

439
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.571
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

440
00:11:55.571 --> 00:12:00.571
<v Speaker 1>the point was this preacher had sex with his mom and an outhouse.</v>

441
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Outhouse.</v>

442
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>In the magazine.</v>

444
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:04.991
<v Speaker 1>And I've made like,</v>

445
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 1>we had a cartoon of it,</v>

446
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

447
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.280
<v Speaker 1>And I went and saw Larry Flynt speak cause I said,</v>

448
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.741
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

449
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of his and so they,</v>

450
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.660
<v Speaker 1>the guy sued them.</v>

451
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Well it's Jerry Falwell.</v>

452
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:15.641
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

453
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>

454
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>So he said Jerry Falwell had sex with his mom and an outhouse and it was a</v>

455
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 1>cartoon,</v>

456
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.300
<v Speaker 1>like a mad magazine for part two.</v>

457
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And your follow suit them for liable,</v>

458
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:25.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:12:25.231 --> 00:12:25.540
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

460
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

461
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.760
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously a fucking joke.</v>

462
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>

463
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you know,</v>

464
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking comedy.</v>

465
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 1>And he sued them and it went to the fucking supreme court.</v>

466
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 1>And I went and saw the Larry Flynt talk and when they repeat,</v>

467
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>when the lawyer,</v>

468
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.920
<v Speaker 1>this is Larry Flynt said this is what,</v>

469
00:12:39.921 --> 00:12:40.421
<v Speaker 1>when he knew,</v>

470
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>he knew he was going to win the supreme court trial.</v>

471
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.330
<v Speaker 1>When his lawyer repeated what the article said that his,</v>

472
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 1>his mom had sex at.</v>

473
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Falwell had sex,</v>

474
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 1>his Momma House,</v>

475
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.920
<v Speaker 1>he saw the supreme,</v>

476
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 1>he saw the judges giggle for a second and the lawyer stopped and he's like,</v>

477
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>and that's when he knew he had the trial one because the whole point is,</v>

478
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Speaker 1>you laughed when I said it,</v>

479
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 1>that this guy fucking his mom out in and out house.</v>

480
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's how are we going to have an argument that's not comedy when all</v>

481
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>all you fuckers just started laughing.</v>

482
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>He said from that point on he knew he was going to win.</v>

483
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And it was funny too,</v>

484
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 1>he also said that Jerry Falwell came to him years later and they became friends</v>

485
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted to go do a speak cause I guess he had,</v>

486
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:23.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

487
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:24.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe not watch his money.</v>

488
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to go do a speaking tour with Larry Flynt.</v>

489
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.733
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

490
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.411
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

491
00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:32.340
<v Speaker 1>what thought I just,</v>

492
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:32.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I want the biggest supreme court freedom of speech he's ever again,</v>

494
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.670
<v Speaker 1>he said he realized that's when they kind of,</v>

495
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 1>he's like Jerry Falwell too.</v>

496
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:40.451
<v Speaker 1>It's all a show.</v>

497
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:41.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

498
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.003
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

499
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.180
<v Speaker 1>it was just a,</v>

500
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 1>it was just theater to him.</v>

501
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.171
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

502
00:13:45.171 --> 00:13:45.620
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

503
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.360
<v Speaker 1>we can go out and make some money on the road and we talk about each other.</v>

504
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

505
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>The friends like fuck you.</v>

506
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:50.141
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

507
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

508
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.243
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

509
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I was serious about it.</v>

510
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.630
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

511
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.600
<v Speaker 1>we had a funny though,</v>

512
00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 1>it was like the party with Jerry Falwell find out what it goes down,</v>

513
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 1>but when he got drunk he did become friends.</v>

514
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And another one I'd have to look,</v>

515
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

516
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive that when he died,</v>

517
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Larry Flynt wrote his maybe for the La Times.</v>

518
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I think Larry Flynt wrote his obituary.</v>

519
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

520
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.133
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

521
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

522
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.211
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

523
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 1>they became friendly or later,</v>

524
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:11.871
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

525
00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting trial.</v>

526
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.320
<v Speaker 1>You should definitely check out.</v>

527
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

528
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.020
<v Speaker 1>and the movie is sums it up,</v>

529
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 1>but you got to get into the details of it because what they used to do at hustle</v>

530
00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>was pretty fucking crazy.</v>

531
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

532
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.021
<v Speaker 1>besides,</v>

533
00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

534
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.420
<v Speaker 1>really getting in there,</v>

535
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.190
<v Speaker 1>looking inside the post and all that shit.</v>

536
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.890
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

537
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.030
<v Speaker 1>they had been in shit,</v>

538
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.330
<v Speaker 1>like they would do crazy like kind of x rated mad magazine and that was a chip.</v>

539
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.631
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

540
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:35.870
<v Speaker 1>they've got him in trouble like,</v>

541
00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:36.704
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.940
<v Speaker 1>as you know that the,</v>

543
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 1>it was what it was the the second year that they were actually pissed about.</v>

544
00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:42.011
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

545
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 1>but that was what they could catch him on because there were so preposterous.</v>

546
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are so graphic.</v>

547
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.101
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

548
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:48.371
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

549
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

550
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>that must've been the one that was the guy who,</v>

551
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:50.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

552
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 1>this is the letter he wrote in the La Times after he died.</v>

553
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Speaker 1>How I find myself,</v>

554
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

555
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 1>he is a phrase that's his,</v>

556
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>that's Larry Flynt Obituary for the article is called the porn king and the</v>

557
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:03.944
<v Speaker 1>preacher.</v>

558
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

559
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Is there the 1997 autobiography or biography called an unseemly man.</v>

560
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

561
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.953
<v Speaker 1>he's hilarious.</v>

562
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Let's look.</v>

563
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>He sued him for $50 million.</v>

564
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 1>That's why I went to the Supreme Court.</v>

565
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 1>He kept losing the case.</v>

566
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I lost repeatedly yet eventually won a supreme court.</v>

567
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

568
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.163
<v Speaker 1>I kept losing it.</v>

569
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Now he's hugging me in front of millions on the Larry King show.</v>

570
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.943
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

571
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the same one.</v>

572
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:33.830
<v Speaker 1>How much it cost him to fight those off because someone suing you for $50</v>

573
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:33.831
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

574
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:34.940
<v Speaker 1>If he lost her repeatedly,</v>

575
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.470
<v Speaker 1>each one of those things that's it had,</v>

576
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.800
<v Speaker 1>luckily it was the right guy who was crazy enough,</v>

577
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:40.281
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

578
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 1>and had the money to fight it because most people would have just never wouldn't</v>

579
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 1>have thought at once much less.</v>

580
00:15:44.781 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 1>All the way up to the supreme court.</v>

581
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

582
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:47.991
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

583
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:48.824
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

584
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

585
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is funny.</v>

586
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:51.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

587
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean the real story.</v>

588
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where the real stories crazier in the fucking mood.</v>

589
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.131
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

590
00:15:56.131 --> 00:16:00.300
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that it's such a pivotal moment in free speech history yet.</v>

591
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

592
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not something anybody ever talks about that he actually had to go out</v>

593
00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:04.451
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

594
00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

595
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were saying before there's an SNL might not exist if that was,</v>

596
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.580
<v Speaker 1>if he had won that case.</v>

597
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

598
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:12.091
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

599
00:16:12.091 --> 00:16:13.620
<v Speaker 1>if he can a daily show or any of that shit.</v>

600
00:16:13.621 --> 00:16:14.310
<v Speaker 1>If you can't,</v>

601
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:18.060
<v Speaker 1>if you can't parody public figures,</v>

602
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.020
<v Speaker 1>SNL can happen,</v>

603
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:19.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

604
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.460
<v Speaker 1>You can't do the daily show,</v>

605
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

606
00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And we could prove that.</v>

607
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 1>And here's the way to prove it.</v>

608
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a round about way,</v>

609
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.440
<v Speaker 1>but marijuana is still illegal in 2016 because of some bullshit propaganda that</v>

610
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 1>was made in the 1930s so that momentum carries on,</v>

611
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>even though it doesn't make any sense.</v>

612
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 1>You could still go to jail today for growing pot.</v>

613
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.390
<v Speaker 1>So if you think that if Howard stern didn't have those lawsuits,</v>

614
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 1>didn't pay all that money,</v>

615
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 1>didn't make this big public outright did public outcry,</v>

616
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.870
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to go to Sirius satellite radio.</v>

617
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 1>If all those things didn't happen and they won,</v>

618
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.010
<v Speaker 1>what if they shut him down?</v>

619
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.520
<v Speaker 1>What if they pulled him off the air with Larry Larry Flynt loss and never fought</v>

620
00:16:55.521 --> 00:16:57.470
<v Speaker 1>it would have everything buckled down.</v>

621
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 1>How long would it take for the Internet to happen?</v>

622
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.771
<v Speaker 1>How would it,</v>

623
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:02.030
<v Speaker 1>what would have taken forward?</v>

624
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Things like reddit or four Chan or these fucking uncensored blogs or uncensored</v>

625
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 1>youtube content where you can do whatever you want.</v>

626
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:09.711
<v Speaker 1>Vimeo,</v>

627
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:11.060
<v Speaker 1>all that shit podcast,</v>

628
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.130
<v Speaker 1>that ripple from those two guys is like one of the most important ripples for</v>

629
00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 1>free speech media in 2016 and it's one of most important,</v>

630
00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 1>like pivotal moments in the history of free speech,</v>

631
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking about that.</v>

632
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.841
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing,</v>

633
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:24.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

634
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy and crazy that we're talking about an x ray had record that I</v>

635
00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 1>own on a podcast that you own.</v>

636
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 1>This wouldn't have been fucking like this whole world.</v>

638
00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:34.490
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing wouldn't have happened.</v>

639
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
