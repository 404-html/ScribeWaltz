00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.680
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting way of doing it.</v>

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Are you completely opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization?</v>

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.951
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:09.590
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I am not completely opposed to</v>

5
00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:13.340
<v Speaker 2>legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mind concern here is that the country</v>

6
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 2>are too ignorant right now for</v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization.</v>

7
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>Not that people will go out and do some</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous things related to drugs,</v>

8
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 2>but if you legalize drugs now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will happen is that you will have</v>

9
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 2>the detractors say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any ills in our society is going to be</v>

10
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 2>blamed on a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are so ignorant.</v>

11
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.290
<v Speaker 2>We're susceptible to believing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before legalization I'm arguing that</v>

12
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 2>we have this increase in education about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what drugs do and don't do,</v>

13
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 2>do so people cannot be susceptible to</v>
<v Speaker 2>being hoodwinked like that.</v>

14
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm arguing that the education provides</v>
<v Speaker 2>an inoculation,</v>

15
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:48.734
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

16
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying we can handle the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

17
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying is that we need this</v>
<v Speaker 1>decriminalization step before we get to</v>

18
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 1>a legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's the.</v>

19
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't just jump right into</v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization.</v>

20
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.850
<v Speaker 1>It will be too much change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pandemonium.</v>

21
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.070
<v Speaker 1>People go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear.</v>

22
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>People would use propaganda to set</v>
<v Speaker 1>people against the,</v>

23
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go against it.</v>

24
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm thinking about,</v>

25
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it'll be pandemonium.</v>

26
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 2>We have Washington and Colorado right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

27
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Mark my words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There will be studies coming out of</v>

28
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:24.461
<v Speaker 2>Washington and Colorado showing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>young people in those states do more</v>

29
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 2>poorly on whatever measure you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have as a result of marijuana.</v>

30
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 2>The studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data won't support that conclusion,</v>

31
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 2>but that's what people are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>drawing from those data.</v>

32
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my prediction right now as a</v>

33
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 2>result of people's ignorance about</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and that's that's marijuana.</v>

34
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>A drug that we have a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced in with heroin and,</v>

35
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 2>but mark my words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see those steps come up</v>

36
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 3>and they religions have a way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecuting psychedelic losers are</v>

37
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 3>losers say users throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they would call it the work of the</v>

38
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 3>devil and that's what I ran into with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mazda text who I was working with up</v>

39
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 3>in Wahaca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they had to.</v>

40
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.500
<v Speaker 3>When the Spaniards came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to flee into the hills to</v>

41
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 3>continue the mushroom tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now you'll actually see,</v>

42
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to San Jose,</v>

43
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Delpha Civica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one town where the mushrooms are readily</v>

44
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 3>accessible in this other town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what La de Jimenez and you'll see on the</v>

45
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 3>churches they have Jesus and Mary and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then on the other side they have a</v>

46
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 3>mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they actually worship the mushrooms.</v>

47
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 3>They've kind of mixed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess to survive.</v>

48
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 3>They mixed Catholicism in with their</v>
<v Speaker 3>worship of these mushrooms and um,</v>

49
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.300
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty trippy per se to see it</v>

50
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 3>painted on these churches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually</v>

51
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>a big part of really ancient religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>artwork,</v>

52
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look in,</v>

54
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some research on the connection</v>

55
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>between mushrooms and even the Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Church.</v>

56
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>There's mushroom iconography all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place and really ancient</v>

57
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>descriptions like one of the earliest</v>
<v Speaker 1>depictions of Adam and Eve on some</v>

58
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>ancient fresco is Adam and eve with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom tree in between them.</v>

59
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that image?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can pull that up.</v>

60
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve mushroom picture and we'll</v>

61
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>find the description of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

62
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>and eve mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>We just lost track of all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also one of the reasons,</v>

64
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:17.584
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

65
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>It's right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could pull up that image.</v>

66
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.590
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

67
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.800
<v Speaker 1>that's an image of Adam and eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.643
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

69
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mushroom.</v>

70
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really strange for me when I was</v>

71
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 3>in Mexico to see them blessing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms on the altar a instead of the</v>

72
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 3>communion holy water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give you mushrooms and that's your</v>

73
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 3>sacrament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you eat.</v>

74
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 3>There's another one,</v>

75
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up.</v>

76
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>There's the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one that's a different image,</v>

77
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>but a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar image.</v>

78
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>See that one on the far left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Far Left.</v>

79
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

80
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.483
<v Speaker 1>Click up that one.</v>

81
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.673
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

82
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that trippy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's from 1147.</v>

83
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>They call it ce now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't call it a d anymore for</v>

84
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's from 1147.</v>

85
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.990
<v Speaker 1>So they knew even back then about</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic plants having some sort of a</v>

86
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>connection to Christianity and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

87
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are from churches.</v>

88
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>it's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just something that went away</v>

90
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 5>even before I ever went incident Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophy.</v>

91
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 5>I fought a tough man contest when I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>18 years old.</v>

92
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 5>Mr t was the referee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God it was a video that I</v>

93
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Video was on entertainment tonight.</v>

94
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 5>Show a clip of me with a Mohawk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you had three guys.</v>

95
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 5>I fought all heavyweight day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>day one 75 minutes.</v>

96
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.900
<v Speaker 5>I will have my clothes on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was,</v>

97
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.620
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

98
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.230
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was brown that weight by one 75 at</v>

99
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

100
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fought three guys.</v>

101
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 5>I knocked out two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

102
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 5>the second guy took.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

103
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 5>how about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tough man experience was the worst head</v>

104
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 5>trauma than all my fights combined.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

105
00:04:57.941 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

106
00:04:58.811 --> 00:04:59.644
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

107
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.830
<v Speaker 5>I had a concussion like you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe I've never get through to this</v>

108
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.910
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to get grossed out</v>

109
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 5>in case you didn't hear it at home.</v>

110
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 5>Kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

111
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:15.410
<v Speaker 5>that's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my joy.</v>

112
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.090
<v Speaker 5>That goes from the tough was my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fought one guy and he was a day.</v>

113
00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 5>It's funny because they put it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two small guys together.</v>

114
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 5>So they put me verse this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking scarred for life now.</v>

115
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.040
<v Speaker 5>It was me versus this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

116
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.343
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

117
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 5>they announced me as a weight lift in</v>
<v Speaker 5>pizza boy from long island because I</v>

118
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 5>delivered pizzas and my buddy at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

119
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 5>Jim mccluskey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a professional boxer.</v>

120
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 5>Me and him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got into a ton of street fights</v>

121
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

122
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 5>he used the items for the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my life.</v>

123
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 5>But I used to fight a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got it looks stand like this,</v>

124
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:49.040
<v Speaker 5>you less of a target as it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why he,</v>

125
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 5>that was my lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

126
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

127
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.390
<v Speaker 5>I went in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what the fuck do you</v>

128
00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 5>expect?</v>

129
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 5>No head gear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just these big gloves on that guy who</v>

130
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:57.990
<v Speaker 5>runs it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever his name was.</v>

131
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.911
<v Speaker 5>Beard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

132
00:05:58.911 --> 00:05:59.631
<v Speaker 5>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

133
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 5>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

134
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 5>they put me in verse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this platoon leader from Desert Storm</v>

135
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 5>and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's from long island to.</v>

136
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

137
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 5>I ended up fucking drilled him so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking hammered them and they stopped</v>

138
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 5>it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That clip.</v>

139
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.160
<v Speaker 5>I can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was on it.</v>

140
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:16.300
<v Speaker 5>I got it on tape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get,</v>

141
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 5>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can get it to you.</v>

142
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:19.004
<v Speaker 5>I think you'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Want to see it.</v>

143
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 5>It's funny because they showed it on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that statement tonight and I'm like,</v>

144
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:22.484
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's great.</v>

145
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 5>Mary or whoever it is making a face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Mr t was the referee.</v>

146
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was amazing.</v>

147
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 6>You're a smart dude because I was just</v>
<v Speaker 6>at this tech conference,</v>

148
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.540
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we as ceos and this thing and we</v>

149
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 6>were talking about it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we got into a fight with one of these</v>

150
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 6>big dudes or an old dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big powerful guy.</v>

151
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 6>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know who,</v>

152
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who wouldn't,</v>

153
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.230
<v Speaker 6>jails.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Snowden.</v>

154
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.851
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>

155
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't tell them what's the</v>
<v Speaker 6>difference between snowden and Woodward</v>

156
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 6>and Bernstein,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Woodward and Bernstein and the</v>

157
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 6>presidential papers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they were the punks of their</v>

158
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 6>generation like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but now they're heroes because it's the</v>

159
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 6>baby boomers and Snowden's fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's what's good for the goose is good</v>

160
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 6>for the Gander.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>

161
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:00.850
<v Speaker 6>we got into this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's he,</v>

162
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.480
<v Speaker 6>what's his argument?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

163
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 6>he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's bad and has the same argument.</v>

164
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:09.674
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's not,</v>

165
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 6>he's weakened country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a trader,</v>

166
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 6>I'd kill myself in front of them.</v>

167
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 6>And so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so we got into this fight,</v>

168
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:19.890
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

169
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the interesting thing about that is a,</v>

170
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 6>the fact that a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

171
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 6>whistleblowing is seen as eye.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see it as,</v>

172
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 6>as that's what's going to keep democracy</v>
<v Speaker 6>safe,</v>

173
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 6>but this sort of overreaching and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>

174
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:35.901
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

175
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 6>I didn't come to America for it to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>able to live in a police state and this</v>

176
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 6>is the definition of a police state is</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they could watch everything that we</v>

177
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 6>do and that it was all these tech guys</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the tech guys just sort of rolled</v>

178
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 6>their eyes and said it's already</v>
<v Speaker 6>happened.</v>

179
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.790
<v Speaker 6>The tech is already there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

180
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 6>the government has already made the</v>
<v Speaker 6>deals.</v>

181
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.720
<v Speaker 6>It's a de facto thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't change it.</v>

182
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then I got kind of worried because</v>

183
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 6>you're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're 100 percent right.</v>

184
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 6>The tech is so pervasive that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck with it.</v>
