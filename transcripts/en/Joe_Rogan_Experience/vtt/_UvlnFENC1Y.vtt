00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.060
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>so what is it with scientology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if they have ceremonies,</v>

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you look at that Tom cruise</v>

6
00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>recruitment video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking fantastic,</v>

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's standing out there,</v>

8
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen the one where they give</v>
<v Speaker 1>them a metal guests,</v>

9
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>which is she fucking just so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant metal,</v>

10
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:26.660
<v Speaker 1>many times larger than an Olympic gold</v>
<v Speaker 1>medal.</v>

11
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing this metal and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing there in front of a fucking.</v>

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 1>It's called the freedom middle of valor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's standing in front of all those</v>

14
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>people and he's such a charismatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

15
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

16
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Louisa's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at that fucking thing.</v>

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the,</v>

18
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>the lack of like understanding how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>come across that would allow you to wear</v>

19
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lack of objectivity that it will</v>

20
00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 1>allow you to put that on and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

21
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>and be able to do this fingertips down</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing on the,</v>

22
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the desk.</v>

23
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Like you're making a very important</v>
<v Speaker 1>point while you're wearing a fucking</v>

24
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Frisbee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gold frisbee around your neck.</v>

25
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he's trying to convince</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself by tricking all these people.</v>

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something to,</v>

27
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.950
<v Speaker 1>if you can get a thousand people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheer at these words that you're saying</v>

28
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how fucking crazy they are,</v>

29
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>if you can get all these people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe you and listened to you,</v>

30
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>it sort of validates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be you're not fucked up because</v>

31
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>you're in with all these other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that agree and fetuses and fucking,</v>

32
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other wacky shit that they</v>

33
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something to that where he's</v>

34
00:01:55.461 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>putting on his massive performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just for them but for himself as</v>

35
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:00.914
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

36
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I have my own bill o'reilly story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please send it to me.</v>

37
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 48 laws of power just come out in</v>

38
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 98 and Bill O'reilly decides</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have me on the Riley if o'reilly</v>

39
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:11.900
<v Speaker 2>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was big then,</v>

40
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>but not as big as it became later on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like,</v>

41
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>this is like one of my first shows I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been on.</v>

42
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

43
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing like this ever happened to me</v>

44
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically you go to a studio in Los</v>

45
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Angeles where he's in New York and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in this room and there's nothing</v>

46
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they put an earphone in your head</v>

47
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 2>and you're staring at a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see anything.</v>

48
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 2>You just hear bill o'reilly's stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking voice in your ear asking you</v>

49
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're on drugs and it's so</v>

50
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 2>disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the guy who's trying to put</v>

51
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 2>you off your game before you're already</v>
<v Speaker 2>put off your game,</v>

52
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 2>the moment you start.</v>

53
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he interviews me and I prepared like</v>

54
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 2>shit for this interview because I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>the questions coming.</v>

55
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 2>It was all about Monica Lewinsky and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton and the scandal and the 48 laws.</v>

56
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>And I nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

57
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a great interview,</v>

58
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Robert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have you on again.</v>

59
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

60
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm feeling pretty good about</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

61
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 2>So four weeks later I trudge back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that office and I sit in that same chair</v>

62
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:17.761
<v Speaker 2>with a little earphone in my head and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>proceeds to just rip me to shreds about</v>

63
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

64
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>essentially he hated the 48 laws of</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

65
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 2>He liked the writing or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was just using,</v>

66
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>posing his game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just,</v>

67
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

68
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>He was just using it as a way to attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton,</v>

69
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 2>which I wasn't wanting to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

70
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just like totally messing with me</v>

71
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 2>and I was so expecting the opposite that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

72
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.463
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

73
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he says,</v>

74
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about this law about use selective</v>

75
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>honesty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

76
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that politicians and</v>

77
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 2>business people use all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Lyndon Johnson for instance.</v>

78
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 2>And then I was about to explain how</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lyndon Johnson's and he cuts me off.</v>

79
00:03:57.581 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

80
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 2>The same man who said 58,000 men of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>young men to death in Vietnam,</v>

81
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 2>let's break for a commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the end of the interview.</v>

82
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.760
<v Speaker 2>So he like made me look like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting Lyndon Johnson,</v>

83
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 2>mit massacring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>58,000 Americans in Vietnam.</v>

84
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>He manipulated me and humiliated me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

85
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 2>and the whole thing was he hates the 48</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws of power because it's all about</v>

86
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 2>manipulation and ugliness and he's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most fucking manipulative interviewer</v>

87
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>you could ever imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how he manipulated me.</v>

88
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>He completely set me up by making me</v>
<v Speaker 2>think this was going to be like a,</v>

89
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.370
<v Speaker 2>a softball interview where we were just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.020
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I tell you this?</v>

91
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.220
<v Speaker 3>I've told it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll stop.</v>

92
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.760
<v Speaker 3>We've found out it was on a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>plane.</v>

93
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.380
<v Speaker 3>You're on a giant plane and it was on</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a 7:37 year old that you in</v>

94
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Virgin,</v>

95
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.690
<v Speaker 3>a Virgin Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has a groovy airline.</v>

96
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.070
<v Speaker 3>So on the flight with me and my wife has</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game,</v>

98
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.010

<v Speaker 3>And Carrie Hilden who's also a rapper</v>

99
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.830
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their policy,</v>

100
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:12.890

<v Speaker 3>It starts to get them p and the pilot</v>

102
00:05:15.201 --> 00:05:17.600
<v Speaker 3>comes on and goes like everybody's strap</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

103
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For like ever,</v>

104
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 3>and Australia's 15 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 minutes long this whole day.</v>

105
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.550
<v Speaker 3>And this lasted literally five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

106
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Jess?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bouncing up and down,</v>

107
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 3>side to side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitching yard,</v>

108
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.420
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on the,</v>

109
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.290
<v Speaker 3>on the sky map it says like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paygo,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Paygo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1500 kilometers,</v>

<v Speaker 3>paygo.</v>

112
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pacific Ocean is so big,</v>

113
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.620
<v Speaker 3>there's no land masses,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
