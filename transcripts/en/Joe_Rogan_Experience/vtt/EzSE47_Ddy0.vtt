<v Speaker 2>People take steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to restart their system or if</v>

00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:13.091
<v Speaker 2>you want to testosterone boost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take clomid or clomiphene and these</v>

25
00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are standard drugs in the steroid</v>

26
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:17.204
<v Speaker 2>users world.</v>

29
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>basically what did you take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took a,</v>

30
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I took an offbrand cialis pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Offbrand it was,</v>

31
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't extra Cialis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was described to me as being a</v>

32
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>cialis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought it was a Cialis and I,</v>

33
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I just took it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why does a guy like you need cialis?</v>

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:43.770
<v Speaker 1>you didn't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't pass your drug test and uh,</v>

124
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the level of hurt and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and confusion and I literally had an</v>

125
00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>anxiety attack and I had never had one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those before.</v>

126
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.170
<v Speaker 1>What does that feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the whole room just came in</v>

127
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 1>on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole room came down on me and</v>

128
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't breathe.</v>

129
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I remember opening up his hotel window</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a balcony so I could just</v>

130
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>breathe and realized that I'm like not</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped.</v>

131
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's little,</v>

132
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.960
<v Speaker 1>the window opened that much.</v>

133
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.750
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't jump out hotel in Vegas?</v>

134
00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Where was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas fucking brick and I'm breathing.</v>

135
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.060
<v Speaker 2>They don't want gamblers or sleeping</v>

136
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 1>back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm breathing through the thing,</v>

137
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 1>calm myself down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

138
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.860
<v Speaker 1>and I instantly started thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of the,</v>

139
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I had the weight of the world literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my back.</v>

140
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 1>I knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I wasn't going to be</v>

141
00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:35.400
<v Speaker 1>fighting a few hours before everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else knew.</v>

142
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.700
<v Speaker 1>The public knew and I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could already start hearing</v>

143
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even my own coaches,</v>

144
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at me like just their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearts were on the floor.</v>

145
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I had done so much to get back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting at UFC 200,</v>

146
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>like getting my life in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the people around me in order,</v>

147
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.680
<v Speaker 1>getting my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my health,</v>

148
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just being in order to,</v>

149
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>to beat DC and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like literally right now I've done</v>

150
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much of the right things to be back</v>

151
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>in a good position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And right now,</v>

152
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people look at me as if I still don't</v>

153
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>have my shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the only thing that I did was I took</v>

154
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:19.211
<v Speaker 1>a pill that I thought was going to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a boner and literally it's caused me</v>

155
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>a lot of heartache and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment and a lot of,</v>

156
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>and it just threw me</v>

157
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.590
<v Speaker 2>here in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

158
00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:28.930
<v Speaker 2>When someone gives you this pill and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know where it came from,</v>

159
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think,</v>

160
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.900
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's in this.</v>

161
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

162
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:34.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think of it because,</v>

163
00:06:34.741 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been dealing with the athletic</v>

164
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:40.980
<v Speaker 1>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in the UFC for a long time and</v>

165
00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I've taken a little gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Pills before,</v>

166
00:06:42.931 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've never felt the drug test ever.</v>

168
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.590
<v Speaker 1>But then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever think that you might've</v>

169
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.700
<v Speaker 1>gotten lucky?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

170
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that you felt drug test when</v>

171
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>you're doing sketchy shit.</v>

172
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But didn't you think there might be some</v>

173
00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:56.970
<v Speaker 2>sketchy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some Chinese,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken him several times before and</v>

188
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>with the Nevada State Athletic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commission,</v>

189
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always pass my drug test and,</v>

190
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and I know that I would never do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to cheat this sport.</v>

191
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of pride in my work ethic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knowing that dude,</v>

192
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been skinny my whole career,</v>

193
00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:38.010
<v Speaker 1>whooping people's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a knockout artist.</v>

194
00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't because I'm smart and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

195
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

196
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.580
<v Speaker 1>but with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the nod,</v>

197
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Nevada athletic commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had an issue.</v>

198
00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And then I was suspended when you cited</v>
<v Speaker 1>came.</v>

199
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 1>So I was never really educated on how</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious you shot.</v>

200
00:07:55.381 --> 00:08:00.381
<v Speaker 1>It really was like I um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came back into the game and there's</v>

201
00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:01.411
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey,</v>

202
00:08:01.411 --> 00:08:04.360
<v Speaker 1>we got this new company name and each</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of instead of Nevada.</v>

203
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.550
<v Speaker 1>What were you suspended for when you saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>the king?</v>

204
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm into this sport.</v>

205
00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we came into your house,</v>

206
00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 1>so when you started came into the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was used to spend it because my hit</v>

207
00:08:14.551 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>and run and so I never had even met</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who worked for you that I,</v>

208
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you signed a seminar,</v>

209
00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:22.920
<v Speaker 1>what to do and what not to do and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious it is and what could happen if</v>

210
00:08:22.921 --> 00:08:24.900
<v Speaker 1>you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And only thing I knew it was I had to</v>

211
00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 1>report where I was at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go to La for the weekend,</v>

212
00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I got a little sad to know that I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>La because they can drug test me at</v>

213
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 1>anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing I really knew</v>

214
00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:33.990
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw the,</v>

215
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that doing something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had done several times before.</v>

216
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:40.380
<v Speaker 1>It could ultimately lose me a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

217
00:08:40.381 --> 00:08:43.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only difference was I had taken like</v>

218
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.440
<v Speaker 1>little gas station pills aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken viagara before.</v>

219
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.230
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this teammate gave me something that was</v>

220
00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Seattle is I thought the only thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would do is make me bigger and</v>

221
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>stronger for longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I thought was going to be</v>

222
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

223
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when I find out that,</v>

224
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>that I had just failed the drug test.</v>

225
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that via Viagara is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually illegal in the Olympics?</v>

226
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't take that stuff.</v>

227
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.830
<v Speaker 2>The Viagra is a performance enhancer</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

228
00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:13.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a Vasso dilator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

229
00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's how they describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it actually has athletic performance</v>

230
00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:18.750
<v Speaker 2>enhancing pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

231
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.260
<v Speaker 2>properties to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it,</v>

232
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.700
<v Speaker 2>how does it help you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

233
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to look into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it,</v>

234
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.660
<v Speaker 2>it's similar to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways to nitric oxide</v>

235
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a PR,</v>

236
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.720
<v Speaker 2>like a pre workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your,</v>

237
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it does something to open up your</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood cells and get you pumped.</v>

239
00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does something not just to your Dick,</v>

240
00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.490
<v Speaker 2>but to all of your muscle.</v>

241
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would want it to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumped up during a fight.</v>

243
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

244
00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:42.141
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

245
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it actually can possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially help endurance.</v>

246
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

247
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that athletes take it for</v>

248
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:51.260
<v Speaker 1>that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's banned from the</v>

249
00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.503
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

251
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.670
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I understand that it wasn't your</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention.</v>

253
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.210
<v Speaker 1>It was not my intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no,</v>

254
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I had no clue that I needed to report</v>
<v Speaker 1>this to your side of it because I</v>

255
00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:03.710
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.330
<v Speaker 1>literally I was reporting everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

257
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.050
<v Speaker 1>What supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what preworkout what,</v>

260
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.170

<v Speaker 1>And what happens once you find out?</v>

261
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd you narrow it down to this pill?</v>

262
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through my supplements and I,</v>

263
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handed it to,</v>

264
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I hired that private lab in the lawyer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we started handing it,</v>

265
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.340
<v Speaker 1>giving them everything that I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't really a lot of stuff at</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

281
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Got Nutrition website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment we found out about it that</v>

282
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 2>someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John sponsored by Gat Nutrition.</v>

283
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.151
<v Speaker 2>So we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

284
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's check that out.</v>

285
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Get nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some fucking dude is,</v>

286
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.840
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great products that you want to get big</v>

287
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.640
<v Speaker 1>and strong and then you can definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to them,</v>

288
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.560
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as we saw that,</v>

289
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:20.650
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the holy fuck is he taking?</v>

290
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

291
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.281
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

292
00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 1>but people saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got gigantic,</v>

293
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:26.510
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>

294
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:27.500
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.200
<v Speaker 1>completely unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

296
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.100
<v Speaker 1>that's what I have great pride in being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a natural athlete.</v>

297
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.353
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

298
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.690
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they got,</v>

299
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.360
<v Speaker 1>they got all the cat stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test it and clear,</v>

300
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was clear.</v>

301
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gets to have other things that you</v>

302
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.230
<v Speaker 1>saw don't regulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

303
00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:48.800
<v Speaker 1>But the things that they gave me they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were super smart about and I,</v>

304
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.660
<v Speaker 1>all the products I was thinking with</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear and um,</v>

305
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>and so my manager was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think outside of the box.</v>

306
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Like did you take anything that could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have possibly been?</v>

307
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

308
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

309
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 1>one of my teammates did give me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dick pill.</v>

310
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need those.</v>

311
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So we got those pills tested and sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

312
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.300
<v Speaker 1>they and their ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they listed about five products in their</v>

313
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 1>ingredients and they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

314
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.840
<v Speaker 1>there was actually like seven products</v>
<v Speaker 1>too that weren't listed in the</v>

315
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two estrogen blockers were never in</v>

316
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>their ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

317
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a tainted pill.</v>

318
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.630
<v Speaker 1>It was what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

319
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

320
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.330
<v Speaker 1>so the [inaudible] was able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

321
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:42.330
<v Speaker 1>this was totally in attention or there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no engine,</v>

322
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.670
<v Speaker 1>no way in Hell I'm John would take these</v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen blockers and purpose.</v>

323
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very small traces.</v>

324
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like I was loaded up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen blockers.</v>

325
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And why the fuck would they put estrogen</v>
<v Speaker 1>blockers out?</v>

326
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>We believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

327
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.850
<v Speaker 1>the factory that created these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

328
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.650
<v Speaker 1>these Dick Pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

329
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 1>were maybe manufacturing these pills in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dirty laboratory or whatever.</v>

330
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And there were because of this container</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tainted.</v>

331
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because each pill that we,</v>

332
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:16.230
<v Speaker 1>that we had tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them had more estrogen blocker,</v>

333
00:13:16.231 --> 00:13:19.320
<v Speaker 1>some had almost no estrogen blockers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some had small traces.</v>

334
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Actually none of the pills were</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent.</v>

335
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 1>So it was obvious that when we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tested several different packages.</v>

336
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So it was obviously that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these pills were probably getting</v>

337
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 1>made in the same machine and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just traces,</v>

338
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 1>which is to show up in your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found some of these dick pills that</v>

339
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.800
<v Speaker 1>had none,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no estrogen blockers.</v>

340
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:39.431
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

341
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:40.810
<v Speaker 1>why did I get that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

342
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took one that was just contaminated</v>

343
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 1>enough and literally I got tested two</v>
<v Speaker 1>days later and it was in my system.</v>

344
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was obvious that it was complete</v>

345
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 1>accident and even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if I were to report it,</v>

346
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 1>the Dick Pill to you side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

347
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.990
<v Speaker 1>they would have read the label and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>label would,</v>

348
00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:01.900
<v Speaker 1>it never said that it was extra blocker</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and I still would have had a</v>

349
00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:04.710
<v Speaker 1>dirty right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Entertainment contaminated.</v>

350
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Where does that leave you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time did they suspend you for?</v>

351
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I got suspended for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a year from starting from back in</v>

352
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 1>July.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I find in July of two subs,</v>

353
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I love you shot up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what they're doing.</v>

354
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with things like that.</v>

355
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Because what you took does not enhance</v>
<v Speaker 1>your performance.</v>

356
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.391
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

357
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:27.370
<v Speaker 1>It's especially in such a trace amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like in certain circumstances,</v>

358
00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:29.920
<v Speaker 1>like there's been several fighters like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez.</v>

359
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>

360
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he has eczema.</v>

361
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.490
<v Speaker 2>He was taking an Eczema cream that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a,</v>

362
00:14:37.491 --> 00:14:40.910
<v Speaker 2>was it a hormone precursor or a hormone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peptide?</v>

363
00:14:40.911 --> 00:14:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I believe some sort of a hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>peptide.</v>

364
00:14:44.541 --> 00:14:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that enhances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

365
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the use of this</v>

366
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 1>cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

367
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't the full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

368
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.190
<v Speaker 2>obviously not a doctor or a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about suspending</v>

369
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 2>someone for something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems ridiculous.</v>

370
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in my situation,</v>

371
00:15:02.521 --> 00:15:04.140
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

372
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evening you start his lawyer,</v>

373
00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:10.690
<v Speaker 1>he showed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed a little bit of remorse.</v>

374
00:15:10.691 --> 00:15:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can feel that he felt bad about what</v>

375
00:15:12.551 --> 00:15:14.490
<v Speaker 1>was happening to me cause I think he can</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

376
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.190
<v Speaker 1>even the arbitrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could tell what had actually</v>

377
00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their problem was they said Janet</v>

378
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.560
<v Speaker 1>was just negligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't,</v>

379
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you should have reported this pill.</v>

380
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.500
<v Speaker 2>But that's it seems to me that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that,</v>

381
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but even if I would have reported the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill,</v>

382
00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:33.660
<v Speaker 1>they would have read the ingredients and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would've never saw that there was a</v>

383
00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:36.540
<v Speaker 1>trace of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something that wasn't advertised.</v>

384
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.473
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

385
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.620
<v Speaker 2>spend someone for something like,</v>

386
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.260
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they said it,</v>

387
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.970
<v Speaker 1>there was zero tolerance policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like I was the first fighter</v>

388
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 1>to ever take them to into arbitration</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

389
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.510
<v Speaker 1>and they were more upset that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them know that I took the pill.</v>

390
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Then what actually happened was like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule is you tell us what you take and we</v>

391
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:58.070
<v Speaker 1>can point you in a different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

392
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.370
<v Speaker 1>But I never told him when I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole argument was even if I told you</v>

393
00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:02.450
<v Speaker 1>what I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

394
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 1>it's still was never on the label.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless you guys were going to spend</v>

395
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 1>all the money to take it to a private</v>
<v Speaker 1>law or tickets to a laboratory to test</v>

396
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 1>this individual pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what I'm saying?</v>

397
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I still don't ran into the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

398
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great to protect people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from people that cheating.</v>

399
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's great to punish</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone for taking something that has a</v>

400
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Speaker 2>trace amount of something that does the</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no benefit whatsoever and</v>

401
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 2>clearly and wasn't supposed to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pill and wasn't supposed to be in</v>

402
00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:32.090
<v Speaker 2>that pill and clearly wasn't being taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>to enhance athletic performance.</v>

403
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems silly.</v>

404
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.120
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

405
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a mass that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

406
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand their zero tolerance</v>

407
00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:40.960
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with it in this war,</v>

408
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 2>the Chad Mendez situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

409
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.870
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's weird ones like Yoel Romero,</v>

410
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:47.680
<v Speaker 2>he tested positive for something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found out that it was a,</v>

411
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 2>in one of the protein powders or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something he was taking,</v>

412
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:53.240
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't supposed to be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't listed that way and they gave</v>

413
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:54.530
<v Speaker 2>him an abbreviated sentence.</v>

414
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.730
<v Speaker 1>He should have had no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

415
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>no parts whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

416
00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole thing,</v>

417
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I'm so grateful.</v>

418
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm still optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

419
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking for light in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

420
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

421
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the way I deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

422
00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always trying.</v>

423
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I always believe there's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at the end of the day.</v>

424
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.650
<v Speaker 1>That's just how I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so grateful where most people</v>

425
00:17:16.651 --> 00:17:19.530
<v Speaker 1>would be so upset with themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this type of stuff.</v>

426
00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm upset about the fans that I let down</v>

427
00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:24.120
<v Speaker 1>who flew out to UFC 200 and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

428
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.080
<v Speaker 1>But as far as the whole situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just glad that that my ne,</v>

429
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.840
<v Speaker 1>my name would no longer be associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with steroids.</v>

430
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I rather it be bowling or boy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call me.</v>

431
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call me.</v>

432
00:17:36.571 --> 00:17:39.240
<v Speaker 1>But steroids that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have really,</v>

433
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.060
<v Speaker 1>that was really bothering me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just glad that it's out.</v>

434
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.020
<v Speaker 1>What actually happened</v>

435
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.840
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
