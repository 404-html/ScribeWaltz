<v Speaker 1>I did everything that I could to be back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the position to win that belt back.</v>

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I was getting ready to show this</v>
<v Speaker 1>triumphant amazing story of someone who</v>

10
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>she's made it through a hit and run</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

11
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>It had almost had everything taken from</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and got it all back.</v>

12
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about so many things at</v>

15
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might have been.</v>

16
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 2>So let's just talk about what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

17
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 2>you tested positive for some</v>
<v Speaker 2>estrogen inhibitors or blockers</v>

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.900
<v Speaker 2>yesterday and blockers that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people associate with people who take</v>

19
00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People take steroids and you want to</v>

20
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 2>restart their system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if you want a testosterone boost,</v>

21
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you take clomid or clomiphene and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

22
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 2>these are standard drugs in the steroid</v>
<v Speaker 2>users world.</v>

23
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

24
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All new for me.</v>

25
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>basically what did you take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took a,</v>

27
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I took an offbrand Cialis bill off</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand.</v>

28
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't actual Cialis,</v>

29
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but it was described to me as being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cialis.</v>

30
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought it was a Cialis and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took it.</v>

31
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>So why is it guy like you need.</v>

33
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>It's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good answer.</v>

34
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>We don't have the resources to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean everyone knows for a fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

75
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the supplement industry has a giant</v>

76
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>issue with the people that mix the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

77
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>like if you have a VAT and you're mixing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up whatever,</v>

78

<v Speaker 2>creatine or something like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>right before,</v>

80
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>place that doesn't have excellent</v>
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>

81
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not scrupulous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be scooping up steroids in the</v>

82
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 2>batch before that and you just throw the</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatine in it and some of it gets</v>

83
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 2>contaminated if they don't clean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

84
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to that.</v>

85
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

119
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.530
<v Speaker 1>like the whole room came down on me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

120
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember opening up his hotel window</v>

121
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>looking for a balcony so I could just</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe and realize that I'm not</v>

122
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

123
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a little window opened that much</v>

124
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.860
<v Speaker 2>so you don't trump hotel in vegas where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in Vegas.</v>

125
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Fucking freak and I'm breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want gamblers leaping through</v>

126
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:20.720
<v Speaker 2>the years</v>

127
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 1>back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm breathing in through the thing,</v>

128
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 1>calm myself down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

129
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.860
<v Speaker 1>and I instantly started thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of the.</v>

130
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I had the weight of the world literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my back.</v>

131
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I wasn't going to be</v>

132
00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 1>fighting a few hours before everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else knew,</v>

133
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.700
<v Speaker 1>the public knew and I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could already start hearing</v>

134
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.040
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even my uncle just been looking at me</v>

135
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 1>like just their hearts were on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>

136
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I had done so much to get back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting at UFC $200.</v>

137
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Like get my life in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the people around me in order to</v>

138
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.680
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my health,</v>

139
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just being in order to beat DC.</v>

140
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like literally right now I've done</v>

141
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much of the right things to be back</v>

142
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>in a good position and right now now</v>
<v Speaker 1>people look at me as if I still don't</v>

143
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>have my shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only thing that I did was I took</v>

144
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:15.270
<v Speaker 1>a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>that I thought was gonna give me a boner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it literally,</v>

146
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.800
<v Speaker 1>it's caused me a lot of heartache and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of disappointment and a lot of just</v>

147
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.080
<v Speaker 1>threw me</v>

148
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.590
<v Speaker 2>here in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

149
00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:28.930
<v Speaker 2>When someone gives you this pill and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know where it came from,</v>

150
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think,</v>

151
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.900
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's in this.</v>

152
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

153
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:34.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think of it because,</v>

154
00:06:34.741 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been dealing with the athletic</v>

155
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:40.980
<v Speaker 1>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in the UFC for a long time and</v>

156
00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I've taken a little gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take pills before,</v>

<v Speaker 1>got lucky?</v>

160
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I got lucky.</v>

161
00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I thought that you failed drug tests</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing sketchy shit.</v>

162
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But didn't you think there might be some</v>

<v Speaker 2>sketchy shit?</v>

<v Speaker 2>know John Likes to party.</v>

170

171
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.323
<v Speaker 1>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

176
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I've taken them several times before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with the Nevada State Athletic</v>

177
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always pass my drug test and,</v>

178
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and I know that I would never do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to keep this sport,</v>

179
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of pride in my work ethic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that dude,</v>

180
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I've been skinny my whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whooping people's ass.</v>

181
00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a knockout artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't because I'm smart and you</v>

182
00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:41.160
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work hard.</v>

183
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with you with the Knob,</v>

184
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Nevada Athletic Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had an issue.</v>

185
00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And then I was suspended when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>started came,</v>

186
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>so I was never really educated on how</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious you shot a really was like,</v>

187
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came back into the game and there's</v>

188
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.291
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

189
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:02.650
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got this new company name and</v>

190
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Usada instead of Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were you suspended for when you saw</v>

191
00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:06.600
<v Speaker 1>the king?</v>

192
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean when they come into the sport?</v>

193
00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

194
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.450
<v Speaker 1>when they came into your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you started came into the sport.</v>

195
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I was looking because my head right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I never had even met anyone who</v>

196
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>worked for your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been sat down.</v>

197
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I know you started seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do and what not to do and how</v>

198
00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:23.400
<v Speaker 1>serious it is and what could have it if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do this.</v>

199
00:08:23.401 --> 00:08:26.160
<v Speaker 1>And only thing I knew is I had to report</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was at.</v>

200
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go to La for the weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a little sad to know that I'm in</v>

201
00:08:29.941 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 1>La because like a drug spent anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing I really knew</v>

202
00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 1>about Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

203
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Doing something that I had done several</v>
<v Speaker 1>times before I could ultimately lose me</v>

204
00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>

205
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.510
<v Speaker 1>The only difference was I had taken like</v>
<v Speaker 1>little gas station pills and I've taken</v>

206
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 1>by Agora before this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this teammate gave me something that was</v>

207
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Seattle is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought the only thing that it would</v>

208
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>do is make me bigger and stronger for</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

209
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>That's all I thought it was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and then when I find out that</v>

210
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>that I just failed the drug test.</v>

211
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that via Viagara is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal in the Olympics.</v>

212
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.400
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

213
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.560
<v Speaker 2>You can't take that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Viagra is a performance enhancer.</v>

214
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Vaso dilator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

215
00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's how they describe it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it actually has athletic performance</v>

216
00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:20.260
<v Speaker 2>enhancing properties to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it,</v>

217
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.670
<v Speaker 2>how does it help you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

218
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.430
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to look into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's similar in a lot of</v>

219
00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.890
<v Speaker 2>ways to nitric oxide supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a pro,</v>

220
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.720
<v Speaker 2>like a pre workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your.</v>

221
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

222
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.340
<v Speaker 2>It does something to open up your blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells and get you pumped.</v>

223
00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does something not just to your Dick</v>

224
00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.490
<v Speaker 2>but to all of your muscle.</v>

225
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would want it to be</v>

226
00:09:38.751 --> 00:09:41.450
<v Speaker 1>pumped up during a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works that way.</v>

227
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

228
00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it actually can possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially help endurance.</v>

229
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

230
00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that athletes take it for</v>

231
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:51.260
<v Speaker 1>that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's spanned from the</v>

232
00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.503
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

234
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.670
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I understand that it wasn't your</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention.</v>

236
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.610
<v Speaker 1>It was not my intention and I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no clue that I needed to report</v>

237
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:03.620
<v Speaker 1>this to your side up because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

238
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.330
<v Speaker 1>literally I was reporting everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And what happens once you find out?</v>

243
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd you narrow it down to this pill?</v>

244
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through my supplements and I um,</v>

245
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.600
<v Speaker 1>handed it to.</v>

246
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I hired a private lab in the lawyer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started handing it,</v>

247
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.580

<v Speaker 1>We know it's not from that gut nutrition</v>

258
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:00.890
<v Speaker 1>website though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fucking hilarious.</v>

259
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Gat Nutrition website at the moment we</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out about it that someone said,</v>

260
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:05.980
<v Speaker 2>John sponsored by Gat Nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've,</v>

261
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's check that out.</v>

262
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Get nutrition is some fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as</v>

<v Speaker 1>and you can definitely go to them.</v>

265
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.910
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as we saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

266
00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:21.490
<v Speaker 1>what in the holy fuck is he taking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

267
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people saw you.</v>

269

<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely natural.</v>

270
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what I have great pride in being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a natural athlete.</v>

271
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.940
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

272
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.790
<v Speaker 1>so they got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got all the cat stuff,</v>

273
00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>test it and clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

274
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Everything was clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

275
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 1>this gets to have other things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't regulate.</v>

276
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the things that they gave me,</v>

277
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.140
<v Speaker 1>they're super smart about and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in all the products I was thinking</v>

278
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.690
<v Speaker 1>with clear and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so my managers,</v>

279
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I think outside of the box I did you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take anything that could have possibly</v>

280
00:11:58.721 --> 00:11:59.554
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

281
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

282
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

283
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 1>one of my teammates did give me this</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill and he's like,</v>

284
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I need those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where you got those pills tested and</v>

285
00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they and their ingredients,</v>

286
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 1>they listed about five products and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ingredients.</v>

287
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.960
<v Speaker 1>And they actually are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually like seven products too</v>

288
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>that weren't listed in the ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two estrogen blockers were never in</v>

289
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:28.280
<v Speaker 1>their ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

290
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

291
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>it was a tainted pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would say what I'm saying.</v>

292
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

293
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

294
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cited was able to tell,</v>

295
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was totally inattention or there's</v>

296
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:46.801
<v Speaker 1>no engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way in Hell I'm John would take these</v>

297
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:48.690
<v Speaker 1>estrogen blockers on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

298
00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 1>it was very small traces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't like I was loaded up with</v>

299
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 1>estrogen blockers and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck would they put estrogen</v>

300
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:58.080
<v Speaker 1>blockers and put them into digital?</v>

301
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.780
<v Speaker 1>We believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

302
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 1>the factory that created these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

303
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.590
<v Speaker 1>these Dick Pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

304
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.330
<v Speaker 1>were maybe manufacturing these pills in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dirty laboratory,</v>

305
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of this container just</v>

306
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:10.211
<v Speaker 1>tainted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

307
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 1>because each pill that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we had tested,</v>

308
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
<v Speaker 1>some of them had more estrogen blockers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some had almost no estrogen blockers,</v>

309
00:13:18.301 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 1>some head small traces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually none of the pills were</v>

310
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:22.060
<v Speaker 1>consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was obvious that.</v>

311
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.730
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tested several different packages.</v>

312
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So it was obviously that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these pills were probably getting</v>

313
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 1>made in the same machine and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just traces,</v>

314
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally,</v>

315
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.460
<v Speaker 1>which is enough to show up in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

316
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 1>When drug do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found some of these dick pills that</v>

317
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.790
<v Speaker 1>had none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No estrogen blockers.</v>

318
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.431
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

319
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:40.810
<v Speaker 1>why didn't I get that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

320
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

321
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I took one that was just contaminated</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and literally I got tested two</v>

322
00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 1>days later and it was in my system.</v>

323
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was obvious that it was complete</v>

324
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 1>accident and even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if I would have reported the</v>

325
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Deq pill to Usada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have read the label and the</v>

326
00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 1>label would have never said that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen blocker in there and I still</v>

327
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:02.960
<v Speaker 1>would have had a dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

328
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Good attachments contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that leave you?</v>

329
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:07.740
<v Speaker 1>How much time did they suspend you for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got suspended for,</v>

330
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.590
<v Speaker 1>for a year back from starting from back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in July.</v>

331
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.610
<v Speaker 1>So now I fight in July of 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love you shot up.</v>

332
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I love what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with things like that.</v>

333
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what you took does not enhance</v>

334
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 1>your performance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

335
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:24.400
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's especially in such a trace amount.</v>

336
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel like in certain circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's been several fighters like</v>

337
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

338
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.770
<v Speaker 1>he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he has eczema.</v>

339
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.440
<v Speaker 2>He was taking an Eczema cream that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a,</v>

340
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.880
<v Speaker 2>was it a hormone precursor or a hormone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peptide?</v>

341
00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:44.570
<v Speaker 2>I believe some sort of a hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>peptide.</v>

342
00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:49.571
<v Speaker 2>I think that enhances the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the use of this</v>

343
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 1>preme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

344
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

345
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.970
<v Speaker 2>obviously not a doctor or a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

346
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 2>there's something about suspending</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone for something like that.</v>

347
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.223
<v Speaker 2>That seems ridiculous.</v>

348
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my situation they,</v>

349
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.900
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

350
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 1>the evening you said his lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed,</v>

351
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>he showed a little bit of remorse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

352
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I could feel that he felt bad about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was happening to me because I think he</v>

353
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>could really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the arbitrators,</v>

354
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 1>they could tell what had actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

355
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but their problem was they said John was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just negligent.</v>

356
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have reported this pill,</v>

357
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.700
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that's silly.</v>

358
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.170
<v Speaker 1>But even if I were to report it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill,</v>

359
00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:33.690
<v Speaker 1>they would've read the ingredients and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would've never saw that there was a</v>

360
00:15:33.691 --> 00:15:36.540
<v Speaker 1>trace of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something that wasn't advertised.</v>

361
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.700
<v Speaker 1>So why suspend someone for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

362
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.421
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

363
00:15:39.421 --> 00:15:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Because they said it was zero tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

364
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.690
<v Speaker 1>It was just like I was the first fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ever take them to into arbitration</v>

365
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.280
<v Speaker 1>and and they were more upset that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't let them know that I took the</v>

366
00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:53.670
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what actually happened was like the</v>

367
00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:57.180
<v Speaker 1>rule is you tell us what you take and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can point you in a different direction,</v>

368
00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.500
<v Speaker 1>but I never told him what I took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole argument was if I told you what</v>

369
00:16:01.501 --> 00:16:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still was never on the label.</v>

370
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so unless you guys were going to spend</v>

371
00:16:06.541 --> 00:16:10.470
<v Speaker 1>all the money to take it to a private</v>
<v Speaker 1>lab or take it to a laboratory to test</v>

372
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:12.450
<v Speaker 1>this individual pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what I'm saying?</v>

373
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I still don't run into the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

374
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great to protect people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from people that are cheating.</v>

375
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's great to punish</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone for taking something that has a</v>

376
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Speaker 2>trace amount of something that does them</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no benefit whatsoever and</v>

377
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 2>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was it supposed to be in that bill</v>

378
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 2>and wasn't supposed to be in that pill</v>
<v Speaker 2>and clearly wasn't being taken to</v>

379
00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 2>enhance athletic performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

380
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Speaker 2>That seems silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a mess.</v>

381
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a mass that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

382
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand there zero tolerance</v>

383
00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with it.</v>

384
00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 2>In this war of the Chad Mendez</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

385
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

386
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.580
<v Speaker 2>there's weird ones like Yoel Romero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tested positive for something.</v>

387
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 2>They found out that it was a in one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protein powders or something.</v>

388
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.190
<v Speaker 2>He was taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't supposed to be in there,</v>

389
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.530
<v Speaker 2>wasn't listed that way and they gave him</v>
<v Speaker 2>an abbreviated sentence.</v>

390
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 1>You should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

391
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no part of it whatsoever.</v>

392
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 1>But my whole thing is I'm so grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still optimistic,</v>

393
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking for light in every</v>

394
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:06.434
<v Speaker 1>situation</v>

395
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the way I deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

396
00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I just am always trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always believe there's going to be</v>

397
00:17:12.391 --> 00:17:13.260
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

398
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.620
<v Speaker 1>that's just how I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so grateful where most people</v>

399
00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:19.530
<v Speaker 1>would be so upset with themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this type of stuff.</v>

400
00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm upset about the fans that are let</v>

401
00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:24.120
<v Speaker 1>down who flew out to UFC 200 and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

402
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.810
<v Speaker 1>but as far as the whole situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just glad that that my,</v>

403
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.840
<v Speaker 1>my name will no longer be associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with steroids.</v>

404
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather be vulnerable boy or whatever you</v>

405
00:17:32.821 --> 00:17:34.590
<v Speaker 1>want to call me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but steroids that that was really.</v>

407
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.000
<v Speaker 1>That was really bothering me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just glad that it's out.</v>

408
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.020
<v Speaker 1>What actually happened.</v>
