1
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.360
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you pull it through as you push it through.</v>

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no,</v>

4
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>there's no banging on my wrist at all.</v>

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel anything on my right one,</v>

6
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>it's on my left.</v>

7
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just a timing thing.</v>

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like as it's coming up like you'd get into here and then all in one motion.</v>

9
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>You should it like this where your hand quote meaning you're doing swing swings</v>

10
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.074
<v Speaker 1>is a different thing.</v>

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.221
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do,</v>

13
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing two hand cleans up twice.</v>

14
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>If you go on to him cleans,</v>

15
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>you'd have one in each arm and you go like this like that you recommended?</v>

16
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.981
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

17
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>The ones I like,</v>

18
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>I like to him to this,</v>

19
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>it makes me work both sides the same,</v>

20
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:55.914
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 2>It's called project tango and it's been out for a little while but they made</v>

22
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 2>some adjustments for the sake of io and it's a a tablet if it looks like a</v>

23
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 2>regular tablet,</v>

24
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 2>but what it actually has the ability to do is to map three d space in real time.</v>

25
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 2>So if you think of like VR generally you put on a Vr headset and you're in</v>

26
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 2>whatever university they want to put you in.</v>

27
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.770
<v Speaker 2>This one is looking at the actual thing.</v>

28
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 2>So interacting with objects is something you can still do even though you're</v>

29
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 2>looking at a digital representation of it.</v>

30
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.023
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

31
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Sounds,</v>

32
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.301
<v Speaker 2>sounds weird,</v>

33
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 2>but like a couch,</v>

34
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.581
<v Speaker 2>it's still a couch.</v>

35
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>So you could,</v>

36
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.750
<v Speaker 2>you could like almost stylize it and say you can put like an alligator on the</v>

37
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 2>couch next to you,</v>

38
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:34.341
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

39
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 2>like a completely active scenario that you can interact with physically.</v>

40
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that they have,</v>

41
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:42.074
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

42
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 2>the other use case scenario that I think they're talking about is like in</v>

43
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 2>mapping projects,</v>

44
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>mapping internal spaces and things like that.</v>

45
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's in a developer mode right now.</v>

46
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.150
<v Speaker 2>So you can either hold it up and do it like that.</v>

47
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

48
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.381
<v Speaker 2>normally.</v>

49
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 2>And they also build like a actual physical headset for would be wicked for</v>

50
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 2>greenscreen gps where you could actually have gps and going in between.</v>

51
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

52
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.641
<v Speaker 2>the main,</v>

53
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:05.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

54
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 2>one of the main propositions just for robotics because right now robots don't</v>

55
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:13.601
<v Speaker 2>see very well and this would essentially give robots the ability to see time and</v>

56
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:15.104
<v Speaker 2>space similar.</v>

57
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Shoot the whole</v>

58
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.700
<v Speaker 1>thing off the host talking about 280</v>

59
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.153
<v Speaker 1>blower.</v>

60
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>It's small.</v>

61
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a tight arrow.</v>

62
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>That's her small</v>

63
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.470
<v Speaker 1>aluminum and carbon.</v>

64
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I thought you like the iPhone.</v>

65
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.383
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

66
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

67
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

68
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.823
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

69
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>will be old one.</v>

70
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.283
<v Speaker 1>It fits.</v>

71
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.793
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

72
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

73
00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>that's clean.</v>

74
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.303
<v Speaker 1>That was all right.</v>

75
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I hit a nice sweet spot.</v>

76
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I have this awesome background on the gang green.</v>

77
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

78
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>that's on target and I'm all set.</v>

79
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.903
<v Speaker 1>That's on target.</v>

80
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of these things when we don't,</v>

81
00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:15.380
<v Speaker 1>but we'll book.</v>

82
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

83
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Cut it</v>

84
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>sharp or is it like a point?</v>

85
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.731
<v Speaker 1>There's a point.</v>

86
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:33.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.744
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a point.</v>

88
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Do we want to try and get this done?</v>

89
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:37.350
<v Speaker 1>We need to do,</v>

90
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I should</v>

91
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.343
<v Speaker 1>bring it up here.</v>

92
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.591
<v Speaker 1>Bring Nafa said,</v>

93
00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:42.710
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

94
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>get here.</v>

95
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

96
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.931
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

97
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Here we're going to need the big boat book.</v>

98
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Said it a little easier to manage a swap your main just to 10 pounds more</v>

99
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.084
<v Speaker 1>pulling.</v>

100
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

101
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>it's 100% not necessary and we're actually going to shoot those thing.</v>

102
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll explain what this is and what of those and</v>

103
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

104
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.733
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot like,</v>

105
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

106
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>like if you wanted to do this,</v>

107
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do this experiment,</v>

108
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:14.404
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

109
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

110
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.683
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

111
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.570
<v Speaker 1>if not,</v>

112
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you know the other one that I to is the most powerful compound bullet point</v>

113
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

114
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to order it special from the factory.</v>

115
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't even buy this from the most.</v>

116
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>You can buy a running count along from a low score,</v>

117
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>but there will be more on like this</v>

118
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>is a special order.</v>

119
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.273
<v Speaker 1>The 90 [inaudible],</v>

120
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.203
<v Speaker 1>the other one</v>

121
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.100
<v Speaker 1>got called at nine.</v>

122
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It's called point factor to 90 pounds.</v>

123
00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:50.864
<v Speaker 1>Draw weight.</v>

124
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>It shoots 490 green arrows.</v>

125
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>288 is one of the most powerful pose known to man.</v>

126
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could conceivably make something that's more powerful.</v>

127
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I've heard of a hundred pound bows but very few companies.</v>

128
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.303
<v Speaker 1>Or is this data?</v>

129
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>This is all about the distance.</v>

130
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.971
<v Speaker 1>This is all,</v>

131
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

132
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>this one doesn't have a sight tape on it.</v>

133
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.130
<v Speaker 1>If you look at this one,</v>

134
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.650
<v Speaker 1>see site</v>

135
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.353
<v Speaker 1>a little more.</v>

136
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.973
<v Speaker 1>Last lap,</v>

137
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>the CEPHEID.</v>

138
00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.693
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

139
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.190
<v Speaker 1>smell the burn.</v>

140
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>It's barbecue barbecue.</v>

141
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.180
<v Speaker 1>It'd be smelly arrowhead springs.</v>

142
00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:10.014
<v Speaker 1>She's scholastic.</v>

143
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

144
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>That's fresh smelling.</v>

147
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:17.861
