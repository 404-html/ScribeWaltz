9
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:22.251
<v Speaker 1>was going on about a chef who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting protested by a bunch of animal </v>

10
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:26.931
<v Speaker 1>rights activists and Vegans who decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>to camp out in front of your business </v>

<v Speaker 1>trying to do,</v>

13
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>but you decided to butcher a a leg of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer in front of them and it became this</v>

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>horrific thing like how could you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and a place that serves meat.</v>

15
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>How could you prepare the meat right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them?</v>

16
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Like how did this all get started?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did it become such a crazy viral </v>

17
00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:00.771
<v Speaker 1>story and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why were they mad at you when there's a </v>

18
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>million other restaurants around you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

19
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:06.231
<v Speaker 1>so it started in about December of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clue.</v>

20
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian,</v>

21
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>the crazy Canadian besides being nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why</v>

22
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 2>viral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wasn't being nice.</v>

23
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't the stereotypical Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

24
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 2>you weren't even being mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just doing your job and doing my </v>

25
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.731
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they started in December and they </v>

26
00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 2>really is right in front of your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really got pissed off with our.</v>

27
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 2>We have a little chalkboard sign out </v>
<v Speaker 2>front.</v>

28
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the,</v>

29
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.750
<v Speaker 2>we have a 45 seat restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're a small,</v>

30
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have one business partner who's a,</v>

31
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 2>my best friend and family friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had a little chalkboard sign out </v>

32
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 2>front that said Venison is the new Kale </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

33
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 2>we get cute with our sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tease other restaurants around us </v>

34
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 2>like we have fun with the sign and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

35
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 2>And the cyclist Vegan rode by and took </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge offense to our sign and all of a </v>

36
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 2>sudden one day these protesters just </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up.</v>

37
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 2>So I'm originally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just kind of frustrated because </v>

38
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 2>they're totally misguided because um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take a lot of pride in where our food</v>

39
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:11.291
<v Speaker 2>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have Vegan and vegetarian dishes on </v>

40
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 2>the menu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really respect that type of diet,</v>

41
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 2>so we were just totally floored with why</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was happening.</v>

42
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 2>And so they started going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd started come every week and they </v>

43
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 2>went from like two or three people being</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of peaceful to being like 10,</v>

44
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 2>15 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so peaceful.</v>

45
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 2>So a is when it turned not so peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were shouting at our,</v>

46
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 2>at our guests and shouting in our door </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really trying to harm our business.</v>

47
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of got fed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last resort,</v>

49
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.280
<v Speaker 2>went down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a whole deer a couple times a </v>

50
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.280
<v Speaker 2>month and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we butchered ourselves.</v>

51
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said,</v>

52
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 2>screw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw it.</v>

53
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get these people to get out</v>

54
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 2>of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that that would</v>

55
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>make them go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you think that was going to make</v>

56
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>them go away and not escalate it?</v>

57
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

58
00:02:57.171 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just totally like last resort,</v>

59
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 2>a totally</v>

60
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 3>fed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

61
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to defend myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defend our customers,</v>

62
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see people walking in visibly </v>

63
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:08.791
<v Speaker 3>upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

64
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:12.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're being shouted at being screamed </v>

65
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.731
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called a murderer as they're walking in </v>

66
00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:14.731
<v Speaker 3>for dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're going on a date,</v>

67
00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 3>you want to have this time and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are screaming at you,</v>

68
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

69
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 3>just for eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

70
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just fed up and I just kinda </v>

71
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.790
<v Speaker 3>thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

72
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.730
<v Speaker 3>buzz off and why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just one sign once I send is the new </v>

73
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Kale one sign set this whole thing off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 3>And you're surrounded by restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

75
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're surrounded by restaurants until</v>

76
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 3>there's an actual butcher shop across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the street and if you go in,</v>

77
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 3>there's like whole cattle hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

78
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 3>And the butcher shop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a problem with your comparison to</v>

79
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Kale.</v>

80
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.240
<v Speaker 3>You attack their sacred tail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're promoting a meet.</v>

81
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really bizarre because you are </v>

82
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 3>promoting and we were promoting it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

83
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just didn't promote anything and </v>

84
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 3>they were allowed to cycle by and dream </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Broccoli without interference.</v>

85
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

86
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally bizarre.</v>

87
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many times did they protest you?</v>

88
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's about eight now.</v>

89
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.090

<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

94
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 3>they're basically giving us an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimatum.</v>

95
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 3>We have to put their slogan in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>window and they'll go away.</v>

96
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

99
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:37.160
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

100
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.410
<v Speaker 3>like killing animals is wrong and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have feelings while.</v>

101
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to put that in your window?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't,</v>

103
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way they want.</v>

104
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 3>So eco terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extortion,</v>

106
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 3>wherever you want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

107
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the part,</v>

108
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.930
<v Speaker 3>the part of this that drives you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most crazy is the fact that you're </v>

109
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're surrounded by restaurants you're </v>

110
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

111
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 3>you're across cross street from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>butcher shop.</v>

112
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 3>90 seven percent of the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world eat meat.</v>

113
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 3>It's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something crazy like that.</v>

114
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure everyone hasn't really been </v>

115
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.450
<v Speaker 3>pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's not that accurate,</v>

116
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's somewhere between 95 and $97.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's big.</v>

117
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.140
<v Speaker 3>It's big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we know we're an easy </v>

118
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.140
<v Speaker 3>target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

119
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 3>her name is antler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>

120
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I think they're mad because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

121
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

122
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 3>their thing is that we're promoting </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical farming and their beliefs is </v>

123
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 3>there is no such thing as ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>farming that all meat is murder.</v>

124
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

125
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 3>if you look up murder in the dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with humans,</v>

126
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has nothing to do with animals.</v>

127
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is such a thing as ethical farming</v>

128
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:48.181
<v Speaker 3>and sustainable farming and we work </v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard to make sure that where we </v>

129
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 3>get our meat from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

130
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:53.791
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the best possible place we can and </v>

131
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:56.941
<v Speaker 3>it's local.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's supporting our local farmers </v>

132
00:05:56.941 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 3>that are within hours of our restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

133
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:02.321
<v Speaker 3>when you say that they started out nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how many people were there in the </v>

134
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:02.321
<v Speaker 3>beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>

135
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>

136
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 3>And they had signs and they were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>

137
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>promoting their message,</v>

138
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't really yelling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming and what escalated it.</v>

139
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we would call the police.</v>

140
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 3>We kind of got wind of it on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook groups,</v>

141
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:21.071
<v Speaker 3>so we would call the police and have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>police there to make sure everyone's </v>

142
00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 3>safe because one thing like customers </v>
<v Speaker 3>are scared,</v>

143
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 3>our staffers scared.</v>

144
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's dealt with this before.</v>

145
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 3>I've never dealt with this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

146
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 3>so we would have the police there they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

147
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 3>the police were amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

148
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 3>and then one time we kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

149
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:36.250
<v Speaker 3>let's not call the police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see what happens.</v>

150
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go away.</v>

151
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 3>And so then like a megaphone came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

152
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 3>our neighbors were coming down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in fights with them.</v>

153
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was ugly.</v>

154
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 3>So we called the police to come and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ keeps the peace.</v>

155
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A megaphone.</v>

156
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the problem with these kinds of </v>

157
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>things is it becomes a contest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes a battle,</v>

158
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to see who's gonna win.</v>

159
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 3>And they're absolutely on a team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

160
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that happens </v>

161
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 3>with veganism and I think it happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>with hunters to,</v>

162
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people become very tribal,</v>

163
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

164
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:17.261
<v Speaker 3>it's us versus them and they want to win</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it becomes this thing where,</v>

165
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

166
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.160
<v Speaker 3>the reality is a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>idiots and they don't have a lot going </v>

167
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 3>on in their life.</v>

168
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.940
<v Speaker 3>And so when something comes up where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes a primary focus of their life,</v>

169
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.180
<v Speaker 3>one restaurant is a logical is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be that becomes the battle </v>

170
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 3>ground and it's an ideological battle </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground for,</v>

171
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:40.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't eat meat ever versus sustainable </v>

172
00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 3>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

173
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 3>this the look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure,</v>

174
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:48.371
<v Speaker 3>I know you're a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you feel a certain amount of </v>

175
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 3>remorse when an animal dies a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

176
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.690
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of sort of my beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and my philosophy and why I'm working on</v>

177
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:58.170
<v Speaker 3>this cookbook right now is because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

178
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you do eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to kill an animal and</v>

179
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 3>experience that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

180
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that if people were to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill an animal,</v>

181
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 3>they would see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

182
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 3>what goes into that and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>people would consume as much,</v>

183
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 3>meaning I don't think people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely,</v>

184
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.860
<v Speaker 3>certainly wouldn't waste as much meat as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do and it's just really upsetting.</v>

185
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's totally misguided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

186
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 3>why we were targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

187
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

188
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it just becomes a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

189
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a big tribal game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

190
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real argument,</v>

191
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 3>a real argument that I support against </v>
<v Speaker 3>factory farming and factory farming is </v>

192
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.351
<v Speaker 3>the way most people are getting their </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat in terms of like in terms of like </v>

193
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 3>cheeseburgers and fast food and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>along those lines.</v>

194
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:49.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting it from the most </v>

195
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 3>ethical sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not financially sustainable to</v>

196
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 3>do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything would cost more money.</v>

197
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

198
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real.</v>

199
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 3>That we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a society,</v>

200
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 3>it's not obviously not you or I that set</v>
<v Speaker 3>up the system,</v>

201
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 3>but that this system is a system that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>find ourselves a part of.</v>

202
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've removed myself from it for the most</v>

203
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but occasionally I'm on the road and I'm</v>

204
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 3>hungry and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat some meat.</v>

205
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 3>That's just whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

206
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a necessary evil,</v>

207
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:18.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in sort of sorts.</v>

208
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not really necessary at all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the wrong way to describe </v>

209
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.301
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's how the system has been set up </v>

210
00:09:26.301 --> 00:09:28.581
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually why I started hunting and </v>

211
00:09:28.581 --> 00:09:30.890
<v Speaker 3>doing what I do because I watched these </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries like food inc and these </v>

212
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 3>things that kind of shine a light on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

213
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 3>the system and how this stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually being produced.</v>

214
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:36.460
<v Speaker 3>And it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

215
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.520
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

216
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the real number one </v>

217
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.391
<v Speaker 3>problem and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this Vegan activist message to go </v>

218
00:09:44.391 --> 00:09:46.360
<v Speaker 3>after these types of farming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

219
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 3>we support as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We agree with.</v>

220
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that we were targeted for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this was really,</v>

221
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 3>really frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

222
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I think vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

223
00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.410
<v Speaker 3>I understand where they're coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that they have seen </v>

224
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 3>the big picture.</v>

225
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 3>And the big picture is there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that need to be harvested.</v>

226
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 3>They're not sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wild pigs is the best example.</v>

227
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 3>There is no way you are going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild pigs without killing them.</v>

228
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to give them birth </v>

229
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to,</v>

230
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.870
<v Speaker 3>unless you've gotta let loose fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>packs of wolves.</v>

231
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 3>And I mean packs to deal with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in Texas.</v>

232
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

233
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 3>they're forced to shoot them out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters.</v>

234
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:33.951
<v Speaker 3>They hot crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hire people to come in with </v>

235
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:33.951
<v Speaker 3>helicopters and shoot them from this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

236
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 3>It's that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is farmers.</v>

237
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 3>There's companies called Hella hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they have it on the side,</v>

238
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 3>like they have a wild boar and a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter blade on their logo.</v>

239
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.400
<v Speaker 3>They have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

240
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

241
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:52.071
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a lot of experience with </v>

242
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:52.071
<v Speaker 3>that because where I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have that wild boar problem.</v>

243
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:52.670
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

244
00:10:52.671 --> 00:10:57.671
<v Speaker 3>I hunt with these guys from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Moscow yoke and I've gone down </v>

245
00:10:57.671 --> 00:11:00.891
<v Speaker 3>there and done one of these pig hunts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've shown me their fields and </v>

246
00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 3>like one third of their cornfield is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just destroyed,</v>

247
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 3>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have to hunt them at night or </v>

248
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.071
<v Speaker 3>they hunt them with dogs and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge problem for farmers trying </v>

249
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 3>to make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a huge problem.</v>

250
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 3>And vegans themselves need to understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your food supply.</v>

251
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not growing your own food.</v>

252
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:21.771
<v Speaker 3>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people listening to this that are </v>

253
00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:23.631
<v Speaker 3>Vegan or not growing their own food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting your own food from a </v>

254
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 3>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That farm is getting attacked by pigs.</v>

255
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the only one animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one is dear.</v>

256
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a shitload of deer in </v>
<v Speaker 3>North America.</v>

257
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.970
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is California has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very weird way of handling it and I kind</v>

258
00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:35.070
<v Speaker 3>of get it in some ways.</v>

259
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.340
<v Speaker 3>The weird way that we handle it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>California is we don't hunt mountain </v>

260
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:40.340
<v Speaker 3>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

261
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.950
<v Speaker 3>There's no mountain lion hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very few deer.</v>

262
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see deer in my neighborhood.</v>

263
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I've lived in a fairly rural area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

264
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I see deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

265
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.080
<v Speaker 3>couple of times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's nothing like if you go to the </v>

266
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.381
<v Speaker 3>east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever been in the east coast of </v>

267
00:11:57.381 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 3>California or the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like New York state,</v>

268
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 3>that kind of area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but near New York City.</v>

269
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 3>I had been to the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the state,</v>

270
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 3>if you go upstate like New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many fucking deer up there.</v>

271
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why lyme disease</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so horrible up there.</v>

272
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 3>It's comes from the ticks that were on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the deer and people get these terrible,</v>

273
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 3>terrible cases of lyme disease and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking everywhere up there,</v>

274
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:23.671
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have several friends that have really </v>

275
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:23.671
<v Speaker 3>bad lyme disease.</v>

276
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Have to take 'em,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to Jim Miller's instagram.</v>

277
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:31.381
<v Speaker 3>Jim Miller is a fighter in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a high level fighter who's been </v>

278
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.200
<v Speaker 3>competing at the highest level for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time and he has serious lyme </v>

279
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 3>disease to the point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>debilitating,</v>

280
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.050
<v Speaker 3>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to take a fat bag of pills and he</v>

281
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 3>held up his pills the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he takes while he's looking at this</v>

282
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 3>is what he takes wally's in training </v>
<v Speaker 3>camp.</v>

283
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen days of medication supplements.</v>

284
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.540
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

285
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 3>fuck Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me Thirty one capsules a day.</v>

286
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:04.070
<v Speaker 3>You do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember the carry to seven a and it </v>

287
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 3>just says lyme disease is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hashtags.</v>

288
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got it really bad and I mean,</v>

289
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 3>what's crazy is the guy could not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthier,</v>

290
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 3>works out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly eats right.</v>

291
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:19.050
<v Speaker 3>He's not booze and his body's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>falling apart because of fucking lyme </v>

292
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 3>disease and it's being carried by these.</v>

293
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.660
<v Speaker 3>These deer overpopulation of wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals is handled in one of two ways.</v>

294
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Either you introduced predators or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>manage them with hunting.</v>

295
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a place in Maui,</v>

296
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.300
<v Speaker 3>in Maui where they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

297
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.660
<v Speaker 3>the at Maui has no predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

298
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.730
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also have a bunch of wild game </v>

299
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.420
<v Speaker 3>that was brought in for King Kamehameha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in the 18 hundreds.</v>

300
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 3>They brought it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure when,</v>

301
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:53.671
<v Speaker 3>but there's tons of access deer on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Maui and Lanai and on Molokai and a </v>

302
00:13:55.151 --> 00:14:00.151
<v Speaker 3>couple of different islands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things they've started </v>

303
00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:02.710
<v Speaker 3>doing is they were trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to eradicate them from this area.</v>

304
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.240
<v Speaker 3>So a bunch of hunters got together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hunting these access deer.</v>

305
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.870
<v Speaker 3>Then giving the meat to poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like making it free for them and it's a,</v>

306
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:16.990
<v Speaker 3>it's a really cool program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's another sort of situation </v>

307
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:19.290
<v Speaker 3>where you kind of have to hunt you.</v>

308
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Speaker 3>There's no other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're just going to poison them </v>

309
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.420
<v Speaker 3>or you're going to somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 3>capture them all and neuter and spay a </v>

310
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.251
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of them every month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's really no other way to handle </v>

311
00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:32.251
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

312
00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:36.421
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a big misconception </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people that don't educate </v>

313
00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 3>themselves about hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting is bad.</v>

314
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:41.821
<v Speaker 3>Killing animals is bad and they'd get on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bandwagon but they don't have </v>

315
00:14:41.821 --> 00:14:42.180
<v Speaker 3>enough information about it know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

316
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.460
<v Speaker 3>and I think people confuse trophy </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting with like they see cecil the </v>

317
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:47.980
<v Speaker 3>lion and everyone goes after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

318
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:49.510
<v Speaker 3>it's hunting is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the problem,</v>

319
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

320
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:55.231
<v Speaker 3>trophy hunting is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the hunters that hunt for food and </v>

321
00:14:55.231 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 3>that hunt to help the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

322
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 3>the sort of environmental impacts that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're having.</v>

323
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:04.841
<v Speaker 3>Like people don't like snow geese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know much about </v>

324
00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:07.090
<v Speaker 3>snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You read that article that you </v>

325
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:07.090
<v Speaker 3>retweeted.</v>

326
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

327
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.151
<v Speaker 3>They like a nat Geo article that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>posted these birds fly in flocks of 20,</v>

328
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:15.671
<v Speaker 3>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds and they land in a farmer's field </v>

329
00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:17.891
<v Speaker 3>and they eat everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and they destroy it and you </v>

330
00:15:17.891 --> 00:15:17.891
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 10,</v>

331
00:15:17.891 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 3>15 years ago these populations of birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't like they are now.</v>

332
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:25.451
<v Speaker 3>So I'm well large scale agriculture is </v>
<v Speaker 3>also responsible for the boom and the </v>

333
00:15:25.451 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 3>population of deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer and in America,</v>

334
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.990
<v Speaker 3>particularly like in the midwest where </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the farms are.</v>

335
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:38.230
<v Speaker 3>What is it a fucking coincidence that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all the deer were all the farms </v>

336
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.230
<v Speaker 3>are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

337
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.771
<v Speaker 3>it's not by my good friend Doug Darren,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a big ass farm in Wisconsin.</v>

338
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful place in the driftless area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what that is?</v>

339
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 3>It's where the glaciers didn't pass </v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

340
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.040
<v Speaker 3>so it's not flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all these hills and it's very </v>

341
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 3>beautiful and lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a phenomenal place,</v>

342
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.230
<v Speaker 3>but essentially he's got the deer that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he hunts and that,</v>

343
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.280
<v Speaker 3>that he and his friends hunt on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>property.</v>

344
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.170
<v Speaker 3>They're farm animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

345
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Corn grows corn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a farmer,</v>

346
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.910
<v Speaker 3>so he grows all this corn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The deer are eating all this corn and </v>

347
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:13.510
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

348
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.850
<v Speaker 3>They're huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so good.</v>

349
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 3>But there's a reality to a population </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

350
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:26.110
<v Speaker 3>Now in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get it because they're around them </v>

351
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hitting them with their cars.</v>

352
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 3>They see them everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look.</v>

353
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not like the idealistic view of </v>

354
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 3>someone who lives in a city street in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto and is driving around their bike</v>

355
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 3>looking for signs that are criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kale or whatever the fuck they're doing.</v>

356
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 3>They're not in the real natural world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that these animals are present.</v>

357
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.510
<v Speaker 3>They don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand,</v>

358
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

359
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.080
<v Speaker 3>they live in their bubble and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing they don't understand is </v>

360
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.080
<v Speaker 3>that hunter is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

361
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.670
<v Speaker 3>we have to buy tags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to buy our licenses that were </v>

362
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.670
<v Speaker 3>rules and laws that we have to follow.</v>

363
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 3>And those fees actually pay for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife conservation.</v>

364
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:05.470
<v Speaker 3>And I'm pretty sure it's the same in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>states as well from talking to my </v>

365
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.621
<v Speaker 3>friends and it is Pitman Robertson Act </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't understand been percent </v>

366
00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:13.450
<v Speaker 3>of all the proceeds from hunting gear go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to wildlife conservation.</v>

367
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 3>And that turns out to be billions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars.</v>

368
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:21.200
<v Speaker 3>It's far more than any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation group,</v>

369
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 3>far more than any wildlife conservation </v>
<v Speaker 3>group or animal activist group,</v>

370
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:30.491
<v Speaker 3>and no one contributes more to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation than hunting because we </v>

371
00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:34.691
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want it to be there for our kids and </v>

372
00:17:34.691 --> 00:17:34.691
<v Speaker 3>their kids and it's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

373
00:17:34.691 --> 00:17:38.320
<v Speaker 3>it's how the world is supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also this contradictory thing that </v>

374
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:38.320
<v Speaker 3>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it doesn't make sense,</v>

375
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 3>but we love the wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the animals.</v>

376
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Just because you eat them doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't love them,</v>

377
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 3>but you recognize them as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a weird way to look at it,</v>

378
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 3>but it is a renewable resource.</v>

379
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is also a magical,</v>

380
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:56.631
<v Speaker 3>beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because of that doesn't mean you </v>

381
00:17:56.631 --> 00:17:56.631
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

382
00:17:56.631 --> 00:18:00.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this disconnect that people have with </v>

383
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Speaker 3>the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is a real part of it.</v>

384
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 3>A real part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck finding a Vegan in Alaska.</v>

385
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of them that </v>

386
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.570
<v Speaker 3>live out in the bush that are vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>salmon and they're eating and you can,</v>

387
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.560
<v Speaker 3>you can bring in vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

388
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are some of them just </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking shit,</v>

389
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're embedded in that world,</v>

390
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.000
<v Speaker 3>you understand it and you appreciate it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's very humbling.</v>

391
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing an animal is very humbling.</v>

392
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:31.221
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like somewhat as an animal </v>

393
00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:31.221
<v Speaker 3>lover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds fucking crazy.</v>

394
00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:31.350
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also really hard.</v>

395
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:36.351
<v Speaker 3>Like when I see a deer come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hunt with a bow crossbow and I see a </v>

396
00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:36.351
<v Speaker 3>deer come out.</v>

397
00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trembling.</v>

398
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 3>The hair on my back is standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are these beautiful,</v>

399
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 3>majestic creatures and I'm going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and it's really,</v>

400
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:48.210
<v Speaker 3>really difficult and I don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people understand that,</v>

401
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 3>that don't hunt and then haven't killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>an animal.</v>

402
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:55.101
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand the respect and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of effort that goes into </v>

403
00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:55.500
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

404
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.330
<v Speaker 3>they definitely don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't care.</v>

405
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they have an idea and the is </v>

406
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.000
<v Speaker 3>animals should not die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to die.</v>

407
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to die of old age.</v>

408
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 3>They're going to die of starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna freeze to death.</v>

409
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna be eaten alive.</v>

410
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be eaten alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people think that animals,</v>

411
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 3>they die peacefully in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely incorrect.</v>

412
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:19.010
<v Speaker 3>If you google anything about how animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>dying well and they're being eaten </v>

413
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.301
<v Speaker 3>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like deer being taken down and eaten </v>

414
00:19:23.301 --> 00:19:23.301
<v Speaker 3>alive by wolves or coyotes or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

415
00:19:23.301 --> 00:19:24.810
<v Speaker 3>there's bears and it's horrific.</v>

416
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 3>And to be shot with an Arrow to be shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bullet,</v>

417
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a way more humane way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

418
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:31.410
<v Speaker 3>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

419
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unquestionably a more humane way to</v>

420
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

421
00:19:34.771 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the reasons why I hunt and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>practiced so much.</v>

422
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I practice every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one of the reasons why we got </v>

423
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.570
<v Speaker 3>this building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I could put a $45 dollars.</v>

424
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I want to shoot it to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

425
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.200
<v Speaker 3>we could shoot afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was have to fucking practice.</v>

426
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:54.290
<v Speaker 3>You have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to make an ethical </v>

427
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.441
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now when I sit down and I cook </v>

428
00:19:57.441 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 3>something for my family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know where that came from.</v>

429
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.380
<v Speaker 3>If we have vegetables that we grow in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our garden,</v>

430
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a great satisfaction for serving</v>
<v Speaker 3>up some cucumbers or some,</v>

431
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.640
<v Speaker 3>some Kale or whatever it is that we grow</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our garden.</v>

432
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.640
<v Speaker 3>It tastes better when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go out there and you cut that </v>

433
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 3>cucumber off the planet and you cut that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kale down,</v>

434
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:18.070
<v Speaker 3>it is like half an hour old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nothing compares to that freshness </v>

435
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 3>that you go to the grocery store that </v>
<v Speaker 3>may be a couple of days a week,</v>

436
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:23.010
<v Speaker 3>a month old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea and for me as a chef,</v>

437
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.790
<v Speaker 3>that's why I love hunting and foraging </v>
<v Speaker 3>and having a garden in my backyard </v>

438
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 3>because when you go and pick something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing tastes as good as that.</v>

439
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

440
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean I appreciate were vegans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal rights activists are coming from </v>

441
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:43.170
<v Speaker 3>because it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of distortion with</v>

442
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 3>like really angry ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is my take on a lot of this is </v>

443
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.171
<v Speaker 3>you get a group of 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them for sure is a fucking idiot </v>

444
00:20:52.171 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 3>just out of just sheer odds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

445
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Like what are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is a fucking gets pretty </v>

446
00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.340
<v Speaker 3>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

447
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Well if you're going to get a group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 vegans,</v>

448
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get at least one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

449
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're going to be.</v>

450
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them are super aggressive about </v>

451
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.270
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a ton of them online.</v>

452
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.350
<v Speaker 3>You can go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

453
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Their identity is completely wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 3>around veganism.</v>

454
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 3>These vegan in their name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always,</v>

455
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm the Vegan this or the Vegan that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is 100 percent of their name,</v>

456
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.010
<v Speaker 3>so a 100 percent of their identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they can't.</v>

457
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:26.070
<v Speaker 3>They can't separate from it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is who they are forever and </v>

458
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 3>they have been some serious problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the name of that cafe again?</v>

459
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Cafe gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were some people that were running</v>

460
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:36.820
<v Speaker 3>a Vegan restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they have a couple of them right</v>

461
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.120
<v Speaker 3>in La and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were having health issues and some </v>

462
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:47.281
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Vegan Diet just doesn't agree with </v>

463
00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:48.940
<v Speaker 3>them and maybe they were doing it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they have unique dietary needs,</v>

464
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.970
<v Speaker 3>but they started raising cattle and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>started eating those cattle and the </v>

465
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.790
<v Speaker 3>fucking vegans freaked out.</v>

466
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.880
<v Speaker 3>Death threats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this crazy shit coming after them </v>

467
00:21:59.880 --> 00:21:59.880
<v Speaker 3>protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

468
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people were terrified.</v>

469
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:01.610
<v Speaker 3>They're older folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

470
00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

471
00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:02.980
<v Speaker 3>they're elderly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

472
00:22:02.981 --> 00:22:07.981
<v Speaker 3>it is Vegan restaurant owners received </v>
<v Speaker 3>death threats over animal slaughter </v>

473
00:22:07.981 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 3>scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

474
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the bad ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

475
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 3>And it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them,</v>

476
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.840
<v Speaker 3>most vegans I think are vegans for all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right reasons.</v>

477
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 3>You're misinformed if you choose to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not,</v>

478
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not eat meat and choose that kind of </v>

479
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle like power to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

480
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.970
<v Speaker 3>And I think that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

481
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.510
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

482
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.140
<v Speaker 3>if it works for you in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

483
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.580
<v Speaker 3>And for me it doesn't work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've,</v>

484
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.170
<v Speaker 3>I've done Vegan cleanses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done the juice cleanses,</v>

485
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done,</v>

486
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I've gone out for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a chef to Vegan restaurants and I'm </v>

487
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 3>not full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

488
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

489
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.940
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat three or four courses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll spend tons of money and half an </v>

490
00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.490
<v Speaker 3>hour later I'm starving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starving and I need to eat something </v>

491
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.500
<v Speaker 3>with protein and lots of protein and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's meat or fish or I've made tofu from</v>

492
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 3>scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from soybeans and it's just,</v>

493
00:22:58.181 --> 00:22:59.800
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same.</v>

494
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well right now people are screaming,</v>

495
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.560
<v Speaker 3>you're doing every vegan food is tasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not selling of it is.</v>

496
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 3>Some of it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

497
00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 3>I eat vegan raw all the time there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a Vegan restaurant near me.</v>

498
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 3>I go to all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you get dirty looks,</v>

499
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker's here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you here?</v>

500
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not one of us.</v>

501
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.710
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to eat our food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

502
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.510
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very unfortunate that I think these</v>

503
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.210
<v Speaker 3>ideological groups get tainted by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most extreme members.</v>

504
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's true on the hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>side too.</v>

505
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:38.040
<v Speaker 3>And you got guys like fucking Ted </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nugent,</v>

506
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the people that I think that </v>

507
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.810
<v Speaker 3>they distort the real sort of</v>

508
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.790
<v Speaker 1>fascinating in mystical qualities of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife and harvesting wildlife and </v>

509
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:58.181
<v Speaker 1>being out there and experiencing nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said it's an almost psychedelic </v>

510
00:23:58.181 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 1>experience to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hunt and be in the wild.</v>

511
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 1>That sounds so counterintuitive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's never experienced it,</v>

512
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 1>but the world of these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're away from your cell phone,</v>

513
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 1>when you're away from television and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit and the computer,</v>

514
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.860
<v Speaker 1>when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're out there in the wild,</v>

515
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:20.861
<v Speaker 1>you are almost in another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in complete silence in the </v>

516
00:24:20.861 --> 00:24:21.830
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in you,</v>

517
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:27.070
<v Speaker 1>your mind goes into a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different sort of mode that is familiar,</v>

518
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:35.890
<v Speaker 1>but yet alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's familiar in a way that your body's </v>

519
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:35.890
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

520
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.941
<v Speaker 1>this is hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what humans have done for </v>

521
00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why we became human.</v>

522
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is literally one of the reasons </v>

523
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 1>that scientists believed that our brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew is because we started eating meat.</v>

524
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.090
<v Speaker 1>We started cooking meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nutrition became more accessible and</v>

525
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:53.210
<v Speaker 1>also we started thinking about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>

526
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:58.270
<v Speaker 1>developing tools to hunt with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of this is the reason why </v>

527
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 1>humans are humans today and I'm sure the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan argument against that would be,</v>

528
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's then and we're past that now.</v>

529
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 1>While we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

530
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>

531
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Because of controlling the population of</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

532
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:12.550
<v Speaker 1>we're certainly not because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling the population of predators </v>

533
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:12.920
<v Speaker 1>and that's another thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to accept and understand.</v>

534
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why they eradicated all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wolves in North America before they </v>

535
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.641
<v Speaker 1>reintroduced them to yellowstone and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're thriving and many parts of the </v>

536
00:25:21.641 --> 00:25:25.031
<v Speaker 1>northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they were fucking killing </v>

537
00:25:25.031 --> 00:25:26.951
<v Speaker 1>everything and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any predators and the </v>

538
00:25:26.951 --> 00:25:29.680
<v Speaker 1>predators that they have are humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we don't keep the populations in </v>

539
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.001
<v Speaker 1>check of them and have grizzly bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>have black bears and all the other </v>

540
00:25:34.001 --> 00:25:35.030
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start eating each other.</v>

541
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.120
<v Speaker 1>They start tearing each other apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start coming after us to start </v>

542
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.120
<v Speaker 1>encroaching on p.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

543
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.360
<v Speaker 1>we're in their territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't be in their place.</v>

544
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.830
<v Speaker 1>We humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

545
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on team people so I don't know what </v>

546
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.950
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you're saying here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that we should move out of</v>

547
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco and give it to the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go fuck yourself.</v>

548
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is literally what it boils down</v>

549
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:56.801
<v Speaker 1>to because you have to draw some line in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sand somewhere because if someone </v>

550
00:25:56.801 --> 00:25:58.580
<v Speaker 1>doesn't control the population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

551
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.400
<v Speaker 1>then what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

552
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:06.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can leave them to their own devices </v>

553
00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:06.770
<v Speaker 1>and they can sort of sort it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know how they sorted out through</v>

554
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:11.771
<v Speaker 1>disease and starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what happens is there's too many </v>

555
00:26:11.771 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 1>animals and not enough food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they get horrific diseases.</v>

556
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 1>That's where mange comes from.</v>

557
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.340
<v Speaker 1>That's where a lot of serious diseases </v>
<v Speaker 1>that infect wildlife come from.</v>

558
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.230
<v Speaker 1>They come from a lack of food or </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpopulation.</v>

559
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.510
<v Speaker 1>That's how nature sorts it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

560
00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:28.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's how nature sorts of that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people too.</v>

561
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:33.071
<v Speaker 1>Which just sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've used vaccines and shit and we're </v>

562
00:26:33.071 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 1>at the top of food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've worked hard to get there.</v>

563
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:38.650
<v Speaker 1>We are and I think we it comes with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain responsibility and that </v>

564
00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:42.521
<v Speaker 1>responsibility is really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were really doing a disservice to </v>

565
00:26:42.521 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 1>that responsibility with factory farming</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the main arguments for</v>

566
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:50.811
<v Speaker 1>veganism that one of the main arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the horrific treatment of those </v>

567
00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:54.591
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's veganism or or or or </v>

568
00:26:54.591 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 1>whether it's rather factory farming or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a large skill,</v>

569
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:02.210
<v Speaker 1>dairy farms where they mistreat their </v>
<v Speaker 1>cows or the chicken farms are all these </v>

570
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:06.111
<v Speaker 1>different factory farms with a treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals not as a living being but </v>

571
00:27:06.121 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 1>as a commodity.</v>

572
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Then it becomes a giant problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at guys like,</v>

573
00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 1>do you know Joel Salitan is Joel South,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tends very fascinating guy.</v>

574
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.490
<v Speaker 1>He runs a farm called polyface farms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he is essentially done is made </v>

575
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.880
<v Speaker 1>large scale animal agriculture possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a humane and very natural way.</v>

576
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:32.990
<v Speaker 1>He has enormous electric fences that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses for his pigs and he just moves them</v>

577
00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:39.321
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves the fences around so the pigs </v>

578
00:27:39.321 --> 00:27:39.840
<v Speaker 1>wander around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a huge rolling chicken coop.</v>

579
00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucking huge and he pushes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing around.</v>

580
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 1>He moves it to a new space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chickens go out,</v>

581
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 1>they wander around and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

582
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:46.800
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

583
00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:51.801
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do the chicken thing and they go </v>

584
00:27:51.801 --> 00:27:51.801
<v Speaker 1>right back into the chicken house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets the eggs from.</v>

585
00:27:51.801 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 1>This is how they raised chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how they raise cattle.</v>

586
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.960
<v Speaker 1>They do it with all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and his perspective on all this </v>

587
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 1>is that if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do it right,</v>

588
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an evil thing,</v>

589
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.010
<v Speaker 1>and that these animals are living the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they've.</v>

590
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.620
<v Speaker 1>They're meant to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

591
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:15.310
<v Speaker 2>and that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that we do at </v>

592
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Antler is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to find those farmers and guys like </v>

593
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.221
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the farms that we get our deer </v>

594
00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:20.221
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have thousand acres.</v>

595
00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:20.560
<v Speaker 2>The deer roam as they pleased they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>

596
00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:25.620
<v Speaker 2>not an apples and acorns and grass and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they're supposed to eat and </v>

597
00:28:25.691 --> 00:28:30.691
<v Speaker 2>then when it's time they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're collected and harvested and </v>

598
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:33.901
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is where we get our meat from and </v>

599
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:34.570
<v Speaker 2>we try really hard not to buy from these</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>

600
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.880
<v Speaker 2>We don't serve chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beef or pork.</v>

601
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 2>We have bison pheasant duck well bore </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these game farms,</v>

602
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.880
<v Speaker 2>they don't have these massive large </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale operations and I buy direct from </v>

603
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.790
<v Speaker 2>the farmer and they can tell me what </v>
<v Speaker 2>their diet is,</v>

604
00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good months,</v>

605
00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:56.010
<v Speaker 2>they're bad months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know all about these animals that </v>

606
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.410
<v Speaker 2>we're bringing to the restaurant and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

607
00:28:56.411 --> 00:28:57.220
<v Speaker 2>we're really proud of that.</v>

608
00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I have an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue with people that keep saying </v>

609
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.521
<v Speaker 2>wild boar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did they say wild boar when it's </v>

610
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 2>wild pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it's a male,</v>

611
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 2>it actually is a different breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the pigs that are in these factory </v>

612
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.430
<v Speaker 2>farms or even regular regular pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

613
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.570
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's many different breeds and a lot </v>

614
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.570
<v Speaker 2>of them are hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hybrid breeds.</v>

615
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:22.010
<v Speaker 2>The wild boar breed has long black hair </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tusks that actually come out so I </v>

616
00:29:23.021 --> 00:29:25.600
<v Speaker 2>can buy whole pigs and they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>those tusks.</v>

617
00:29:25.601 --> 00:29:28.780
<v Speaker 2>And when I buy the well bore breed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat is darker,</v>

618
00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.680
<v Speaker 2>hair is black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>

619
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 2>we're getting um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

620
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.930
<v Speaker 2>there's no hair by the time we get them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've got the tusks in the jaw.</v>

621
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is that a board is a male,</v>

622
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely eating females too.</v>

623
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.570
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

624
00:29:40.571 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 2>So why do call it a wild boar?</v>

625
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Because it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

626
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:48.391
<v Speaker 1>it's just the breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you know that they're all the </v>

627
00:29:48.391 --> 00:29:48.391
<v Speaker 1>same breed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

628
00:29:48.391 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 1>All [inaudible] is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

629
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the genus,</v>

630
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:57.510
<v Speaker 1>is that what you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all sort of interchangeable </v>

631
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.290
<v Speaker 1>breed with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know there's,</v>

632
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 1>there's tons of different varieties like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Berkshire,</v>

633
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:05.671
<v Speaker 1>there's Tamworth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these different kinds of </v>

634
00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:05.671
<v Speaker 1>shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breeds of hogs is variations.</v>

635
00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're all the same animal.</v>

636
00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.910
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy about wild pigs is you took</v>
<v Speaker 1>a domestic pig,</v>

637
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like babe release babe out into the </v>

638
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.661
<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They morph right a very short amount of </v>

639
00:30:18.661 --> 00:30:18.661
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it extends.</v>

640
00:30:18.661 --> 00:30:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Their hair becomes darker and thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their tusks lengthen.</v>

641
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>

642
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:28.861
<v Speaker 1>There are weird animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pigs are a weird animal because where </v>

643
00:30:28.861 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 1>we're at a weird animal when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic,</v>

644
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>they're sweethearts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you fall in the cage when they're</v>

645
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:34.810
<v Speaker 1>hungry and they fucking eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

646
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.730
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the main ways that farmers </v>
<v Speaker 1>die falling into cages that eaten by.</v>

647
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Some happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

648
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 1>It happens every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy will fuck up and fall into a pig pen</v>

649
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 1>and the pigs just fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

650
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're dealing with those </v>

651
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.891
<v Speaker 1>really enormous pigs mean those pigs </v>
<v Speaker 1>need a lot of food and they're fucking </v>

652
00:30:55.891 --> 00:31:00.661
<v Speaker 1>big and once they start chewing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your ass is just an aside.</v>

653
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you been pig hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

654
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

655
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I've been hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've shot a couple of pigs.</v>

656
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meat is definitely different.</v>

657
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot darker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darker.</v>

658
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious though.</v>

659
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I do it.</v>

660
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.390
<v Speaker 1>What's really interesting is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

661
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the pigs were introduced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>William Randolph hearst,</v>

662
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that crazy asshole that ran from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie citizen Kane,</v>

663
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:29.670
<v Speaker 1>of course in wells depiction of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was this crazy guy that ran hearst </v>

664
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:29.800
<v Speaker 1>publications in the 19 thirties.</v>

665
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.710
<v Speaker 1>He's literally one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is illegal.</v>

666
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>William Randolph hearst decided that </v>

667
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.740
<v Speaker 1>when there was a cover of a believe as </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular science magazine that said hemp </v>

668
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.480
<v Speaker 1>is the new billion dollar crop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were,</v>

669
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.510
<v Speaker 1>they had invented a machine called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decorticator and when a decorticator </v>

670
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 1>does is it effectively processes hemp </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiber.</v>

671
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm much more efficiently and for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longest time they use slaves to process </v>

672
00:31:55.330 --> 00:32:00.121
<v Speaker 1>hemp fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then Eli Whitney came around with </v>

673
00:32:00.121 --> 00:32:01.270
<v Speaker 1>the cotton gin and they switch from hemp</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothing to cotton.</v>

674
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Cotton is easier to produce with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cotton gin,</v>

675
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's just an inferior cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hamp makes better paper.</v>

676
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 1>A hemp makes cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make houses with it.</v>

677
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford made the first fenders for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first model t out of hemp.</v>

678
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy thing.</v>

679
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.550
<v Speaker 1>William Randolph hearst read this </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

680
00:32:20.551 --> 00:32:25.551
<v Speaker 1>saw what was coming and realized that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to have to transition all of </v>

681
00:32:25.551 --> 00:32:29.491
<v Speaker 1>his paper mills and he owned forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would cut down the trees and </v>

682
00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:32.791
<v Speaker 1>make paper with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will have to transition those to </v>

683
00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:35.041
<v Speaker 1>hemp if people were demanding hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead he undercut the entire </v>

684
00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:39.691
<v Speaker 1>industry by saying that there was a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug that blacks and were smoking</v>

685
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 3>and they were raping white women and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>called this drug marijuana,</v>

686
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 3>which was really just the name of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a Mexican slang for wild tobacco.</v>

687
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.590
<v Speaker 3>So we start printing these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Congress made it illegal.</v>

688
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.460
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even thought of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were voting on it,</v>

689
00:32:53.461 --> 00:32:57.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know that they were making </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis or hemp,</v>

690
00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

691
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the textile.</v>

692
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:01.070
<v Speaker 3>And the commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him,</v>

693
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know they were making it </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

694
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:07.690
<v Speaker 3>They thought they were stopping a drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>scourge that was forcing blacks and </v>

695
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.871
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans to rape white women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all William Randolph hearst is </v>

696
00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:12.980
<v Speaker 3>one crazy asshole with Harry anslinger </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the fucking 19 thirties.</v>

697
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.840
<v Speaker 3>That's when it became illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

698
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:19.841
<v Speaker 3>this is the same crazy asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let a bunch of wild pigs loose on his </v>

699
00:33:19.841 --> 00:33:21.500
<v Speaker 3>property so he can hunt them because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a gentlemen hunter.</v>

700
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 3>So the pigs that I hunt in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I go pig hunting probably are </v>

701
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:31.610
<v Speaker 3>direct descendants from the pigs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were let loose by this asshole.</v>

702
00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:35.390
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand is how fast they breed.</v>

703
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

704
00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:41.651
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friends and Mississippi were telling </v>

705
00:33:41.651 --> 00:33:41.651
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:33:41.651 --> 00:33:41.651
<v Speaker 3>a pig can lay a litter three times a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

707
00:33:41.651 --> 00:33:44.570
<v Speaker 3>four times a year up to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 piglets per litter,</v>

708
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.150
<v Speaker 3>and they have no natural predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are these farmers going to do?</v>

709
00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:49.880
<v Speaker 3>And they start decimating their crops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

710
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 3>They're not a native North American </v>
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>

711
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.790
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

712
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

713
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:57.230
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most destructive </v>
<v Speaker 3>invasive species.</v>

714
00:33:57.231 --> 00:33:59.750
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've never seen them before,</v>

715
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:01.490
<v Speaker 3>you see them on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look,</v>

716
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pig.</v>

717
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Pigs are cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen my friend has a potbelly pit.</v>

718
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.370
<v Speaker 3>I pet it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

719
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:12.610
<v Speaker 3>What they are as adults,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're wild boars covered in mud </v>

720
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.750
<v Speaker 3>and disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking a mammal.</v>

721
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Plague.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're vicious.</v>

722
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.530
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go through everything.</v>

723
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 3>They will spread across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll destroy your garden that still </v>

724
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 3>eat your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

725
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.700
<v Speaker 3>no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking dangerous.</v>

726
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:29.180
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of farmers actually asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>me if I'll come hunt on their property.</v>

727
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 3>A lot of vineyards will ask me to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and they have a problem with the </v>

728
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Turkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Turkeys are eating all their grapes,</v>

729
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that,</v>

730
00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:36.630
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

731
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:41.650
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of regular kind of city people </v>

732
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:41.650
<v Speaker 3>live in the city that don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

733
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:46.331
<v Speaker 3>The Turkey population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some places are exploding too because </v>

734
00:34:46.331 --> 00:34:46.331
<v Speaker 3>they've realized that it was just go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the suburbs.</v>

735
00:34:46.331 --> 00:34:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I even hunts us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one running down the street in</v>

736
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:52.931
<v Speaker 3>Toronto last week at Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were filming it and sending me </v>

737
00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:52.931
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

738
00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:52.931
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

739
00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:54.220
<v Speaker 3>they're delicious too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

740
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.440
<v Speaker 3>that's actually the first bird I hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't actually start hunting until I </v>

741
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.310
<v Speaker 3>was in my twenties and I had grown up </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking.</v>

742
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was interested in becoming a chef and </v>

743
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.070
<v Speaker 3>a family friend told me he was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey hunting and I said,</v>

744
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:12.071
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean you're going Turkey </v>

745
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:12.071
<v Speaker 3>hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought Turkeys were.</v>

746
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:12.071
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know there was such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

747
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were a domesticated bird,</v>

748
00:35:14.271 --> 00:35:17.280
<v Speaker 3>like a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he takes me Turkey hunting and um,</v>

749
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.010
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe it.</v>

750
00:35:19.011 --> 00:35:19.390
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

751
00:35:19.391 --> 00:35:21.120
<v Speaker 3>we shot a couple of birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

752
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:26.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we plucked them out and then the skin </v>

753
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:26.250
<v Speaker 3>was yellow and the meat is dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

754
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.460
<v Speaker 3>like the chicken leg meat is like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>breast,</v>

755
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:30.220
<v Speaker 3>like it's dark and I just thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

756
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.760
<v Speaker 3>this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when I tasted it,</v>

757
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't believe that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what Turkey was supposed to taste,</v>

758
00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:39.700
<v Speaker 3>like blessed flavor and you grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

759
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 3>at least I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Christmas,</v>

762
00:35:43.381 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 3>eating Turkey and you see it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>this big white blob and it's humongous.</v>

763
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:47.320
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

764
00:35:47.321 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 3>the wild bird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's leaner.</v>

765
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.200
<v Speaker 3>It's not like super round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

766
00:35:50.201 --> 00:35:50.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's lean,</v>

767
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:52.740
<v Speaker 3>it's how it's supposed to be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

768
00:35:52.741 --> 00:35:57.741
<v Speaker 3>that was like the light bulb moment that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we're supposed to be </v>

769
00:35:57.741 --> 00:36:01.491

<v Speaker 3>that really white meat,</v>

772

<v Speaker 3>Toronto,</v>

774
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:09.020

<v Speaker 3>I'm so thankful to be here because it's </v>

775
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.930
<v Speaker 3>still snowing and so it's still snowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

776
00:36:09.931 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 3>I love winter and snowboarding and going</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and enjoying the snow,</v>

777
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:15.930
<v Speaker 3>but I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

778
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Come on down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

779
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.030
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a buddy of mine from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana on the phone yesterday.</v>

780
00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking freezing cold up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thick snow everywhere and you know,</v>

781
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.800
<v Speaker 3>they're about to open up their bear </v>
<v Speaker 3>season and he's like,</v>

782
00:36:28.801 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

783
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Speaker 3>It's snow's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

784
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:33.450
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my underwear right now outside.</v>

785
00:36:33.451 --> 00:36:37.090
<v Speaker 3>I love it here man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a soft spot for a for California.</v>

786
00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:42.091
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been coming here since I was a </v>

787
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:42.170
<v Speaker 3>little kid to visit my dad in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>summers and I come here two,</v>

788
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.370
<v Speaker 3>three times a year and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it too.</v>

789
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

790
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:50.031
<v Speaker 3>the mountain lion thing is a weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with California because I see their </v>

791
00:36:50.031 --> 00:36:50.031
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would they be,</v>

792
00:36:50.031 --> 00:36:54.760
<v Speaker 3>is essentially done is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of the weird things </v>

793
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:59.661
<v Speaker 3>about California is like California is </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the places that doesn't have a </v>

794
00:36:59.661 --> 00:37:01.560
<v Speaker 3>fishing game department.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

795
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they don't call it that,</v>

796
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.770
<v Speaker 3>call it wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't call it like a,</v>

797
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.100
<v Speaker 3>like they don't think of it as like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to hunt them.</v>

798
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Like if you say like fishing game or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona calls it game and fish because </v>

799
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.960
<v Speaker 3>there's more game in Arizona and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are fish desert.</v>

800
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:24.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting way they've </v>

801
00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:24.560
<v Speaker 3>switched it around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the way California calls it,</v>

802
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:29.570
<v Speaker 3>it's fish and wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we call it the Ministry of natural </v>

803
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:30.240
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to look at it,</v>

804
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:35.690
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't argue with the effectiveness of </v>

805
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:38.481
<v Speaker 3>their approach because you do not find a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of deer in California and deer </v>

806
00:37:38.481 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 3>hunters are extremely frustrated by that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I get it.</v>

807
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 3>If you're like a local guy and you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to hunt your own deer,</v>

808
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 3>it's hard going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

809
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually didn't know there was hunting</v>

810
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:53.781
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea and through through </v>

811
00:37:53.781 --> 00:37:53.781
<v Speaker 3>hanging out with my friends at Mtsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>Yolk,</v>

812
00:37:53.781 --> 00:37:58.131
<v Speaker 3>I met this guy that lives actually in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Orange County is named Jeremiah Dowdy </v>

813
00:37:58.131 --> 00:37:58.940
<v Speaker 3>from field to plate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know,</v>

814
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.510
<v Speaker 3>if you know this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a local,</v>

815
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

816
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>La guy and he hunts all over California.</v>

817
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.880
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that there was so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

818
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:11.630
<v Speaker 3>California unt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a really good friend of mine and </v>

819
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

820
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.630
<v Speaker 3>what's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

821
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's Turkey.</v>

822
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 3>There's wild pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the pronghorn.</v>

823
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.260
<v Speaker 3>There's all kinds of stuff that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt.</v>

824
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today there's rocky mountain elk near to</v>

825
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:24.771
<v Speaker 3>home ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's two Lee elk that are </v>

826
00:38:24.771 --> 00:38:24.771
<v Speaker 3>natural on the coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of different animals here,</v>

827
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.330
<v Speaker 3>but there's also a lot of motherfucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain lions.</v>

828
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they still kill it,</v>

829
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 3>but the way they kill them now is </v>
<v Speaker 3>through government trackers.</v>

830
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.050
<v Speaker 3>It's really kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they do is mountain lion</v>

831
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 1>starting people's dogs and cats and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the get scary and then people call </v>

832
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:46.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who you would call that </v>

833
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.551
<v Speaker 1>would take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they hire people and most of the </v>

834
00:38:49.551 --> 00:38:50.470
<v Speaker 1>time they use dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these dogs to tree the mountain lion and</v>

835
00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:52.900
<v Speaker 1>they shoot them and when they empty the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contents,</v>

836
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 1>their stomachs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do an autopsy on them,</v>

837
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 1>they find it filled with dogs and cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really kind of crazy.</v>

838
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.350
<v Speaker 2>There was one near my where my dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

839
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.650
<v Speaker 2>A lady was attacked and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>running a pair.</v>

840
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.660
<v Speaker 2>A pair of girls are running a in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>canyon and a mountain lion actually </v>

841
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.011
<v Speaker 2>attacked one of them and she was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a tug of war with the mountain </v>

842
00:39:13.011 --> 00:39:13.011
<v Speaker 2>lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with her friend.</v>

843
00:39:13.011 --> 00:39:15.300
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was about five or six </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

844
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.400
<v Speaker 2>And that was this summer in Orange </v>
<v Speaker 2>County.</v>

845
00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Someone was attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running or cycling or something like </v>

846
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.490
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

847
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.490
<v Speaker 2>And they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to.</v>

848
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:23.370
<v Speaker 2>They went and found it and shot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

849
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.710
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when they get hungry,</v>

850
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.080
<v Speaker 1>no wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're encroaching because we're </v>

851
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.080
<v Speaker 1>encroaching on their land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

852
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

853
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not there as you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

854
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.980
<v Speaker 1>This is what's crazy about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were encroaching on their </v>

855
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:39.980
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dead.</v>

856
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.020
<v Speaker 1>And then whatever was there that claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>that territory is dead,</v>

857
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.840
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a new one that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and they take it.</v>

858
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:50.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking constant battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that like we're in their </v>

859
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.261
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have a good established gated </v>

860
00:39:54.261 --> 00:39:56.661
<v Speaker 1>community that we've entered and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>start putting up houses and pissing off </v>

861
00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:56.661
<v Speaker 1>their neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

862
00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:58.050
<v Speaker 1>that's not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just land.</v>

863
00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you hate people and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

864
00:40:00.571 --> 00:40:03.900
<v Speaker 1>cities will then go fucking live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest until then,</v>

865
00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:07.440
<v Speaker 1>fuck off and stop saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're encroaching on their leg.</v>

866
00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you go to the supermarket?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

867
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you buy your Vegan food?</v>

868
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:12.300
<v Speaker 1>A Vegan Deli?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

869
00:40:12.301 --> 00:40:14.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a place where a deer could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>

870
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you go to the movie theater you do </v>

871
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:19.280
<v Speaker 1>while you piece of shit that used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Squirrel's house?</v>

872
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.030
<v Speaker 1>That was a field at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

873
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean the large scale agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the other thing that kind of </v>

874
00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.050
<v Speaker 1>drives me crazy about vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

875
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you shouldn't eat grain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying you shouldn't eat vegetables,</v>

876
00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:35.931
<v Speaker 1>but large scale agriculture in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just raising vegetables is responsible </v>

877
00:40:36.271 --> 00:40:38.430
<v Speaker 1>for a tremendous amount of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

878
00:40:38.431 --> 00:40:43.431
<v Speaker 1>there's the pesticides that they use </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kill bugs and now if you only like </v>

879
00:40:43.431 --> 00:40:44.520
<v Speaker 1>mammals and you don't mind when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill bugs,</v>

880
00:40:44.521 --> 00:40:49.521
<v Speaker 1>that seems a little hypocritical to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gets a little weird but does get weird </v>

881
00:40:49.521 --> 00:40:51.150
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the fact that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making these,</v>

882
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.700
<v Speaker 1>when you're using a combine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running through the,</v>

883
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.380
<v Speaker 1>all the rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the bunnies,</v>

884
00:40:55.381 --> 00:40:58.140
<v Speaker 1>all the hogs are being decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decimated.</v>

885
00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:01.930
<v Speaker 1>My good buddy lives in Iowa and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

886
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.360
<v Speaker 1>he takes pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

887
00:41:03.361 --> 00:41:04.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just chopped down.</v>

888
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.280
<v Speaker 1>We just cut the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the vultures and the </v>

889
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.250
<v Speaker 1>vultures just circling overhead and </v>
<v Speaker 1>landing in the field right out.</v>

890
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.650
<v Speaker 1>They know when the combine rolls </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

891
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.140
<v Speaker 1>they come in dinner time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally know.</v>

892
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's places in Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on Kodiak island where a </v>

893
00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:25.530
<v Speaker 1>rifle shots equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of this dinner bell,</v>

894
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.960
<v Speaker 1>the forebears come running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of this.</v>

895
00:41:27.961 --> 00:41:29.830
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stairs</v>

896
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 2>are are carrying like big magnum 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like pistols</v>

897
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.200
<v Speaker 3>to defend themselves against these </v>
<v Speaker 3>grizzlies.</v>

898
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you a fantastic podcast that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Steven Rinella is?</v>

899
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steven Rinella is a really,</v>

900
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:47.280
<v Speaker 3>really interesting guy and he's a host </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a TV show called mediator.</v>

901
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.320
<v Speaker 3>He's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

902
00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

903
00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:53.681
<v Speaker 3>He's an author.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a podcast that he recorded when </v>

904
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:58.961
<v Speaker 3>they were in a fog neck island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like one of those chains of </v>

905
00:41:58.961 --> 00:42:02.321
<v Speaker 3>islands near Kodiak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it has those enormous coastal brown </v>

906
00:42:02.321 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 3>bears just like Kodiak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they got attacked.</v>

907
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:09.910
<v Speaker 3>They got attacked when they shot an elk </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were packing the elk out and </v>

908
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:13.481
<v Speaker 3>they got rushed by a fucking tanker of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear and it is a crazy podcast because </v>

909
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:20.170
<v Speaker 3>they record it right after the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever everyone's freaking out still.</v>

910
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:25.450
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one guy had a pistol on him but he set </v>

911
00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.020
<v Speaker 3>it down next to his pack and they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these ideas of like what it would be</v>

912
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:28.580
<v Speaker 3>like if an animal came in.</v>

913
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Like if they got attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had all these preconceived notions </v>

914
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:33.580
<v Speaker 3>of what it would be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it would feel like.</v>

915
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.540
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw all that out the window.</v>

916
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.960
<v Speaker 3>It was you were in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain isn't not even on a reptilian</v>

917
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:41.480
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain is so terrified.</v>

918
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:45.410
<v Speaker 3>And this thing was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend has said that he saw its teeth</v>

919
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 3>gnashing literally feet from his head as</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ran through the candle.</v>

920
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the revenant is just like,</v>

921
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.450
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got rushed by a deer one time and uh,</v>

922
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I was losing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to do.</v>

923
00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was before sunrise.</v>

924
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:04.250
<v Speaker 3>It was like five in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm walking into my dear setup and I had</v>

925
00:43:04.251 --> 00:43:09.251
<v Speaker 3>to cross this little river and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>full of stones and stuff and I'm kinda </v>

926
00:43:09.251 --> 00:43:12.770
<v Speaker 3>walking up this river and all I hear is </v>
<v Speaker 3>I put it on and I'm like,</v>

927
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what the hell is that noise?</v>

928
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.630
<v Speaker 3>And then it stopped and it was pawing at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground and snorting.</v>

929
00:43:17.631 --> 00:43:18.830
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

930
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 3>this is a buck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like my,</v>

931
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got goosebumps right now thinking </v>

932
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 3>about this and this is my bows in my bag</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just like,</v>

933
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get taken down by this </v>
<v Speaker 3>deer.</v>

934
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.280
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought it was another buck </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

935
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in the,</v>

936
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:36.190
<v Speaker 3>it's running season for these deer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it then it smelt that I was a human and </v>

937
00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:37.610
<v Speaker 3>it did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got blown it,</v>

938
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 3>whistled did that whistling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing kind of sound and took off.</v>

939
00:43:40.641 --> 00:43:42.890
<v Speaker 3>But I thought I was fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

940
00:43:42.891 --> 00:43:44.000
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get gored.</v>

941
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get gored by these antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

942
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

943
00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:49.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was in Canada.</v>

944
00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 3>So I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are big animals.</v>

945
00:43:51.111 --> 00:43:56.111
<v Speaker 3>They're big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have big white tail and I'm 300 </v>

946
00:43:56.111 --> 00:43:56.111
<v Speaker 3>pounds sometimes they're big.</v>

947
00:43:56.111 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 3>We and even our dozer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge like we got,</v>

948
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.610
<v Speaker 3>we got a lot of doe tags where I grew up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

949
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.870
<v Speaker 3>in Collagen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about an hour north of the city</v>

950
00:44:02.871 --> 00:44:06.110
<v Speaker 3>on a horse farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a gun season for deer.</v>

951
00:44:06.111 --> 00:44:08.810
<v Speaker 3>So that's how I got into archery and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting with a bow.</v>

952
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.370
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

953
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

954
00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because it's,</v>

955
00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.810
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the farms are kind of closer together.</v>

956
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.230
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

957
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.790
<v Speaker 3>it's not huge agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're more kind of hobby farm,</v>

958
00:44:18.791 --> 00:44:20.240
<v Speaker 3>so I think they're a little closer </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

959
00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 3>letting loose bullets let loose bolts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main thing is rifles,</v>

960
00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:29.630
<v Speaker 3>so a deer season and Turkey season you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can use a shotgun and it's really stupid</v>

961
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can shoot too with,</v>

962
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.770
<v Speaker 1>with a rifle or shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no a shotgun,</v>

963
00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:36.690
<v Speaker 1>a rifle for deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is weird.</v>

964
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 1>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>

965
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.870
<v Speaker 1>But that's why I got into archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

966
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

967
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky because it's so close to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city I can,</v>

968
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of go and hunt and then come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to work in the morning.</v>

969
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Kyle thing is interesting because </v>

970
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.390
<v Speaker 1>it's very counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more coyotes you kill,</v>

971
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 1>the more coyotes breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More kyle populations increase.</v>

972
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes are off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a big problem,</v>

973
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.390
<v Speaker 1>at least in Canada and where I'm from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

974
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:01.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were talking about the mountain</v>

975
00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:03.360
<v Speaker 1>lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of our version.</v>

976
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.370
<v Speaker 1>They don't think there's any mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions where I live,</v>

977
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coyotes are problem,</v>

978
00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:09.760
<v Speaker 1>their nab and people's dogs and cats </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere off,</v>

979
00:45:09.761 --> 00:45:10.660
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the trail.</v>

980
00:45:10.661 --> 00:45:15.661
<v Speaker 1>People were walking on their leash and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming out and nail in their </v>

981
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:15.661
<v Speaker 1>little dogs out here.</v>

982
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I had one kill a chicken of mine two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>

983
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

984
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I've got a video of the dead fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken and my chicken coop.</v>

985
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's really dark.</v>

986
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I dug a hole and a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chicken,</v>

987
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.120
<v Speaker 1>we don't eat our chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just use the eggs or eggs and they're</v>

988
00:45:29.121 --> 00:45:30.090
<v Speaker 1>like pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

989
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:35.160
<v Speaker 1>like there's a video me from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram walking in my yard holding my </v>

990
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.930
<v Speaker 1>daughter's bunny and the chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

991
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:42.110
<v Speaker 1>they're following me around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote I'm the motherfucking chicken </v>

992
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 1>because it's a crazy video because these</v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens just follow me.</v>

993
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean they literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like pets.</v>

994
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 1>So when this chicken died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was bummed out.</v>

995
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:53.540
<v Speaker 1>It was a sweetheart of a chicken too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was a chicken that we used to.</v>

996
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.820
<v Speaker 1>We would turn over rocks and she would </v>
<v Speaker 1>come and get the worms and so she would </v>

997
00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:58.890
<v Speaker 1>follow you around.</v>

998
00:45:58.890 --> 00:45:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on sweetie.</v>

999
00:45:59.641 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really like a pet.</v>

1000
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

1001
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Here's a video of me walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1002
00:46:04.651 --> 00:46:05.820
<v Speaker 1>look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so cool.</v>

1003
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:07.050
<v Speaker 1>They just follow me around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1004
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of farmers and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little hobby farms.</v>

1005
00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 1>They use chickens as insect control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And their vegetable garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1007
00:46:13.111 --> 00:46:15.430
<v Speaker 1>they're great for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're great for the.</v>

1008
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 1>They will fuck up some mikes too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1009
00:46:17.971 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 1>You ain't never seen nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1010
00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 1>you never said I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how I found out about it.</v>

1011
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one,</v>

1012
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.450
<v Speaker 1>one way I found out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mouse got in the chicken coop and they</v>

1013
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.190
<v Speaker 1>fucked that thing up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1014
00:46:29.191 --> 00:46:34.191
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then another thing happened was my </v>

1015
00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:38.380
<v Speaker 1>daughters found a hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife decided in all of you,</v>

1016
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.710
<v Speaker 1>women are always trying to like spruce </v>
<v Speaker 1>things up.</v>

1017
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.790
<v Speaker 1>She decided she was going to change some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these fences to a glass fence and the</v>

1018
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:49.791
<v Speaker 1>hawks didn't get the memo and they sat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they swan dived into this,</v>

1019
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.440
<v Speaker 1>this glass wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we first put up the fence there</v>

1020
00:46:55.441 --> 00:47:00.441
<v Speaker 1>was like three hawks that got fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them died and we found one of</v>

1021
00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 1>them that was just kod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up blood coming out of its nose,</v>

1022
00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>like literally it was like a UFC fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was down and fucked up.</v>

1023
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:08.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1024
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Speaker 1>my daughter's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1025
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.690
<v Speaker 1>took this in and they put it in a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardboard box and they had to figure out</v>

1026
00:47:15.691 --> 00:47:20.691
<v Speaker 1>how to feed it because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on Saturday and the </v>

1027
00:47:20.691 --> 00:47:22.530
<v Speaker 1>wildlife rescue place was not open on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weekend.</v>

1028
00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:25.530
<v Speaker 1>And so we had to bring it into a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Monday.</v>

1029
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 1>So over the weekend we went to this pet </v>
<v Speaker 1>store that we to and they sell something</v>

1030
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:31.420
<v Speaker 1>called pinkies.</v>

1031
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:37.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a very cute term for baby mice that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't really see yet.</v>

1032
00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 1>And they're separated from their mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they feed them to snakes.</v>

1033
00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 1>So mostly reptiles that for him too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these hawks would fuck these pinkies</v>

1034
00:47:45.641 --> 00:47:50.641
<v Speaker 1>up and so to try to give this hawk some </v>
<v Speaker 1>food while it was there over the </v>

1035
00:47:50.641 --> 00:47:55.530
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't starve that my daughter's </v>

1036
00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:55.530
<v Speaker 1>brought them the pinkies and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>one pinky left,</v>

1037
00:47:55.530 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the hawke didn't eat when we </v>

1038
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 1>brought the hock to the wildlife rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1039
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:04.141
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fix up the Hawk and they told us </v>

1040
00:48:04.141 --> 00:48:04.141
<v Speaker 1>the Hawk was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1041
00:48:04.141 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 1>they took care of its wing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually they released it back in the </v>

1042
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a nice story.</v>

1043
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.070
<v Speaker 1>But there's this one pinky leftover and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing was going to die.</v>

1044
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't with its mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was too small to drink milk.</v>

1045
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to keep it,</v>

1046
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 1>we want to keep it as a pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1047
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:21.300
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just feeding its brothers and </v>

1048
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:21.300
<v Speaker 1>sisters to this fucking Hawk and now you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys want to keep it.</v>

1049
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:22.510
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1050
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I think we should feed it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens.</v>

1051
00:48:23.921 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1052
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:25.810
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1053
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:27.930
<v Speaker 1>what do you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you crazy?</v>

1054
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to die.</v>

1055
00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

1056
00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:31.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1057
00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1058
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.550
<v Speaker 1>well listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to watch.</v>

1059
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go out and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I put that fucking thing down and I </v>

1060
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.861
<v Speaker 1>have never seen those chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So voracious attack that mouse and then </v>

1061
00:48:43.271 --> 00:48:48.271
<v Speaker 1>they were all chasing the one chicken </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had the mouse trying to steal it </v>

1062
00:48:48.271 --> 00:48:48.271
<v Speaker 1>from him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

1063
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Here's the chicken with a mouse right </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1064
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a mouse and they have fucked </v>

1065
00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.271
<v Speaker 1>that mouse up man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they try to steal it from each </v>

1066
00:48:57.271 --> 00:48:57.271
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came out tonight,</v>

1067
00:48:57.271 --> 00:49:01.890
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one where a cat is playing with </v>

1068
00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:01.890
<v Speaker 1>a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cat.</v>

1069
00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:03.100
<v Speaker 1>You've seen them one with the cat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chicken.</v>

1070
00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best one because the cat,</v>

1071
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 1>everybody thinks of cats is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious.</v>

1072
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Cats are pretty vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chickens are fucking dinosaurs,</v>

1073
00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:16.681
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way the chicken attacks the mouse </v>

1074
00:49:16.681 --> 00:49:16.681
<v Speaker 1>like here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1075
00:49:16.681 --> 00:49:20.290
<v Speaker 1>look at that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to eat this shit out of that </v>

1076
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:20.290
<v Speaker 1>mouse too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a.</v>

1077
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:24.000
<v Speaker 1>she's got to keep her eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mics or those other constant coming </v>

1078
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.000
<v Speaker 1>steal her mouth seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at her.</v>

1079
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 1>They're experts in bobbing and weaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>and turning their heads,</v>

1080
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but so the cat is stocking the mouse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chickens like,</v>

1081
00:49:31.661 --> 00:49:32.740
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know what you're doing.</v>

1082
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.380
<v Speaker 1>The chicken just runs in and snatches it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of the cat.</v>

1083
00:49:35.381 --> 00:49:36.890
<v Speaker 1>The cat's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously?</v>

1084
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Like my mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're way more ruthless.</v>

1085
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>birds are ruthless creatures and </v>

1086
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:48.060
<v Speaker 1>chickens in particular are just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a part of their </v>

1087
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.601
<v Speaker 1>natural diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I'm a mouse would get look at </v>

1088
00:49:51.601 --> 00:49:51.601
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the cat,</v>

1089
00:49:51.601 --> 00:49:51.610
<v Speaker 1>the cat's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1090
00:49:51.611 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 1>check out this mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how lucky I am.</v>

1091
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.440
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1092
00:49:56.441 --> 00:49:58.510
<v Speaker 1>cats for a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half of it's a game,</v>

1093
00:49:58.570 --> 00:49:59.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't play with it.</v>

1094
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's chick hanging back.</v>

1095
00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:08.070
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as the chicken finds it </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neema,</v>

1096
00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:09.850
<v Speaker 1>that mouse does not seem scared of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chat.</v>

1097
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:14.900
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not scared of it that that mouse </v>

1098
00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:14.900
<v Speaker 1>has talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at the chickens like fuck you.</v>

1099
00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Give me that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

1100
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that about chickens.</v>

1101
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll fuck up.</v>

1102
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way they do it too fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1103
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 1>And they think of it as purely as food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not thinking like the cat,</v>

1104
00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 1>it's sport</v>

1105
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:29.990
<v Speaker 3>for the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of fun.</v>

1106
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Cats probably fully fed and it's a house</v>
<v Speaker 3>cat,</v>

1107
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.270
<v Speaker 3>fat house cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just looking to kill.</v>

1108
00:50:35.271 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 3>So that's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nature.</v>

1109
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.140
<v Speaker 3>People don't understand that they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1110
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 3>they want to remove themselves from it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's great,</v>

1111
00:50:41.031 --> 00:50:43.250
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to understand it.</v>

1112
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:48.310
<v Speaker 3>They want something that aligns with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ideology and their ideology is </v>

1113
00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:51.590
<v Speaker 3>love and compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except for people that eat meat and then</v>

1114
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:53.490
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>death threats.</v>

1115
00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1116
00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 3>it's an ideological battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that sense,</v>

1117
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:05.650
<v Speaker 3>veganism becomes very much like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion because you like,</v>

1118
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:11.110
<v Speaker 3>you support all the people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your side and the people that are </v>

1119
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 3>opposed to you are like apostates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1120
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 3>they're like the negative people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are trying to bring you to the dark side</v>

1121
00:51:16.521 --> 00:51:17.120
<v Speaker 3>to hell.</v>

1122
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:22.570
<v Speaker 3>It gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets really crazy and there's a lot </v>

1123
00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:25.511
<v Speaker 3>of evidence on their side in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like factory farming and the horrors of </v>

1124
00:51:25.511 --> 00:51:30.250
<v Speaker 3>factory farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even the really incredibly poor </v>

1125
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:34.190
<v Speaker 3>modern American diet that they see a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people when they go Vegan,</v>

1126
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:39.460
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best things that they're </v>

1127
00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:39.460
<v Speaker 3>doing is they're eliminating all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

1128
00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 3>They're eliminating all the trans fats </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the fucking but all the terrible</v>

1129
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:45.740
<v Speaker 3>shit that a lot of people eat that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan.</v>

1130
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:51.400
<v Speaker 3>But the negative thing is most of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>were eating diets that are far too </v>

1131
00:51:51.771 --> 00:51:56.771
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they're not getting their blood </v>

1132
00:51:56.771 --> 00:51:59.471
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even know how unhealthy they </v>

1133
00:51:59.471 --> 00:52:01.451
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They convinced themselves they're doing </v>

1134
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:03.791
<v Speaker 3>much better than it feeling much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lack of cholesterol can fuck with </v>

1135
00:52:03.791 --> 00:52:08.261
<v Speaker 3>your hormone functions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of vegans have low hormones </v>

1136
00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:08.261
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>

1137
00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:08.261
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1138
00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:12.430
<v Speaker 3>one of our regulars Antler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to me about his </v>

1139
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:13.250
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to have a organic vegetable farm</v>

1140
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 3>and he's a six foot seven big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>

1141
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:18.380
<v Speaker 3>tall Dutch white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes to me,</v>

1142
00:52:18.381 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1143
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was Vegan for a long time and had this</v>

1144
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:24.590
<v Speaker 3>organic vegetable farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that I was doing my body a</v>

1145
00:52:24.591 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1146
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.170
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was doing something great </v>
<v Speaker 3>for my body,</v>

1147
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.870
<v Speaker 3>and he got really sick and he went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctor and the doctor said,</v>

1148
00:52:29.871 --> 00:52:34.871
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to take supplements to </v>

1149
00:52:34.871 --> 00:52:37.361
<v Speaker 3>supplement the things you're not getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>from from eating meat or you have to go </v>

1150
00:52:37.361 --> 00:52:39.710
<v Speaker 3>back to eating meat because just some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's bodies do better than others.</v>

1151
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 3>And I said a lot of Asian cultures are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more susceptible to to vegetable diets,</v>

1152
00:52:43.581 --> 00:52:45.020
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in reality he's like,</v>

1153
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a,</v>

1154
00:52:46.251 --> 00:52:51.251
<v Speaker 3>you're a northern European descent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to eat this stuff to be healthy</v>

1155
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 3>and that's when he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went back to eating meat and it,</v>

1156
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

1157
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:57.160
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're trying to.</v>

1158
00:52:57.161 --> 00:52:57.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1159
00:52:57.401 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 3>he was living on an organic vegetable </v>
<v Speaker 3>farm.</v>

1160
00:52:59.361 --> 00:53:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what more healthy vegetables could he be</v>

1161
00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:03.580
<v Speaker 3>eating?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So B,</v>

1162
00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:08.640
<v Speaker 3>12 is a big one and B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 essentially only comes from things </v>

1163
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.791
<v Speaker 3>other than vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get some of it from algae you </v>

1164
00:53:12.791 --> 00:53:12.830
<v Speaker 3>can get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1165
00:53:12.831 --> 00:53:15.410
<v Speaker 3>you definitely can get it from meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rich and me.</v>

1166
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.630
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is iron iron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1167
00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:18.200
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1168
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:19.880
<v Speaker 3>there's iron and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>

1169
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:21.900
<v Speaker 3>but it's not very bioavailable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1170
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.590
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the various vitamins and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>protein and vegetables,</v>

1171
00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 3>not very</v>

1172
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.490
<v Speaker 1>bioavailable in most</v>

1173
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.120
<v Speaker 2>and is how your body absorbs those </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients as well.</v>

1174
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Like it might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be written that that,</v>

1175
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.710
<v Speaker 2>that substance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your body can't really absorb it.</v>

1176
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just everybody's body's different.</v>

1177
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just that as an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that there are some people that can</v>

1178
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:44.480
<v Speaker 1>eat certain diets and be very healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then other people eat them and they </v>

1179
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:48.111
<v Speaker 1>have a really hard time with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is that most of </v>

1180
00:53:48.111 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 1>these people that are talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy and how great they feel,</v>

1181
00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:54.141
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of it is sort of a placebo</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and they're not getting blood </v>

1182
00:53:54.141 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 1>work done at everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of what your diet is.</v>

1183
00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:02.420
<v Speaker 1>You should get blood work done just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out if you have any potential </v>

1184
00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:07.281
<v Speaker 1>problems that are on the horizon because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of times you'll feel okay </v>

1185
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:10.170
<v Speaker 1>and then you get your blood work done </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the doctor will tell you,</v>

1186
00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:15.171
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really low and vitamin B and d </v>

1187
00:54:15.171 --> 00:54:17.110
<v Speaker 1>and a and you know you need this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you know this is this.</v>

1188
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:22.160
<v Speaker 1>The health consequences of not having </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff in your diet and if you are </v>

1189
00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.730
<v Speaker 1>committed to a Vegan diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's ways that you can supplement and</v>

1190
00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:27.600
<v Speaker 1>this is my advice to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to supplement,</v>

1191
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.330
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a algae is a great one.</v>

1192
00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:35.610
<v Speaker 1>It tastes like shit but it's very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your body and you just add it to </v>

1193
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:35.990
<v Speaker 1>smoothies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1194
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 1>just add it with coconut milk or a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of other things.</v>

1195
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:43.970
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you definitely can eat a vegan </v>

1196
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:43.970
<v Speaker 1>diet and be healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to be on the ball,</v>

1197
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:46.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the [inaudible] one is a big one.</v>

1198
00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:51.351
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading some crazy article the </v>

1199
00:54:51.351 --> 00:54:55.371
<v Speaker 1>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said something like 90 percent of all </v>

1200
00:54:55.371 --> 00:54:55.371
<v Speaker 1>vegans or B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 deficient.</v>

1201
00:54:55.371 --> 00:54:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert,</v>

1202
00:54:55.981 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 1>but I've been terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

1203
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Chris Kresser that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had on my podcast before who's a </v>

1204
00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:08.300
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an expert in diet nutrition who </v>

1205
00:55:09.811 --> 00:55:14.811
<v Speaker 1>started out as a macrobiotic Vegan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had massive health problems and then </v>

1206
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:20.421
<v Speaker 1>switched to eating meat eventually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then really became a connoisseur of </v>

1207
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 1>organ meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like probably the most nutrient</v>

1208
00:55:22.951 --> 00:55:24.730
<v Speaker 1>dense food in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love.</v>

1209
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite thing about hunting </v>

1210
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:29.850
<v Speaker 2>as the organ meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too,</v>

1211
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:29.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love liver,</v>

1212
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:30.490
<v Speaker 2>liver and the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1213
00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went hunting and I came back and I </v>

1214
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:39.121
<v Speaker 2>brought the heart into the restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the guys because I wanted to share </v>

1215
00:55:39.121 --> 00:55:39.970
<v Speaker 2>with them like the experience of eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fresh killed,</v>

1216
00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:41.770
<v Speaker 2>like the heart was still warm when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought it to work.</v>

1217
00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.410
<v Speaker 2>And the way I like to use either tar </v>
<v Speaker 2>tar,</v>

1218
00:55:44.411 --> 00:55:47.350
<v Speaker 2>like just mince it up raw or cooked like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a steak.</v>

1219
00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.920
<v Speaker 2>So I cut it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.380
<v Speaker 2>horizontally in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into like,</v>

1221
00:55:50.381 --> 00:55:53.120
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a tenderloin steak and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all got like this,</v>

1222
00:55:53.121 --> 00:55:58.121
<v Speaker 2>like buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we shot a double espresso or </v>

1223
00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:58.121
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

1224
00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:58.121
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1225
00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 2>it's so nutrient rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1226
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:00.910
<v Speaker 2>the organ meat.</v>

1227
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I had Alexander Gustafson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast yesterday is a UFC number </v>

1228
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:06.720
<v Speaker 1>one lightweight content light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight contender,</v>

1229
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 1>big viking motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he gets all of his meat from hunting</v>

1230
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.350
<v Speaker 1>for his training camps and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1231
00:56:13.351 --> 00:56:15.960
<v Speaker 1>He hunts red deer in Sweden's where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

1232
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:21.350
<v Speaker 1>And we were both talking about how when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat really nutrient dense wild game,</v>

1233
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:26.290
<v Speaker 1>it gives you like a stimulated effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your body is like,</v>

1234
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:27.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of this.</v>

1235
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Give me more of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1236
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.960
<v Speaker 1>there's something in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>

1237
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:34.490
<v Speaker 1>And it just tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tastes like it's supposed to taste.</v>

1238
00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flavor is totally different.</v>

1239
00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Even when we were buying from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool game farms,</v>

1240
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 1>it's different than the deer that I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shoot and shoot because you know,</v>

1241
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:46.210
<v Speaker 1>that deer I just shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be like six,</v>

1242
00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.880
<v Speaker 1>seven years old versus at the farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe one or two.</v>

1243
00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

1244
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:53.050
<v Speaker 1>it's eating such a diverse diet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1245
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my belief is that that's how we're </v>

1246
00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:58.260
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1247
00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.861
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely how we were eating for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the longest time and it is entirely </v>

1248
00:57:01.861 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 1>possible that if humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you've got an isolated group</v>

1249
00:57:05.111 --> 00:57:10.111
<v Speaker 1>of humans that stuck to a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rigid vegan diet for many,</v>

1250
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:12.190
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many generations,</v>

1251
00:57:12.191 --> 00:57:16.450
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that our genes </v>
<v Speaker 1>would adapt to that diet and lifestyle.</v>

1252
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:21.480
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality of your current physical </v>

1253
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.931
<v Speaker 1>form is it's most likely not designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that and this is just based on genes</v>

1254
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:30.760
<v Speaker 1>and on genetics and epigenetics and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the various things that they've.</v>

1255
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Methods that they've devised to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

1256
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:39.750
<v Speaker 1>What makes you a person and where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where your ancestors came from and how </v>

1257
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did your ancestors developed?</v>

1258
00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Did they eat mostly fish?</v>

1259
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Like there's people that live like in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the northwest,</v>

1260
00:57:47.261 --> 00:57:52.261
<v Speaker 1>like the extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Alaska and a inuits and people </v>

1261
00:57:52.261 --> 00:57:54.790
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their entire history,</v>

1262
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:59.880
<v Speaker 1>they've evolved from eating fish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wail and whale blubber and seal and seal</v>

1263
00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:05.920
<v Speaker 1>fat and there's real changes to who they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are as people.</v>

1264
00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1265
00:58:07.001 --> 00:58:08.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the big ones is that people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>live up there,</v>

1266
00:58:08.741 --> 00:58:11.630
<v Speaker 1>their hands don't get cold like ours do </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands doing.</v>

1267
00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1268
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous communities,</v>

1269
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some program where they were </v>

1270
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 1>trying to get them to stop hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>whales are and stop killing seals.</v>

1271
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And the government was supplementing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them with uh,</v>

1272
00:58:22.431 --> 00:58:23.830
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with beef and cattle.</v>

1273
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And their argument was this is not what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to eat.</v>

1274
00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:28.090
<v Speaker 1>This is not what we're designed to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1275
00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:31.540
<v Speaker 1>we need the fat in the whale blubber to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay warm.</v>

1276
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda weird.</v>

1277
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:38.670
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why would we be forcing these </v>

1278
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.670
<v Speaker 1>people to eat something that was foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them?</v>

1279
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fat content in beef is way different</v>

1280
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:43.810
<v Speaker 1>than whale and seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like apples and oranges.</v>

1281
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

1282
00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about before,</v>

1283
00:58:47.651 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 1>like white meat from Turkey domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey versus the Turkey.</v>

1284
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:56.671
<v Speaker 1>That's a wild Turkey when you see cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get these corn fed cows,</v>

1285
00:58:57.491 --> 00:59:02.491
<v Speaker 1>you have this pale meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That meat is Pale because it's not as </v>

1286
00:59:02.491 --> 00:59:04.180
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more filled with fat,</v>

1287
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:06.550
<v Speaker 1>which tastes good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just.</v>

1288
00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:10.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not as nutrient dense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a moose steak,</v>

1289
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you've seen a moose steak before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1290
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:14.590
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1291
00:59:14.591 --> 00:59:17.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like like purple dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>

1292
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking dark,</v>

1293
00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:20.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1294
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.170
<v Speaker 1>that's way different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way different thing.</v>

1295
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That cow is just some.</v>

1296
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fattest laziest person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1297
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:35.561
<v Speaker 1>like if you thought about like take an </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete like Lebron James Who's just </v>

1298
00:59:35.561 --> 00:59:39.701
<v Speaker 1>like this super athlete and compare like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the composition of his body to some </v>

1299
00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking Slob who just drinks soda all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and is tired,</v>

1300
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 1>is on antidepressants and antibiotics </v>
<v Speaker 1>because his body's fucking deteriorating</v>

1301
00:59:48.711 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got arthritis and all of his joints</v>

1302
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 1>because he's too fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That literally is a cow that's literally</v>

1303
00:59:55.791 --> 01:00:00.791
<v Speaker 1>one of these fucking farm raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>overstuffed corn fed cows and they grind</v>

1304
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:04.310
<v Speaker 1>that fat fuck into a hamburger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the same.</v>

1305
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not endorsing eating Lebron James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying there's a difference in </v>

1306
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.220
<v Speaker 1>what the composition of their body is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

1307
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:14.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1308
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think wild things,</v>

1309
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:23.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it's wild salmon or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even wild vegetables I think would be </v>

1310
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>probably</v>

1311
01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:27.670
<v Speaker 2>better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big part of what I do is one</v>

1312
01:00:27.671 --> 01:00:32.671
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons why I love nature so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>as foraging and I take my kids out to </v>

1313
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.540
<v Speaker 2>the woods and we'd go pick mushrooms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>since there were like,</v>

1314
01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>babies,</v>

1315
01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:37.540
<v Speaker 2>my son has been dragged in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 2>since he was one.</v>

1316
01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.830
<v Speaker 2>What kind of mushrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1317
01:00:38.831 --> 01:00:41.500
<v Speaker 2>so my favorite one to harvest where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>live is morals.</v>

1318
01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really funky looking to kind of </v>

1319
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:47.170
<v Speaker 2>look like a brain or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something weird them online.</v>

1320
01:00:47.171 --> 01:00:52.171
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen him in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing that tastes quite like </v>

1321
01:00:52.171 --> 01:00:52.750
<v Speaker 2>them that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy like a meat.</v>

1322
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:58.230
<v Speaker 2>They're very needy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very media and there's a couple </v>

1323
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:59.941
<v Speaker 2>different kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like black ones and white or </v>

1324
01:00:59.941 --> 01:00:59.941
<v Speaker 2>yellowish ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1325
01:00:59.941 --> 01:01:04.290
<v Speaker 2>and they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fascinating to go out into the </v>

1326
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:06.571
<v Speaker 2>wild and pick your own food and when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>come home and cook it like nothing else </v>

1327
01:01:06.571 --> 01:01:07.270
<v Speaker 2>tastes like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like mushrooms from the store,</v>

1328
01:01:07.271 --> 01:01:12.271
<v Speaker 2>the totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just something really special </v>

1329
01:01:12.271 --> 01:01:12.271
<v Speaker 2>that you can go and experience in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>

1330
01:01:12.271 --> 01:01:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morels are a real weird</v>

1331
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>one and I've been reading up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the strange things is when </v>

1332
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.061
<v Speaker 1>there's fire forest fires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pop up like the neck the next </v>

1333
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:23.061
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>

1334
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:24.430
<v Speaker 2>They're like cleansing their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their cleansing the earth.</v>

1335
01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a my call just so I don't know.</v>

1336
01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I just enjoy finding them and eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1338
01:01:29.711 --> 01:01:34.711
<v Speaker 2>But I do know there's a cleansing </v>
<v Speaker 2>property to decaying a decaying matter.</v>

1339
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:40.470
<v Speaker 2>So when trees fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the best place to find Morales is </v>

1340
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:41.710
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look for trees with no bark on them.</v>

1341
01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:43.150
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really super old,</v>

1342
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.950
<v Speaker 2>it's called a dead elm tree and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the rotting roots of these dead elm</v>

1343
01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:49.460
<v Speaker 2>trees and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1344
01:01:49.461 --> 01:01:54.461
<v Speaker 2>you're in the bush and are in the field </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you kind of see this one tree that </v>

1345
01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:54.461
<v Speaker 2>has no bark on it and it's about to fall</v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

1346
01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:57.320
<v Speaker 2>There'll be like 20 morels at the base </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

1347
01:01:57.321 --> 01:02:02.321
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're feeding off the root system </v>

1348
01:02:02.321 --> 01:02:02.321
<v Speaker 2>that's underground.</v>

1349
01:02:02.321 --> 01:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely fascinated by mushrooms.</v>

1350
01:02:02.911 --> 01:02:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I had a Paul stamets on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I saw that one.</v>

1351
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>How great is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Cool.</v>

1352
01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>It was mushroom hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1353
01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>

1354
01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:16.961
<v Speaker 1>gave me too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to do it too in case one </v>

1355
01:02:16.961 --> 01:02:16.961
<v Speaker 1>breaks an extra mushroom hat</v>

1356
01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:19.850
<v Speaker 2>was a really cool documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1357
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called know your mushrooms.</v>

1358
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I think it's by Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by Ron man.</v>

1359
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.230
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1360
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:30.290
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he travels along with these mushroom </v>

1361
01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:32.751
<v Speaker 3>hunters a up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it's in Oregon and up </v>

1362
01:02:32.751 --> 01:02:32.910
<v Speaker 3>the coast of California down into </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico,</v>

1363
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:37.911
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're professional foragers that then </v>

1364
01:02:37.911 --> 01:02:37.911
<v Speaker 3>go and sell these mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1365
01:02:37.911 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but they track these forgers and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a cool movie.</v>

1366
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.870
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1367
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:46.190
<v Speaker 3>well I was going to say is you better </v>
<v Speaker 3>know mushrooms because they'll fucking </v>

1368
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.190
<v Speaker 3>kill you if you don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing,</v>

1369
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.190
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1370
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.440
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first experiencing foraging for </v>

1371
01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.541
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like an apprentice chef at this </v>

1372
01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:53.541
<v Speaker 3>restaurant and the chef comes in and was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1373
01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:53.541
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check these out.</v>

1374
01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:53.820
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1375
01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:55.830
<v Speaker 3>like what the hell are these?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1376
01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:56.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1377
01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:58.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found them mountain biking and there's</v>

1378
01:02:58.421 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 3>this stigma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1379
01:02:59.311 --> 01:03:00.270
<v Speaker 3>like as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a kid,</v>

1380
01:03:00.271 --> 01:03:01.140
<v Speaker 3>like your parents were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1381
01:03:01.141 --> 01:03:02.280
<v Speaker 3>don't eat those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't touch those.</v>

1382
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.300
<v Speaker 3>They're poisonous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll kill you.</v>

1383
01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:04.020
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1384
01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 3>well then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have this idea.</v>

1385
01:03:05.821 --> 01:03:10.821
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms come from the grocery store </v>

1386
01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:10.821
<v Speaker 3>will take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1387
01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:10.821
<v Speaker 3>they grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come in the wild and you know,</v>

1388
01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:14.760
<v Speaker 3>that's my thing with me is I teach my </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids like meat doesn't come from the </v>

1389
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:14.760
<v Speaker 3>grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1390
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.410
<v Speaker 3>it's not a styrofoam package.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not where it comes from.</v>

1391
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:18.090
<v Speaker 3>It's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1393
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just like,</v>

1394
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:25.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms that grow in the wild and </v>

1395
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.730
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're crazy.</v>

1396
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.990
<v Speaker 3>They like Michael Micro cycle rises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1397
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Michael Riser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with the animals or with </v>

1398
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:33.440
<v Speaker 3>the trees rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1399
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.270
<v Speaker 3>do you know the story of the laminated </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot area?</v>

1400
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.590
<v Speaker 3>I know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1401
01:03:37.591 --> 01:03:42.591
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The to miscarry is the most fascinating </v>

1402
01:03:42.591 --> 01:03:45.801
<v Speaker 3>one to me because that's the one that </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like it looks like Santa Claus or </v>

1403
01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:45.801
<v Speaker 3>the marks card with washroom.</v>

1404
01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the subject of a book by a guy </v>

1405
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:54.531
<v Speaker 3>named John Marco Allegro who was one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the head scholars for deciphering the </v>

1406
01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He deciphered the Dead Sea Scrolls for </v>

1407
01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.120
<v Speaker 3>14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an ordained minister,</v>

1408
01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.931
<v Speaker 3>but he was also in his study of theology</v>
<v Speaker 3>became agnostic and these sort of when </v>

1409
01:04:05.931 --> 01:04:09.471
<v Speaker 3>you started realizing that there was all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these different religions that had </v>

1410
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:12.981
<v Speaker 3>similar stories and he was found all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different connections and he was </v>

1411
01:04:12.981 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 3>trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out what the origins of</v>

1412
01:04:14.911 --> 01:04:16.410
<v Speaker 3>all these stories where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1413
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.620
<v Speaker 3>after studying the Dead Sea Scrolls for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 14 years before he wrote </v>

1414
01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.611
<v Speaker 3>this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he decided that all of Christianity was </v>

1415
01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:30.741
<v Speaker 3>a massive misunderstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what it was originally about was </v>

1416
01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:34.311
<v Speaker 3>these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these collection of stories that were </v>

1417
01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:36.090
<v Speaker 3>about fertility rituals and psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushroom use,</v>

1418
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:41.570
<v Speaker 3>and he traced the word Jesus back to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient Sumerian word that was a </v>

1419
01:04:42.451 --> 01:04:47.451
<v Speaker 3>mushroom covered in God's semen and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>when God would come on the earth,</v>

1420
01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:52.791
<v Speaker 3>that's what rain was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rain was God coming on the earth and </v>

1421
01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:53.910
<v Speaker 3>that these mushrooms would rise up out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ground.</v>

1422
01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:56.430
<v Speaker 3>They would eat them and trip they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking balls off.</v>

1423
01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe you got to think people that </v>

1424
01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.841
<v Speaker 3>were foraging for food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially back when there was no </v>

1425
01:05:05.841 --> 01:05:05.841
<v Speaker 3>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1426
01:05:05.841 --> 01:05:06.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was touch and go.</v>

1427
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:09.900
<v Speaker 3>You could easily starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean you're a bad winter.</v>

1428
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a drought.</v>

1429
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 3>People would starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very,</v>

1430
01:05:12.901 --> 01:05:17.901
<v Speaker 3>very common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would take foraging extremely </v>

1431
01:05:17.951 --> 01:05:18.460
<v Speaker 3>serious,</v>

1432
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>and they knew what they could eat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew what they couldn't eat.</v>

1433
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:26.430
<v Speaker 1>While they knew that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between coniferous trees </v>

1434
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:29.520
<v Speaker 1>and coniferous trees would grow these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird looking shiny red and white </v>

1435
01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms under him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what coniferous trees,</v>

1436
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>pine trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we use for Christmas trees.</v>

1437
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Those red and white packages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1438
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>They are like the shiny packages </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the Christmas tree.</v>

1439
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>They are the color of Santa Claus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are common inside barrier.</v>

1440
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>There are eaten constantly by Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribou are reindeer.</v>

1441
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Reindeer are addicted to these to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where when people are having </v>

1442
01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:58.450
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushroom rituals and they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside to take a leak,</v>

1443
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.840
<v Speaker 1>the Karabal will knock them over to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Amany to miscarry a piss in the </v>

1444
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:08.371
<v Speaker 1>sand because they smell the Amanita </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mascara in the pis and one of the ways </v>

1445
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:14.281
<v Speaker 1>these guys trip their balls off as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat the mushroom and then they drink </v>

1446
01:06:14.281 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 1>their own urine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a second process of this.</v>

1447
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Here's where it gets even crazier in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>times in Siberia where it become </v>

1448
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 1>extremely snowy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this shaman would visit,</v>

1449
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:28.020
<v Speaker 1>the way they would get into the house is</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the fucking chimney because the </v>

1450
01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.800
<v Speaker 1>door would be snowed in so they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>climb in through the chimney.</v>

1451
01:06:29.801 --> 01:06:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many parallels to Santa Claus</v>

1452
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.040
<v Speaker 1>and to Christianity to this one mushroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they think was a massive part of </v>

1453
01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:40.900
<v Speaker 1>shamanistic rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>

1454
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.640
<v Speaker 1>This is this Rudolph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red nose reindeer.</v>

1455
01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1456
01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is such a cool story.</v>

1457
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

1458
01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:52.771
<v Speaker 1>So he wrote this book called the Sacred </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushroom in the cross that was bought </v>

1459
01:06:52.771 --> 01:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>out by the Catholic Church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This I have to verify,</v>

1460
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.550
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that they stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>production of it.</v>

1461
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was bought out by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic Church.</v>

1462
01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:00.820
<v Speaker 1>That's always been what's been told to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1463
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.610
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that they stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>production of it forever.</v>

1464
01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came out with another book called the</v>

1465
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Dead Sea Scrolls in the Christian myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still available.</v>

1466
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Then more recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really recently,</v>

1467
01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:14.610
<v Speaker 1>within the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1468
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:19.830
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Yon Irvin republished the </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Marco Allegro books with permission</v>

1469
01:07:20.111 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 1>from his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might've actually been one of</v>

1470
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:25.360
<v Speaker 1>those things where when a book is over </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years old,</v>

1471
01:07:25.361 --> 01:07:27.580
<v Speaker 1>it becomes public domain or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that too,</v>

1472
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:33.150
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book and this story behind it is </v>

1473
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:37.140
<v Speaker 1>incredibly fascinating and what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically saying is that it makes sense </v>

1474
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:42.390
<v Speaker 1>if you were living thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago when you stumbled upon these </v>

1475
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:43.600
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushrooms and you took them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would experience God.</v>

1476
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:48.630
<v Speaker 1>You literally would think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic state was you communicating </v>

1477
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:52.411
<v Speaker 1>with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would want to hide those from the </v>

1478
01:07:52.411 --> 01:07:52.411
<v Speaker 1>Romans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they hid them in parables and stories</v>

1479
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:57.450
<v Speaker 1>and he explains what the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of all these parables and </v>

1480
01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:00.961
<v Speaker 1>stories are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course you're going from </v>

1481
01:08:00.961 --> 01:08:03.930
<v Speaker 1>ancient Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is extremely complicated language </v>

1482
01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:06.391
<v Speaker 1>that also involves numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The letters are also numbers and then </v>

1483
01:08:06.391 --> 01:08:07.870
<v Speaker 1>that's translated to Latin and Greek and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then eventually to English.</v>

1484
01:08:07.871 --> 01:08:12.871
<v Speaker 1>So a lot is lost in that translation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it really takes a linguist and a </v>

1485
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>biblical scholar to kind of understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether</v>

1486
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 2>or not what this guy is saying is </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

1487
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously not one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just talking shit,</v>

1488
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many parallels.</v>

1489
01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:29.201
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could it be just coincidental that </v>

1490
01:08:29.201 --> 01:08:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Santa Claus is red and white at Santa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Claus legs reindeers,</v>

1491
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:35.530
<v Speaker 2>that the Christmas tree is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we used in the presence or under </v>

1492
01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 2>the Christmas tree that Santa Claus </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives the fucking North Pole,</v>

1493
01:08:36.561 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 2>which is Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where Caribou live in,</v>

1494
01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:41.360
<v Speaker 2>which is where these mushrooms are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>common.</v>

1495
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many parallels.</v>

1496
01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:45.080
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

1497
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great book.</v>

1498
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Anybody I really highly recommend it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's one of those books.</v>

1499
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:51.860
<v Speaker 2>We just got to read a few chapters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go.</v>

1500
01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:56.861
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I may have to go back over that </v>

1501
01:08:56.861 --> 01:08:56.861
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll go over and again.</v>

1502
01:08:56.861 --> 01:08:56.861
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so freaky.</v>

1503
01:08:56.861 --> 01:09:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've stumbled upon those in the </v>

1504
01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:01.900
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those never found those.</v>

1505
01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:03.710
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to cook them first.</v>

1506
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:05.030
<v Speaker 2>You can eat them raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to boil them.</v>

1507
01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 2>We will make you sick apparently if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do it right.</v>

1508
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1509
01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:09.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1510
01:09:09.911 --> 01:09:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I forge more for Merelda my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>obviously like awesome culinary </v>

1512
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:18.200
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1513
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.700
<v Speaker 2>what's that yellow one that grows on </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees?</v>

1514
01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:21.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like a thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chicken of the woods.</v>

1515
01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:26.981
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one's real and it tastes like </v>

1516
01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:26.981
<v Speaker 2>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is unbelievable.</v>

1517
01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:26.981
<v Speaker 2>That one's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really funky.</v>

1518
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:32.110
<v Speaker 2>We found I was walking with the kids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a park downtown Toronto and I look over </v>

1519
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 2>and there's this massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on my instagram,</v>

1520
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:37.810
<v Speaker 2>a massive yellow kinda looks like goo </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing on this tree and it was a </v>

1521
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:41.510
<v Speaker 2>premature chicken of the woods and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just looked like this blob and then if I</v>

1522
01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:46.511
<v Speaker 2>were to leave it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would start to kind of a shelf out </v>

1523
01:09:46.511 --> 01:09:46.511
<v Speaker 2>into like shelf kind of mushrooms.</v>

1524
01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>And so I left it for like a week and </v>
<v Speaker 2>went back and harvested and it's like,</v>

1525
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 2>it's like tender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>juicy chicken flavor.</v>

1526
01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:53.720
<v Speaker 2>It is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's Kinda cool.</v>

1527
01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:58.721
<v Speaker 2>So you were just hoping nobody else saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>and thing and it wasn't like a really </v>

1528
01:09:58.721 --> 01:10:00.260
<v Speaker 2>public park and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1529
01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:02.360
<v Speaker 2>like I better get this before someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else finds it.</v>

1530
01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people would know in a public </v>

1531
01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:07.680
<v Speaker 2>park in Toronto?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1532
01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:07.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1533
01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 2>there's Wsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1534
01:10:07.731 --> 01:10:11.120
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of walked up to ladies like </v>
<v Speaker 2>picking herbs and stuff and I was like,</v>

1535
01:10:11.121 --> 01:10:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what do you do?</v>

1536
01:10:12.261 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 2>And then they kind of looked at me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of went away.</v>

1537
01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:15.910
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to share their </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge with me.</v>

1538
01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Here it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

1539
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.880
<v Speaker 2>So that's the bizarre man zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zookeeper.</v>

1540
01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so pumped.</v>

1541
01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I was so excited.</v>

1542
01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Face you make you look like Krista Leah </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1543
01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 2>But that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's so cool.</v>

1544
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:36.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like a little tiny one below it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>

1545
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1546
01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Well that one you can see the bark is </v>
<v Speaker 2>deteriorating.</v>

1547
01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:40.460
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1548
01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:43.460
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's feeding off the decaying a treat.</v>

1549
01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.920
<v Speaker 2>So look how bad asset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if that,</v>

1550
01:10:45.921 --> 01:10:47.930
<v Speaker 2>if you actually go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found ones like that too.</v>

1551
01:10:47.931 --> 01:10:52.931
<v Speaker 2>If you go in and harvest those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really woody by that time and </v>

1552
01:10:52.931 --> 01:10:52.931
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of a little too tough.</v>

1553
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1554
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:59.590
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanna you wanna get them when </v>

1555
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.590
<v Speaker 2>they're younger like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is there a color change?</v>

1556
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1557
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:00.630
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess when,</v>

1558
01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:05.690
<v Speaker 2>when they're older they get a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>orange from that kind of yellow </v>

1559
01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Speaker 2>premature stacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one where there's like yellow,</v>

1560
01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:07.490
<v Speaker 2>yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are like perfect.</v>

1561

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

1562
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks like almost like cauliflower.</v>

1564
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:13.350
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really neat.</v>

1566
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1567
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1568
01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:16.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1569
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:18.690
<v Speaker 1>the mushroom world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a super cool.</v>

1570
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you know they breathe air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

1571
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>They breathe air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they breathe out carbon dioxide,</v>

1572
01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>you're closer to animals and they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vegetables.</v>

1573
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>That's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're weird.</v>

1574
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Fungus is a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one,</v>

1575
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it's like I'm misunderstood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1576
01:11:33.151 --> 01:11:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was,</v>

1577
01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the podcast with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the mushroom guy.</v>

1578
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to Paul Depaul.</v>

1579
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a lot of it is,</v>

1580
01:11:42.181 --> 01:11:44.530
<v Speaker 1>is still being learned today of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1581
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>of the impact on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the earth.</v>

1582
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:51.471
<v Speaker 1>And when what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear a story about how would he </v>

1583
01:11:51.471 --> 01:11:54.291
<v Speaker 1>take 10 grams of psilocybin mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and climbed a tree was in a lightning </v>

1584
01:11:54.291 --> 01:11:56.640
<v Speaker 1>storm and like connected to the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

1585
01:11:56.641 --> 01:11:57.570
<v Speaker 1>first time ever doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1586
01:11:57.571 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 1>And he just don't ever do it.</v>

1587
01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did that.</v>

1588
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I think he was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1589
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Or some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere around that.</v>

1590
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Very young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>

1592
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Such a trip though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was reading the filicides is </v>

1593
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 1>linked to your and curing depression and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>

1594
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:13.410
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know a lot about,</v>

1595
01:12:13.411 --> 01:12:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's fascinating the effects they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have on,</v>

1596
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.130
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1597
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:22.310
<v Speaker 1>on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Hopkins is doing some studies on </v>

1598
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most fascinating of all the mushroom</v>

1599
01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:28.110
<v Speaker 1>theories is by the late great terence </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna and his brother Dennis Mckenna,</v>

1600
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:33.140
<v Speaker 1>who's still alive and a scientist </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained it on my first podcast with </v>

1601
01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if anybody's interested,</v>

1602
01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 1>find that in downloaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Dennis is a brilliant guy and this </v>

1603
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 1>theory is called the stoned ape theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this coincides what we were talking </v>

1604
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 1>about about hunting and con con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption of meat.</v>

1605
01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm leading to us becoming humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a doubling of the human brain </v>

1606
01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:55.440
<v Speaker 1>size over a period of 2 million years.</v>

1607
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like apparently one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries in the fossil record.</v>

1608
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:04.370
<v Speaker 1>They do not understand why something so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important like the thing that actually </v>

1609
01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:09.891
<v Speaker 1>created the theory of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explained evolution like this very </v>

1610
01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Oregon doubled over a period of 2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years and you don't know why.</v>

1611
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Terrence believes that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincided with climate change and that </v>

1612
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:26.511
<v Speaker 1>as the climate changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these rain forest receded into </v>

1613
01:13:26.511 --> 01:13:30.531
<v Speaker 1>grasslands and these lower hominids like</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ancestors came down from the trees </v>

1614
01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:35.781
<v Speaker 1>and started experimenting with new food </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources and one of the things they </v>

1615
01:13:35.781 --> 01:13:38.610
<v Speaker 1>experimented with with psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and that through Psilocybin,</v>

1616
01:13:38.611 --> 01:13:40.860
<v Speaker 1>which they found by flipping over cow </v>
<v Speaker 1>patties.</v>

1617
01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:43.200
<v Speaker 1>A couple things happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1618
01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.310
<v Speaker 1>it increased visual acuity mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in low doses,</v>

1619
01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:50.490
<v Speaker 1>increased visual acuity which would make</v>
<v Speaker 1>them better hunters.</v>

1620
01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.220
<v Speaker 1>They could see better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made them more intuitive,</v>

1621
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:58.250
<v Speaker 1>made them more creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the way Dennis explains the </v>

1622
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:59.640
<v Speaker 1>effect of Psilocybin on the brain.</v>

1623
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.640
<v Speaker 1>He was saying that it could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly led to the development of </v>

1624
01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.821
<v Speaker 1>language and that all of this could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out of the consumption of </v>

1625
01:14:07.821 --> 01:14:09.390
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking intense,</v>

1626
01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrence called it stoned ape theory.</v>

1627
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:16.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how he thinks we became human.</v>

1628
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.490
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1629
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:21.160
<v Speaker 1>it sounds stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds stupid until you do mushrooms.</v>

1630
01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

1631
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1632
01:14:23.951 --> 01:14:25.010
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1633
01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1634
01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

1635
01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I is this illegal.</v>

1636
01:14:28.871 --> 01:14:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Then you start going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1637
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1638
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1639
01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:35.720
<v Speaker 1>When you first started cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1640
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.870
<v Speaker 1>did when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old were you when you became a chef?</v>

1641
01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1642
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.740
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a fluke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny Story.</v>

1643
01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:46.741
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a 13 year old kid and I wanted a </v>

1644
01:14:46.741 --> 01:14:46.741
<v Speaker 2>part time job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1645
01:14:46.741 --> 01:14:47.710
<v Speaker 2>like a newspaper route or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1646
01:14:47.711 --> 01:14:52.711
<v Speaker 2>And I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in a little town on this horse </v>

1647
01:14:52.711 --> 01:14:55.561
<v Speaker 2>farm in the country and I rode my bike </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to this gas station and I applied </v>

1648
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:59.860
<v Speaker 2>to pump gas and this guy had a diner on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the corner and was like,</v>

1649
01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:01.690
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't need anyone to pump gas but</v>

1650
01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:06.691
<v Speaker 2>can you cook?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I grew up cooking at home with my </v>

1651
01:15:06.691 --> 01:15:09.211
<v Speaker 2>mom because she would work late and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>would call me on her way home and tell </v>

1652
01:15:09.211 --> 01:15:09.211
<v Speaker 2>me how to start dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1653
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.500
<v Speaker 2>turn on the oven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the chicken out of the fridge,</v>

1654
01:15:11.501 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 2>get the shake and bake and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1655
01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:18.001
<v Speaker 2>she would walk me through it and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>start dinner and she'd get home and </v>

1656
01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:18.001
<v Speaker 2>finish it.</v>

1657
01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:18.001
<v Speaker 2>So I totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1658
01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 2>I can cook or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had had me in there,</v>

1659
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:25.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dropping the fry baskets and </v>

1660
01:15:25.891 --> 01:15:28.321
<v Speaker 2>flipping eggs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the brunch shift on the weekend </v>

1661
01:15:28.321 --> 01:15:29.230
<v Speaker 2>and it just stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things that uh,</v>

1662
01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.550
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of grow up doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1663
01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:35.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted money to buy skateboards and </v>

1664
01:15:35.551 --> 01:15:35.551
<v Speaker 2>pot and stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1665
01:15:35.551 --> 01:15:35.551
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1666
01:15:35.551 --> 01:15:36.880
<v Speaker 2>it just kind of stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1667
01:15:36.881 --> 01:15:41.881
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all through high school I had a job </v>

1668
01:15:41.881 --> 01:15:42.370
<v Speaker 2>cooking and I really started to struggle</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it because,</v>

1669
01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1670
01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:48.871
<v Speaker 2>I was taking all these world issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>courses and learning about the </v>

1671
01:15:48.871 --> 01:15:51.991
<v Speaker 2>environment and watching these </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentaries about food and I didn't </v>

1672
01:15:51.991 --> 01:15:51.991
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1673
01:15:51.991 --> 01:15:55.161
<v Speaker 2>how being a chef could help change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and how am I going to make a </v>

1674
01:15:55.161 --> 01:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>difference as a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1675
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:57.190
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1676
01:15:57.191 --> 01:16:02.191
<v Speaker 2>and then I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my daughter when I was 19 and I </v>

1677
01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:02.260
<v Speaker 2>had all this experience cooking and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1678
01:16:02.261 --> 01:16:02.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1679
01:16:02.621 --> 01:16:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna go to chef school and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make a go of this.</v>

1680
01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I've got all this experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already this far ahead.</v>

1681
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.520
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1682
01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 2>it was having kids at such a young age </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really made me focus and was like,</v>

1683
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have a job to do.</v>

1684
01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:18.340
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell in love with food.</v>

1685
01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1686
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:24.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a 17 year old kid with a </v>

1687
01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:24.541
<v Speaker 2>vegetable garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who does that,</v>

1688
01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:24.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1689
01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:27.580
<v Speaker 2>and then I got into hunting and foraging</v>
<v Speaker 2>and learning about food and I just,</v>

1690
01:16:27.581 --> 01:16:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I totally just fell in love with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how did antler come about?</v>

1691
01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 2>He brought a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of these.</v>

1692
01:16:32.981 --> 01:16:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this photo,</v>

1693
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:35.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually took this photo.</v>

1694
01:16:35.951 --> 01:16:40.951
<v Speaker 2>It's blown up in the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the green on the ground is a wild </v>

1695
01:16:40.951 --> 01:16:41.320
<v Speaker 2>leeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the spring.</v>

1696
01:16:41.321 --> 01:16:44.050
<v Speaker 2>And I actually took this Turkey hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1697
01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:45.370
<v Speaker 2>and I looked over and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1698
01:16:45.371 --> 01:16:46.300
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

1699
01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.750
<v Speaker 2>And just took the photo postcard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is actually a sketch.</v>

1700
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.990
<v Speaker 2>My friend did have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a deer skull that I shot.</v>

1701
01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1702
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:56.850
<v Speaker 2>lyric came about because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1703
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.850
<v Speaker 2>I worked for a celebrity chef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1704
01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.200
<v Speaker 2>he gave me his cookbook and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting and foraging,</v>

1705
01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:02.590
<v Speaker 2>doing all the stuff and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1706
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways I can make an impact in </v>

1707
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.000
<v Speaker 2>the world that I can teach people about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing.</v>

1708
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.000
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1709
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I went and got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a camera and I would take it with </v>

1710
01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.641
<v Speaker 2>me and shoot photos like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wanted to teach people about </v>

1711
01:17:15.641 --> 01:17:17.420
<v Speaker 2>hunting and foraging because what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is not new.</v>

1712
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:18.530
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really old.</v>

1713
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.450
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1714
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people seem to have forgotten about it,</v>

1715
01:17:21.111 --> 01:17:22.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least people in the cities anyway,</v>

1716
01:17:22.761 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 2>people don't really know much about it.</v>

1717
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:25.520
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1718
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to help educate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1719
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:32.860
<v Speaker 2>a modern civilization about hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>foraging and this'll be like my make a </v>

1720
01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 2>difference in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1721
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:39.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up hanging out with a really </v>

1722
01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:39.580
<v Speaker 2>good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1723
01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.690
<v Speaker 2>one of my best friends today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a family friend,</v>

1724
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:44.270
<v Speaker 2>a documentary film maker by the name of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jody Shapiro.</v>

1725
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1726
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:47.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had this deal and you said,</v>

1727

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

<v Speaker 2>teach me how to cook.</v>

1729
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:55.570
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was taking some culinary courses at </v>

1730
01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:56.330
<v Speaker 2>the local college just as a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1731
01:17:56.331 --> 01:17:56.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1732
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:59.150
<v Speaker 2>we started hanging out and shooting this</v>
<v Speaker 2>cookbook.</v>

1733
01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:04.210
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started to kind of get some press </v>

1734
01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:04.210
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1735
01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:08.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eater magazine did this article on us </v>

1736
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:11.141
<v Speaker 2>and we started doing these game dinners </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of his house and he had this really </v>

1737
01:18:11.141 --> 01:18:11.850
<v Speaker 2>nice condo and so I put on this game </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner,</v>

1738
01:18:11.851 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I sold tickets and I knew there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws about serving game and restaurant.</v>

1739
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I appreciate the,</v>

1740
01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:18.830
<v Speaker 2>u.</v>
<v Speaker 2>s is pretty similar.</v>

1741
01:18:18.831 --> 01:18:20.780
<v Speaker 2>You can't serve wild game in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

1742
01:18:20.781 --> 01:18:23.180
<v Speaker 2>So there's public health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>

1743
01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm amit has to be inspected through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughterhouse.</v>

1744
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Europe is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of do whatever in Europe.</v>

1745
01:18:29.111 --> 01:18:34.111
<v Speaker 2>But so I thought okay cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have this game dinner out of his </v>

1746
01:18:34.111 --> 01:18:34.420
<v Speaker 2>house and we're in the clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with the,</v>

1747
01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 2>with the Ministry of natural resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't sell game meat.</v>

1748
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:40.090
<v Speaker 2>So for any kind of profit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we weren't profiting off it.</v>

1749
01:18:40.091 --> 01:18:41.710
<v Speaker 2>We just going to have some fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1750
01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.570
<v Speaker 2>and we do this game dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a local paper,</v>

1751
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:46.820
<v Speaker 2>a national paper actually wanting to buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ticket.</v>

1752
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:51.850
<v Speaker 2>They came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we thought they're going to write this </v>

1753
01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:53.621
<v Speaker 2>little blurb about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a two page spread in the </v>

1754
01:18:53.621 --> 01:18:53.621
<v Speaker 2>national newspaper about this game </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner.</v>

1755
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:55.760
<v Speaker 2>So we started to get all this press </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1756
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.560
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just said,</v>

1757
01:18:57.561 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

1759
01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:01.010
<v Speaker 2>let's have a home where we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1760
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:02.240

1761
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:07.630
<v Speaker 2>possibly shoot some documentary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>really just have fun and explore a </v>

1762
01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Canadian cuisine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that I'm really </v>

1763
01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:13.490
<v Speaker 2>passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that really hasn't really been</v>

1764
01:19:13.491 --> 01:19:18.491
<v Speaker 2>defined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of people trying to </v>

1765
01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:18.491
<v Speaker 2>define it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1766
01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:18.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1767
01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:18.491
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1768
01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:23.410
<v Speaker 2>and it was just sort of our home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you say Canadian cuisine or </v>

1769
01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:25.280
<v Speaker 2>these traditional recipes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or are they improvise?</v>

1770
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1771
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is improvised.</v>

1772
01:19:27.561 --> 01:19:28.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my take on it.</v>

1773
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1774
01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:35.021
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely want to do some more kind </v>

1775
01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:35.021
<v Speaker 2>of studying about native and indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking.</v>

1776
01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1777
01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:38.300
<v Speaker 2>traveling across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I want to do and learning</v>

1778
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:41.200
<v Speaker 2>from the indigenous communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1779
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:43.370
<v Speaker 2>but sort of my take on it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.650
<v Speaker 2>if there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there wasn't these farmed animals,</v>

1781
01:19:45.651 --> 01:19:47.000
<v Speaker 2>what would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would we eat?</v>

1782
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1783
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:49.670
<v Speaker 2>it's morals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's maple syrup,</v>

1784
01:19:49.671 --> 01:19:54.671
<v Speaker 2>it's the wild leeks in this photo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's deer and Turkey and rabbit and </v>

1785
01:19:54.671 --> 01:19:58.510
<v Speaker 2>these things we all serve at antler </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what's growing around us </v>

1786
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:59.030
<v Speaker 2>in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wild fish.</v>

1787
01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:04.150
<v Speaker 2>And thanks again for the map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to break my diet to </v>

1788
01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:07.470
<v Speaker 2>enjoy some of this liquid ious looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>richest looking.</v>

1789
01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Ever seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looks amazing.</v>

1790
01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:15.630
<v Speaker 2>So I was telling you earlier that takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 liters of sap boiled down to make one</v>

1791
01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:20.631
<v Speaker 2>liter of syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the cool part is you can drink the </v>

1792
01:20:20.631 --> 01:20:20.631
<v Speaker 2>sap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a natural,</v>

1793
01:20:20.631 --> 01:20:24.831
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's full of a lot of natural </v>

1794
01:20:24.831 --> 01:20:24.831
<v Speaker 2>electrolytes and minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's Kinda like a coconut water,</v>

1795
01:20:24.831 --> 01:20:29.730
<v Speaker 2>a type of beverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's crazy to me is how someone </v>

1796
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:31.500
<v Speaker 2>figured out to do that and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it for hundreds of years,</v>

1797
01:20:31.501 --> 01:20:32.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1798
01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Super Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it happens only you can only make it</v>

1799
01:20:34.741 --> 01:20:39.330
<v Speaker 2>in the spring when it's freezing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and it was during the day.</v>

1800
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:44.630
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is the tree roots are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking up as much water as it can to </v>

1801
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:45.350
<v Speaker 2>feed the buds that it's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1802
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.100
<v Speaker 2>to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make leaves again.</v>

1803
01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:48.550
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did anybody figure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>

1804
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.390
<v Speaker 2>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take the sap from the trees like that.</v>

1805
01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:54.250
<v Speaker 2>So simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1806
01:20:54.251 --> 01:20:55.880
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool to when,</v>

1807
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go,</v>

1808
01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drill a hole in the tree,</v>

1809
01:20:58.051 --> 01:21:01.410
<v Speaker 2>you put in this little tap and hang a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucket and it just drips out and.</v>

1810
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long does it take to drip when </v>

1811
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:10.611
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's like kind of perfect </v>

1812
01:21:10.611 --> 01:21:12.531
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put up these 16 liter buckets and </v>

1813
01:21:12.531 --> 01:21:12.531
<v Speaker 2>within like three or four days they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>full.</v>

1814
01:21:12.531 --> 01:21:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's cool.</v>

1815
01:21:13.171 --> 01:21:15.150
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it gets me out in the woods.</v>

1816
01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I call it my spring training because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>lugging around all these buckets,</v>

1817
01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:18.260
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1818

<v Speaker 2>That winter fat off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you were talking about </v>

1821
01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:26.381
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they would cook their food,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1829
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:38.430
<v Speaker 2>where do we go from here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1830
01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:39.570
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned,</v>

1831
01:21:39.571 --> 01:21:44.571
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my business partner is a documentary </v>

1832
01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:44.571
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

1833
01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:46.931
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to travel and travel across the </v>

1834
01:21:46.931 --> 01:21:46.931
<v Speaker 2>country and learn really what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1835
01:21:46.931 --> 01:21:49.140
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities in Canada.</v>

1836
01:21:49.141 --> 01:21:51.150
<v Speaker 2>Canada is on three coasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1837
01:21:51.151 --> 01:21:52.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much like the states with Alaska,</v>

1838
01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:57.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really think of the Arctic up </v>

1839
01:21:57.501 --> 01:21:57.501
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1840
01:21:57.501 --> 01:21:58.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three ocean that ocean,</v>

1841
01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:02.440
<v Speaker 2>so it's not an ocean to walk across it.</v>

1842
01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:05.060
<v Speaker 2>It's frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1843
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:06.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

1844
01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:08.580
<v Speaker 2>it's something that I definitely want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn more about.</v>

1845
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how would they cook Moose,</v>

1846
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.650
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1847
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:18.200
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it would be open fire in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it's raw seal meat and whale blubber,</v>

1848
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

1849
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.360
<v Speaker 2>like in the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a lot of wood to burn,</v>

1850
01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would have like a oil lamps </v>

1851
01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:26.780
<v Speaker 2>from the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the blubber.</v>

1852
01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:26.970
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1853
01:22:26.971 --> 01:22:29.070
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the cooking is raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1854
01:22:29.071 --> 01:22:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Steven Rinella went to new Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a new event?</v>

1855
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1856
01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.350
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's been,</v>

1857
01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1858
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:42.260
<v Speaker 2>the North Northwest Territories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's new boot and they were eating a </v>

1859
01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:46.710
<v Speaker 2>lot of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen fish that was dipped in seal oil,</v>

1860
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Speaker 2>dip the fish and seal oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat it.</v>

1861
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:53.650
<v Speaker 2>They have a tremendous amount of oil and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat in their diet,</v>

1862
01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which kind of makes sense.</v>

1863
01:22:55.741 --> 01:22:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1864
01:22:58.190 --> 01:23:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're up there in the coldest of cold </v>

1865
01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:05.721
<v Speaker 2>climates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we do this kind of </v>

1866
01:23:05.721 --> 01:23:05.721
<v Speaker 2>cool is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1867
01:23:05.721 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I know the native in the indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures</v>

1868
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would make cedar tea and it's full of </v>

1869
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.220
<v Speaker 3>vitamin C and minerals and nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we do a cedar a sorbet.</v>

1870
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.780
<v Speaker 3>So we boil cedar leaves and then I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>add sugar and make it into like an ice.</v>

1871
01:23:19.781 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's a frozen kind of survey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really cool.</v>

1872
01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:23.260
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1873
01:23:23.261 --> 01:23:24.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you eat it,</v>

1874
01:23:24.011 --> 01:23:25.610
<v Speaker 3>it's like the forest and your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

1875
01:23:25.611 --> 01:23:27.790
<v Speaker 3>really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get the cedar from.</v>

1876
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:32.910
<v Speaker 3>We just go into the woods and cut it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and we'll bring that into the </v>

1877
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:36.061
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all kinds of cool stuff that we </v>

1878
01:23:36.061 --> 01:23:36.061
<v Speaker 3>do that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1879
01:23:36.061 --> 01:23:38.791
<v Speaker 3>because I go up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try and be in nature a couple times a </v>

1880
01:23:38.791 --> 01:23:38.791
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1881
01:23:38.791 --> 01:23:40.620
<v Speaker 3>and I'll go and forage for all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and bring it into antler.</v>

1882
01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another way we use the cedar isn't a </v>

1883
01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:45.680
<v Speaker 3>cocktail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do a cedar gin sour,</v>

1884
01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.450
<v Speaker 3>so we infuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infuse the gin with a,</v>

1885
01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.170
<v Speaker 3>with cedar leaves for like a week.</v>

1886
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:53.470
<v Speaker 3>And then we shake that with some simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>syrup and make me hungry.</v>

1887
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:55.330
<v Speaker 3>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1888
01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:00.280
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that when you go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woods to forage for plant life,</v>

1889
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:01.800
<v Speaker 3>it's totally legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1890
01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.050
<v Speaker 3>You could sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.070
<v Speaker 3>But if you forge for animal life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

1892
01:24:06.071 --> 01:24:11.071
<v Speaker 3>I think that is because of market </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting that really decimated most of </v>

1893
01:24:11.381 --> 01:24:16.381
<v Speaker 3>the population of North American game </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals in the 18 hundreds and early </v>

1894
01:24:16.381 --> 01:24:17.680
<v Speaker 3>into the 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like mo.</v>

1895
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Most people associate that with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>death of the buffalo,</v>

1896
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:22.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1897
01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:23.730
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1898
01:24:23.731 --> 01:24:28.731
<v Speaker 3>I think if there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are ways to do it where it could </v>

1899
01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:31.351
<v Speaker 3>be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I could hunt enough Meat </v>

1900
01:24:31.351 --> 01:24:31.351
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the restaurant,</v>

1901
01:24:31.351 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 3>but five seats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>45 seats.</v>

1902
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:35.680
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think I do think that,</v>

1903
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:40.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's people's right to be able </v>

1904
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.950
<v Speaker 3>to eat wild meat.</v>

1905
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the right to try that.</v>

1906
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:43.480
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know how to go do it,</v>

1907
01:24:43.481 --> 01:24:45.640
<v Speaker 3>you have the right to at least try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1908
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:50.670
<v Speaker 3>and I do know in newfoundland they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to serve wild game and the </v>

1909
01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:54.991
<v Speaker 3>hunter has to go and get a permit to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sell and then he has to bring it to a </v>

1910
01:24:54.991 --> 01:24:59.911
<v Speaker 3>butcher that has a permit to process it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and expect it and then not butcher can </v>

1911
01:24:59.911 --> 01:25:00.310
<v Speaker 3>then sell to a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1912
01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:01.420
<v Speaker 3>well that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1913
01:25:01.421 --> 01:25:03.010
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's controlled and like I don't want to</v>

1914
01:25:03.011 --> 01:25:06.040
<v Speaker 3>decimate the population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hurt a anything.</v>

1915
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Is that the way to say it though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>New found land,</v>

1916
01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:08.980
<v Speaker 3>newfoundland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:25:08.981 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 3>I think it's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call it new found land.</v>

1918
01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like calling chicago chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get pissed at you.</v>

1919
01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Like fake canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an aunt from there.</v>

1920
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want market hunting of wild </v>

1921
01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:28.381
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Because I love wild animals and </v>

1922
01:25:28.381 --> 01:25:28.381
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

1923
01:25:28.381 --> 01:25:31.980
<v Speaker 3>how do you love an animal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1924
01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:36.400
<v Speaker 3>well I just think it's very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

1925
01:25:36.401 --> 01:25:41.401
<v Speaker 3>I think just staying alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a human is very complex and I </v>

1926
01:25:41.401 --> 01:25:42.850
<v Speaker 3>think we have very simplistic ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at it.</v>

1927
01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:48.150
<v Speaker 3>I also think that it's entirely possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>that plants are communicating with each </v>

1928
01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:51.751
<v Speaker 3>other and they have a level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence that we don't totally </v>

1929
01:25:51.751 --> 01:25:53.470
<v Speaker 3>understand and that's supported by data </v>
<v Speaker 3>that supported by more and more research</v>

1930
01:25:53.471 --> 01:25:58.471
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're finding out that plants have </v>

1931
01:25:58.471 --> 01:26:01.471
<v Speaker 3>some interconnected network of </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication with each other and that </v>

1932
01:26:01.471 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>they recognize when they're being and</v>

1933
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:09.010
<v Speaker 1>they changed their flavor profile to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make themselves tastes terrible to </v>

1934
01:26:09.010 --> 01:26:13.151
<v Speaker 1>animals that are eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some communication between them </v>

1935
01:26:13.151 --> 01:26:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and there are some sort of a primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>life form that many are.</v>

1936
01:26:14.731 --> 01:26:19.731
<v Speaker 1>You are far more complex than things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that vegans won't eat like mollusks </v>

1937
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.580
<v Speaker 1>mollusks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we think of them as animals,</v>

1938
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:25.790
<v Speaker 1>they're the simplest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbest fucking thing on earth vice.</v>

1939
01:26:25.791 --> 01:26:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Just an article that a questioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether mollusks we're vegan.</v>

1940
01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be.</v>

1941
01:26:31.450 --> 01:26:34.250
<v Speaker 1>I think for health purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are vegans like,</v>

1942
01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:35.310
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

1943

<v Speaker 1>They're sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could farm them.</v>

1944
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:42.641
<v Speaker 1>You could have anything property to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they were using muscles </v>

1945
01:26:42.641 --> 01:26:43.790
<v Speaker 1>to clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ocean beaches,</v>

1946
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:49.030
<v Speaker 1>filter the water and a fast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms to apparently are very </v>

1947
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:52.691
<v Speaker 1>cleansing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to find ways to use </v>

1948
01:26:52.691 --> 01:26:53.280
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms to clean kind of oil spills </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

1949
01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.800
<v Speaker 1>screwed up environmental things.</v>

1950
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:59.860
<v Speaker 1>People should eat mandalas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really should and they should also </v>

1951
01:26:59.860 --> 01:26:59.860
<v Speaker 1>eat eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat eggs,</v>

1952
01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:01.700
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just from An ethical animals,</v>

1953
01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:06.701
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just saying this just as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who values health in a person </v>

1954
01:27:06.701 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 1>who's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

1955
01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I put my body through a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My body has to.</v>

1956
01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.160
<v Speaker 1>It has to perform and it has my whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1957
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:18.161
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very concerned with nutrition and I'm </v>

1958
01:27:18.161 --> 01:27:21.131
<v Speaker 1>very aware of the impact attrition has </v>
<v Speaker 1>on physical performance and I think eggs</v>

1959
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:26.261
<v Speaker 1>are gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so goddamn good for your health </v>

1960
01:27:26.261 --> 01:27:26.780
<v Speaker 1>and this idea that somehow know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something cruel.</v>

1961
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:30.320
<v Speaker 1>My chickens are my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it from that video that's proven</v>

1962
01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:31.850
<v Speaker 1>in the pudding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scared of me at all.</v>

1963
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:36.950
<v Speaker 1>That runnIng around with their running </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with me and I eat their eggs and </v>

1964
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:37.280
<v Speaker 1>those eggs are good for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know everybody can't do that,</v>

1965
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:39.780
<v Speaker 1>but you can get these toilets.</v>

1966
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:42.770
<v Speaker 1>It's eggs and you vote with your dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're spending.</v>

1967
01:27:42.771 --> 01:27:47.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to the store and you buy </v>

1968
01:27:47.771 --> 01:27:47.771
<v Speaker 1>organic eggs and you buy the healthier </v>
<v Speaker 1>version,</v>

1969
01:27:47.771 --> 01:27:48.200
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paying an extra buck or two bucks</v>

1970
01:27:48.201 --> 01:27:51.380
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but crack open an egg from like the mass</v>

1971
01:27:51.381 --> 01:27:55.130
<v Speaker 1>produced place and you crack open an egg</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the organic place.</v>

1972
01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.280
<v Speaker 1>One is like the organic ones are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bright orange and like super dark and </v>

1973
01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.811
<v Speaker 1>even the yolk is like really thick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the other one it's like pale and </v>

1974
01:28:04.811 --> 01:28:09.611
<v Speaker 1>runny yellow and you crack them and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>yolks break sometimes and they're just </v>

1975
01:28:09.611 --> 01:28:13.631
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's garbage and who knows what's in </v>

1976
01:28:13.631 --> 01:28:13.631
<v Speaker 1>them and what conditions those chickens </v>
<v Speaker 1>are living in.</v>

1977
01:28:13.631 --> 01:28:17.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times terrible conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think whoever started off,</v>

1978
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess it's just economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1979
01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:23.891
<v Speaker 1>And then you give people the option to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the most amount of money and not </v>

1980
01:28:24.651 --> 01:28:28.900
<v Speaker 1>have to account for ethics or cruelty </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards or whatever.</v>

1981
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:34.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever issues were in place that </v>

1982
01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:37.181
<v Speaker 1>allowed factory farms to materialize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the worst,</v>

1983
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:42.980
<v Speaker 1>worst pieces of evidence about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruelty of human beings.</v>

1984
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.110
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific.</v>

1985
01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1986
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:51.610
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I think we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>really collectively do something about </v>

1987
01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.520
<v Speaker 1>and absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that really ramps</v>

1988
01:28:55.521 --> 01:29:00.521
<v Speaker 1>up the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anger on the side of the animal </v>

1989
01:29:00.521 --> 01:29:00.740
<v Speaker 1>rights activists and the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegans.</v>

1990
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

1991
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:06.500
<v Speaker 1>but to go after someone like you is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my opinion,</v>

1992
01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>so incredibly misguided and it's why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked you to come on because I thought </v>

1993
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.431
<v Speaker 1>it was so frustrating and watching you </v>
<v Speaker 1>carved that venice and up in front of </v>

1994
01:29:16.431 --> 01:29:17.550
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were they screaming at you?</v>

1995
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Murderer murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

1996
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1997
01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:27.390
<v Speaker 1>it's just like saying you're a thief </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you cut grass.</v>

1998
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1999
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2000
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:33.870
<v Speaker 1>it's kIlling animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even,</v>

2001
01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:36.000
<v Speaker 1>even the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's walking by and they're like,</v>

2002
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:37.530
<v Speaker 1>they're saying they're murderers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

2003
01:29:37.531 --> 01:29:39.060
<v Speaker 1>they're murdering people and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2004
01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:41.190
<v Speaker 1>they're murdering animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of laugh.</v>

2005
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:48.980
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those people are sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of like what you're dealing </v>

2006
01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:50.310
<v Speaker 1>with with these animal rights activists </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're,</v>

2007
01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:54.750
<v Speaker 1>they're so engrossed in this struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the part of their,</v>

2008
01:29:54.751 --> 01:29:57.510
<v Speaker 1>their daily existence and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're angry and sad.</v>

2009
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:02.930
<v Speaker 1>There's one crazy video where this lady </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into this restaurant and she starts</v>

2010
01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:08.660
<v Speaker 1>yelling in front of everybody about her </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and just be this beautiful </v>

2011

<v Speaker 1>creature that just wants to live and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a chicken.</v>

2016
01:30:16.890 --> 01:30:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I've seen these videos and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll storm a restaurant.</v>

2017
01:30:19.531 --> 01:30:22.570
<v Speaker 1>There'll be like 50 people that go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy a steakhouse.</v>

2018

<v Speaker 5>She was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>she has a very determined look in her </v>

2022
01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:43.021
<v Speaker 5>eyes wherever she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she was hurt and abused her entire </v>

2023

<v Speaker 3>there's protesting and it's like it's,</v>

2049
01:32:42.930 --> 01:32:47.930
<v Speaker 3>it's our fundamental right to protest </v>
<v Speaker 3>and have freedom of speech and have </v>

2050
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.930
<v Speaker 3>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not protesting.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's not what they're supposed to eat.</v>

2070
01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:37.330
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cats need meat.</v>

2071
01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.740
<v Speaker 3>You can't feed a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A vegan dIet like you can see.</v>

2072
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.320
<v Speaker 3>One of my bits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a bit about it.</v>

2073
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:46.350
<v Speaker 3>do you really fucking hilarious because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that I found online when </v>

2074
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:47.800
<v Speaker 3>someone's angry at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone was angry at me,</v>

2075
01:33:47.801 --> 01:33:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I went to her page and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things said hashtag vegan cat.</v>

2076
01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh jesus.</v>

2077
01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:56.410
<v Speaker 3>I went down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was illegal in animal rights.</v>

2078
01:33:56.411 --> 01:33:58.180
<v Speaker 3>People will come and should tinker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cat.</v>

2079
01:33:58.330 --> 01:34:00.160
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk about that later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do my bit.</v>

2080
01:34:00.161 --> 01:34:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing it on a comedy special zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

2081
01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:06.700
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with this is that as we said</v>

2082
01:34:06.701 --> 01:34:09.550
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes like a contest.</v>

2083
01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.020
<v Speaker 3>It becomes like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a battle ground.</v>

2084
01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my concern is like,</v>

2085
01:34:13.451 --> 01:34:15.940
<v Speaker 3>how does this end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we bridge the gap?</v>

2086
01:34:15.941 --> 01:34:18.550
<v Speaker 3>How do we get people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they stop fucking with you?</v>

2087
01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:20.140
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2088

<v Speaker 3>sign in our window that's explained </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2090
01:34:25.141 --> 01:34:29.210
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're mistreating animals and animal </v>

2091
01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:29.230
<v Speaker 3>lives or their right and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2094
01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.110
<v Speaker 3>we're not doing anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2095
01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:36.670
<v Speaker 3>nothing we're doing is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not infringing on anyone's rights.</v>

2096
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Have you talked to them at all if you </v>

<v Speaker 3>and there,</v>

2099
01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:44.740
<v Speaker 3>they just screamed at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

2100
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.480
<v Speaker 3>this isn't the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think just murderer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

<v Speaker 3>we invited them to go foraging with us.</v>

2104
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:58.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we talked about our different </v>

2105
01:34:58.810 --> 01:34:58.810
<v Speaker 3>ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies and how,</v>

2106
01:34:58.810 --> 01:34:58.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2107
01:34:58.810 --> 01:34:58.810
<v Speaker 3>they're really far</v>

2108
01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:03.010
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we can come to some kind of </v>

2109
01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:03.010
<v Speaker 2>understanding and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:05.570
<v Speaker 2>at the time they didn't respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't respond for awhile and now I</v>

2112
01:35:05.571 --> 01:35:08.630
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm a,</v>

2113
01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:09.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2114
01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that anything good would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come with that meeting at this point.</v>

2115
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you do?</v>

<v Speaker 2>We were very lucky.</v>

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:24.470

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that's part of it.</v>

2120
01:35:24.471 --> 01:35:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

2121
01:35:25.161 --> 01:35:30.161
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had some international </v>

2122
01:35:30.161 --> 01:35:30.161
<v Speaker 2>recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2123
01:35:30.161 --> 01:35:30.161
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of traveling last year,</v>

2124
01:35:30.161 --> 01:35:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I've been to five continents in the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>year or two of them cooking.</v>

2125
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to abu dhabi with a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2138
01:36:01.371 --> 01:36:02.150
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2139
01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:05.840
<v Speaker 2>And we actually won and they sent me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>abu dhabi to,</v>

2140
01:36:05.841 --> 01:36:10.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to compete against 11 other chefs from </v>

2141
01:36:10.841 --> 01:36:10.841
<v Speaker 2>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2142
01:36:10.841 --> 01:36:10.910
<v Speaker 2>and it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>

2143
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then from there,</v>

2144
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:18.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think six slash six or eight months </v>

2145
01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:18.040
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a festival in Australia.</v>

2146
01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.700
<v Speaker 2>So they brought me to Australia to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2147
01:36:19.701 --> 01:36:23.360
<v Speaker 2>to cook in western Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a event called the gourmet escape,</v>

2148
01:36:23.890 --> 01:36:28.890
<v Speaker 2>a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool event and it was down the </v>

2149
01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:31.211
<v Speaker 2>road from a deer farm and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting out a lunch and dinner for 200 </v>

2150
01:36:31.211 --> 01:36:31.211
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2151
01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 2>So we actually roasted to hold dear sato</v>
<v Speaker 2>style over open fire,</v>

2152
01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do that.</v>

2153
01:36:37.690 --> 01:36:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rAn the woods.</v>

2154
01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:43.780
<v Speaker 2>it was incredible photos on my instagram</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the antler kitchen borrowed up to or </v>

2155
01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:47.780
<v Speaker 2>at antler kitchen bar on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's photos of this,</v>

2156
01:36:47.781 --> 01:36:49.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this uh,</v>

2157
01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.290
<v Speaker 2>sato.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was super,</v>

2158
01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.280
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super cool.</v>

2159
01:36:52.281 --> 01:36:57.281
<v Speaker 2>So sato sato is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the argentinian cooking </v>

2160
01:36:57.281 --> 01:36:57.281
<v Speaker 2>style and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole,</v>

2161
01:36:57.281 --> 01:37:02.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal that's a kind of split down the </v>

2162
01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:02.220
<v Speaker 2>middle and kind of like cross across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2163
01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:03.980
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool.</v>

2164
01:37:03.981 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 2>So pig is probably the best one to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with because of the fat content,</v>

2165
01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.680
<v Speaker 2>a deer and lamb and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have to base it to keep it </v>

2166
01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:15.971
<v Speaker 2>moist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you regulate temperature when it </v>

2167
01:37:15.971 --> 01:37:17.831
<v Speaker 2>comes to something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just stacking up the wood and kind </v>

2168
01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:18.720
<v Speaker 2>of how far leaning on it and some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to do it.</v>

2169
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.960
<v Speaker 2>It just practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just playing around.</v>

2170
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

2171
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:24.770
<v Speaker 2>It just lay low and slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was kind of ready to go for many times.</v>

2172
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2173
01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.440
<v Speaker 2>So we do at the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it in my backyard a lot.</v>

2174
01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I actually did for my wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did two pigs from my wedding.</v>

2175
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm like poking the fire and my suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so graphic.</v>

2176
01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.250
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2177
01:37:34.251 --> 01:37:37.580
<v Speaker 2>That got a lot of hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's hate on that.</v>

2178
01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's food,</v>

2179
01:37:39.591 --> 01:37:41.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people want to disconnect themselves</v>

2180
01:37:41.931 --> 01:37:43.780
<v Speaker 2>from where it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2181
01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.150
<v Speaker 2>but he went back to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2182
01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:46.600
<v Speaker 2>business has always been good in </v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses,</v>

2183
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:47.930
<v Speaker 2>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good days and bad days.</v>

2184
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now there's a lot of attention on </v>

2185
01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:52.960
<v Speaker 2>antler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of media attention on antler.</v>

2186
01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:52.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2187
01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:52.960
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2188
01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.200
<v Speaker 2>we're a little bit busier than normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

2189
01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Get ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

2190
01:37:56.350 --> 01:38:01.350
<v Speaker 1>get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be nuts down there and </v>

2191
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:03.981
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a bunch of people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your side to hopefully nothing bad </v>

2192
01:38:03.981 --> 01:38:03.981
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2193
01:38:03.981 --> 01:38:07.530
<v Speaker 1>people don't get into anything physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can start shouting at each other,</v>

2194
01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but that</v>

2195
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 2>shouting stuff was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2196
01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.520
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully this will kind of smooth out </v>

2197
01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:16.910
<v Speaker 2>and people can learn to get it to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and lifting</v>

2198
01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:17.710
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:38:17.711 --> 01:38:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Well it doesn't seem like that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want though.</v>

2200
01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.900
<v Speaker 1>It seems like what they want is for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bend their demands.</v>

2201
01:38:22.901 --> 01:38:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what a lot of this is when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to change,</v>

2202
01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to people wanting change,</v>

2203
01:38:28.811 --> 01:38:33.811
<v Speaker 1>they want you to change and they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>their right and they want you to admit </v>

2204
01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:34.630
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

2205
01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:39.660
<v Speaker 1>this is a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with something that's </v>

2206
01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:39.660
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

2207
01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing was like we've had </v>

2208
01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.090
<v Speaker 2>vegan and vegetarian items on our menu </v>
<v Speaker 2>since 2015 when we opened.</v>

2209
01:38:44.150 --> 01:38:47.270
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it was like the second or</v>
<v Speaker 2>third week they came,</v>

2210
01:38:47.271 --> 01:38:48.510
<v Speaker 2>we thought okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>

2211
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:53.530
<v Speaker 2>we're going to feature one of our vegan </v>
<v Speaker 2>dishes on the sign and hopefully that </v>

2212
01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:57.161
<v Speaker 2>makes them happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we feature one of our vegan </v>

2213
01:38:57.161 --> 01:39:00.581
<v Speaker 2>dishes on the sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we saw from their online post </v>

2214
01:39:00.581 --> 01:39:03.650
<v Speaker 2>that they thought that we made the posts</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we made them change a meat dish to</v>

2215
01:39:03.651 --> 01:39:05.570
<v Speaker 2>a vegan dish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to keep pUshing them.</v>

2216
01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:07.190
<v Speaker 2>And it was so frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2217
01:39:07.191 --> 01:39:09.050
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys don't know who we are.</v>

2218
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Well that's exactly what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2219
01:39:11.871 --> 01:39:16.871
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a contest or a battle ground </v>

2220
01:39:16.871 --> 01:39:16.871
<v Speaker 1>and Ideological battle ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:39:16.871 --> 01:39:21.370
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thought that they're making you </v>

2222
01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:21.370
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want you to change.</v>

2223
01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:22.490
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seeN.</v>

2224
01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I saw a video once where people were mad</v>
<v Speaker 1>at me too and they were like,</v>

2225
01:39:25.671 --> 01:39:28.280
<v Speaker 1>he's listening so he's open to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2226
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:33.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm listening because I want to </v>

2227
01:39:33.650 --> 01:39:33.650
<v Speaker 1>hear your perspective like you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2228
01:39:33.650 --> 01:39:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not right.</v>

2229
01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:39.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have our own perspectives </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to change if I change.</v>

2230
01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It's because of the evidence and because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking and careful consideration </v>

2231
01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:44.810
<v Speaker 1>and I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot of thinking.</v>

2232
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot of kale for careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

2233
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's what led me to becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter in the first place.</v>

2234
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:50.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2235
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:52.430
<v Speaker 1>how did you start hunting?</v>

2236
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Stephen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noah took her.</v>

2237
01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I had been thinking about it for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the main reason I've been </v>

2238
01:39:59.080 --> 01:39:59.930
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it was because of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pet videos,</v>

2239
01:40:00.170 --> 01:40:02.630
<v Speaker 1>those fucking horrific factory farming </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

2240
01:40:02.631 --> 01:40:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to eat that.</v>

2241
01:40:04.071 --> 01:40:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want him to be a part of this.</v>

2242
01:40:05.361 --> 01:40:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I want to figure out how to not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started buying grass fed meat and I</v>

2243
01:40:09.321 --> 01:40:13.850
<v Speaker 1>tried to figure out a way to get around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I really started getting very,</v>

2244
01:40:13.851 --> 01:40:16.760
<v Speaker 1>very interested in hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know how to start.</v>

2245
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know where to start and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming a fear factor episode at tone </v>

2246
01:40:21.831 --> 01:40:26.831
<v Speaker 1>ranch says 270,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>acre ranch in the middle of the country </v>

2247
01:40:26.831 --> 01:40:30.491
<v Speaker 1>while middle of the state rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were saying that they have a </v>

2248
01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:33.470
<v Speaker 1>wild pigs there and they would teach you</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they.</v>

2249
01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:38.980
<v Speaker 1>That was something that I had considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I met rinella and when I met </v>

2250
01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:42.761
<v Speaker 1>rinella he took me on a hunt for his tv </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and I shot a mule deer and we ate </v>

2251
01:40:42.761 --> 01:40:43.580
<v Speaker 1>it that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over the fire.</v>

2252
01:40:43.581 --> 01:40:46.060
<v Speaker 1>And I said that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2253
01:40:46.450 --> 01:40:48.180
<v Speaker 1>The quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cool part about hunting is a,</v>

2254
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:50.120
<v Speaker 1>nothing goes to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take,</v>

2255
01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I take the hides to a guide to have them</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>

2256
01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 1>So I've actually made a knife roll</v>

2257
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.350
<v Speaker 2>out of one of the highlights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an apron out of one of the hides.</v>

2258
01:40:56.710 --> 01:40:59.760
<v Speaker 2>My wedding ring has antler in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2259
01:40:59.761 --> 01:41:01.060
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud of that one.</v>

2260
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:02.220
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2261
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:04.750
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I use all the bones to make a stock.</v>

2262
01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:05.920
<v Speaker 2>And then when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2263
01:41:05.921 --> 01:41:10.921
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the cuts and one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to write this book is to teach </v>

2264
01:41:10.921 --> 01:41:13.750
<v Speaker 2>hunters how to use those tough cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite parts of uh,</v>

2265
01:41:13.751 --> 01:41:18.751
<v Speaker 2>of the deer and different animals as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neck and the neck has got all this </v>

2266
01:41:18.751 --> 01:41:22.441
<v Speaker 2>really super flavorful kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>gelatinous meet kind of in between the </v>

2267
01:41:22.441 --> 01:41:22.910
<v Speaker 2>cartilage and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2268
01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:26.020
<v Speaker 2>and you make a stew with that stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is unbelievably tasty.</v>

2269
01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:28.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2270
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I think in a lot of guys when they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

2271
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:35.070
<v Speaker 2>they kind of breast out the birds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they leave the little legs and they </v>

2272
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.070
<v Speaker 2>don't really know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2273
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.890
<v Speaker 2>how to cook the legs of a Turkey or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>duck.</v>

2274
01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:40.890
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one of the reasons why I want </v>

2275
01:41:40.890 --> 01:41:43.111
<v Speaker 2>to write this book and really educate </v>
<v Speaker 2>people how to use those tougher cuts </v>

2276
01:41:43.111 --> 01:41:43.660
<v Speaker 2>that you can be kind of tricky to cook </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

2277
01:41:43.661 --> 01:41:48.661
<v Speaker 2>Nela has a couple of good books on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that he's really </v>

2278
01:41:48.661 --> 01:41:50.750
<v Speaker 2>into his making shanks and also gluco </v>
<v Speaker 2>good brazing.</v>

2279
01:41:50.751 --> 01:41:51.370
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's also,</v>

2281
01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big advocate of not wasting anything.</v>

2282
01:41:55.451 --> 01:41:58.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's into organ meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liver.</v>

2283

<v Speaker 2>I had a Turkey feathers in my little </v>

2285
01:42:05.251 --> 01:42:05.251
<v Speaker 2>boot near,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my wedding day from a Turkey.</v>

01:42:05.251 --> 01:42:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was neat.</v>

2287
01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:10.380
<v Speaker 2>It was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why it's so kind</v>

2288
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:15.390
<v Speaker 2>of crazy that you're the guy that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked on and not the butcher shop </v>

2289
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:18.361
<v Speaker 2>across the street or not some burger </v>
<v Speaker 2>joint down the street that's getting </v>

2290
01:42:18.361 --> 01:42:22.831
<v Speaker 2>factory farmed meat is you do have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and appreciation for the </v>

2291
01:42:22.831 --> 01:42:24.590
<v Speaker 2>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that this ideological battle,</v>

2292
01:42:24.591 --> 01:42:29.591
<v Speaker 2>ground battle ground on their side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't leave any room for forgiving </v>

2293
01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:29.591
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

2294
01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:34.120
<v Speaker 2>there's no room for reasons just you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>either an animal murderer or a year that</v>

2295
01:42:34.330 --> 01:42:37.000
<v Speaker 2>the most amazing person ever because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're vegan,</v>

2296
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:38.150
<v Speaker 2>go vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2297
01:42:38.250 --> 01:42:38.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2298
01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:42.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new thing in terms of first world</v>

2299
01:42:42.791 --> 01:42:44.320
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first world countries.</v>

2300
01:42:44.321 --> 01:42:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean people have been needing </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian dishes forever,</v>

2301
01:42:47.050 --> 01:42:52.050
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of like being ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 2>rabid about your,</v>

2302
01:42:52.710 --> 01:42:53.980

2306
01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:04.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had a lot of support from our </v>

2307
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:07.530
<v Speaker 2>community and Canada and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>international community and we're </v>

2308
01:43:07.530 --> 01:43:10.470
<v Speaker 2>actually getting support from other </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegans and vegetarian people writing to </v>

2309
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.470
