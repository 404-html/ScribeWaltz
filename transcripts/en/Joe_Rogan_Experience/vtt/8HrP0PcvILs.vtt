00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.980
This fucking podcast was brought to you by me leaving the laptop volume on

2
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.820
this podcast.

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Updated Url for audible.com if you go to audible.com forward slash show,

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.620
you will know what I'm about to talk about.

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.670
Ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.750
what am I about to talk about?

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.100
You know what I didn't do the other day,

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.440
the last time my dumb ass did the podcast and did a,

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:31.621
a,

10
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:33.330
an audible add.

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.490
I forgot to say the URL.

12
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.543
No,

13
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.650
I thought I did.

14
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.820
I think I said it at the end right,

15
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.840
but it didn't say at the beginning.

16
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.360
So I instance audible is a,

17
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.194
uh,

18
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470
a very nice customer and uh,

19
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.950
I think they have a great product.

20
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.023
We're going to do it again.

21
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.631
So,

22
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:49.290
um,

23
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.260
audible.com/joe you go and,

24
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.440
uh,

25
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.980
you get audible free for 30 days and you get a free audio book.

26
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.610
Uh,

27
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.050
it's pretty fucking bad ass.

28
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.880
I've been reading this book called sex at dawn and uh,

29
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.200
it's a Duncan Trussell.

30
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.560
Uh,

31
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.311
turned me on to it.

32
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:05.581
This guy,

33
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:06.720
Dr. Christopher Ryan,

34
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.310
we're going to get him in on the podcast.

35
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:08.671
Really,

36
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:13.470
really interesting stuff about how monkeys used to fuck Joe d as in how it

37
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:14.550
turned us into people.

38
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.670
Fascinating edge and Mccain Yourself,

39
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:18.570
ladies and gentlemen,

40
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:20.130
and do it through audible.com.

41
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.460
The beautiful thing about audible is that not only do they have a fuck load of

42
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.780
audio books that you can listen to,

43
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.550
but they also have a thing called whisper sync for the Amazon kindle fire.

44
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.331
And uh,

45
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:34.410
it's amazing what it,

46
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:35.041
what it is,

47
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:36.180
is you read the book,

48
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.250
say if you're reading it on the kindle and then you get in your car,

49
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:39.270
it's syncs up to your phone.

50
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:43.890
So it plays you the audio version read by professional actors.

51
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.670
Incredible.

52
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.320
It syncs up to where you left off.

53
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.050
So if you leave off the beginning of page 34,

54
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.411
boom,

55
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:50.610
that's where it picks up in your car.

56
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.440
It's awesome.

57
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.040
It makes commuting so much better as does podcasting.

58
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:56.791
And you listen,

59
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.750
we hear that from you people all the time and we appreciate the fuck out of it.

60
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.131
We really,

61
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:02.964
really do.

62
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.150
I think Jamie's about the lock the door and he should,

63
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.103
um,

64
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.340
but the uh,

65
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.600
audible.com um,

66
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.730
sponsorship is for me it's a,

67
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:15.180
it's a great one because audible has done a lot to support comedians.

68
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.100
There's a lot of comedy shows and comedy CD's and stuff that's on audible and

69
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:20.791
back in the day,

70
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.760
audible when the Internet was really young,

71
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:26.910
autobot was taking a lot of chances with comedians and like I know they had like

72
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.590
Steve Marr and a couple of other guys,

73
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:32.010
they did like weekly shows that they upload it to audible,

74
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.930
like all the new stuff of the week.

75
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.830
They tried to do like five or 10 minutes of new standup each week and you know,

76
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:38.281
it was a lot,

77
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:39.091
a lot of pressure to do,

78
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.700
to come up with like that kind of material that you'd want recorded.

79
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:43.530
But audible is pretty bad ass.

80
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.801
Uh,

81
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:44.400
I liked that.

82
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.290
audible.com forward slash joke go there,

83
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.130
you get 30 days for free and you get a free audio book.

84
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.080
You fuckers fuckers were also Bhante as always,

85
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:56.430
always buy on it.com.

86
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.550
I'm on at.com makers of supplements,

87
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.730
fitness equipment and even food.

88
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.410
You'd have to lock it yet man,

89
00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:05.244
he's not done.

90
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.450
He's got to fix something.

91
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.393
Um,

92
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.301
if you,

93
00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:09.570
uh,

94
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.291
you go to on it,

95
00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:13.410
you will see all the various new things that we sell.

96
00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:14.200
Include a,

97
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.520
we have Madison balls now and wall balls,

98
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:21.270
these balls you throw up against the wall and these things called steel bells.

99
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.780
They're really awkward and heavy and you pick them up and fucking slam him and

100
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:26.610
throw him battle ropes,

101
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.710
kettlebells and all this stuff that we sell is the type of fitness equipment

102
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.910
that you're seeing.

103
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:35.610
If you're watching like any shows,

104
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.120
uh,

105
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.720
where uh,

106
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.710
you see UFC countdown shows where guys have to do these brutal strength and

107
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:43.890
conditioning workouts in what they're doing by,

108
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.780
there's a lot of guys who don't like doing this stuff.

109
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.350
A lot of guys just like to do their martial arts workouts and,

110
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.191
and that's it.

111
00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:53.100
But the guys who are doing strength and conditioning,

112
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.050
they have a significant advantage.

113
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.071
And that advantage is,

114
00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:57.870
this stuff is fucking brutal,

115
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.320
but it puts your body in incredible shape for work.

116
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.251
If you do,

117
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:03.750
if you can get through a kettle bell workout,

118
00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:06.270
like the Keith Weber Kettle Bell workouts that we sell,

119
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.811
uh,

120
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:07.051
on,

121
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:07.440
on it,

122
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.340
those are the ones that we had talked about for a long ass time before we had

123
00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:13.410
ever gotten them to sell.

124
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.311
There were so good.

125
00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:15.540
I just kept talking about it wasn't,

126
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.740
it wasn't that I was,

127
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:17.340
uh,

128
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.641
you know,

129
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:19.140
trying to court them as a,

130
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:19.861
as a client.

131
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:21.660
I'm just completely being honest.

132
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.270
His Kettle Bell DVD beats my ass.

133
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:27.690
It's called the extreme kettle bell workout cardio workout.

134
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.560
Um,

135
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.000
it's fucking wicked.

136
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.241
I mean,

137
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:33.120
it's the best cardio Kettlebell workout I've ever done.

138
00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:37.140
It's a mother fucking heart attack with a 35 pound kettle bell for real.

139
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.070
It's a heart attack.

140
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.060
It's bad ass.

141
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.781
I love it.

142
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:42.510

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.641
but it's called candy.

170
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.650
Why do you have a fucking button that shuts him off?

171
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.330
Deejaying this,

172
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.650
this button is silly.

173
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.360
That's a silly bitch of a button.

174
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.350
It's just because that we constantly accidentally hit it and we think something

175
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:50.920
more like insane as broke and said,

176
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:53.210
then we're like trying to fix something that doesn't,

177
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.601
yeah.

178
00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:57.020
The podcast was delayed by a solid 20 seconds because I was scrambling to try to

179
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.250
out how to fix that shit.

180
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.271
<v 0>Last night,</v>

181
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.530
a Dj saved man,

182
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.380
Joey Coco Diaz will be joining me and our pal Douglas Stan hope who will also be

183
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:11.210
on the podcast this Saturday afternoon.

184
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.630
And Joey Coco Diaz will be joining me and Doug Stanhope and honey honey band

185
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.140
Friday at the end of the world basically sold out.

186
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.520
There's like single tickets left,

187
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.510
um,

188
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.770
that are scattered around the room.

189
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:26.390
People coming in from all over the world.

190
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.930
We're very excited and we're hoping that if we have a good show,

191
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.310
the world won't actually end.

192
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.780
I think we can keep it together.

193
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.090
I think we can keep this simulation guy that Joe Diaz.

194
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.770
Wait,

195
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.470
thanks.

196
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.370
I hope so brother.

197
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.443
I hope so.

198
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.790
I want it to end so much fun fucking though,

199
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.290
but a lot of things have been happening,

200
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.130
so you know,

201
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.260
we should happen this.

202
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.280
She is so maybe,

203
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.863
yeah,

204
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.550
I don't think it's going to end.

205
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:51.560
I think it's just changed how we'll live in,

206
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.230
there's something that we were talking about before the show,

207
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.040
um,

208
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.550
where,

209
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.120
uh,

210
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.270
there's a page that shows all the various,

211
00:06:59.271 --> 00:06:59.521
I,

212
00:06:59.521 --> 00:06:59.790
I,

213
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.860
I retweeted it.

214
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.190
It shows all these school shootings and what drugs the young kids were on,

215
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.610
whether it was a 14 year olds on Prozac,

216
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.930
Prozac,

217
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.510
whether it's a pack sills,

218
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:15.410
Zoloft.

219
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:16.040
I mean,

220
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.180
it's incredible.

221
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.050
If you look at the history of school shootings from,

222
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.243
you know,

223
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.730
I mean it goes all the way back to 1992 p kids that were on drugs that were in,

224
00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:29.280
in,

225
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.410
in the 1990s,

226
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:31.420
there were putting people on,

227
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.300
on different,

228
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.930
different meds and some of these kids want it being school shooters.

229
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.680
Does that mean the kid wasn't already fucked up and wasn't already really

230
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.820
troubled to begin with?

231
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:44.000
And maybe the fucking drugs kept him from doing something even more horrible

232
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.720
earlier.

233
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.553
I don't know.

234
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.570
But you've got to look at this.

235
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.560
This thing is crazy.

236
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:52.070
It's like 2008 school shooting Paxil withdrawal,

237
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.540
but PROZAC withdrawal rather.

238
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.190
Um,

239
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.370
2008,

240
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:57.140
PROZAC and Paxil,

241
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.580
Zoloft,

242
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.280
Zoloft Med for depression meds for depression.

243
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:01.941
Medford pressure,

244
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:02.774
withdrawal,

245
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.400
antidepressant,

246
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.381
Zoloft,

247
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:07.340
antidepressant,

248
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:08.151
antidepressant,

249
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:10.130
and this is like each school shooting.

250
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.580
Each one of these kids is on one of these fucking things.

251
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.280
SSRI meds for depression,

252
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:17.110
antidepressant.

253
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.431
I mean I'm,

254
00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:20.630
I'm reading off like virtually every school shooting.

255
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.070
I mean this is a fucking carets he situation.

256
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.490
If every one of those shooters is on psych meds,

257
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.481
does that,

258
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:31.520
does that mean that the psych meds are causing it?

259
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.000
No.

260
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.241
No.

261
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:33.590
That doesn't mean that it doesn't,

262
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.260
but what it does mean is that you got it.

263
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.700
You're dealing with some very fucked up people,

264
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.960
which we know by the results,

265
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.380
but that that connection should at least be investigated and that needs to be,

266
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:47.720
we need to understand what the fuck is going on,

267
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:50.840
even if it's only a small percentage of the population who have these psychotic

268
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:51.590
episodes.

269
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.620
How many people have like very similar thoughts and don't act?

270
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:56.250
How many people

271
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.190
<v 3>have like extreme feelings of detachment and don't report it?</v>

272
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.340
What is that map showed that people that aren't,

273
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.670
are not on anything.

274
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.860
Also like you're like no prescription medicine.

275
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.001
Oh,

276
00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:10.001
this one is just all of the different school shootings that were connected to,

277
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.560
uh,

278
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.430
to kids on drugs.

279
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.301
Let's go with that though.

280
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.210
That's a really good point.

281
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.230
If it was like 90% not on something.

282
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.050
Yeah.

283
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.680
Well I don't think so because there would have to be truly shootings.

284
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.510
There's so many in the,

285
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:22.590
in the PROZAC ones,

286
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:22.891
it's like,

287
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:23.161
come on.

288
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:24.180
How many have there been?

289
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.840
There's so many in,

290
00:09:25.841 --> 00:09:27.180
in the a antidepressant.

291
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:28.770
When school shootings from kids,

292
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.210
not on antidepressants.

293
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.511
Joey,

294
00:09:30.511 --> 00:09:32.070
did you have a lot of people in your,

295
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.520
your school growing up like that brought guns or did you ever have anything like

296
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.383
that

297
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.090
<v 4>thinking I was just thinking about Joe's age because I wanted to ask Joe a</v>

298
00:09:41.091 --> 00:09:41.511
question.

299
00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:42.380
When you wanted the eighth,

300
00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:42.921
seventh,

301
00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:43.754
and sixth grade,

302
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.780
if a kid went to the meds office to take meds and the date,

303
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:49.340
then we all told he was fucking crazy.

304
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.820
It was crazy when I was a kid.

305
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.270
I never heard of all of these pills to lately.

306
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.231
Me Personally,

307
00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:58.220
when a parent tells me,

308
00:09:58.221 --> 00:09:59.600
I think kids on something,

309
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.310
I want to smack the parent.

310
00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:01.850
But again,

311
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.870
it's none of my business.

312
00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:04.130
How you raise your child.

313
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.570
I have my own problems.

314
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:06.973
But uh,

315
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.911
you're given these,

316
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:08.750
like I told Joe,

317
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:13.340
you're giving these kids pills and it really is because you're not working on

318
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:13.940
parenting.

319
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.020
You're cutting yourself short.

320
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:16.730
You're bit whenever the fuck it is.

321
00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:17.840
Your kid needs attention.

322
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.740
Somebody told me that with children you have to put the time in now or if not,

323
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:23.120
you have to put the time in later.

324
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.440
And he goes,

325
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.520
when he had his daughters,

326
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.331
both his daughters,

327
00:10:26.331 --> 00:10:27.530
he was very involved.

328
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:28.430
You know,

329
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.380
we sit and talk like men on this podcast.

330
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.540
After the situation on Friday,

331
00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:33.374
I read everybody.

332
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.640
I didn't say anything on Twitter,

333
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:35.474
on Facebook.

334
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.750
I'm not one of those peoples can let's talk shit because I don't know what the

335
00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:39.470
fuck's going on.

336
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.303
I wasn't there.

337
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.240
But I will tell you where I was between the ages of seven and 10 my mother was

338
00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:47.090
married to a very violent men,

339
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.980
not towards me or my mother,

340
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.720
but he was very violent.

341
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.261
I he,

342
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:53.720
I seen him shoot somebody in the leg when I was eight.

343
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.710
Shoot,

344
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:55.770
not hear about it.

345
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.161
Knocked the,

346
00:10:56.161 --> 00:10:57.680
somebody told me I shoot him,

347
00:10:57.681 --> 00:10:58.640
throw to wicked,

348
00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:01.430
beaten some people and I seen him stab but few people,

349
00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:03.320
his weapon of choice was having a knife.

350
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.880
Do you know when I was eight Joe,

351
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.790
I had to live in,

352
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.291
I had,

353
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.840
my mother had that big house with the bedroom,

354
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.980
but she made my bedroom.

355
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.920
They had it and I was very scared of sleeping up there and I would throw a

356
00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:16.460
tantrum like any other child who eight or seven you have children were scared.

357
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:17.440
We heard the Boogie man,

358
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.091
if you not,

359
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:19.230
this guy used to give me a gumball.

360
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:23.650
The silence when you were an eight give me a gun with the silence and Sunday

361
00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:24.411
ain't no spirits.

362
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:25.221
If you see a spirit,

363
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:29.120
you shoot him and I put the thing down next to him and I go to bed and he'd come

364
00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:31.700
up in the morning before my mother come up and they go give me the gun back,

365
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.180
<v 3>give him the gun with the fucking silence.</v>

366
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.920
I've been ashamed to tell this story,

367
00:11:38.921 --> 00:11:41.140
but I have to admit you ever seen me fucking,

368
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.580
you ever see me with a weapon?

369
00:11:42.581 --> 00:11:43.061
A knife,

370
00:11:43.061 --> 00:11:43.361
a gun?

371
00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:44.050
It's crazy.

372
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:44.530
You read,

373
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.040
man.

374
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.430
Have I ever taken away to me in a way?

375
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:46.670
A minute.

376
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.101
Wait a minute.

377
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:47.934
Wait a minute though.

378
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.870
Wasn't there a Jay Morris situation?

379
00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:50.650
Yeah.

380
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:50.831
Yeah,

381
00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:51.910
but I didn't have a gun.

382
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.580
You told him you had no,

383
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.160
I had a gun

384
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.120
<v 4>three doors away,</v>

385
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.930
but I didn't have it on me.

386
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.200
But I still have that gun.

387
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.850
Was it what happened in that?

388
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.590
It doesn't matter what what,

389
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:03.760
what I'm putting doesn't matter.

390
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.860
I don't know what I'm talking about.

391
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.830
It's a great story.

392
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.750
You've never ever seen me.

393
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.700
You know I never snapped one had a double o seven rife.

394
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:13.720
Which your generation,

395
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:17.830
remember I remember those nights like a buck knife we'll fucking wouldn't handle

396
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:17.950
it.

397
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.090
Actually said double seven double oh seven when he carried in his fucking

398
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:24.930
painter's pants in the 70s when you wore a paint,

399
00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:25.990
this pants wasn't,

400
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:27.310
doesn't mean that you were a painter.

401
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.260
It means you were back and fucking a knife.

402
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:30.970
That would stab your fucking throat off.

403
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.151
Well,

404
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:34.270
if you're in Arizona and you see a gentleman with a fanny pack with a fanny pack

405
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:35.104
is a gun in that,

406
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.943
oh my God.

407
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.640
You know,

408
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.430
especially if he's got like his shirt tucked into his pants.

409
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.130
I was raised around weapons from that age.

410
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:46.030
I was raised around drugs and that 15 whatever.

411
00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:49.840
I had a bad situation that happened in my house and I was still connected with

412
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:50.800
weapons or whatever.

413
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.671
You know what?

414
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:54.670
It never gave me the urge you to take a weapon and shoot somebody or whatever.

415
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.740
As angry as I was at the world.

416
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.700
But I guarantee if I had thrown some kind of drug on me at the age of 12 and 13

417
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.010
I would have possibly been able to do something like that.

418
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.410
So there's different variables here,

419
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:08.621
Joe.

420
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.970
I was raised around weapons.

421
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.240
So for them to say it's a weapons fought breaks my fucking heart.

422
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:14.074
That's not fair.

423
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.050
I was raised around weapons and I'm unstable.

424
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.750
We've all agreed on that situation in a fucking room.

425
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:20.950
So I,

426
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:21.880
when I hear that shit,

427
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:22.750
it breaks my heart.

428
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.240
So do you think that it's possible,

429
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:28.480
like you've been in altered states of consciousness where you went on benders

430
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:30.490
and you weren't in the right frame of mind?

431
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.941
You know,

432
00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:35.830
could you imagine that some of these people could be on something that really

433
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:37.830
sort of disconnects them with the,

434
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:42.100
the normal every day feelings that we all have?

435
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:42.281
I mean,

436
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:47.140
we don't understand what the real developmental effects of a lot of these things

437
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:47.620
are.

438
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.400
We have vague ideas of whether or not it's quote unquote helping people,

439
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.740
but there's not a lot known about the longterm effects of raising young people

440
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:58.900
on these types of medications is,

441
00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:01.600
there hasn't been hundreds of years of research done on it.

442
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.021
You know,

443
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:06.310
there hasn't been a lot of anecdotal evidence has been studied and carefully

444
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:06.881
reviewed.

445
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:10.450
There's a lot of people pushing shit on kids just to calm the fuck down and

446
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:13.120
they're not exactly sure what the repercussions are going to be when that guy

447
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.280
turns 25 18 one not stable.

448
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.500
We want to stay with Joseph.

449
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.401
I know you weren't.

450
00:14:17.401 --> 00:14:17.591
I know.

451
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:18.281
I definitely was.

452
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:19.114
I don't know about red man.

453
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.740
I got super lucky man.

454
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.350
I told him I could've gone down some really bad roads,

455
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:25.990
but I found martial arts at a really early age,

456
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:26.650
so we're not,

457
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.130
by the time I was 15 I was completely obsessed with martial arts.

458
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:35.131
That's all I did with my time and I watch all these kids around me like

459
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:39.550
thrashing around trying to find their place in the world and not having anything

460
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:41.560
that tests and we're defines them.

461
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.450
And I realized very early on that it was really lucky to find the martial arts

462
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:50.260
and even though martial arts consumed me to the point where I paid very little

463
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:51.480
attention to schoolwork,

464
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.050
I didn't

465
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.290
<v 0>give a fuck about schoolwork.</v>

466
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.580
Dude.

467
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.510
I didn't give a fuck.

468
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:54.990
I was,

469
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.890
I had nightmares that I was going to fail and have to go back because in my

470
00:14:58.891 --> 00:15:00.140
nightmares I was trying to figure out what they are.

471
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:02.430
I'll get back at all whether I'd just tell him to go fuck themselves.

472
00:15:02.431 --> 00:15:05.430
I thought about telling them to go fuck themselves when I was 16 because I heard

473
00:15:05.431 --> 00:15:07.380
that you can quit school when you were 16.

474
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.891
I'm like,

475
00:15:07.891 --> 00:15:10.260
what am I getting out of this that I can't get out of books.

476
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:10.891
This is,

477
00:15:10.891 --> 00:15:11.830
this is not the guy,

478
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.661
I guess socially.

479
00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:13.570
Am I getting something out of it?

480
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.480
I was trying to analyze it myself,

481
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.160
but I barely paid attention.

482
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.450
All I gave a fuck was training.

483
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.400
That's all I cared about.

484
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.273
I quit.

485
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.240
Did you quit?

486
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.930
What year was it?

487
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:22.763
My senior year.

488
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.251
He just said,

489
00:15:23.251 --> 00:15:23.760
fuck it.

490
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.451
<v 4>I had to quit.</v>

491
00:15:24.451 --> 00:15:26.970
I needed to make a living and then I ended up going back like in,

492
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:27.990
uh,

493
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.540
January.

494
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.070
I felt really bad about quitting.

495
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.130
Did you get a GED or a diploma?

496
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.950
They fucking,

497
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:33.330
uh,

498
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.530
that was too political.

499
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.090
John was in my hometown,

500
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.910
so the one political John was on that pushed me.

501
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.490
The other political John wanted me the fuck out of that.

502
00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:43.620
So by the time I got back in,

503
00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:45.240
the other political Jonathan was in and they said,

504
00:15:45.241 --> 00:15:46.830
I miss graduating by credit.

505
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.670
I had no reason to walk down and get a graduate anyway cause I had no family

506
00:15:50.671 --> 00:15:52.680
that I didn't give a fuck about a diploma,

507
00:15:52.681 --> 00:15:53.730
shaking somebody's hand.

508
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.710
But it was important to me to get a diploma.

509
00:15:55.711 --> 00:15:59.580
That was a credit short and they tried to give me like a credit for football,

510
00:15:59.581 --> 00:16:00.930
but they said it wasn't counting.

511
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.730
So I ended up having to go to summer school.

512
00:16:02.731 --> 00:16:07.110
I told him to suck my dick and I got a GED in Colorado and then went to fucking

513
00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:07.501
school.

514
00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:08.440
And you know,

515
00:16:08.441 --> 00:16:11.340
it didn't really matter to a college anyway,

516
00:16:11.341 --> 00:16:12.930
so it really doesn't fucking matter to me.

517
00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:13.764
It was a,

518
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.371
<v 0>yeah,</v>

519
00:16:14.371 --> 00:16:17.890
if you can get into a community college and show good grades and then you can

520
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.020
get into a better college.

521
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:21.930
But at that age I thought that quit and high school was the beginning of the yet

522
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.720
at that age I really thought I was going to,

523
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.550
I did too.

524
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.060
I thought it was,

525
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:26.940
I went to college.

526
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.340
The whole reason I went to college was to,

527
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.140
so that people didn't think I was a loser.

528
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.800
It's the whole reason 100% so that I could say I'm going to college.

529
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.390
I had no,

530
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.330
no business there because again,

531
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.090
it was like,

532
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.520
that was when I was 18 and all I was thinking of most competing.

533
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.383
That's all I was doing.

534
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.141
I was obsessed.

535
00:16:43.141 --> 00:16:43.800
I was not,

536
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.190
I'm not,

537
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.680
I was not good at like doing a bunch of different things.

538
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.580
You know,

539
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.840
like if I had a girlfriend,

540
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.740
like one of my province was my first girlfriend in high school.

541
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.850
When I first started banging,

542
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.580
I cease and desist at all of their activities.

543
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:56.960
I mean,

544
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.020
you all do everything.

545
00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.010
Yeah.

546
00:16:59.010 --> 00:16:59.190
Yeah.

547
00:16:59.190 --> 00:16:59.671
But nothing,

548
00:16:59.671 --> 00:17:00.810
I didn't do anything else.

549
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:01.280
I'll just hang.

550
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.740
I was obsessed and hanging around with this car.

551
00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:05.430
I think I left back in the seventh grade for it because I fucking,

552
00:17:05.431 --> 00:17:06.264
I'm that stupid.

553
00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:07.590
No,

554
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.620
the fucking monkey drove me fucking nuts.

555
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:10.454
A monkey.

556
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:11.070
I know.

557
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:11.970
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

558
00:17:11.971 --> 00:17:12.331
Go ahead.

559
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:13.164
So what happened?

560
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.011
Did you quit everything?

561
00:17:14.011 --> 00:17:14.844
Karate.

562
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:16.920
I quit talking to me for months,

563
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.521
for months.

564
00:17:17.521 --> 00:17:18.354
I didn't train.

565
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.590
And then I finally,

566
00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:21.540
I don't know whether I got tired of fucking her or,

567
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:21.840
you know,

568
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.280
I just came to my senses.

569
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.100
I got back there and started training again and then,

570
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.670
and then I became obsessed with that again and not as much her.

571
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.850
Was that your first love,

572
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.440
that same broad or yeah.

573
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:31.771
Yeah,

574
00:17:31.771 --> 00:17:32.281
definitely.

575
00:17:32.281 --> 00:17:34.980
That was my first love to the one that fucked me up completely.

576
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.180
Well I had two,

577
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.430
two at the same time during that period of time,

578
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.350
like a,

579
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.080
a sort of an on and off situation when one of them wouldn't work out.

580
00:17:43.081 --> 00:17:46.980
Then the other one would somehow or another magically like wind up being single

581
00:17:46.981 --> 00:17:47.761
at the same time.

582
00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:49.950
Like went for like a couple of went back and forth.

583
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.120
<v 4>But one was like,</v>

584
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:51.390
Whoa,

585
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.040
I was way closer to one than the other.

586
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.240
One was actually really cool.

587
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.074
She's pretty smart,

588
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.810
interesting check from a single mom.

589
00:17:57.811 --> 00:17:58.321
She had like,

590
00:17:58.321 --> 00:17:58.770
she was,

591
00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.640
she was interesting.

592
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.450
She was smart,

593
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.283
you know,

594
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.041
and she was,

595
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:02.790
um,

596
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.230
she went on to be,

597
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:04.770
uh,

598
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.320
like sports for the government or some shit like that.

599
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.170
So she did some computer work for the government.

600
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.870
Forget what we were looking at early twenties and she was explaining to me what

601
00:18:13.871 --> 00:18:14.460
she does.

602
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:14.821
It's very,

603
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:15.420
very,

604
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:15.900
you know,

605
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.930
very interesting to like be in touch with someone from the time he knew them

606
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.931
when you were 14 he just fingering each other and jerking each other off too.

607
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.610
Like all of a sudden she like works for the government,

608
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.470
you know a grown up human being.

609
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:29.191
It's like all right.

610
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:32.640
I guess we're a real live adults now but with the one I was in love with,

611
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:35.610
I used to go roll this game with her and shit on the weekends and we were

612
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:36.444
holding hands.

613
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.170
It wouldn't give me the push and she just let me dry it up.

614
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.550
Dry humping earth,

615
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:43.370
wind and fire every fucking after though.

616
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.110
But she was in love with Donny Osmond but I was going to have the show with

617
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:47.850
marina on Friday nights.

618
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:48.620
I was going to fuck.

619
00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.453
Donnie has husband done,

620
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.820
but that was my competition.

621
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.370
Then when she realized you couldn't have Donny Osmond,

622
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:56.370
she let me give it a little tap and it's set me off dog.

623
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.680
It's amazing that I never got this girl pregnant.

624
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.380
We didn't use any birth control.

625
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.420
We're just pulling out.

626
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.650
I was like,

627
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.483
you know,

628
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.040
15 or 16 or something like that and we fucked all,

629
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.641
<v 3>hey,</v>

630
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:09.530
we fucked pampering.

631
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.373
Dang.

632
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.970
If there was some isolation,

633
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:13.500
we were fucking while she was on and be like,

634
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.191
what do you think that is?

635
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:16.680
Cause there's a lot of times where it's like that where it's like,

636
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:17.760
fuck you got lucky.

637
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.010
You got lucky.

638
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.280
We'll see of acid

639
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.030
savage ass.

640
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.301
No,

641
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:25.134
I wasn't eating ass

642
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.070
first of all back then it wasn't the same because ass was like herring.

643
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.741
There was like,

644
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:32.730
you know you went to,

645
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:33.750
if you went down on a girl,

646
00:19:33.751 --> 00:19:35.100
like there's fucking hair everywhere.

647
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:35.520
No,

648
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.750
nobody did anything about it.

649
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.680
They didn't trim it.

650
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.730
They just let it go.

651
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:40.250
It was California Bananas,

652
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.461
Dude.

653
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:46.140
I dated a girl when I was in my really early twenties and I took her pants off

654
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:47.460
and I was just shocked.

655
00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:48.870
I was flabbergasted.

656
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:49.381
I was like,

657
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:51.000
how could you just leave it like that?

658
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:51.750
Like there was red,

659
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.760
she was Italian and it was ridiculous.

660
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.980
It was an asshole to pussy all the way up to the size of the thighs.

661
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.510
It was just chaos.

662
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.870
It was unbelievable chaos between that pussy,

663
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.250
that ass little Wang.

664
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.300
It smells like a garlic hot dog.

665
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.370
Why is that repulsive?

666
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.263
I love it.

667
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.750
But what is it about like asshole hair and all that stuff that's gross.

668
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.740
What is it about that?

669
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:19.500
But it is girls shave their legs,

670
00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:20.334
you know,

671
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.193
girls aren't having hair.

672
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.830
All of it thought it was disgusting.

673
00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:26.850
When you eat that pussy and it's swampy and his hair is shit all over your

674
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:27.780
fucking face.

675
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:28.614
I'm telling you,

676
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.390
someone said that women started shaving their legs during World War Two because

677
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:34.440
that's when they,

678
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:34.800
um,

679
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.330
they were running out of panty hose.

680
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.410
Does that make any sense?

681
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:38.400
Yeah,

682
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.120
kind of.

683
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.350
That doesn't make any sense to me.

684
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.060
When did women start shaving their legs?

685
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:44.820
As soon as they realize that men would fuck them harder if they didn't have hair

686
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:45.654
on their legs.

687
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.440
Right?

688
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.273
Yeah.

689
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.533
Gas.

690
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.040
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

691
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.040
I don't mind a little not you know,

692
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.030
right pussy but the worst is like there's so many things going on like yeast

693
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:56.440
infections and things like that.

694
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.370
<v 3>Girls you date and Sonia,</v>

695
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.220
you know we're used to infections come from and one of the big,

696
00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:03.260
one of the big reasons why I'm asked to vagina.

697
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.550
There's a little of that and there's all that's actually more dangerous cause

698
00:21:07.551 --> 00:21:08.450
that's like ECO law.

699
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.970
You can have like real problems like you could die,

700
00:21:10.971 --> 00:21:14.300
you can have like Septic Cosa brought out from the inside.

701
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.930
What I was going to say is it's from other dudes shooting loads into the same

702
00:21:17.931 --> 00:21:18.290
hole.

703
00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:18.740
Really?

704
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.320
Yup.

705
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320
Oh yeah.

706
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.130
It's nature letting you know she's a skank.

707
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:22.701
Wow.

708
00:21:22.701 --> 00:21:25.310
It does happen with some girls for whatever reason.

709
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.310
It's like a warning sign that you know those,

710
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.000
those loads of battling to the death in there and as they're battling to the

711
00:21:32.001 --> 00:21:32.571
death in there,

712
00:21:32.571 --> 00:21:34.980
she gets like some sort of a weird sort of a

713
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:35.401
<v 2>back to,</v>

714
00:21:35.401 --> 00:21:35.641
you know,

715
00:21:35.641 --> 00:21:36.474
men,

716
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.890
men can get yeast infections.

717
00:21:37.891 --> 00:21:42.891
Also I found out and I felt like I was googling it to see if I had one once and

718
00:21:43.711 --> 00:21:44.190
then it's like,

719
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.311
oh,

720
00:21:44.311 --> 00:21:45.780
you could just use doctor Scholls.

721
00:21:45.781 --> 00:21:46.800
You know if you're a guy,

722
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.640
so like if you can use like foot spray on it to kill it if you're a guy,

723
00:21:50.641 --> 00:21:52.810
but don't do it if you're a girl because you have to spray it inside.

724
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.283
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

725
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.770
I have fucked women from every aspect of life.

726
00:21:56.771 --> 00:21:59.980
What I'm saying is like Baus Coke fucking hole.

727
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:01.260
It's coke.

728
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.800
You know airplanes.

729
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:07.120
You know we've gotten a big suck this comedians after clubs and fuck them with

730
00:22:07.121 --> 00:22:07.954
no condoms.

731
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.033
I'll tell you what,

732
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.300
I never got a disease.

733
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:13.060
You know I got diseases from college girls.

734
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.120
Those are the filthiest little motherfuckers up there,

735
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.860
those little cake going,

736
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.810
I get fucked and they don't remember fuck's.

737
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.230
Those are the filthy mother fuckers.

738
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.800
I got that chlamydia shit when you had that yoga coming out of here and then I

739
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:34.801
gave it to the chick [inaudible] when I was 28 I called from a waitress at the

740
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:37.210
broker joker.

741
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:40.660
Why was a a a comic that I was the House Mc on Tuesdays.

742
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.560
Where is it then?

743
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:42.070
Bolga there.

744
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.120
That's why I started comedy.

745
00:22:43.121 --> 00:22:43.941
It's called the broker.

746
00:22:43.941 --> 00:22:45.280
The broker in all right.

747
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:49.020
They used to have the broker joker and on Wednesday nights it was spot Tucson

748
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.230
that was sponsored by,

749
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.060
what was the other beer in the nineties?

750
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:52.894
Beside uh,

751
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.940
uh,

752
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.190
Heineken Germany?

753
00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.361
No,

754
00:22:55.361 --> 00:22:55.780
no.

755
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.360
Jack's Beck's Beck's comedy night.

756
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.270
So the banks would give me a dude.

757
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.230
It fell off back to yet they were fucked.

758
00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:04.123
They made me the house

759
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.730
and I banged her in the fucking and I banged her first for like a year.

760
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.350
I was in love with this college chick.

761
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.880
I kept getting itches.

762
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.030
This chick had more fucking diseases when they ain't got to eat that little

763
00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:19.840
monkey.

764
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.660
And you could see like with the chlamydia leaked that a monkey in the dry paint

765
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.960
after you paid it and the fucking monkey just dries on the wall and shit like

766
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:29.590
that.

767
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.850
I looked at and I didn't even go to the doctor either.

768
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.060
That time I got clean.

769
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.220
I didn't know til years later I asked somebody what happened to like idiot,

770
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.420
there's nobody died.

771
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:38.010
You know what I'm saying?

772
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.830
I'm going to the doctor in those days I was 28 no,

773
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.950
too busy slinging thing.

774
00:23:41.951 --> 00:23:42.761
What did they do for you?

775
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:46.180
They give you a shot at these cause your body fight off if you don't talk about

776
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.500
mania.

777
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:46.940
Yeah,

778
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.450
I don't know.

779
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.200
I don't know.

780
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.370
That's way to get a doctor.

781
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:50.360
I didn't go to the doctor.

782
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:53.660
I didn't find out till years later when I was embarrassed and I ask somebody

783
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:54.411
coked up and said,

784
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:55.244
listen,

785
00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.210
when you get that little white yoga that comes out of the middle level that

786
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.120
though like it's chlamydia or some shit like,

787
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.400
oh see I thought they were,

788
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.680
because I had the word Clinton it.

789
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.570
You couldn't get it.

790
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.490
<v 1>That's Ohio suburbs.</v>

791
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.330
14 year old science.

792
00:24:15.331 --> 00:24:16.060
It's saying

793
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.270
<v 5>penis dribbles or something like that.</v>

794
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.450
You can't like if you have a vagina,

795
00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:24.451
you couldn't get [inaudible] dot com the Korean roommate that when she went to

796
00:24:26.171 --> 00:24:27.490
New York gave me something too,

797
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.290
but that was the very disease.

798
00:24:29.291 --> 00:24:30.130
I was like a rash.

799
00:24:30.131 --> 00:24:30.321
We,

800
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:32.770
I just scratched my fucking skin off my nut sack.

801
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.880
And what'd you do about that?

802
00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.890
I had at that time I had to go to pharmacy and he goes,

803
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:36.724
don't you need help?

804
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.890
So how do I do in pharmacy and pull your Dick out?

805
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.071
No,

806
00:24:39.071 --> 00:24:39.700
I showed him

807
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.533
<v 1>nuts.</v>

808
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.273
You know what?

809
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.290
Cvs is completely different than here.

810
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.421
<v 5>Oh,</v>

811
00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:49.254
the bio.

812
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.290
This is in north boulder by the hospice.

813
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:52.124
So you go

814
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.123
take a look at my notes.

815
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.111
I knew the dude,

816
00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:57.180
I know he started blows.

817
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.750
I would bring him a rock from time to time,

818
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.250
like free medical advice.

819
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.511
So fuck it.

820
00:25:01.511 --> 00:25:04.570
That was so you showed him your balls and he said you've got to go to the doctor

821
00:25:04.571 --> 00:25:05.530
and get like a cream.

822
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.510
So I went to the doctor in Bolton.

823
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.550
I told him the truth that I got it from and they go,

824
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.520
what did he say was some skin disease?

825
00:25:12.521 --> 00:25:14.350
Something in like the ring warmth.

826
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.890
Uh,

827
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:15.723
cousin.

828
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.140
Whoa Pussy.

829
00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:17.974
Ringworm.

830
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:18.791
Ringworm.

831
00:25:18.791 --> 00:25:21.810
When I was a kid from playing in the weeds and Jersey dirty.

832
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.300
That's unprecedented.

833
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.710
So that's a dark,

834
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.170
dark itching getting that sack.

835
00:25:29.171 --> 00:25:30.510
That won't go the fuck away.

836
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.160
You rip that motherfucker up part dog.

837
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:33.461
Yeah,

838
00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:35.890
I knew a lot about a ringworm because of Jujitsu.

839
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.491
If you're,

840
00:25:36.491 --> 00:25:37.650
if you're getting ringworm,

841
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.220
<v 0>here's one thing you don't want to do.</v>

842
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.290
Don't use antibacterial soap.

843
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.060
You've gotta be real careful about that shit.

844
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.880
When you use antibacterial soap,

845
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.640
it's okay if you're going to like do operations on people and Shit,

846
00:25:48.641 --> 00:25:52.900
but the issue with antibacterial soap is it kills all the good bacteria in your

847
00:25:52.901 --> 00:25:53.710
body too.

848
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:54.491
So you support this.

849
00:25:54.491 --> 00:25:58.270
There's a company called defense soap and they make this soap that has all

850
00:25:58.271 --> 00:26:00.430
natural oils like tea tree oil,

851
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.630
eucalyptus oil,

852
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.780
all like natural oils that keep the bad shit from growing but help the healthy

853
00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:08.200
shit.

854
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.100
It's all like,

855
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:10.630
it promotes good flora,

856
00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:11.710
good skin flora,

857
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:12.770
but that's fine.

858
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.170
<v 5>Well like Kaka it for your fucking skin.</v>

859
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.490
Takapuna shut juice.

860
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:18.300
You fucking drank a couple of Jujitsu

861
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.060
back into the probiotics.

862
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.923
In fact,

863
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.000
that's a probiotic off the list.

864
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:26.341
That's another,

865
00:26:26.341 --> 00:26:26.560
yeah,

866
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.131
<v 0>biotic.</v>

867
00:26:27.131 --> 00:26:30.520
They say you could actually like Sauerkraut and yet like certain types of

868
00:26:30.521 --> 00:26:31.354
Sauerkraut,

869
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.790
like for vegans or people don't want to eat animal products.

870
00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:35.470
They can get probiotics that way,

871
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.290
but you know,

872
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:36.940
they're just,

873
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.340
it's like what size animal you're not allowed to eat.

874
00:26:39.341 --> 00:26:42.130
Cause at a certain point in time you're eating some fucking live in fungus.

875
00:26:42.131 --> 00:26:43.030
You're eating some little,

876
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.460
some little microbes

877
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.660
<v 4>there that are running around.</v>

878
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.120
I guess they can't cry since they can't cry.

879
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:50.850
You're allowed to eat them like you're allowed to eat ants.

880
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:51.743
If you're a Vegan.

881
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.200
Can you have like chocolate covered ants?

882
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.930
Probably not living thing.

883
00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.220
Hmm.

884
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:56.910
Aunts,

885
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.290
no microbes.

886
00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:58.830
Yes.

887
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:59.970
You're allowed to eat the microbes.

888
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.830
You can eat living things if you're gonna,

889
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:03.180
if you're gonna have probiotics,

890
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.560
you got to eat something that's alive.

891
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.940
It just can't complain.

892
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.260
So you just fucking eat it.

893
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.660
<v 2>You know they sell bugs.</v>

894
00:27:08.661 --> 00:27:11.270
Now Abercrombie or know urban outfitters,

895
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.410
you know the clothing store,

896
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.840
they have like chocolate covered bugs that you can buy.

897
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:15.141
Like what?

898
00:27:15.141 --> 00:27:17.760
You know how you're waiting to check out and have like all that shit that you,

899
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.370
they want you to buy at the last second,

900
00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:19.730
you know.

901
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.031
So that's,

902
00:27:20.031 --> 00:27:22.490
cause they figured they'd made you retarded from that spray.

903
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.550
They're spraying and that plays to keep it stinks.

904
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.550
Know you're thinking Abercrombie,

905
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.753
urban outfitters,

906
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.670
urban outfitters is different.

907
00:27:28.671 --> 00:27:32.000
Like Abercrombie is the one where that music super loud and it has like a stupid

908
00:27:32.001 --> 00:27:33.110
Cologne smell everywhere.

909
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.920
<v 4>Gay guys all over the wall,</v>

910
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:40.020
they're like hugging girls and they all have perfect hair and it smells so bad.

911
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.950
Like that place is you ever go to Ambercrombie offense and be ever rope you in.

912
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.270
So that's what happens when you have daughters.

913
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:47.010
Someone needs to go into Abercrombie and it's like,

914
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.960
it's like going into this conch cows.

915
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:49.853
That's what it's like.

916
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:50.371
It's like,

917
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:50.880
you know,

918
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.290
someone's got to clean up the skunk shit.

919
00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:52.861
I'll do it.

920
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:53.101
All right,

921
00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:53.551
I'll do it.

922
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:57.540
Like you're going into an area where you know you can only last a certain amount

923
00:27:57.541 --> 00:27:58.200
of time.

924
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.501
Okay.

925
00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:00.330
If you go into the gap or whatever,

926
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.650
going to buy a pair of Levi's,

927
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.280
you can sit down in that store for an hour and read a book if you had to,

928
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.440
but you go into that Abercrombie and Fitch,

929
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.720
that mother fucker is toxic gas.

930
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.050
It's all stinky smells and it's a stinky smell.

931
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:14.170
It's not good for you.

932
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.013
Seriously.

933
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.900
It's like it's like a Glendale 24 hour fitness locker room.

934
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.010
Is that how they do it?

935
00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.540
Is that I'm a fucking do it.

936
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.170
How they want to do it is that they're going on purpose.

937
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:26.430
I asked this girl was working there.

938
00:28:26.431 --> 00:28:26.910
I go,

939
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.260
why do you keep spraying that stuff?

940
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:28.501
She goes,

941
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:29.221
they make us,

942
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:32.670
they make us every like on the hour you have to walk around and spray this shit.

943
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.960
Whoever owns that store is more raw.

944
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.820
The advantages of being two weeks.

945
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.860
You don't have to go to this place and no,

946
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:45.170
I don't have my size and any of those fucking so where do you go to church?

947
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:46.840
You a specialist.

948
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:48.811
You know what bro?

949
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:49.840
You can not.

950
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.480
You don't know what you're buying anymore until you bought.

951
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.450
You'd like something you buy,

952
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:55.284
you try it on.

953
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.550
Sometimes I'll get a pair of pants and then 42 they fucking fit.

954
00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.560
Sometimes 42 don't go around my leg.

955
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.840
It depends whether the two European cod or it's an American car.

956
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.960
I bought clothes when I go to Tennessee,

957
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.300
everything fucking fits in Tennessee.

958
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:11.130
They make the clothes smaller.

959
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.601
So do you follow him?

960
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:13.530
Say Anything in Tennessee?

961
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:16.350
I fit in a one X.

962
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.351
Oh really?

963
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:19.960
That's interesting because there's a lot of big people and take the people to

964
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.810
make double x little bit bag rager.

965
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.770
So when you go home and mom La Loche thank and Cida blacks,

966
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.570
it's the outlets like Macy's.

967
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:30.781
Okay.

968
00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:33.720
When you go to Macy's here and you see a two x,

969
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.040
you'll put it on anyway,

970
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.383
it's breathing.

971
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.940
I go to Houston and get that same two x.

972
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.650
It's a fucking three X.

973
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.680
Right?

974
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.530
So it's very weird.

975
00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.050
Largely across the country.

976
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.390
Who has the biggest people?

977
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.880
Doesn't it was the fattest.

978
00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:51.420
It's between Houston and Dallas blessing.

979
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.570
How can you fucking be skinny in a town where the breakfast is?

980
00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:57.160
Those fucking hot dogs and a bunny.

981
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.640
You can't lose because I could listen as a stoner.

982
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.580
I don't give a fuck what type of fitness you're and you got to stop over there

983
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:04.240
once a week.

984
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.691
I'll tell you why.

985
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:08.200
When you go to Texas and you fucking sit down and they serve you a 24 ounce

986
00:30:08.201 --> 00:30:08.710
steak,

987
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:09.191
you know like,

988
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:09.811
God damn it.

989
00:30:09.811 --> 00:30:10.151
Fuck it.

990
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:10.850
I'm in Texas.

991
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:11.800
Let's just do this.

992
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.640
It seems like what you're supposed to be doing there when you're looking over it

993
00:30:14.641 --> 00:30:15.131
and dude,

994
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:15.491
next to you,

995
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:17.380
it is giant belt buckle and a cowboy hat.

996
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:19.330
It gives you the nod as he's cutting into the meat.

997
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.870
Do you know what was the deadliest place we ever went to as a restaurant?

998
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.713
Brian?

999
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.820
When we went to Houston and after that night we all went to that fucking place

1000
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.930
with the old guy and we sat in a table like this and they brought his Greek food

1001
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.120
and they brought us to Greek pizza places.

1002
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:34.420
Great.

1003
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.680
Let's get it out of the fucking way.

1004
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.560
Babies as Susan,

1005
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.060
the name of it.

1006
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:38.470
No,

1007
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.741
no,

1008
00:30:38.741 --> 00:30:38.891
no,

1009
00:30:38.891 --> 00:30:39.071
no.

1010
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:39.851
It's a Greek place.

1011
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:40.480
It's a,

1012
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:40.901
in fact,

1013
00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:43.190
I just got an invite to his birthday was the name of that place.

1014
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:47.410
Like the kid was a curling NGOs to come by these fevers.

1015
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.050
BBDS is a girl's clothing store.

1016
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:53.800
Bb,

1017
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.131
BB.

1018
00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:57.520
But the fucking guy in the daytime used to assault people.

1019
00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.380
They had a way to use the soap people.

1020
00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:00.214
He's really,

1021
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:01.240
and he would give you the weight,

1022
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.081
the fucking thing.

1023
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:04.840
And he'd come up to you like five minutes when he wanted for breakfast.

1024
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.621
I don't know.

1025
00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:10.360
Your thing is diabetes that make up your mind fucking yell at people and the

1026
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:11.290
people liked it.

1027
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.700
They had an old school waitresses there too,

1028
00:31:13.701 --> 00:31:13.950
right?

1029
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:14.591
Old School.

1030
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:16.000
They were a hundred a piece.

1031
00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:16.834
Like if you were,

1032
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.230
if you were younger than they do not apply.

1033
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.890
They would make them up.

1034
00:31:20.891 --> 00:31:22.540
No plastic surge like that Ag.

1035
00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:24.710
We seen the baseball commercial like that.

1036
00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.480
These one women that were 80 dog and the best thing about Greeks is that like

1037
00:31:28.481 --> 00:31:29.110
Jews,

1038
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.943
but even better,

1039
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.560
they don't accuse up money or stealing or nothing,

1040
00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:33.394
but let's just,

1041
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.580
let's not fuck white white dad.

1042
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.420
Let's just put my mother behind the register,

1043
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.070
right?

1044
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.730
They always have the cooks mother behind.

1045
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.151
Why?

1046
00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:44.670
Why take that chance and that bitch will not go home and my line,

1047
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.810
you go before pool at seven she's dead and at the pool,

1048
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.361
she's still there.

1049
00:31:49.361 --> 00:31:51.340
She's sleeping against the thing.

1050
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:52.390
You've got to bring the balance.

1051
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:52.631
You get,

1052
00:31:52.631 --> 00:31:53.000
Oh,

1053
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
I'm reading glasses on them bitches or put that Greek mothers there.

1054
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.340
Those motherfuckers are there 12 hours shifts.

1055
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:00.521
Yeah.

1056
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:01.241
That was that place.

1057
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:02.190
That place was very,

1058
00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:03.720
that you actually like that think

1059
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.020
he had a couple of those places.

1060
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:09.730
He had like two or three of those fucking rolls.

1061
00:32:09.731 --> 00:32:11.470
That one crazy flood.

1062
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.940
There's one of the girls who was a waitress at the laugh stop sent me a photo of

1063
00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:18.120
where that old hotel where we used to stay at eastern?

1064
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:19.063
Yeah.

1065
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:19.600
Was the,

1066
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.380
what was that parkway?

1067
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.071
The Allen Park.

1068
00:32:21.071 --> 00:32:21.904
Highland Park in,

1069
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.743
is that what it is?

1070
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.120
The Allen Park and it was,

1071
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.190
was so flooded.

1072
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:28.121
It was,

1073
00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:29.120
it was like the,

1074
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:30.070
the entire,

1075
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.460
like highway was an ocean and it was like a big river.

1076
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.600
It was crazy.

1077
00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:34.751
Like,

1078
00:32:34.751 --> 00:32:35.920
I don't know how it happened.

1079
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:37.240
How he got so flooded though.

1080
00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.530
What the fuck happens?

1081
00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:40.040
That a city can get that flooded.

1082
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.750
But that place was gone.

1083
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.290
But that,

1084
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:47.060
that place was a staple for like a standup comics and crazy stories on the road.

1085
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.820
I have this crackhead dude just insisting that I knew,

1086
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.140
I knew where Eddie was.

1087
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.940
This is like pre Eddie Bravo,

1088
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.930
you know like a,

1089
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:56.450
I was there and I'm walking around and the guy,

1090
00:32:56.451 --> 00:32:56.631

1091
00:32:56.631 --> 00:32:57.321

1092
00:32:57.321 --> 00:32:58.370

1093
00:32:58.371 --> 00:32:59.300
Where's Eddie?

1094
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.111
And I was like,

1095
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:00.351

1096
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:01.250
I do not know Eddie.

1097
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:01.731
Come on man.

1098
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:02.211

1099
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:03.410

Come on man.

1102
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.130
Like crazy and shaking and shit and just this dude had to find this guy and they

1103
00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:13.910
was just walking around knocking on doors like trying to find the guy who sells

1104
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:14.744
the crack.

1105
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.160
That was the only hotel.

1106
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.010
You go back to your hotel room,

1107
00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.360
this home,

1108
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.410
your hair a little bit,

1109
00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.830
get a bit and just sit in front of your whole tone and doing the morning within

1110
00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:25.551
15 minutes.

1111
00:33:25.551 --> 00:33:26.510
Some of you your walked by.

1112
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:27.370
Yeah,

1113
00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.230
you drink a beer.

1114
00:33:28.231 --> 00:33:28.801
Come on on them.

1115
00:33:28.801 --> 00:33:30.680
My Room mixing it a little rip now heroin and stuff.

1116
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.920
I'll tell you what though is another thing about that place.

1117
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:38.900
If you went down to Allen Park in and the girl was willing to go back there with

1118
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:39.803
you,

1119
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.263
she's not,

1120
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.860
she's not going to play games.

1121
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.401
Okay.

1122
00:33:43.401 --> 00:33:46.520
You're taking it on a dingy as creepiest pots on earth.

1123
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.110
She's she DTF.

1124
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:48.973
All right.

1125
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.090
She's like looking for a spot just as much as you are and you'd say this could

1126
00:33:54.091 --> 00:33:54.330
come on.

1127
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:54.871
Nobody's Eddie.

1128
00:33:54.871 --> 00:33:55.001
Yeah,

1129
00:33:55.001 --> 00:33:55.580
man.

1130
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.270
Like don't worry.

1131
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.021
Don't worry about him.

1132
00:33:57.021 --> 00:33:59.390
This door is an inch thick of solid cardboard.

1133
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:01.250
There's no way it's going to get to us while we're naked.

1134
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.620
I was just thinking about that meal.

1135
00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:08.000
You know how big that meal was and how we were done.

1136
00:34:08.001 --> 00:34:09.230
At one point we were like,

1137
00:34:09.231 --> 00:34:09.910
we're done.

1138
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:10.340
And we're like,

1139
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.600
we had eight people at the table.

1140
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:12.980
You're friends with that from Dallas.

1141
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:13.851
What's his name?

1142
00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:14.684
The Nice Kid.

1143
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.880
Flash WIC.

1144
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.460
They were all there and we were ready.

1145
00:34:18.461 --> 00:34:21.500
Here's the first Rogan board circle jerk and they all put in.

1146
00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:23.060
They came up and put those cheese,

1147
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.240
those Greek pizza and what's that flame on the cheese?

1148
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:27.420
[inaudible] cheese.

1149
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.833
What's the called?

1150
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.010
Stop fast

1151
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.020
with them.

1152
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.140
My locked us juice.

1153
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:37.581
Yeah,

1154
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:39.920
they had those Dolomites.

1155
00:34:39.921 --> 00:34:40.940
It's not Dolomites.

1156
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:41.803
That's the fucking,

1157
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:42.840
that's the pimp.

1158
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.790
Dolomites the pimp.

1159
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.430
What are those things do the,

1160
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.371
the leaves.

1161
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:47.300
The grape leaves.

1162
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.920
Stuffed grape leaves.

1163
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.730
It was the best of us.

1164
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.773
They'll be whatever.

1165
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.030
Oh,

1166
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.863
those are fucking

1167
00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.413
fucking,

1168
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:58.550
when are you ever more hungry though?

1169
00:34:58.551 --> 00:34:59.680
That after two shows,

1170
00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:01.790
when we do two shows on a Friday or Saturday night,

1171
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.700
we eat like unbelievable amount to eat.

1172
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.150
You go back to your room and eat your fucking stomach.

1173
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.830
It's horrible how fucking hungry you are three and you got to get something like

1174
00:35:12.831 --> 00:35:13.190
that.

1175
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:17.030
Even like approaching anything will work and you'd go to fucking sleep.

1176
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.940
But what wears you out more than doing two shows?

1177
00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:22.640
Is there anything where you went like when you have to do to headlining shows,

1178
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.870
have you been doing that lately?

1179
00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:24.150
Yeah.

1180
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.940
That mentally where the fuck up?

1181
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.390
Yeah.

1182
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.900
Right.

1183
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.920
It's a lot of talking.

1184
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.210
What are you doing an hour,

1185
00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.000
you doing an hour each.

1186
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.170
Shelf 50 you know,

1187
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.860
even when you do sets around town,

1188
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:36.950
if you'd do a three sets and one that is 15 fucking minutes are set.

1189
00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.410
Right,

1190
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:37.620
right.

1191
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.120
You but the third set you're like,

1192
00:35:39.121 --> 00:35:44.121
it's amazing how sometimes it's set flies by and sometimes a set takes a long

1193
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:46.530
time but it really does fly by.

1194
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:47.160
But like,

1195
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.510
it's just amazing comedy,

1196
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:49.344
the whole,

1197
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:50.850
the whole mechanics of it.

1198
00:35:50.851 --> 00:35:52.170
It's getting weirder and Weirder,

1199
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:53.480
but I love it more now than I,

1200
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:54.030
but you know,

1201
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.650
don't you feel like the more you do it,

1202
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.580
the better it gets,

1203
00:35:56.581 --> 00:35:58.020
but the more out of your hands it is.

1204
00:35:58.021 --> 00:35:58.351
It's like,

1205
00:35:58.351 --> 00:35:58.591
God,

1206
00:35:58.591 --> 00:35:59.430
this is fucking crazy thing.

1207
00:35:59.431 --> 00:36:00.280
He's got a life of own.

1208
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:00.811
Yes.

1209
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:01.644
Keep doing it.

1210
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:02.903
Keep doing it.

1211
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.050
Keep getting up there.

1212
00:36:04.051 --> 00:36:04.440
Right.

1213
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:04.981
You're talking,

1214
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:06.840
there's so much shit going on that you,

1215
00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:07.801
you know,

1216
00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:08.100
you don't,

1217
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:08.521
you just,

1218
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:09.060
I dunno,

1219
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.440
it commonly is a lot of fun.

1220
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:12.710
Lately I've been having a lot of fucking phone with lates.

1221
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.040
No shows.

1222
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.720
It's the best job ever,

1223
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:16.470
man.

1224
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.600
It's the best job ever for us.

1225
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.010
It's the best job ever.

1226
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.270
You know,

1227
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.310
I even miss getting lake on planes the last three weeks I've been home.

1228
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:23.901
I Miss Getting,

1229
00:36:23.901 --> 00:36:24.990
I'm fucking plans.

1230
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:29.910
Like I really miss getting even a little flight from Burbank to San Jose.

1231
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.931
You know what I'm saying?

1232
00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:31.980
Like on a Thursday night,

1233
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:33.540
like I was pulling those Thursday nights.

1234
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:34.770
I love that shit guys.

1235
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.320
There's an adventure to our job that,

1236
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:37.670
uh,

1237
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.140
is one of the things that's real exciting about it.

1238
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.760
Like our last trip to Austin,

1239
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.650
there's a lot of adventure to our job.

1240
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.390
They're always this venture for me.

1241
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:47.310
Tomorrow night during my first black room,

1242
00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:48.360
I don't know how to do it.

1243
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.070
I went to tip jelly there.

1244
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.343
Here's a tip,

1245
00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.900
being able to run as soon as you get off stage.

1246
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:55.711
That's important.

1247
00:36:55.711 --> 00:36:59.430
Have a nice exit strategy and start off strong.

1248
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.151
Started off strong.

1249
00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.710
You have to start off strong,

1250
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:03.900
but you also have to be relaxed.

1251
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:04.950
If you stutter,

1252
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:06.090
they will attack.

1253
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.960
They will go after silly and goofy and like that pill.

1254
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.991
They'll like that.

1255
00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:12.480
But you also have to be smooth with your words.

1256
00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:13.650
You have to be well prepared.

1257
00:37:13.651 --> 00:37:13.841
They are.

1258
00:37:13.841 --> 00:37:14.674
When in Rome,

1259
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.010
they appreciate like for real,

1260
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:22.011
but black crowds are more likely to appreciate good showmanship.

1261
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:22.680
Oh really?

1262
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.513
And good.

1263
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.320
Somebody has a really good entertainer,

1264
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.780
but they're also more critical.

1265
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:28.921
So they will,

1266
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:30.690
they will come down on you if you start stuttering,

1267
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.560
if you start stuttering,

1268
00:37:31.561 --> 00:37:33.030
white people give you a chance to recover.

1269
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:33.420
Right?

1270
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.021
Black people.

1271
00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:34.770
Not so much.

1272
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:35.960
Wow.

1273
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:37.170
Let's see.

1274
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:37.561
Bullshit.

1275
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:40.240
I pay my the fuck I paid to see you get some food.

1276
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.200
I started in a black room but the biggest bombing,

1277
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.840
but I never got back on a black stages in a black room.

1278
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.093
Not to,

1279
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.670
not to interrupt you or to get this off the subject.

1280
00:37:50.671 --> 00:37:51.361
What we're talking about,

1281
00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:51.931
black people,

1282
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:53.520
famous black people and drugs.

1283
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.350
I guarantee you,

1284
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.760
I will bet each of you a hundred bucks and I'm no genius cause I don't know much

1285
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:00.750
about the pill world,

1286
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.320
but I guarantee you Katt Williams just problem all started with Adderall.

1287
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:08.400
You think so?

1288
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.430
Because after you don't do Adderall,

1289
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.290
you God was watching something when you say Adderall because I was watching

1290
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:18.291
something on discovery where a guy went from Adderall to speed to meth because

1291
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:19.231
he felt that,

1292
00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:19.771
wait a second,

1293
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:20.760
if I'm doing this,

1294
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.170
what will speed too?

1295
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.130
He was like an accountant.

1296
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.150
He was like a fucking,

1297
00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:24.840
you know,

1298
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.950
I never fucked with Adderall.

1299
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.740
So I just hear what people are saying that you could write better.

1300
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.510
You write a ton better,

1301
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:31.830
you do all this shit better.

1302
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:35.530
So I've already been around the block with things that make things better,

1303
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.820
so I don't need,

1304
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.713
you know what I'm saying?

1305
00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:38.450
I don't know.

1306
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.650
Reminded me of cocaine immediate.

1307
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:40.270
That's what I'm saying.

1308
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.650
Like I felt like I had drips in my mouth.

1309
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:46.480
I could see a person doing that are all and doing two bumps and just losing it.

1310
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:51.580
I have a friend and I believe he's on the Adderall and he's been acting very

1311
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:52.450
erratic lately.

1312
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.810
More and more like over the last like six,

1313
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:56.321
seven months.

1314
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:57.310
I don't see him that often.

1315
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:57.951
I see him,

1316
00:38:57.951 --> 00:38:58.360
you know,

1317
00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.350
every few months or so,

1318
00:38:59.650 --> 00:38:59.980
he's,

1319
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.070
he's starting to get a little bonkers about our one friend.

1320
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:04.360
I'm talking about a friend.

1321
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.940
I'll tell you who it is when the show's over and we stop recording,

1322
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:09.040
we'd go outside and stand behind a car.

1323
00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:10.630
Went friends off it.

1324
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:11.210
I,

1325
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:11.331
no,

1326
00:39:11.331 --> 00:39:11.430
no,

1327
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:12.190
no.

1328
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.970
Um,

1329
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.540
I don't know which friend you're talking about.

1330
00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.110
Uh,

1331
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.901
up north.

1332
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:18.040
We just saw him in,

1333
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:18.820
uh,

1334
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.450
no,

1335
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:19.841
no,

1336
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:20.800
that guy.

1337
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.693
You're right.

1338
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:22.181
Yeah.

1339
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:23.200
That guy is off it.

1340
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:23.331
Yeah,

1341
00:39:23.331 --> 00:39:24.164
that guy.

1342
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.380
That guy's a way smarter,

1343
00:39:26.381 --> 00:39:26.681
Dude.

1344
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:27.071
And the dude.

1345
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:30.700
I'm talking about the dude I'm talking about as much dumber and he's got a

1346
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:31.540
fucking problem.

1347
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:31.820
Wow.

1348
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.470
So the town,

1349
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.480
I'll tell you after the show,

1350
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:38.973
it has something.

1351
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.930
Why do you think that cat is doing Adderall in the first question?

1352
00:39:41.931 --> 00:39:44.590
What makes you think maybe it's not at all,

1353
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:45.430
but it's something.

1354
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.960
I think it's cocaine and mental.

1355
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.240
He's mixing with that gentlemen.

1356
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.720
It's something that's Zod night with it.

1357
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.010
Let me get this goal and now he's smoking crack with it.

1358
00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:55.690
You know,

1359
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.810
I tell you guys once you start doing it and if you listen to the stories,

1360
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.640
these people started doing it with everything else.

1361
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:04.570
It don't matter you the chicken Florida that was drinking and doing the bottom

1362
00:40:04.571 --> 00:40:05.200
pills.

1363
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.450
Maybe shooting pool with a fucking loud that day.

1364
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:09.340
Maybe it's just trying to come up with a new hour.

1365
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.531
Just dude,

1366
00:40:10.531 --> 00:40:11.760
it's just going to go all.

1367
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.460
I seem to take out a whole new hour and I've seen the tape from Oakland.

1368
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:17.830
I seen the woman when he came up with the drug bunny rabbit,

1369
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:21.730
he is of his head and he just shook his head for 35 fucking minutes or whatever

1370
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.190
and I love that one is,

1371
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.630
but I'm telling you guys that these pills and this over the counter,

1372
00:40:26.631 --> 00:40:27.940
this shit on that over the counter,

1373
00:40:27.941 --> 00:40:28.690
this side,

1374
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.280
what do you call it?

1375
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.470
Pharmaceutical is oxycon opiates.

1376
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.290
It's just killing mother fuckers.

1377
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.030
This or all of this shit.

1378
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:38.850
Just smoke fucking joints that whatever happened,

1379
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.910
just smoked on a fucking,

1380
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:40.963
I don't know.

1381
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.030
I don't understand why no one's beat him back though.

1382
00:40:43.031 --> 00:40:43.840
Like how many,

1383
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.720
how many people has he hit but you don't hear like them beating his ass.

1384
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:50.440
He's seen what happens when he hits people like nothing.

1385
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:53.200
He's like getting swatted by a four year old.

1386
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.480
Like he punched the Walmart guy in the face.

1387
00:40:55.481 --> 00:40:56.590
The Guy didn't even flinch.

1388
00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.670
[inaudible] guiding,

1389
00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.420
go down.

1390
00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.640
The guy didn't put his hands out,

1391
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:00.701
the target guy,

1392
00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:01.450
whatever it was,

1393
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.510
he punched that guy in the face.

1394
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.310
It's like nothing you've got.

1395
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.153
The guy was like,

1396
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.420
that was nothing like you didn't do anything to me.

1397
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.460
What that did was obviously just scared of black people.

1398
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.760
Was He [inaudible] himself a target?

1399
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.390
Uh,

1400
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.223
Sacramento.

1401
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.430
Was he by himself?

1402
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.600
By himself?

1403
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:16.871
Okay,

1404
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:18.070
so you see the video.

1405
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:18.941
I see the video.

1406
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:21.190
So I just pull the video I saw at what time was this?

1407
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:22.690
What time did it happen in the afternoon?

1408
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.011
That's a good question.

1409
00:41:24.011 --> 00:41:24.641
I can't repeat.

1410
00:41:24.641 --> 00:41:27.400
This motherfucker is asleep before ranking it all day.

1411
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.691
He didn't sleep.

1412
00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:30.130
And do you think that's what gives him,

1413
00:41:30.131 --> 00:41:30.880
that's why he's uh,

1414
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.540
so like,

1415
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.373
uh,

1416
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.710
like short tempered.

1417
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.280
You run it snowflakes in the back of any motherfucker.

1418
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.560
Why didn't you tell him when you don't sleep a dog?

1419
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:40.850
When you don't fucking sleep,

1420
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:42.201
you don't sleep with him?

1421
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:43.034
Two nights.

1422
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:44.420
Oh,

1423
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:44.871
I've been there,

1424
00:41:44.871 --> 00:41:45.500
man.

1425
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.350
What the fuck you talking to me like that before?

1426
00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:48.200
You know,

1427
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.530
you get fucking agitated.

1428
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.330
Confusion.

1429
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:50.480
Yeah.

1430
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.313
There's a word for that.

1431
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.860
You become self delirious deliveries.

1432
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:54.440
Yeah.

1433
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.680
So I,

1434
00:41:55.681 --> 00:41:56.980
I watched that target one.

1435
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.030
That's what I'm taking about.

1436
00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.150
He's up all night before you.

1437
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:00.740
Only Times I've done,

1438
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.580
I did coke all night and by 11 o'clock at night all night,

1439
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.950
he just talking to this fucking guy.

1440
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:08.480
The guy's got his left hand up.

1441
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.710
Oh,

1442
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.240
just stole on him?

1443
00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:14.400
Yeah,

1444
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.590
just kind of looks at his phone and he had stolen him and then he backed up.

1445
00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.600
How many times by 11 o'clock in the morning.

1446
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:22.400
In my mind I was fine.

1447
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:24.651
That was fine.

1448
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:25.190
I'm fine.

1449
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.821
They can't tell.

1450
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:27.050
I was told blow on that.

1451
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:30.400
I'll take a shower and put gel in my hair and I'll go out there.

1452
00:42:30.401 --> 00:42:31.131
They can't tell.

1453
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:31.901
But in your mind,

1454
00:42:31.901 --> 00:42:32.631
as you're walking,

1455
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:35.540
do you have a year old fucking conversation in your mind?

1456
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.460
What's coming out of your fucking head is amazing.

1457
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:38.720
This guy doesn't know.

1458
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:39.560
He can't tell.

1459
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.570
That's why he walks into those places.

1460
00:42:41.571 --> 00:42:43.760
Banged up like that before.

1461
00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.590
That's a horrible situation.

1462
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:47.510
But so do you think that's coke?

1463
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.433
What is that?

1464
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.160
No,

1465
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.120
they're saying it's crack.

1466
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.200
I don't fucking know.

1467
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:52.063
It could be that right.

1468
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:52.881
It could be that,

1469
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:56.150
but you got to stop and spoke that it'd be 20 minutes every 20 minutes.

1470
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.451
Sure.

1471
00:42:56.451 --> 00:42:57.261
You've got a pipe on,

1472
00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:58.570
you got to have a little porch on you.

1473
00:42:58.571 --> 00:42:58.901
You know what,

1474
00:42:58.901 --> 00:42:59.900
you got to have shit on you.

1475
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.720
So I dunno what the fuck is these people are talking about.

1476
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:03.710
We use smoke crack.

1477
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:04.171
You got to smoke.

1478
00:43:04.171 --> 00:43:05.030
I read 20 minutes.

1479
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:09.140
Who was a really hot chick from Baywatch way back in the day.

1480
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.390
She had dark hair and she got arrested.

1481
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.950
Well with the crack pipe or and Michigan.

1482
00:43:12.951 --> 00:43:14.340
She was fucking around with Don Johnson.

1483
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.410
She looked like,

1484
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:20.300
like Danielle and she was so pretty basketball with me.

1485
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:21.650
I think she was a basketball.

1486
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:22.540
What the hell was that Brian?

1487
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.050
I forget what her fucking name was.

1488
00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.260
Yasmin Leaf.

1489
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.560
She was so pretty and then all of a sudden it was just a picture of her.

1490
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:35.561
She was like the first like really famous check to just absolutely fall apart in

1491
00:43:35.991 --> 00:43:36.860
a drug photo.

1492
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.970
I mean look at that.

1493
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.830
That's insane.

1494
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.440
That bitch had been up for a year.

1495
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.393
Look at her.

1496
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.530
She was at one point time like she was stupid hot.

1497
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:48.891
Yeah.

1498
00:43:48.891 --> 00:43:49.450
I wonder where she,

1499
00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:50.283
when she looks at now.

1500
00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:50.810
Oh,

1501
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.440
poor kid.

1502
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.900
I thought I saw on a show like the attorney,

1503
00:43:53.901 --> 00:43:54.890
but I don't think it was up.

1504
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.851
Yeah,

1505
00:43:55.851 --> 00:43:57.990
I'm sure she's got sort of,

1506
00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:58.800
that's what I'm thinking.

1507
00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.780
If you smoke crack,

1508
00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.990
but after you smoked crack for 10 hours,

1509
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:06.310
you just go into a zone two but you don't need it anymore.

1510
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:06.621
You're like,

1511
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:06.951
fine.

1512
00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:07.880
It really,

1513
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.860
I don't need this shit for another hour.

1514
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:11.150
You know I'm going to take a walk.

1515
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:11.720
You know?

1516
00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.100
I don't fucking know Joe,

1517
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.900
but you know what,

1518
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:15.141
man,

1519
00:44:15.141 --> 00:44:17.470
when you're 12 you're not ready at it.

1520
00:44:17.471 --> 00:44:19.010
As a young man with these kids,

1521
00:44:19.011 --> 00:44:22.220
you're not ready at 18 how are you going to give somebody fucking all these

1522
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:23.600
pills at 12 years old?

1523
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.310
Because they have a Ddi at abd at 12 so it fucking,

1524
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.950
you sounded red band.

1525
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:29.871
Yeah.

1526
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:31.010
That's what makes for interesting.

1527
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.070
People needing to be interesting.

1528
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:35.970
Your parents came to you,

1529
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:37.050
so you need to study hard.

1530
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:37.501
You know what?

1531
00:44:37.501 --> 00:44:39.210
From now on a three I'm them pick you up.

1532
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.650
I'm going to take it to the library.

1533
00:44:40.651 --> 00:44:41.510
I'm going to read for an hour.

1534
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.640
You're going to study now they just give you Adderall or whatever.

1535
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:45.331
The fuck they give.

1536
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:49.860
You see ADP now they just replace their fucking attention with a fucking pill.

1537
00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:50.530
You know,

1538
00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:51.450
there's so many things.

1539
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:55.180
Parenting is very hard and there's so many things that you think replaces

1540
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.740
parenting,

1541
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:56.900
but it really doesn't pro,

1542
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:57.811
there's nothing,

1543
00:44:57.811 --> 00:45:00.630
nothing to like your kid coming home at three and you being there,

1544
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:02.640
you know that you call home at Green.

1545
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:03.750
There was nobody fucking that.

1546
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:04.421
Me Too.

1547
00:45:04.421 --> 00:45:05.254
And my whole life

1548
00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:11.600
to come up with three and there's a $10 bill and a thing and the steak cooking

1549
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:11.691
up.

1550
00:45:11.691 --> 00:45:12.290
Take the time,

1551
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:13.190
go eat motherfucker.

1552
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.060
You know and and I,

1553
00:45:15.061 --> 00:45:16.140
and our generation,

1554
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:17.070
you could walk around,

1555
00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:18.210
the neighbor's mother was there.

1556
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.880
You caught yourself cause hey,

1557
00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:20.820
these fucking kid.

1558
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:21.150
I mean,

1559
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:22.230
what are you doing man?

1560
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:22.720
You know,

1561
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.940
it's different times.

1562
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.813
Well it's also,

1563
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.500
<v 0>it's also some people just get a bad roll the dice.</v>

1564
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:31.950
We were talking about this yesterday that you could get a real bad roll the dice

1565
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.630
and be in a terrible family.

1566
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.021
You just,

1567
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:34.950
unfortunately,

1568
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:36.150
<v 4>your mother's a junkie,</v>

1569
00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.310
your father is a murderer.

1570
00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.693
What can you do?

1571
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:41.721
You know what,

1572
00:45:41.721 --> 00:45:41.991
man,

1573
00:45:41.991 --> 00:45:43.070
I've seen a lot of those kids.

1574
00:45:43.071 --> 00:45:43.904
They learned from that.

1575
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:44.590
Yeah,

1576
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:44.970
they don't,

1577
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.210
I don't put the blame on at 50%.

1578
00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:51.020
40% of how many times have you seen the attorney and you've talked to him?

1579
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.790
It's easily attorney because his mother stabbed the father was something that

1580
00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:55.310
was,

1581
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.780
he had a motivation behind it.

1582
00:45:56.781 --> 00:45:57.170
So,

1583
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.740
yeah.

1584
00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.573
Uh,

1585
00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.730
I just always thought I grew up a lot of psychological problems and I'm like,

1586
00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:06.190
I didn't want to go shooting on my fucking classmates.

1587
00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.020
I didn't want to go through a lot of fun.

1588
00:46:08.021 --> 00:46:09.280
I wanted to shoot my stepfather.

1589
00:46:09.281 --> 00:46:10.114
That was it.

1590
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.821
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1591
00:46:10.821 --> 00:46:11.001
Well,

1592
00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:11.661
you know Joey,

1593
00:46:11.661 --> 00:46:12.111
I don't,

1594
00:46:12.111 --> 00:46:12.531
you know,

1595
00:46:12.531 --> 00:46:14.870
I don't know what the fuck that kid's life was like.

1596
00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.070
Who,

1597
00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:20.540
how do you know it would be really important for us,

1598
00:46:20.541 --> 00:46:25.541
I think as a society to try to figure out what it took to turn a person into a

1599
00:46:25.881 --> 00:46:28.520
school shooter and life.

1600
00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:29.570
I don't even want to know.

1601
00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:29.800
I don't,

1602
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.231
I don't know.

1603
00:46:30.231 --> 00:46:30.861
I'm asking you.

1604
00:46:30.861 --> 00:46:31.690
Is that a lot?

1605
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:32.331
A lot of guns.

1606
00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:33.250
There was more than one gun.

1607
00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:33.770
Really?

1608
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:34.090
Yeah.

1609
00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:34.320
Nate,

1610
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.560
if you stop and think about the Columbine shootings,

1611
00:46:36.561 --> 00:46:38.060
I mean we know those kids were bullied,

1612
00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:38.291
you know,

1613
00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:39.230
as kids were tortured,

1614
00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:40.110
did he?

1615
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:40.600
That's,

1616
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.400
that's an important point too because I think it's,

1617
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.350
some people do not really understand how important is that their kids don't

1618
00:46:48.351 --> 00:46:52.010
bully people and they don't understand how devastating that could be on a young

1619
00:46:52.011 --> 00:46:52.844
kid psyche.

1620
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.480
Especially if the kid's coming from an unstable house as it is and then you're

1621
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:56.770
you,

1622
00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.600
you coming from a house where everything is in turmoil and people yelling at you

1623
00:46:59.601 --> 00:47:01.790
and you're going to school and people are pushing you around and hitting you.

1624
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.260
It's like your life is hell.

1625
00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.240
Like that is why people will commit suicide.

1626
00:47:05.241 --> 00:47:06.500
The you are creating their,

1627
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:10.940
their life can be a hell or it could be just the opposite.

1628
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.400
You would go to school and that same kid says,

1629
00:47:13.401 --> 00:47:14.240
what's up dude?

1630
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.811
What are you doing?

1631
00:47:14.811 --> 00:47:15.740
It gives you a big hug.

1632
00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.880
Now you're happy.

1633
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.620
Something is creating that bully and it's not just human nature.

1634
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.580
There's some shit that's going on in that kid's life that's he's trying to

1635
00:47:25.581 --> 00:47:28.730
express and he's trying to express on other people.

1636
00:47:28.731 --> 00:47:29.564
I,

1637
00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.510
when I was a kid,

1638
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:35.190
a lot of people that would go around and beat people up and to a man,

1639
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.590
every one of them got beat up at home.

1640
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:38.940
Every one of them.

1641
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.021
I had a friend,

1642
00:47:40.021 --> 00:47:40.591
my friend Kenny,

1643
00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:41.220
we used to la,

1644
00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.840
he used to love to get in fights.

1645
00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:44.100
Kenny would just start,

1646
00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:45.840
just walk up to someone and start a fight.

1647
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.411
Like,

1648
00:47:46.411 --> 00:47:47.101
come on bitch,

1649
00:47:47.101 --> 00:47:47.611
let's go.

1650
00:47:47.611 --> 00:47:48.121
And they got to be like,

1651
00:47:48.121 --> 00:47:48.510
what?

1652
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:49.830
Like put up your fucking hands.

1653
00:47:49.831 --> 00:47:50.880
We're going right now.

1654
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:51.451
They got booked,

1655
00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:52.350
the fuck are you talking about?

1656
00:47:52.351 --> 00:47:53.340
And he would just start swinging.

1657
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.690
He was crazy.

1658
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.260
You know why?

1659
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.450
Because he got the fuck beat out of him as a kid.

1660
00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.613
I didn't have that.

1661
00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.990
I did not get beat up as a kid.

1662
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:01.631
And uh,

1663
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:02.880
I'm very fortunate for that.

1664
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:07.710
So like when I see kids that lash out like that or kids that want to beat people

1665
00:48:07.711 --> 00:48:07.980
up,

1666
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.813
kids that have,

1667
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.630
they have a different sort of a,

1668
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.450
an anger inside of them,

1669
00:48:12.451 --> 00:48:16.440
they have a really irrational self destructive sort of of violence inducing

1670
00:48:16.441 --> 00:48:17.250
anger.

1671
00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:19.950
A lot of that comes from being physically abused.

1672
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.130
Like it changes the wiring of a child's brain.

1673
00:48:23.131 --> 00:48:27.150
It changes the way a child associates with the people that are the most loving

1674
00:48:27.151 --> 00:48:28.170
and protecting of him.

1675
00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:29.004
It's fucking,

1676
00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.213
nope,

1677
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:30.610
nope.

1678
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:31.520
Nobody gave you a Spec.

1679
00:48:31.521 --> 00:48:31.980
You know,

1680
00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.161
look,

1681
00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:33.420
my dad was a piece of shit,

1682
00:48:33.421 --> 00:48:34.740
but one thing my dad was,

1683
00:48:34.741 --> 00:48:38.700
he was fiercely protective of me fiercely.

1684
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:41.130
Like my cousin did something to me when I was a little kid.

1685
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.100
My Dad picked my cousin hung by his hair.

1686
00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.271
I'll never forget it.

1687
00:48:45.271 --> 00:48:47.730
My cousin was like 12 or 13 and I was probably like five.

1688
00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.270
He picked him up by his hair and beat the shit out of them,

1689
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.080
but pick them in the air by,

1690
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.180
I'll never forget the screaming that kid was making while he was getting lifted

1691
00:48:57.181 --> 00:48:58.770
in the air by his hair.

1692
00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:01.170
So I saw a lot of violence,

1693
00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:03.900
but it didn't get turned on me yet.

1694
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:04.410
You know,

1695
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.210
my parents got divorced when I was five,

1696
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.470
so I never,

1697
00:49:07.471 --> 00:49:08.070
I didn't,

1698
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:08.610
I didn't,

1699
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:08.940
you know,

1700
00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.420
when they split up I saw him be violent with my mother.

1701
00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.340
I saw him be violent with a lot of other people.

1702
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:16.050
I saw him be violent with my cousin.

1703
00:49:16.051 --> 00:49:17.130
Like when I told you he pulled his hair,

1704
00:49:17.131 --> 00:49:18.390
but he never did anything to me,

1705
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.370
so I missed that part.

1706
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.510
I didn't get beat up.

1707
00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:22.740
So because I didn't get beat up,

1708
00:49:22.741 --> 00:49:23.760
my mom was a very,

1709
00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:24.690
very sweet person.

1710
00:49:24.691 --> 00:49:26.130
She was never violent in any way,

1711
00:49:26.131 --> 00:49:26.581
shape or form.

1712
00:49:26.581 --> 00:49:27.420
She never even yelled.

1713
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:28.710
She barely raised her voice.

1714
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:29.640
My mother was a very,

1715
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:32.100
very kind person and still is.

1716
00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.050
So I missed that,

1717
00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:35.243
that part.

1718
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.620
But I got to see its work in a lot of friends.

1719
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:38.221
You know,

1720
00:49:38.221 --> 00:49:38.720
you get to,

1721
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.690
to know when,

1722
00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.960
that's one of the things that's really weird about growing up is as you're

1723
00:49:42.961 --> 00:49:47.250
growing up and you realize how many people come from fucked up families,

1724
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.990
how many people's families are fucked up.

1725
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:50.730
And it's like almost everybody,

1726
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.310
almost everybody I knew had something going on.

1727
00:49:53.311 --> 00:49:56.370
Either the dad was an alcoholic and they were trying to figure out how to not

1728
00:49:56.371 --> 00:49:58.110
get them to the drive or the,

1729
00:49:58.111 --> 00:49:58.441
you know,

1730
00:49:58.441 --> 00:49:58.621
the,

1731
00:49:58.621 --> 00:50:03.210
the mother fucking has a gambling problem and disappears at night and doesn't

1732
00:50:03.211 --> 00:50:07.260
come home until the morning or there was always fucking something.

1733
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:08.400
There's always something.

1734
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.750
It's amazing.

1735
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.670
Our society works as well as it does.

1736
00:50:11.671 --> 00:50:14.280
It's amazing where as together as we really are,

1737
00:50:14.281 --> 00:50:18.150
if you really stop to think about what a shit job people did in raising human

1738
00:50:18.151 --> 00:50:18.984
beings,

1739
00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.170
<v 2>did you see that?</v>

1740
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:25.320
That news a thing with Kat Williams and uh,

1741
00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:29.090
talking about how he's like quitting comedy and he's like crying and stuff.

1742
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.650
It was like a news report.

1743
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.191
Really?

1744
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:31.401
Yeah.

1745
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:32.234
Check this out.

1746
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:34.050
<v 4>Quitting standup comedy and cry.</v>

1747
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.250
This is after all the shit.

1748
00:50:35.251 --> 00:50:35.461
Yeah.

1749
00:50:35.461 --> 00:50:38.970
This is a December 4th I think it's due tonight.

1750
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:39.661
<v 7>Stand up.</v>

1751
00:50:39.661 --> 00:50:43.410
Comic Katt Williams has had a controversial visit to Seattle the past few days

1752
00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:47.100
and tonight he's telling us his side of the store come for caught up with

1753
00:50:47.101 --> 00:50:50.010
Williams as he was ejected from a South Lake Union hotel.

1754
00:50:50.011 --> 00:50:52.200
Around 7:00 PM on Sunday,

1755
00:50:52.201 --> 00:50:55.290
Williams was arrested after an altercation at a nearby restaurant.

1756
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:59.160
Police say he argued with customers and threatened the manager with a pool cue.

1757
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.790
Williams is accused of then throwing a lit cigarette into a family's car,

1758
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:06.660
which hit a woman in the face throwing a rock at that car and struggling with

1759
00:51:06.661 --> 00:51:07.620
police officers.

1760
00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:12.830
A group of fans claims Williams assaulted them after his performance Friday

1761
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:13.291
night tonight,

1762
00:51:13.291 --> 00:51:16.890
Williams admitted to us he has had trouble with the law here in Seattle this

1763
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:17.040
weekend.

1764
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.980
He made a string of allegations against police and the media.

1765
00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:23.100
Then he told us because of his bad weekend in Seattle,

1766
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.680
he's decided to end his standup career.

1767
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:32.080
<v 1>I'm just going to go ahead and announce my retirement from stand up of done.</v>

1768
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.153
This is

1769
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.413
not really.

1770
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.110
Yeah,

1771
00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:36.370
I,

1772
00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:36.710
I've,

1773
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.880
I've,

1774
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.740
I've already discussed it with my kids.

1775
00:51:38.741 --> 00:51:40.930
I wasn't really going to do it on the Seattle Street.

1776
00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:43.460
I was going to go to Los Angeles and do it in the offices.

1777
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.070
I see him or live nation

1778
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.321
<v 7>and William says,</v>

1779
00:51:46.321 --> 00:51:47.580
proven to be unpredictable.

1780
00:51:47.581 --> 00:51:50.010
So we're gonna Watch and see how this all plays out.

1781
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:53.411
<v 4>You see that?</v>

1782
00:51:53.411 --> 00:51:54.630
He looked like that reason why,

1783
00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:56.290
you know,

1784
00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:56.620
that's,

1785
00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.690
that's something that I loved the guy.

1786
00:51:59.080 --> 00:51:59.920
There's a guy I love,

1787
00:51:59.921 --> 00:52:02.710
we all fucking bug the first special cracking me up.

1788
00:52:02.711 --> 00:52:04.580
I knew when he fucking was cat mat,

1789
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:07.120
he'd come to the store on Sunday nights problem again,

1790
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:08.120
a spot up in this month,

1791
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.461
you know?

1792
00:52:09.461 --> 00:52:11.560
And I tried to put them up there and argue with Mitzi,

1793
00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:12.640
the whole fucking deal.

1794
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:14.560
Soul to see this.

1795
00:52:14.561 --> 00:52:15.420
You gotta what?

1796
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:16.263
What is that?

1797
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.390
That's trucks now.

1798
00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.750
Somebody wrote a book about it.

1799
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:19.630
I'm pretty sure that's true.

1800
00:52:19.631 --> 00:52:21.520
Wrote a book about him saying what happened?

1801
00:52:21.521 --> 00:52:22.360
The allegations.

1802
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:22.990
I don't know.

1803
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:24.430
I've never seen him smoke crack.

1804
00:52:24.431 --> 00:52:25.264
I've noticed.

1805
00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.313
That seems like,

1806
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.240
that seems like a drug issue.

1807
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:28.481
Well,

1808
00:52:28.481 --> 00:52:30.700
it's either a drug issue or it's a mental health issue.

1809
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:31.750
There's something,

1810
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:34.090
there was something disconnected that right?

1811
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.431
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1812
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:37.880
I mean if it's a mental health issue and he does drugs of any kind,

1813
00:52:37.881 --> 00:52:38.840
it could set him off.

1814
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.850
It's like a weird spiral.

1815
00:52:40.851 --> 00:52:41.870
That's powerful.

1816
00:52:41.871 --> 00:52:44.660
Doctor Red Band next after Oprah.

1817
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:46.370

1821
00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:54.830

1822
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.840

<v 2>or is Maury Povich sister was [inaudible] father</v>

1824
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:06.560
<v 4>is fucked up cause sometimes I watch gates ELA in the morning to see where</v>

1825
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:10.670
there's traffic and when I get home the TV still on and it's one of those shows

1826
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.980
and I'll make a sandwich listening to like,

1827
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:13.580
you know,

1828
00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:16.740
so this guy took a test is not the father.

1829
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.120
The guy will do this preplanned out dance,

1830
00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:19.710
Huh?

1831
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.890
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1832
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:21.920
Those dudes breakdown bitch,

1833
00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.070
I told truck came on your tillage.

1834
00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:26.170
The shows are me so fucking fake.

1835
00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:27.340
<v 3>I know so many people that were like,</v>

1836
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:27.760
alright,

1837
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.140
we need you to come to this show.

1838
00:53:29.141 --> 00:53:31.790
You're going to play boyfriend and girlfriend and you're going to get in a

1839
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.150
fight.

1840
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.681
He's a dude.

1841
00:53:32.681 --> 00:53:37.270
He used to work at governors in Long Island and he used to be involved in those

1842
00:53:37.271 --> 00:53:37.960
shows.

1843
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.070
And what they would do is,

1844
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.630
uh,

1845
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:40.270
that they,

1846
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:42.190
they don't tell you to fake it,

1847
00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.260
but what they do is they call you up and they say,

1848
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:49.590
our show is looking for a guy who is having an affair with his brother's wife.

1849
00:53:49.631 --> 00:53:50.464
He goes,

1850
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.251
that's crazy.

1851
00:53:51.251 --> 00:53:52.100
I'm having a feral.

1852
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.990
My brother's wife,

1853
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.910
he doesn't even have a brother.

1854
00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:55.893
Next thing you know,

1855
00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.711
he's on camera.

1856
00:53:56.711 --> 00:53:57.700
So whatever it was,

1857
00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:58.540
that was the game,

1858
00:53:58.541 --> 00:53:59.890
they would call you up and say,

1859
00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.430
we're looking for a guy who spent his life in an Asian gang,

1860
00:54:03.431 --> 00:54:04.241
but he's a white guy.

1861
00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:04.450
You know,

1862
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.970
I spent my life and an Asian guy and I was a white guy.

1863
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.250
Right.

1864
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:09.220
And they'll just make up nonsense.

1865
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:10.540
Like a lot of those shows,

1866
00:54:10.541 --> 00:54:11.590
it's a hundred percent

1867
00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:12.423
<v 0>nonsense.</v>

1868
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.300
It's just,

1869
00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:13.780
they just,

1870
00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.650
it's just entertainment.

1871
00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:15.210
But you know,

1872
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:15.821
it's crazy.

1873
00:54:15.821 --> 00:54:19.840
Going back to that family thing you said like in my house,

1874
00:54:19.841 --> 00:54:22.540
I grew up in a fucked up house but there was a lot of love and a lot of love

1875
00:54:22.541 --> 00:54:27.541
came from my mom and my Stepdad was a good guy to an extreme that I meet people

1876
00:54:27.771 --> 00:54:29.530
who have no reason to be fucked up.

1877
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:30.460
Like the people I meet,

1878
00:54:30.461 --> 00:54:35.461
they're like cutting like people at two phase backstabbing because people come

1879
00:54:37.061 --> 00:54:42.061
from perfect households who you think the parents did the work but really didn't

1880
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.840
and they're like Connie and the two phase and they do shit to people and they

1881
00:54:46.841 --> 00:54:47.674
think they cute.

1882
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.460
I would always figure out these people have no reason to be cock suckers like

1883
00:54:51.461 --> 00:54:52.250
me.

1884
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.710
Like that's how I would look at myself.

1885
00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.750
I came from a fucked up house so I ain't understand.

1886
00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:56.950
I give myself a breather.

1887
00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:00.130
But this guy had two nice fucking parents are both attorneys.

1888
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.320
This guy's the biggest piece of shit out of all of them.

1889
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:03.011
But you know what?

1890
00:55:03.011 --> 00:55:03.844
The differences,

1891
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:07.690
the people that grow up with everything that happened from the get go,

1892
00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.700
there's a real issue with self worth.

1893
00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.690
And there's also real issue with a lack of character because they're spoiled.

1894
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.610
When you talk about spoiled kids,

1895
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.960
you want to send them camping,

1896
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.231
you know,

1897
00:55:17.231 --> 00:55:19.690
take those spoiled kids and send them out to wilderness camp.

1898
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.550
Take those spoiled kids and make them work.

1899
00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:22.384
If they knew what it was,

1900
00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:26.680
people need to understand what struggles about,

1901
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:29.530
they need to understand what labor is about.

1902
00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.870
They need to understand what effort is about,

1903
00:55:31.871 --> 00:55:32.190
when,

1904
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.710
what,

1905
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:33.071
how.

1906
00:55:33.071 --> 00:55:36.490
You can get over something and it's difficult and it builds character.

1907
00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:37.870
And if that never happens to you,

1908
00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.160
you don't have any character.

1909
00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:42.460
So while you're trying to make something happen for yourself,

1910
00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.210
you know you're trying to do it any way you can and the way you been getting by

1911
00:55:46.211 --> 00:55:46.781
your whole life.

1912
00:55:46.781 --> 00:55:48.310
It was probably bullshitting people,

1913
00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.630
bullshitting your parents.

1914
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.240
You know the people that work for your parents probably listen to you because

1915
00:55:52.241 --> 00:55:56.160
you're rich and they'll let you slide and they don't develop the character.

1916
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:59.080
They never have an opportunity to actually develop character.

1917
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.221
So they there.

1918
00:56:00.221 --> 00:56:01.450
That's why it's not,

1919
00:56:01.451 --> 00:56:05.500
they're not struggling and they're not being sneaky because they're desperado.

1920
00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:09.880
There've been sneaky because they're weak and that's just the instinct of in man

1921
00:56:09.881 --> 00:56:11.170
is to try to get out of work.

1922
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:13.360
The instinct in man has tried or did you do it?

1923
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.601
Yeah,

1924
00:56:13.601 --> 00:56:14.080
I did it.

1925
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.100
When we mean if you didn't,

1926
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.700
you know,

1927
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:17.290
the instinct is not to man up and go,

1928
00:56:17.291 --> 00:56:17.591
listen,

1929
00:56:17.591 --> 00:56:18.340
I'm going to be honest with you.

1930
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.150
I didn't do it.

1931
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:20.260
I fucked off.

1932
00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:21.880
I went out with my friends,

1933
00:56:21.881 --> 00:56:24.120
we got drunk and I forgot about it and I woke up late.

1934
00:56:24.121 --> 00:56:24.954
I'm so sorry.

1935
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:25.351
You know,

1936
00:56:25.351 --> 00:56:26.071
I don't know what to tell you,

1937
00:56:26.071 --> 00:56:27.030
but that's what happened.

1938
00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:27.361
You know,

1939
00:56:27.361 --> 00:56:28.620
it's obviously a huge error,

1940
00:56:28.621 --> 00:56:30.930
but what am I going to do now that's,

1941
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:32.070
nobody wants to do that.

1942
00:56:32.071 --> 00:56:32.910
So you bullshit.

1943
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:33.391
Oh,

1944
00:56:33.391 --> 00:56:35.220
the car totally wouldn't work.

1945
00:56:35.221 --> 00:56:36.180
We called the police,

1946
00:56:36.181 --> 00:56:37.650
we thought there was a bomb in it.

1947
00:56:37.651 --> 00:56:37.831
You know,

1948
00:56:37.831 --> 00:56:38.070
you'll,

1949
00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:40.050
you'll say all kinds of crazy shit to get out of work.

1950
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:42.300
And especially if you have a weak character,

1951
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.870
that's amazing.

1952
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:45.360
And they'll put that like,

1953
00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.450
I've been locked up with the kids that know we freeze up or something.

1954
00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:52.260
[inaudible] I been locked up with kids that I've seen the visitation.

1955
00:56:52.261 --> 00:56:54.840
I was Saturday and I've said to myself,

1956
00:56:54.841 --> 00:56:55.561
what did you do,

1957
00:56:55.561 --> 00:56:56.394
Bro?

1958
00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.820
Those are your fucking partner with you.

1959
00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:00.890
What the fuck did y'all,

1960
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:01.651
can you do this?

1961
00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:02.820
Which is nice family.

1962
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.290
The whole family would show up.

1963
00:57:04.291 --> 00:57:04.861
The sister,

1964
00:57:04.861 --> 00:57:05.550
the brother,

1965
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:05.701
well,

1966
00:57:05.701 --> 00:57:07.470
you know about Michael Douglas's son,

1967
00:57:07.471 --> 00:57:08.010
right?

1968
00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:12.840
They got beat the fuck up Pittsburgh or something broke his leg and his fingers,

1969
00:57:12.841 --> 00:57:14.250
they broke his femur.

1970
00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.040
It's fucking hard to break someone's femur.

1971
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:17.371
I mean,

1972
00:57:17.371 --> 00:57:20.580
you got to hold the leg down and stomp on it,

1973
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:21.720
you know?

1974
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.510
And this guy is fucked up and his legs in a plate now,

1975
00:57:24.511 --> 00:57:28.500
his fingers or Jack and it's because he somehow or another,

1976
00:57:28.501 --> 00:57:31.500
it was revealed that when he got a shorter sentence,

1977
00:57:31.501 --> 00:57:33.350
it was because he gave up a bunch of the drugs,

1978
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:34.681
his own lawyer.

1979
00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:35.251
Fuck dumb.

1980
00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:36.330
Or someone fucked some.

1981
00:57:36.331 --> 00:57:37.164
Oh fuck.

1982
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:38.190
I'm self that dude.

1983
00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:39.180
Yeah.

1984
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:39.870
He did something.

1985
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:41.070
It's Michael Douglas aside.

1986
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:41.550
I mean,

1987
00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:43.750
Michael Douglas has been famous for a long,

1988
00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:45.140
he's come to the conditional,

1989
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:49.830
remember the same son that's not the same fucked up at night.

1990
00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.170
No brother.

1991
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.250
That's the brothers.

1992
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:54.780
His family used to come into the store at night.

1993
00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:55.680
That's Michael Douglass,

1994
00:57:55.681 --> 00:57:56.870
his brother now,

1995
00:57:56.871 --> 00:57:59.730
and then this kid went to New York and was dealing in Memphis.

1996
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:03.860
That doesn't look at all of those fucking famous fowl.

1997
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.660
The kids like that.

1998
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:06.573
Yeah.

1999
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:08.250
Not good at once.

2000
00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.320
They found that that you're not the only way they get still loans.

2001
00:58:10.321 --> 00:58:11.250
Kid overdosed.

2002
00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.173
Did he really?

2003
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.250
Not what it was at that low,

2004
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.300
but he had a drug problem,

2005
00:58:15.301 --> 00:58:15.690
right?

2006
00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:16.501
No.

2007
00:58:16.501 --> 00:58:17.334
Really?

2008
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:18.331
Yeah.

2009
00:58:18.331 --> 00:58:18.541
No,

2010
00:58:18.541 --> 00:58:19.261
I don't think so.

2011
00:58:19.261 --> 00:58:20.094
That's what they said.

2012
00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:20.880
I,

2013
00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:21.710
that's what I had heard.

2014
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.991
Let me,

2015
00:58:21.991 --> 00:58:22.950
I should go with that.

2016
00:58:22.951 --> 00:58:23.830
So don't,

2017
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:25.853
<v 6>okay.</v>

2018
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:26.851
<v 0>By the way,</v>

2019
00:58:26.851 --> 00:58:31.851
you got to check out not the father.tumblr.com and it's just all these Gif and

2020
00:58:34.391 --> 00:58:35.380
masons from that,

2021
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:35.920
from,

2022
00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.600
you're not the father episodes.

2023
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:38.321
Yeah.

2024
00:58:38.321 --> 00:58:42.070
It says possible drug overdose dies from pill overdose.

2025
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:42.933
Yeah,

2026
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:45.243
<v 6>yeah.</v>

2027
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.213
<v 0>You know?</v>

2028
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:50.163
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2029
00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:50.521
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2030
00:58:50.521 --> 00:58:51.900
They're saying an overdose man.

2031
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.880
Really?

2032
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.370
Yeah.

2033
00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:54.960
That's what most of these sites are saying.

2034
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:59.743
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2035
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:00.911
<v 0>Whatever.</v>

2036
00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:01.031
I mean,

2037
00:59:01.031 --> 00:59:01.331
I mean,

2038
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:02.590
I don't think you have to release it,

2039
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:03.280
so they might not,

2040
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.630
they might just be speculating.

2041
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:05.464
I don't think so.

2042
00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:07.690
I was just alone would have to release why son died.

2043
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.190
That's gotta be fucking devastated,

2044
00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.253
devastated.

2045
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:11.021
These guys.

2046
00:59:11.021 --> 00:59:12.370
Like you know a guy likes alone.

2047
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.791
First of all,

2048
00:59:12.791 --> 00:59:15.010
he's not with the wife anymore of that kid.

2049
00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:16.500
He hasn't forever.

2050
00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:17.321
He has it been a forever.

2051
00:59:17.321 --> 00:59:18.280
And then on top of that,

2052
00:59:18.281 --> 00:59:22.820
he's probably doing these movies where he's in Thailand for six months and this

2053
00:59:22.821 --> 00:59:23.780
place for six months.

2054
00:59:23.781 --> 00:59:26.990
You know he's doing Rambo and shit and flying all over the place and must be

2055
00:59:26.991 --> 00:59:28.970
fucking really hard to also be a father.

2056
00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:32.240
It's a lot of those dudes become drug addicts.

2057
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:33.680
So that is true.

2058
00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:34.971
It's a lot of them.

2059
00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:35.804
Right?

2060
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:39.830
They would tell me that one of those thousand oaks high school,

2061
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.870
the big thing was heroin up there.

2062
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:44.750
I bet was up there.

2063
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:45.201
I bet.

2064
00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:46.880
Oxies when I was a fucking kid,

2065
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:47.380
we smoked,

2066
00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:48.950
they sold joints at school.

2067
00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.720
Some people sold little hits,

2068
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:52.310
a fucking Mike with that acid,

2069
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.240
you know,

2070
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.290
two hours a piece.

2071
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:55.150
But fucking heroin,

2072
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.480
you ain't going to send you that shit.

2073
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:57.703
Cold

2074
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.193
high school,

2075
01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:03.500
you know it was referring little pills and those sheets of paper that we're

2076
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:04.334
asking them.

2077
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.320
That's it values all that shit.

2078
01:00:06.321 --> 01:00:07.700
You had to go over the fucking bridge.

2079
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.240
You know you had to go to Washington square park and something to get the party

2080
01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:12.590
started and those fucking days.

2081
01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:14.180
But I think those thousand oaks kids,

2082
01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:16.850
first of all you were like way out in the suburbs too.

2083
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:20.870
And all it takes is one freak bitch to convert the whole fucking bathroom I need

2084
01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:24.710
to do is have one kid that's this down to do some h.

2085
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.950
Dot.

2086
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:25.790
Do some age bro.

2087
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:29.060
And that some one Puerto Rican kid that's like a year older than everybody

2088
01:00:29.061 --> 01:00:30.140
that's been held back.

2089
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:33.260
But fucking heroin bro.

2090
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.510
He's drinking a bottle of Boone's farm.

2091
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:37.970
You stole from your uncle's place or something like that.

2092
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.790
The strawberry shit that you got and you go,

2093
01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:41.990
I'll never dropped that thing again.

2094
01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:45.920
Fucking heroin it to smoke it and I don't want a straw with a little bit of

2095
01:00:45.921 --> 01:00:46.754
foil.

2096
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:48.950
I never even seen that type of shit.

2097
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:50.390
That's disgusting.

2098
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:51.140
It's gross.

2099
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:51.741
It's gross.

2100
01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:52.311
And not some,

2101
01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:56.150
like that's like some proven stupid shit for decades.

2102
01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.940
It's not like something new like was heroin.

2103
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:59.803
It's not like,

2104
01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.151
you know,

2105
01:01:00.151 --> 01:01:02.030
like nobody's had problems with it yet.

2106
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:03.200
It's not like bath salts.

2107
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.801
You know what I mean?

2108
01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:03.951
Like,

2109
01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:04.131
dude,

2110
01:01:04.131 --> 01:01:04.790
I'm telling you man,

2111
01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:06.680
basketballs remains like nothing even happened.

2112
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.001
She's due a dude.

2113
01:01:08.001 --> 01:01:08.834
Don't worry about it.

2114
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:09.591
Said some shit.

2115
01:01:09.591 --> 01:01:11.180
I sent Stan hope stand out,

2116
01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.290
didn't know about,

2117
01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:13.070
uh,

2118
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.560
that we had McAfee on the podcast and we were,

2119
01:01:15.561 --> 01:01:16.280
uh,

2120
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.150
going over it and I told him about that,

2121
01:01:19.151 --> 01:01:20.300
the whole bath salts thing.

2122
01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.620
He didn't know about that either.

2123
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.120
So then I went back and I said,

2124
01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:25.280
I'll send you some links so you gotta you gotta you gotta read some of that

2125
01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:25.640
stuff.

2126
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.920
So I went back and read some of it myself.

2127
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.150
One of the things that McAfee said that he,

2128
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:32.450
he did like a whole,

2129
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:34.820
like an interview for like one of these,

2130
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.590
a radar in line or something like that about bath salts.

2131
01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.391
But how awesome.

2132
01:01:38.391 --> 01:01:39.620
Pass all serious.

2133
01:01:39.621 --> 01:01:40.454
Yeah.

2134
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:41.330
Yeah.

2135
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.380
But bath salts,

2136
01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:44.720
are the finest drug ever conceived?

2137
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.613
That's what he said.

2138
01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.121
Yeah.

2139
01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:48.290
He's now in the United States.

2140
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:49.610
He's in California probably.

2141
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.110
He confessed that he's a huge fan of MDPV,

2142
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:57.830
better known as bath salts and worked for a year trying to purify psychoactive

2143
01:01:57.831 --> 01:02:01.310
drugs from compounds commercially available over the Internet.

2144
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.190
This is apparently,

2145
01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:06.080
he says this is all bullshit now,

2146
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.100
but in of course this sir.

2147
01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:09.471
Okay.

2148
01:02:09.471 --> 01:02:10.670
This is not an interview.

2149
01:02:10.671 --> 01:02:14.490
This is all based on articles online that he stuffed it.

2150
01:02:14.491 --> 01:02:16.110
He wrote on that a drug.

2151
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:16.910
Okay.

2152
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:17.390
All the,

2153
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:18.070
yeah.

2154
01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:20.050
He's hilarious.

2155
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.650
Yeah,

2156
01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:21.760
Karen Anymore Stan Hope,

2157
01:02:21.761 --> 01:02:22.481
but no idea though.

2158
01:02:22.481 --> 01:02:24.030
He didn't know that it was this though.

2159
01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.450
The whole story is this bananas?

2160
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.811
You know what?

2161
01:02:25.811 --> 01:02:26.291
I lied.

2162
01:02:26.291 --> 01:02:28.120
There was PCP when I was in high school.

2163
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:28.781
Oh yeah.

2164
01:02:28.781 --> 01:02:30.110
There was a,

2165
01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:31.000
that was a,

2166
01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.800
what I called PHC crystal,

2167
01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:34.270
which is really a PCP.

2168
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.050
It was really just watered down.

2169
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.690
Fucking piece of shit was good though.

2170
01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.191
That shit was good.

2171
01:02:39.191 --> 01:02:40.024
I liked it.

2172
01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:43.030
I type on my boxing coach when I was in my bar.

2173
01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:44.530
When I was in Boston,

2174
01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:48.250
my boxing coach got his finger bitten off when he was on PCP.

2175
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.140
So many bent his finger off and they took his toe off because the singer was

2176
01:02:53.141 --> 01:02:53.740
gone.

2177
01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.740
It's like from like a,

2178
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:57.190
from the first knuckle,

2179
01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.600
the knuckle to the side,

2180
01:02:58.601 --> 01:02:59.470
like that first stub,

2181
01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:00.101
this part right here,

2182
01:03:00.101 --> 01:03:00.934
it will still there.

2183
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.960
The rest of it was missing.

2184
01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.730
So what they did was they took,

2185
01:03:03.731 --> 01:03:04.930
is not as big tub,

2186
01:03:04.931 --> 01:03:09.931
but the second toe they removed that toe and they created a finger.

2187
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:12.640
They put the bones back in,

2188
01:03:12.641 --> 01:03:13.570
screwed in place,

2189
01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.070
but you couldn't get it to work.

2190
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:20.050
So he hadn't permanently curved so that he can be able to throw his right hook.

2191
01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.400
So like,

2192
01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:21.701
you know,

2193
01:03:21.701 --> 01:03:25.030
he didn't want to like have a finger like that where it couldn't box anymore

2194
01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.260
because that's the only option.

2195
01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:29.080
The option was you could have it fully straight or you can have it permanently

2196
01:03:29.081 --> 01:03:29.730
correct.

2197
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.160
<v 4>So he took it permanently</v>

2198
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:34.183
book,

2199
01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.320
what am I going do with my shot?

2200
01:03:36.321 --> 01:03:36.561
I got it.

2201
01:03:36.561 --> 01:03:37.850
I fucking lifted the body.

2202
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.271
I used,

2203
01:03:38.271 --> 01:03:39.290
stepped in with the right hook.

2204
01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:40.040
That's good night.

2205
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.330
I'm not taking away good night.

2206
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:42.920
So he uh,

2207
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.560
he kept a finger fucking that thing going away.

2208
01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:46.443
Good night.

2209
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:46.911
So,

2210
01:03:46.911 --> 01:03:47.744
uh,

2211
01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:48.830
I was um,

2212
01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:52.850
I was teaching him a taekwondo when he was teaching me boxing and uh,

2213
01:03:52.851 --> 01:03:55.850
he would be shuffling around with that fucking four toed foot,

2214
01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.770
three toes and no,

2215
01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:58.281
no,

2216
01:03:58.281 --> 01:03:58.760
nothing.

2217
01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.690
A big gapper,

2218
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.160
a big floppy gapper

2219
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:01.881
<v 0>between,</v>

2220
01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:02.530
uh,

2221
01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:02.720
the,

2222
01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.610
these toes over here in the big toe.

2223
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.510
There was just one was missing and he's just trying to shuffle around and throw

2224
01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:08.861
that file.

2225
01:04:08.861 --> 01:04:09.130
Fucking

2226
01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.180
<v 4>creepy hybrid,</v>

2227
01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.253
right hook.

2228
01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.213
That was,

2229
01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:13.690
it was a toe.

2230
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.410
So when he was shaking his hand,

2231
01:04:15.411 --> 01:04:16.840
you were shaking a little bit of a toe,

2232
01:04:16.841 --> 01:04:19.720
a little bit of toe was in his hand and always smelled like feet.

2233
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:20.610
Oh,

2234
01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:21.890
it was a thicker finger,

2235
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:22.763
you know,

2236
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:24.670
like a mason and 83,

2237
01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:28.530
I had this gig running numbers from like 10 to two in the afternoon,

2238
01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.051
the hundred,

2239
01:04:29.051 --> 01:04:30.910
18th and third for these Puerto Rican.

2240
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:31.763
I had grown up with,

2241
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:33.070
I had nothing.

2242
01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:33.970
I had no job.

2243
01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:34.870
I had no direction.

2244
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:36.280
So I went to him like a man.

2245
01:04:36.281 --> 01:04:36.431
I go,

2246
01:04:36.431 --> 01:04:37.330
I just need a little help.

2247
01:04:37.331 --> 01:04:40.250
And they would just draw me like a buck 20 a day just to go with and eat their

2248
01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:41.084
food.

2249
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.070
Tall stories.

2250
01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:44.230
They caught me walking around the block,

2251
01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:46.620
go get this and wasn't that when I was like,

2252
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.880
Nah,

2253
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.350
what I do,

2254
01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.330
and he'll tell you we're doing it up in Brooklyn if you want to go up.

2255
01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:49.781
They go up to,

2256
01:04:49.781 --> 01:04:53.530
but it's a short day because when they switched tracks the numbers fuck up.

2257
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.940
So I'm walking and I'm going to get a bag of a refund and those days Harlem at

2258
01:04:57.941 --> 01:05:00.990
really good Thai stick and I'm walking in and get this bag.

2259
01:05:00.991 --> 01:05:01.470
Every friend,

2260
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:02.500
this chick comes out to me,

2261
01:05:02.501 --> 01:05:05.450
Joe Rogan cute and I'm not really checking around.

2262
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:05.771
She goes,

2263
01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:07.240
do you want to go partners on?

2264
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.380
So whatever.

2265
01:05:08.381 --> 01:05:08.951
She called it,

2266
01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:09.990
junk Jonestown,

2267
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:10.991
what happened?

2268
01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:11.291
I'm like,

2269
01:05:11.291 --> 01:05:11.471
yeah,

2270
01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:12.400
I got some cute girl.

2271
01:05:12.401 --> 01:05:15.520
Just comes up to you and black girl,

2272
01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.760
10 30 in the morning comes up to me and says,

2273
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:20.500
you want to go partners on some Jonestown town?

2274
01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:23.620
Because what you do is they had a bag of dope for 20 bucks,

2275
01:05:23.621 --> 01:05:24.454
which is refund.

2276
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.770
And then for like three bucks you got a tray.

2277
01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:28.420
That's what they called them trays.

2278
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:32.290
So she lets go partners on two trays and we'll split it with a spliff or

2279
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:33.220
whatever the fuck he saying.

2280
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.083
Wow.

2281
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:36.110
So basically you take the reefer,

2282
01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.010
you put in a paper and then you take the train and you sprinkle the dust and the

2283
01:05:39.011 --> 01:05:39.341
joint.

2284
01:05:39.341 --> 01:05:41.110
You wrote it and you bang it up.

2285
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.900
We started smoking this motherfucker and in the middle of this he tells me that

2286
01:05:44.901 --> 01:05:45.734
she's pregnant.

2287
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.970
Why this bitch is by then she shows me a little belly.

2288
01:05:48.971 --> 01:05:49.361
She's like,

2289
01:05:49.361 --> 01:05:49.541
yeah,

2290
01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:51.190
but I'm booked on these trays and shit.

2291
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.870
I didn't fuck her or nothing.

2292
01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:53.081
Like,

2293
01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:53.914
I don't know.

2294
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.480
But I remember we hung out like from 12 till like nine o'clock that night.

2295
01:05:57.970 --> 01:05:58.803
Shit.

2296
01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.700
I remember taking the bus go.

2297
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.840
God Damn.

2298
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.350
I just smoked fucking Jones town with a pregnant fucking black tea.

2299
01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.200
That's when they would give them names and that shit,

2300
01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:09.790
whatever the tragedy had just happened.

2301
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.400
Like what was the black basketball player from the Celtics?

2302
01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:17.140
So it was a rookie and he did coke and he done by bias.

2303
01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:17.561
I'm like,

2304
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:19.660
the next day you go over to Harlem,

2305
01:06:19.661 --> 01:06:20.021
go go.

2306
01:06:20.021 --> 01:06:20.681
Who's got the blue?

2307
01:06:20.681 --> 01:06:22.450
I got the shit that killed bias mother.

2308
01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:23.363
Fuck.

2309
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.120
They always did that.

2310
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:26.170
That was always there.

2311
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.030
Do you remember when we was always government?

2312
01:06:29.031 --> 01:06:29.130
Yeah,

2313
01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:29.910
<v 0>weed.</v>

2314
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:30.900
It was always the government.

2315
01:06:30.901 --> 01:06:31.681
I got the government,

2316
01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:32.570
we just shit,

2317
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.161
what was it called?

2318
01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:39.590
Like end 13 or so like a name for [inaudible] 17 man,

2319
01:06:39.591 --> 01:06:41.670
there's only 10 people in the country and then I have to get this.

2320
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.310
They get,

2321
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:43.320
they get this from the government.

2322
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:43.770
Yeah,

2323
01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:44.401
the government.

2324
01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:47.370
We'd was like the best weed for the longest time.

2325
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.500
Like if you got ahold of some government weed,

2326
01:06:49.501 --> 01:06:50.730
that was like some serious shit.

2327
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.750
Isn't that hilarious?

2328
01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:54.480
That's how far we'd come.

2329
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:55.463
You know,

2330
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.760
there's a lot of God damn weed snobs out there and they need to relax.

2331
01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.713
Let it go.

2332
01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:01.643
You know what else?

2333
01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:04.320
People that want to tell them you never had our,

2334
01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.290
we'd shut up.

2335
01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.780
Please shut the fuck up.

2336
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.710
Just please,

2337
01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.753
please.

2338
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:10.830
There is no stronger weed anywhere now.

2339
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.670
It's a pretty,

2340
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:12.840
pretty much a saturation.

2341
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.850
The Shit that we got an Austin or that shit.

2342
01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:15.451
We got an Austin,

2343
01:07:15.451 --> 01:07:16.050
Texas.

2344
01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:17.070
Oh my Jesus.

2345
01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:18.360
Oh my Jesus.

2346
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:21.450
And you know what the strongest Shit I've gotten all year from Seattle,

2347
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.261
Seattle,

2348
01:07:22.261 --> 01:07:23.280
when they made it legal,

2349
01:07:23.281 --> 01:07:24.720
they just took shit to the neck,

2350
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.400
the Voodoo chicken and moot,

2351
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:26.791
you know,

2352
01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:27.960
hooked me up and I was there.

2353
01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:32.210
They gave me this joint that was like a fucking direct.

2354
01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:33.870
I remember those old school operators,

2355
01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:34.291
you know,

2356
01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:38.280
they would pick up the phone operator and it was right to God just went right to

2357
01:07:38.281 --> 01:07:38.910
him.

2358
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:40.210
He just smoked that weed.

2359
01:07:40.211 --> 01:07:41.280
And before I went on stage,

2360
01:07:41.281 --> 01:07:46.281
I remember sitting in the back room just feeling so vulnerable and so,

2361
01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.280
but so alive and in tuned to everything.

2362
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.560
And me and a Sam AAA,

2363
01:07:52.561 --> 01:07:54.480
Sam Aaa was baked out of his fucking mind.

2364
01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.381
I mean it was,

2365
01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:56.214
it was,

2366
01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:57.240
it was dangerous.

2367
01:07:57.241 --> 01:07:57.561
Like wow,

2368
01:07:57.561 --> 01:08:00.370
this might be too high to talk to talk.

2369
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:01.223
I'm going to tell you something.

2370
01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:02.790
Okay,

2371
01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:04.690
<v 4>let's see how Oregon and Colorado,</v>

2372
01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:08.440
I've always had that strong and if you look at fucking,

2373
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:11.010
or we're going to run this from northern California to over me,

2374
01:08:11.011 --> 01:08:12.130
you know area that Oh yeah,

2375
01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:14.590
but you gotta Let rain that affects people.

2376
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.090
Effects are that weed.

2377
01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:16.630
Oh yeah.

2378
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:17.750
Cause that's outdoor weed.

2379
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:19.640
Now you add some altitude,

2380
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:23.990
which there is some little out the to 2000 feet up in the mount.

2381
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.530
Ranier whatever the fuck those mountains.

2382
01:08:25.531 --> 01:08:26.900
I'm a geology major.

2383
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:27.763
Whatever the fuck it is.

2384
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:28.701
Colorado,

2385
01:08:28.701 --> 01:08:29.534
same thing.

2386
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.100
The higher that we've got,

2387
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:34.520
the high you got up until that fucking mountain that we just got fucking

2388
01:08:34.530 --> 01:08:35.363
stronger.

2389
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.171
Yeah.

2390
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:37.910
Dog in the winter time and all that.

2391
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.590
There's something to that weed.

2392
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:42.830
I smoked some deadly fuck a weed in Colorado,

2393
01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:43.470
20 years.

2394
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:45.230
I don't care what anybody tells me.

2395
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:49.190
If I get 28% this shit was off the fucking charts and shit that grow it.

2396
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:49.790
Now,

2397
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:54.790
the shit that grown out here now in a year we're going to have 45% we'd just

2398
01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:57.350
clean shit that you're smoking it.

2399
01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.070
Done,

2400
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.903
done.

2401
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.510
Do you think that there's going to be any repercussions to these states making

2402
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:02.961
it illegal?

2403
01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:05.930
Obama said right now that they're not going to go on and after people,

2404
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.050
but that doesn't mean anything because they said they were only going to go

2405
01:09:09.051 --> 01:09:13.220
after people that violated both state and federal law when he came to marijuana.

2406
01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.500
But I don't think that was necessarily the case.

2407
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.040
I think the DEA just went after people that their operation was too big.

2408
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:20.120
I think that was a lot of it.

2409
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:20.900
I think that,

2410
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:21.920
what do you think they're going to do here?

2411
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:22.840
Between you and I?

2412
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:23.041
What?

2413
01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:23.280
What?

2414
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.460
What does the federal government shut?

2415
01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:26.294
Shit.

2416
01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:26.840
Yeah,

2417
01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.030
so eventually one morning we're going to wake up,

2418
01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:29.960
we're going to turn it into something.

2419
01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:33.180
There's going to be a bunch of fucking people on the street and they're going to

2420
01:09:33.181 --> 01:09:33.770
raid.

2421
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:38.000
You know they're going to take all the resources of one day and raid 20 fucking

2422
01:09:38.001 --> 01:09:42.170
stores and lock up and confiscated the big ones and hit him where it hurts and

2423
01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:43.010
the fucking pocket.

2424
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.580
I know we're gonna cut out funding or something to the site.

2425
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:48.140
Something's going to go down.

2426
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.000
I don't think it needs funding.

2427
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:53.360
The government is not going to have egg on their face even though that whatever

2428
01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:55.700
they're doing in Colorado with the marijuana,

2429
01:09:55.701 --> 01:09:58.700
with the medical marijuana situation is fucking beautiful.

2430
01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:03.320
I think in Colorado just went full like fucking legal marijuana and took that

2431
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:05.840
money and tax did heavily look.

2432
01:10:05.841 --> 01:10:07.790
If you're gonna allow people to say so weed,

2433
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.100
why not charge 20% taxes?

2434
01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:11.780
I think that's really reasonable.

2435
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:12.171
Yeah,

2436
01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:14.180
20% taxes on everything you sell.

2437
01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:15.260
Let's just do that.

2438
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:18.620
Then that money goes straight to the schools.

2439
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.501
Straight to the COBB.

2440
01:10:19.501 --> 01:10:20.420
Straight to the teachers.

2441
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:21.321
I mean that'd be honest.

2442
01:10:21.321 --> 01:10:23.660
How much markup is on weed as it is right now?

2443
01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:26.750
Imagine it being legal where everyone can girl like weeds going to be like

2444
01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:27.620
fucking grass.

2445
01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.120
Exactly.

2446
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.590
I didn't give a shit mark that said like,

2447
01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.071
let us,

2448
01:10:30.071 --> 01:10:31.610
like you go to a supermarket,

2449
01:10:31.611 --> 01:10:33.440
you buy a head of lettuce for like three bucks or whatever.

2450
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:35.660
You know how long it takes to grow a fucking head of lettuce.

2451
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:36.381
It's amazing.

2452
01:10:36.381 --> 01:10:37.580
You can get one for $3,

2453
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:41.450
you can get a nutritious piece of vegetable that's a long fucking time to grow

2454
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:42.530
and you get up at three bucks.

2455
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:44.110
That's what it would be like for wheat.

2456
01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:44.630
Cause those,

2457
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:47.160
when you go up to Santa Barbara and you see those uh,

2458
01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.720
strawberry patches where they just go on like Ochsner,

2459
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.990
they just go on and on and on.

2460
01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:51.913
That will be weed.

2461
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.753
It will all be there.

2462
01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.430
And then they'll have to have armed guards because high school kids be sneaking

2463
01:10:55.431 --> 01:10:56.720
in and stealing your fucking weed.

2464
01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.190
It's not going to be [inaudible].

2465
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.961
They probably going to be like,

2466
01:10:58.961 --> 01:10:59.150
Hey,

2467
01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:00.050
take whatever you want.

2468
01:11:00.051 --> 01:11:00.980
Yeah,

2469
01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.690
we got a lot of it.

2470
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.070
I see the scar face.

2471
01:11:04.071 --> 01:11:06.660
We got whips the coke off the ground and the fucking licks it.

2472
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.300
It was just on the floor.

2473
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.920
You know what I'm saying?

2474
01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.650
Was people fucking for the people don't understand that you're going to have,

2475
01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.300
if you,

2476
01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.080
you made legal

2477
01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.430
<v 0>weed and you're going to,</v>

2478
01:11:15.431 --> 01:11:17.170
anytime you have people that are smoking weed,

2479
01:11:17.171 --> 01:11:21.880
you're going to have examples of people that are wasting their lives smoking

2480
01:11:21.881 --> 01:11:22.150
weed.

2481
01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:23.470
You're going to have those examples.

2482
01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.550
There's no doubt about it.

2483
01:11:24.551 --> 01:11:27.550
You're going to have kids that are lazy that just smoke weed and watch video

2484
01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:29.980
games and they used to be good students but they're not anymore,

2485
01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:32.470
but you're also going to have a lot of other people,

2486
01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:37.330
and this is what pisses me off the most when you see all these news reports

2487
01:11:37.331 --> 01:11:38.710
about weed and all this,

2488
01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.690
the problems that people are having with weed,

2489
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:44.200
they don't talk about the positive benefits of it.

2490
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.030
Just psychologically.

2491
01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:51.310
We all know the difference between people that we hang out with that smoke weed

2492
01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:52.480
and that don't smoke weed.

2493
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:56.350
There's a difference and one of the differences is the people that don't smoke

2494
01:11:56.351 --> 01:11:56.650
weed,

2495
01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:59.770
there's a level of reality that they don't operate in.

2496
01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:01.090
You don't go there with them,

2497
01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.250
you don't have conversations with them in that level.

2498
01:12:03.251 --> 01:12:03.910
You don't.

2499
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:04.220
There's a,

2500
01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:09.040
there's a place of a vulnerability in respect to the great of it all that they

2501
01:12:09.041 --> 01:12:10.000
don't really possess.

2502
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:14.110
They have like a lens in front of them that they don't ever take out and like

2503
01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.251
raw dog.

2504
01:12:15.251 --> 01:12:17.910
The universe when you get really high,

2505
01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.050
it's like your raw dog in the universe.

2506
01:12:20.051 --> 01:12:25.051
You're getting the whole experience in and one big crazy frightening what you

2507
01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:25.781
call it.

2508
01:12:25.781 --> 01:12:27.520
Paranoia is reality.

2509
01:12:27.730 --> 01:12:27.941
You're,

2510
01:12:27.941 --> 01:12:32.530
you should be fucking paranoid and that that marijuana rush where it really

2511
01:12:32.531 --> 01:12:37.200
likes sets all in and like makes you really take in this experience and that

2512
01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:38.440
that freaky,

2513
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.101
you know,

2514
01:12:39.101 --> 01:12:40.330
crazy high way.

2515
01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:43.631
If you,

2516
01:12:43.631 --> 01:12:45.190
if you're hanging out with people that don't smoke weed,

2517
01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.053
they don't go there,

2518
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.350
then understand that talk.

2519
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:48.240
They don't get that.

2520
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.440
<v 4>You can tell the difference.</v>

2521
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:51.600
I could tell that I don't judge people by that.

2522
01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:52.320
I really,

2523
01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.170
I know a lot of cool people that don't smoke it in a lot of great people that

2524
01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:55.950
don't smoke weed.

2525
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:57.120
I like them for that reason.

2526
01:12:57.690 --> 01:12:59.040
I liked him for that reason,

2527
01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:01.410
but I could see where the conversation ends at.

2528
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:01.740
Like,

2529
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.310
I have a friend who has a bad back but doesn't get hot and I have been trying to

2530
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:05.821
explain to him,

2531
01:13:05.821 --> 01:13:06.750
I understand you're,

2532
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:07.584
uh,

2533
01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.300
you're,

2534
01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:08.850
uh,

2535
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:10.170
lung concerns and stuff.

2536
01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:15.030
There's a fucking tablet now you could say now they have no more excuses if you

2537
01:13:15.031 --> 01:13:16.170
have a tight back or whatever,

2538
01:13:16.171 --> 01:13:18.720
they have an astro now that comes in a tablet.

2539
01:13:18.721 --> 01:13:19.720
It looks like a vitamin seat.

2540
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:23.070
Gabba then you could travel with on a flight and they won't even fucking ask

2541
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:23.760
him.

2542
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.510
So,

2543
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:25.051
and he's like,

2544
01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:25.381
no,

2545
01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:26.071
I'm scared.

2546
01:13:26.071 --> 01:13:26.521
I'm whatever.

2547
01:13:26.521 --> 01:13:27.300
Okay,

2548
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.670
then keep going to the fucking chiropractor for the next year.

2549
01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:30.721
Give it a try.

2550
01:13:30.721 --> 01:13:32.670
I know I would if I had a fucking bad back.

2551
01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:35.610
I try anything if I had a fucking bad back at that point.

2552
01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.413
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:39.021
Yeah.

2554
01:13:39.021 --> 01:13:40.970
There's some people that are in fucking serious pain

2555
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:42.991
<v 4>and that's,</v>

2556
01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:43.411
I tell you,

2557
01:13:43.411 --> 01:13:43.760
man,

2558
01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.070
uh,

2559
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:46.320
I've heard a lot of things over the list and I'm not going to,

2560
01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:48.960
I get to sit here and tell you I got meant the littleness.

2561
01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:49.741
I got VP,

2562
01:13:49.741 --> 01:13:51.000
I got an itch in my ass.

2563
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.260
I got foot fungus.

2564
01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.100
I can tell you all this shit.

2565
01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:54.240
They'll give anxiety,

2566
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.320
sleep apnea.

2567
01:13:55.321 --> 01:13:55.681
Holy Shit.

2568
01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:56.460
Don't give it to you for,

2569
01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:59.250
I was smoking weed way before it came up from medical excuses.

2570
01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:00.383
I was Spanish.

2571
01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:01.230
Yeah.

2572
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:03.950
I was smoking weed to get fucked up and see the devil planning.

2573
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:07.290
Simple to see it with at the way it was every fucking day.

2574
01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:08.140
That's why I smoke,

2575
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.090
but now you know.

2576
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.710
Now it's because of the medical thing,

2577
01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.600
have the whatever,

2578
01:14:13.601 --> 01:14:15.880
but do I see a difference in people?

2579
01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:16.151
Yeah,

2580
01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:17.140
I understand what you're saying.

2581
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:18.520
You can talk to them a little deeper.

2582
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.500
You could actually even catch them.

2583
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.330
Some people would all smoke weed.

2584
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:25.120
You can't catch them rather than anything or even confront them on anything

2585
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:27.220
because they might have a fucking heart attack.

2586
01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.421
People spoke.

2587
01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:31.780
We'd get to a point where you might take them somewhere and they'll giggle at

2588
01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:32.614
themselves.

2589
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:33.640
That's what I'm saying.

2590
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.990
There's an attitude,

2591
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:38.290
but other people that can't laugh at themselves are really,

2592
01:14:38.291 --> 01:14:39.730
I'm going to be asked to hang out with.

2593
01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.900
You got to laugh at yourself.

2594
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:44.940
Anybody who can't laugh at themselves and knowing that that's,

2595
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.390
those are the most annoying humans.

2596
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.340
You can't make fun of your own self at all.

2597
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.061
You don't.

2598
01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:49.820
You don't think,

2599
01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.030
what do you perfect kind of Douche bag.

2600
01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:52.780
Are you?

2601
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.680
What are you the Messiah,

2602
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.753
the Motherfucker,

2603
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:55.661
if that's,

2604
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:56.020
you know,

2605
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.460
one of the funniest thing about Jesus,

2606
01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:57.701
you know,

2607
01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:59.980
we were talking about people that we know that are going crazy.

2608
01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:00.813
Jesus lately.

2609
01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:05.620
One of the funny things about Jesus is that if Jesus actually really did come

2610
01:15:05.621 --> 01:15:05.921
back,

2611
01:15:05.921 --> 01:15:07.870
nobody would fucking ever believe him.

2612
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.520
Not a chance in hell.

2613
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.880
There's not a chance in hell if that dude wearing sandals and robes and his

2614
01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:15.610
beard,

2615
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:18.970
just like in the pictures was walking down the street with holes in his hand and

2616
01:15:18.971 --> 01:15:20.050
blood coming out of his hand,

2617
01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:21.670
people would probably fucking arrest him.

2618
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:25.390
Need to shoot him or arrest him or get him on antidepressants.

2619
01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:25.541
Well,

2620
01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:27.500
Jesus can't just show up to a party though,

2621
01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.373
Sam Jesus,

2622
01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:28.571
right?

2623
01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:28.691
Well,

2624
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:29.524
but he has to do something.

2625
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:30.363
He's got to do something.

2626
01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:31.980
He's got to do a big food.

2627
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.441
They would say,

2628
01:15:32.441 --> 01:15:33.131
this is the devil.

2629
01:15:33.131 --> 01:15:34.540
This is the devil trying to pretend he's Jesus.

2630
01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:35.770
He's got a set up like Gabe,

2631
01:15:35.771 --> 01:15:37.210
really good gets GSP.

2632
01:15:37.211 --> 01:15:41.710
If it gave really gotta thank GSP down and fucking break his fucking shoulder.

2633
01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.290
That's,

2634
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.851
you know what I'm saying?

2635
01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:43.970
Like something to that effect.

2636
01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.640
Something just fucking Jesus did that.

2637
01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:48.940
That's that ridiculous.

2638
01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:51.600
The salad be a miracle to be enough to convince it.

2639
01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:56.140
It's like Joey v is going down a one 85 and one of the fucking Olympics.

2640
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.960
That's,

2641
01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.310
you know,

2642
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:58.630
something that wouldn't even work.

2643
01:15:58.631 --> 01:15:59.464
You'd have to fly.

2644
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.640
You have to come back from the data.

2645
01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:00.821
I mean,

2646
01:16:00.821 --> 01:16:02.020
think about the shit that Jesus did.

2647
01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:02.980
He healed the sick.

2648
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:05.280
You didn't cure blind people then.

2649
01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.070
Was that one of the ones?

2650
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.480
Yeah.

2651
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.530
Turn water into wine though.

2652
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:08.920
That was Moses would cut the ocean.

2653
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:10.480
Cay can turn water into wine.

2654
01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:11.320
It right.

2655
01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.000
Let me ask you something about the other second year.

2656
01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.650
Did they drug test to comics?

2657
01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:15.540
Uh,

2658
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.373
we've been talking about,

2659
01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:18.110
we were talking about the daily.

2660
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.430
I'd say you've got a really bad comic and he kills three nights in a row.

2661
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:22.540
Like comics would get together.

2662
01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.830
Commit guys on weed,

2663
01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.740
the guys on fucking something testosterone.

2664
01:16:26.741 --> 01:16:27.460
We better check him.

2665
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:27.611
Well,

2666
01:16:27.611 --> 01:16:30.580
we're all on performance enhancing supplements when it comes to comedy.

2667
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:31.360
Uh,

2668
01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:31.840
we'd,

2669
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.130
we'd and Alpha brain together,

2670
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.140
there's no doubt about it.

2671
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.490
That's Goddamn performance enhancing.

2672
01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:39.880
Something for me loosens me and an edible to a certain degree.

2673
01:16:39.881 --> 01:16:42.030
Like if I eat the edible at a certain time and I'm,

2674
01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:45.130
I'm all wired up how he def on fucking stage,

2675
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.520
but it comes to a point of time when I had the bowl and I just get giggly as

2676
01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:51.490
fuck and that you can't stop at that plan.

2677
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:53.710
That's like the comfortable level.

2678
01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:58.740
Like not the scary s like skiing feeling when you're at like skiing through the

2679
01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:00.140
universe on an edible like,

2680
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:00.970
oh,

2681
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:01.870
I can't stop.

2682
01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:02.921
That's not good.

2683
01:17:02.921 --> 01:17:07.540
When you're stoned and it's dark at the comedy store that's right there.

2684
01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:09.950
When you're stoned and it's dog,

2685
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:13.790
<v 0>well you don't see nobody but the three people in front of you that you're</v>

2686
01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:17.960
talking to stone and dark and you think you're speaking to the dark.

2687
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:20.600
You're just talking into the darkness is laughter,

2688
01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:23.270
but you don't question it because you're fucked up.

2689
01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:23.950
You know what I'm saying?

2690
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:25.430
And that Hollow Echo

2691
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:27.290
that,

2692
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:28.220
oh our man,

2693
01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:30.770
you want to talk about it like a historic room.

2694
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:32.570
As far as like comedy rooms,

2695
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.670
that original room,

2696
01:17:33.671 --> 01:17:35.630
I was like one of the most historic rooms,

2697
01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:38.540
like ever in the art form of comedy,

2698
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:39.500
you know,

2699
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:39.910
there's,

2700
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:43.670
there was a weird feeling and always just being on that stage since that was

2701
01:17:43.671 --> 01:17:44.580
always like a like,

2702
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.280
wow.

2703
01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.350
It doesn't matter how many years it did stand up.

2704
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:49.970
When you're on stage and the original room,

2705
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:50.391
you're like,

2706
01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:50.661
wow,

2707
01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:51.494
this is my,

2708
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:56.510
my babies taken away because I finally figured out how I could explain the o od

2709
01:17:57.591 --> 01:18:00.980
to people because don't get it when you go to a gym,

2710
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:02.480
the old or the gym,

2711
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.280
the more you could smell it.

2712
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.130
And I don't mean there's a different older to a gym.

2713
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:09.380
It's like when you go to a good jujitsu school,

2714
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:11.330
you could smell a little foot.

2715
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:13.220
It's not overwhelming,

2716
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:15.220
but you could smell just a little footnote.

2717
01:18:15.221 --> 01:18:15.440
Yeah.

2718
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.273
Like you're like,

2719
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.660
this is a good fucking gym.

2720
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:20.030
It's just that perfect amount of footage.

2721
01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:22.710
You know what I'm saying?

2722
01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:23.540
It's just foot.

2723
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:23.781
Well,

2724
01:18:23.781 --> 01:18:28.781
this is one thing that you do get from places that have a lot of experience and

2725
01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:30.650
that's like they have a weird vibe to him.

2726
01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:31.610
Like the Ice House,

2727
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:34.490
like we were at the Ice House the other day after it was closed,

2728
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.320
it was dark out and we're standing in the back.

2729
01:18:36.321 --> 01:18:36.621
I was like,

2730
01:18:36.621 --> 01:18:37.820
feel this room man,

2731
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.740
this room has got like a crazy vibration and it sounds like total like hippy

2732
01:18:42.741 --> 01:18:43.574
bullshit.

2733
01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:46.430
That sounds like nonsense.

2734
01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:48.350
Like objects do not have memory.

2735
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:50.480
That's what Cara Santa Maria would tell you.

2736
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:53.300
There's no evidence that objects have memory,

2737
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:55.210
but there's a field that places have,

2738
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.290
whether that's a self imposed feel,

2739
01:18:57.710 --> 01:19:00.050
you've maybe created it and your own imagination.

2740
01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:02.990
But when I stand in the back room of the Ice House,

2741
01:19:02.991 --> 01:19:03.681
I stand there.

2742
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:04.120
I just saw,

2743
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:04.371
I go,

2744
01:19:04.371 --> 01:19:05.204
wow,

2745
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:06.470
this is a crazy ass room.

2746
01:19:06.471 --> 01:19:08.990
Like Steve Martin motherfucker performed here.

2747
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.033
You know what I mean?

2748
01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.000
I mean,

2749
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:11.480
I used to,

2750
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.620
I watched George Lopez kill there in the 90s Carol,

2751
01:19:15.621 --> 01:19:17.690
when George Lopez was on fire,

2752
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:22.870
like the late nineties before George Lopez at any TV shows maybe had like a few

2753
01:19:23.331 --> 01:19:26.660
things going on when he was just hitting it hard in the clubs every night.

2754
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.750
I watched him destroy in that ice house,

2755
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.980
the road he's got,

2756
01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:31.041
oh,

2757
01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:32.240
this is like a sign up there.

2758
01:19:32.241 --> 01:19:36.380
And when George Lopez was at his prime there where he sold out like fucking 15

2759
01:19:36.381 --> 01:19:38.600
shows in a row there or something crazy like that,

2760
01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.493
you know,

2761
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:40.341
and I,

2762
01:19:40.341 --> 01:19:42.170
that place has seen some shit.

2763
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:43.041
No,

2764
01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:45.550
but it's nothing like walking up the stairs and see original.

2765
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:48.710
Nothing like making that left up those stairs.

2766
01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:50.210
When you're walking straight and somebody goes,

2767
01:19:50.211 --> 01:19:52.440
well then right or wrong,

2768
01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:53.280
we know what we're talking about.

2769
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.570
Can you feel it motherfuckers,

2770
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.210
when you first go in there and you're like,

2771
01:19:56.211 --> 01:19:56.661
which way?

2772
01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:56.840
That,

2773
01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.290
okay,

2774
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:58.450
move that curtain aside.

2775
01:19:58.451 --> 01:20:01.880
You walk up those fucking stairs and just that older,

2776
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:04.040
it smells like a little bit of booze,

2777
01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.780
a little bit like pussy,

2778
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:06.950
a little bit of sweat,

2779
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.280
bad calmly.

2780
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.031
<v 4>Good comedy,</v>

2781
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:09.221
boom.

2782
01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:10.054
Smells like

2783
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.750
it just smells like success.

2784
01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:13.890
It's just smells like something,

2785
01:20:13.891 --> 01:20:17.820
something is in the air that you got to do your thing in that you really got to

2786
01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:18.720
do your thing in there.

2787
01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.680
And then when you sit in the back and you feel the lights would go off and on

2788
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:27.980
and you'd hear that z z is the lights and you know,

2789
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.850
it's just a weird little comedy thing you ever get to do a user hosted open

2790
01:20:32.851 --> 01:20:33.331
mikes there,

2791
01:20:33.331 --> 01:20:33.600
right.

2792
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.620
I read that was my job.

2793
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.710
I hosted the open mic but why was the 10 o'clock guy,

2794
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:40.830
you know what's cool about that when the lights were on with all the different

2795
01:20:40.831 --> 01:20:42.050
people's names please.

2796
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.750
Yeah.

2797
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.180
You know you get to see Sam Kinison and neon.

2798
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.820
That was one of my biggest scams of all time hosting at the comedy store.

2799
01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:49.710
Why is it a scam?

2800
01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:51.570
Because I had a perfect deal.

2801
01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:54.270
I would fucking go up there,

2802
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.730
get 25 bucks to host.

2803
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:58.680
I would do 2015 upfront.

2804
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.821
I will give you a call,

2805
01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:02.820
Rogan a dice and tell him to come down cause I was hosting and I put you up

2806
01:21:02.821 --> 01:21:03.654
first.

2807
01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.670
You guys went up to the hour and I go home

2808
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:10.410
and don virus or close the show and that's the way it was.

2809
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:11.990
I would go up there and do his set,

2810
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.230
bring up the fucking store.

2811
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:15.140
The problem was now we uh,

2812
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:19.440
when we were there all the time we were doing comedy store comedy and then when

2813
01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:23.010
we would go somewhere else we would bring comedy store comedy to them too.

2814
01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:25.410
And there was a lot of places that could not handle it.

2815
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:27.700
You remember when you got fucking kicked out of Dublin's

2816
01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:33.510
fucking 97 or something like that.

2817
01:21:33.511 --> 01:21:34.270
We go and do it.

2818
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:39.240
I sat at Dublin's and all of a sudden I hear yelling and whatnot.

2819
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:42.960
Joey has got some chicken and ice house like a freezer,

2820
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:47.440
like a giant like in room freezer and he's eating coke off her pussy and less

2821
01:21:47.441 --> 01:21:50.750
security comes in and tells me the fucking,

2822
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:53.580
there's a camera in there and they're watching it.

2823
01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:54.853
That place.

2824
01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:55.993
Yeah,

2825
01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.233
I put the coconut,

2826
01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.350
my sock and the cops came and I'm standing in front of the fucking thing with

2827
01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:03.270
the CIC crying with her girlfriends.

2828
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:05.310
I've never had that happen before.

2829
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.140
And the guy with the long hair

2830
01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:12.780
almost died and all this shit cause he was there with them.

2831
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.060
I see the girl in the hallway and I'm like,

2832
01:22:15.061 --> 01:22:15.701
what's going on and stay.

2833
01:22:15.701 --> 01:22:19.140
They don't want to say she's got blow lines of boats talking to say something

2834
01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:21.420
stupid like almost fucking killed him.

2835
01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:22.950
Killed you.

2836
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:26.220
Walk out of here but the best or something sitting there fucking,

2837
01:22:26.221 --> 01:22:27.780
I got the eight ball in my soccer is,

2838
01:22:27.781 --> 01:22:31.170
I'm not giving that mother fuck up until the cops got that for you.

2839
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.730
I'm old school with the cop.

2840
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:33.930
Won't nothing happen.

2841
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:35.790
Where's the rest of the drugs are downstairs?

2842
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:36.361
Let me search.

2843
01:22:36.361 --> 01:22:37.320
You can't search me.

2844
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.000
You can't fucking search me.

2845
01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:39.721
You have no reason.

2846
01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:40.860
It's his word against mine.

2847
01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:41.910
Where's the tape?

2848
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:42.421
You know,

2849
01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:43.650
I wouldn't hold on to that coke,

2850
01:22:43.651 --> 01:22:44.760
but that's the savior.

2851
01:22:44.761 --> 01:22:46.350
That night was Ralphie May.

2852
01:22:46.351 --> 01:22:50.100
He went to the all you can eat at the Japanese fucking place across the street.

2853
01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.690
What's the name of the Japanese place?

2854
01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:55.700
But y'all [inaudible] y'all get exact place there anymore.

2855
01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.940
One of those fights taco now.

2856
01:22:57.941 --> 01:22:58.350
All right.

2857
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:59.410
It's in the pink Taco.

2858
01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:01.710
It's a magical place.

2859
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.960
Paint Taco that place for Vegas.

2860
01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.140
Do you know the pink Taco is place in the hard

2861
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:06.993
<v 0>rock in Vegas?</v>

2862
01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:07.853
Good place.

2863
01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:09.270
They opened a Taco spot.

2864
01:23:09.271 --> 01:23:11.100
They're now at a Japanese Sushi place.

2865
01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:11.900
Yeah.

2866
01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:13.230
And it's a hot place to like,

2867
01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.800
it's where all the celebrities go to.

2868
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.590
So what happened to the TACO place up to corner that's still there.

2869
01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:22.560
The little one on the [inaudible] $92 to get two tacos.

2870
01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:24.600
Bad tacos though.

2871
01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:25.711
Yeah,

2872
01:23:25.711 --> 01:23:26.290
there was a lot.

2873
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:27.540
Benito's is the best.

2874
01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:28.403
It's Benito was good.

2875
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.830
The ninos is fantastic and it's 24 hours.

2876
01:23:31.831 --> 01:23:32.670
He's out on Beverly.

2877
01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.533
Is that what it is?

2878
01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.060
We used to always go there after the Improv.

2879
01:23:36.061 --> 01:23:37.230
That places sensational.

2880
01:23:37.231 --> 01:23:38.850
That is legit.

2881
01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:40.651
Connie,

2882
01:23:40.651 --> 01:23:41.700
I sat out my friend,

2883
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:43.410
extra hot sauce.

2884
01:23:43.411 --> 01:23:44.430
Don't play games.

2885
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:45.840
Oh Shit.

2886
01:23:45.841 --> 01:23:48.120
Connie has sided with the all the wheel fresh,

2887
01:23:48.121 --> 01:23:52.380
chopped Cilantro and onions in that motherfucker and they have pickled Jalapenos

2888
01:23:52.381 --> 01:23:52.630
there.

2889
01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:54.300
Take your chances with those bitches.

2890
01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:55.141
Yeah.

2891
01:23:55.141 --> 01:23:56.850
And then throw some hot sauce on that fucker.

2892
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:57.763
Two o'clock.

2893
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:59.431
And by the way,

2894
01:23:59.431 --> 01:24:00.600
it's packed with drunks.

2895
01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:01.590
Packs with drugs.

2896
01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.390
You'll always find somebody you know there,

2897
01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:08.770
there's always somebody you know there are a victim or a victim or victor over

2898
01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.331
the miles.

2899
01:24:09.331 --> 01:24:09.421
Yeah.

2900
01:24:09.421 --> 01:24:10.081
Can we come to?

2901
01:24:10.081 --> 01:24:10.261
Yeah,

2902
01:24:10.261 --> 01:24:11.780
let me make a left on the fucking corner.

2903
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.190
Get the fuck out of it.

2904
01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:14.850
Dan and I got

2905
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:17.203
to it.

2906
01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.000
I will.

2907
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:18.840
I mean if you have it.

2908
01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.320
Well,

2909
01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.370
but the last place I went to,

2910
01:24:20.371 --> 01:24:21.420
they had a bunch of cocaine.

2911
01:24:21.421 --> 01:24:21.981
I didn't like it.

2912
01:24:21.981 --> 01:24:22.201
Sure.

2913
01:24:22.201 --> 01:24:23.790
You don't even remember what happened.

2914
01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:26.490
But I got VD and I didn't even know until I gave it to join dance.

2915
01:24:26.491 --> 01:24:26.671
No,

2916
01:24:26.671 --> 01:24:27.840
I got chlamydia bitch.

2917
01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.300
Fucking differences.

2918
01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:32.160
I never seen the leakage out of my helmet.

2919
01:24:32.161 --> 01:24:33.630
I seen it out of her fucking pussy.

2920
01:24:33.631 --> 01:24:34.320
That's what I was saying.

2921
01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.450
How did you know you had it then?

2922
01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:38.200
Because I had itches at fucking burning sensation.

2923
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.180
Temptations are fucking tube.

2924
01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:44.310
This should be something like that.

2925
01:24:44.311 --> 01:24:45.240
They sell you.

2926
01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:49.020
Have you made a critical error with your penis is she'd be like something you

2927
01:24:49.021 --> 01:24:49.920
could just slap on her.

2928
01:24:49.921 --> 01:24:52.500
Kills 99.999% of it.

2929
01:24:52.501 --> 01:24:54.870
She didn't the tube shoot it right in the hole,

2930
01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:58.410
right in the piss hall and then wipe it on the outside and it kills almost ever.

2931
01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.310
<v 2>The foot spray says it kills 99% all,</v>

2932
01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.370
all viruses.

2933
01:25:02.371 --> 01:25:03.270
And so what I did,

2934
01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:04.200
um,

2935
01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.200
I mean what spray you thought what I was going to do is like spray it on my Dick

2936
01:25:10.381 --> 01:25:14.070
and then I was in the bathroom doing it and I looked over at the mouthwash and

2937
01:25:14.071 --> 01:25:15.360
it's at 98% on it.

2938
01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:16.283
Awesome.

2939
01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:17.101
I'm like,

2940
01:25:17.101 --> 01:25:18.450
it can't be the same percent,

2941
01:25:18.451 --> 01:25:18.751
you know,

2942
01:25:18.751 --> 01:25:19.680
like that one thing,

2943
01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:20.910
it has to be a different,

2944
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.780
what's the odds?

2945
01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:23.880
I think that one person's like aids or something.

2946
01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:26.460
It's probably just alcohol,

2947
01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:27.060
right?

2948
01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.130
Is that what's killing everything?

2949
01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:28.973
Yeah,

2950
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.750
I think that number is the same.

2951
01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:32.320
Whether it's the mouthwash,

2952
01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.570
pray the same note as the alcohol.

2953
01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.710
I don't know what kind of foot spray brain freezes your Dick.

2954
01:25:37.711 --> 01:25:39.480
So you could do it from a distance.

2955
01:25:39.481 --> 01:25:39.661
Don't,

2956
01:25:39.661 --> 01:25:41.440
don't really close up cause it's right,

2957
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.050
it comes out like freezing.

2958
01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:45.090
Like it's like it could freeze something.

2959
01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:49.920
Have you ever like I'm seeing that stuff that you use to clean off the spray

2960
01:25:49.921 --> 01:25:50.930
that used to clean off keyboards.

2961
01:25:50.931 --> 01:25:51.330
Yeah.

2962
01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:52.163
Same thing.

2963
01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:52.590
You know,

2964
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:53.041
it gets really,

2965
01:25:53.041 --> 01:25:53.874
really cold.

2966
01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:57.540
That's the same thing I read somewhere that someone was addicted to that spray.

2967
01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.420
I used to do it in high school but I wasn't addicted to it.

2968
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:02.460
That's the worst.

2969
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:03.960
What the fuck does it do?

2970
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:04.300
It,

2971
01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:04.951
it's just like,

2972
01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:06.000
you know nitrous oxide.

2973
01:26:06.001 --> 01:26:06.950
Like everyone did nitrogen,

2974
01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:08.130
the bits,

2975
01:26:08.130 --> 01:26:08.851
it's like that,

2976
01:26:08.851 --> 01:26:11.950
but it's like a shitty or version of it and it just kind of makes it,

2977
01:26:11.951 --> 01:26:12.060
yeah.

2978
01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:12.241
<v 4>While,</v>

2979
01:26:12.241 --> 01:26:12.361
while,

2980
01:26:12.361 --> 01:26:12.481
while,

2981
01:26:12.481 --> 01:26:12.631
while,

2982
01:26:12.631 --> 01:26:16.800
while I've worked out a Newport creamery who's an ice cream place in Newton,

2983
01:26:16.801 --> 01:26:18.150
Massachusetts and uh,

2984
01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:18.661
I never,

2985
01:26:18.661 --> 01:26:21.390
I think I did whip it's once but it didn't really work with me.

2986
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.081
But,

2987
01:26:22.081 --> 01:26:22.200
uh,

2988
01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.230
the people that work there,

2989
01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.630
there was this one kid,

2990
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.510
I'll just say his last name cause he knows friends,

2991
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.010
he knows people that I know now.

2992
01:26:29.190 --> 01:26:29.941
His name is Charles.

2993
01:26:29.941 --> 01:26:32.490
I don't know if he wants this information release,

2994
01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:35.520
but Charles was working there as I was working there and he would,

2995
01:26:35.521 --> 01:26:36.060
uh,

2996
01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.820
he would tell somebody watched a grill real quick and he would run in the back

2997
01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:41.940
and he was cooking while I was doing dishes and he would run the back of,

2998
01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:42.421
grab the thing.

2999
01:26:42.421 --> 01:26:43.254
Yeah,

3000
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:47.350
<v 2>do a whip it and then run back out to it to the grill.</v>

3001
01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.930
The best twisted out of the best.

3002
01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:51.430
It's got what they called nitrous hits.

3003
01:26:51.431 --> 01:26:53.290
What you do is you take a balloon,

3004
01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:54.460
you fill the balloon up with,

3005
01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:54.820
uh,

3006
01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:56.600
nitric bomb hits and you fill the,

3007
01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.290
fill the balloon up and then you put it on,

3008
01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:00.173
on the bong.

3009
01:27:00.190 --> 01:27:01.390
Somehow I remember how to do it.

3010
01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:03.070
So when you inhale the bong,

3011
01:27:03.071 --> 01:27:04.390
it's all nitrous air.

3012
01:27:04.391 --> 01:27:07.360
So you're getting pot air mixed with nightdress air,

3013
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:08.260
hit it.

3014
01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.780
See that's all somebody only white people would come up with.

3015
01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.510
And then Snow Bong hits where you pack your bag full of snow in the wintertime.

3016
01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:15.890
Second through the snow.

3017
01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:17.141
I've seen that.

3018
01:27:17.141 --> 01:27:18.850
I've timed thousand ice.

3019
01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:22.150
<v 4>I would get the fresh,</v>

3020
01:27:22.151 --> 01:27:24.580
the whole pack of the bond smoke.

3021
01:27:24.581 --> 01:27:25.414
I love all that.

3022
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.530
Now if I have a bong,

3023
01:27:26.531 --> 01:27:27.490
I put ice in it too.

3024
01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:27.700
Well,

3025
01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.220
we used to smoke bongs before we did the podcast,

3026
01:27:30.221 --> 01:27:31.800
so the problem is you get to stone.

3027
01:27:31.801 --> 01:27:33.250
You don't know what you're talking about,

3028
01:27:33.251 --> 01:27:34.990
what it's like to do.

3029
01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:37.660
If you're going to do bong hands and then do a podcast,

3030
01:27:37.661 --> 01:27:41.110
you get to take an hour or two before you talk because you're not going to

3031
01:27:41.111 --> 01:27:43.270
really have your fucking sea legs under you.

3032
01:27:43.271 --> 01:27:44.500
As Dennis Mckenna would say,

3033
01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:47.763
hey,

3034
01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:49.733
it wouldn't,

3035
01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.620
you can't,

3036
01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.580
you know bongs are too strong vaporizers,

3037
01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.553
don't you find,

3038
01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.200
don't you find vaporizers to be a different experience?

3039
01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:00.820
It doesn't seem to be the same.

3040
01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.130
The same experience as as just smoked.

3041
01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.400
<v 2>I wouldn't get one of those vape pens at the house.</v>

3042
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:10.530
This guy had one last night that was chocolate mint chocolate and like,

3043
01:28:10.531 --> 01:28:10.891
all right,

3044
01:28:10.891 --> 01:28:12.270
these vape pens aren't the best.

3045
01:28:12.271 --> 01:28:12.571
Whatever.

3046
01:28:12.571 --> 01:28:13.200
I don't care.

3047
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.050
I took two hits off that and it tasted so delicious.

3048
01:28:16.051 --> 01:28:19.290
Tastes like ice cream and I was so fucking stoned off that thing.

3049
01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:20.250
It was there.

3050
01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:21.570
Everyone has them now in La.

3051
01:28:21.571 --> 01:28:23.940
Everyone has like these pins that looked like little.

3052
01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:25.840
That's the big thing right?

3053
01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:27.810
<v 4>That one that's going off.</v>

3054
01:28:27.811 --> 01:28:30.180
Fuck people up.

3055
01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:32.640
That's the bottom line.

3056
01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:35.850
Somebody is really going to like the Eureka gets me high,

3057
01:28:36.330 --> 01:28:38.610
but I like at night I don't get high at night.

3058
01:28:38.611 --> 01:28:40.800
I won't get high and I got to switch up the tubes a lot.

3059
01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.480
Like right now I got a uh,

3060
01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.780
a sativa and I have something else.

3061
01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:47.280
I got a pretty good fucking sativa.

3062
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:48.631
Let me ask you this,

3063
01:28:48.631 --> 01:28:49.464
Joe Diaz,

3064
01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.490
who if you were going to do anything with this room,

3065
01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.390
what would you suggest being done here with this new studio?

3066
01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:58.920
Well,

3067
01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.690
outside you got to have a mat out there.

3068
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:01.380
Uh,

3069
01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:02.213
Jujitsu.

3070
01:29:03.090 --> 01:29:03.923
<v 3>Absolutely.</v>

3071
01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:05.670
Officer's in there,

3072
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:06.300
right?

3073
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.290
That's your office.

3074
01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:08.070
You know,

3075
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.480
what's the,

3076
01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:08.640
what?

3077
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.290
The way the room and you only let people come by on is a extra room.

3078
01:29:13.291 --> 01:29:14.340
It ain't no fucking makes no,

3079
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:15.050
no extra beat.

3080
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:16.350
We had a couple people here the other day.

3081
01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:17.320
Dennis brought a positive,

3082
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:18.010
well,

3083
01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:18.970
Russell Peters comes here.

3084
01:29:18.971 --> 01:29:19.980
You're going to need that just for him.

3085
01:29:20.850 --> 01:29:21.720
Just for his ego.

3086
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:24.220
Oh,

3087
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:26.060
can you put the pool test kit?

3088
01:29:26.061 --> 01:29:26.231
Right,

3089
01:29:26.231 --> 01:29:28.350
so definitely have a mat up here.

3090
01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:30.360
A lot of people were mad at Russell Peters because of that.

3091
01:29:30.361 --> 01:29:32.340
A mix master Mike Interview.

3092
01:29:32.341 --> 01:29:35.760
I thought he added a lot to it and add a lot of Dj knowledge,

3093
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:36.220
you know,

3094
01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:36.780
to talk.

3095
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.040
Tell us a lot of shit about needles.

3096
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:39.240
Why people such haters.

3097
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.250
I talked to him about it a couple of days ago and what did he say?

3098
01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:44.880
He was bummed about it because you know you've got,

3099
01:29:44.881 --> 01:29:46.860
Twitter is so harsh,

3100
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:47.580
you know when it ends.

3101
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.910
It's just a bunch of mean cons.

3102
01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:52.560
I mean most people like why not just listen to it and just take it in?

3103
01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:54.690
He was a goddamn three hour conversation.

3104
01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.470
Mike told a lot of shit about working with the Beastie boys to a lot of shit

3105
01:29:58.471 --> 01:29:59.820
about Dj and being in front of it.

3106
01:29:59.821 --> 01:30:02.670
He said he was in front of 400,000 fucking people.

3107
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.190
400,000 people in Germany by the way.

3108
01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:06.024
His CD's out,

3109
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.380
free CD's out.

3110
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:08.080
Where do you get it?

3111
01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:08.230
Uh,

3112
01:30:08.230 --> 01:30:11.520
I think it's mix master mike.com mix master mike.com.

3113
01:30:11.521 --> 01:30:14.250
I believe the eyes are all ones.

3114
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:16.110
I think it's one of those he's,

3115
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:16.860
he's uh,

3116
01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:17.693
he's leaked.

3117
01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.160
You remember that back in the uh,

3118
01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:20.130
the video game days.

3119
01:30:20.131 --> 01:30:21.260
He'd be leaked out.

3120
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:23.101
I think it's one,

3121
01:30:23.101 --> 01:30:23.551
but uh,

3122
01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:28.551
his websites and mix master mike.com using the regular spelling and it's a free

3123
01:30:28.831 --> 01:30:29.910
CD and it's really good.

3124
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:32.250
It's a remix city and he's cool as fuck.

3125
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:35.040
It was a awesome having him on the podcast.

3126
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:36.690
Even if Russell Peters did fuck up the interview.

3127
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.250
You did.

3128
01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:39.010
You didn't.

3129
01:30:39.010 --> 01:30:39.930
Russell's a sweetie.

3130
01:30:39.931 --> 01:30:41.650
I don't know how anybody could not like Russel,

3131
01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.700
you're bipolar.

3132
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:44.093
No,

3133
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:45.103
I'm just,

3134
01:30:46.110 --> 01:30:47.010
just jokes.

3135
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:48.960
So Polo Russell fucking,

3136
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.980
Peter's a nice kid.

3137
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:50.380
He's,

3138
01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.060
he's a,

3139
01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.220
he's a great guy and takes great Goodman.

3140
01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:56.230
They have a lot of good friends and he does good for kids.

3141
01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:56.491
You know,

3142
01:30:56.491 --> 01:30:57.120
when I like,

3143
01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.670
I like when a guy hits big,

3144
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.940
like he does and becomes more generous.

3145
01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:02.790
That's what he,

3146
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:03.780
that's how he is.

3147
01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:05.041
He's something he did,

3148
01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:05.640
I didn't know about.

3149
01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.450
I found out the other day,

3150
01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:10.100
like when Sam there was an HBO special and uh,

3151
01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.970
they originally wanted to have,

3152
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.140
or they originally wanted to have Sam on the HBO special or the Comedy Central

3153
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:16.141
Special.

3154
01:31:16.141 --> 01:31:17.780
But then at the last second they're like,

3155
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.121
all right,

3156
01:31:18.121 --> 01:31:18.630
we're not gonna,

3157
01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:22.020
we don't have enough money for you Sam to pave for you and to film it and all

3158
01:31:22.021 --> 01:31:24.960
that stuff so we're not going to have you on the on the special.

3159
01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.360
So Russell paid out of his own pocket,

3160
01:31:27.361 --> 01:31:30.210
like paid for them to film it and put it on the special.

3161
01:31:30.211 --> 01:31:33.960
And I really like pumped up Sam AAA like five years ago or so.

3162
01:31:34.050 --> 01:31:35.550
They're totally sounds like something he would do.

3163
01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:35.941
Yeah.

3164
01:31:35.941 --> 01:31:36.450
He's,

3165
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:39.780
he's a perfect example of a guy who's got a lot of great things that are

3166
01:31:39.781 --> 01:31:40.650
happening for him.

3167
01:31:40.651 --> 01:31:41.311
Like if you see,

3168
01:31:41.311 --> 01:31:43.380
Russell was showing me pictures of his on his phone,

3169
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:48.590
he's doing like 15,000 seat arenas and he's doing them on a regular basis and

3170
01:31:49.741 --> 01:31:54.270
he's a perfect example of a guy who's just a fucking sweetheart of a guy and

3171
01:31:54.271 --> 01:31:55.500
people go to see them,

3172
01:31:55.501 --> 01:31:58.590
they have a great experience and they tell more people about them and then they

3173
01:31:58.591 --> 01:32:00.000
come and him more and then it's

3174
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:00.220
<v 0>he,</v>

3175
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.640
he's got swarms of people and it all happened by the way,

3176
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:05.500
because they liked his stuff.

3177
01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:09.130
This didn't happen because he was on so fucking crazy sit-com it didn't happen

3178
01:32:09.131 --> 01:32:10.420
because he was in a great movie.

3179
01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.340
It happened because he had youtube clips,

3180
01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.780
people saw the youtube clips and then this guy is awesome and then it all grew

3181
01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:17.440
from there.

3182
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:17.950
It's up to,

3183
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:18.820
he has like,

3184
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:19.691
he's as one of the,

3185
01:32:19.691 --> 01:32:22.450
Russell Peters is one of the best Internet success stories ever.

3186
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:28.580
Really does as far as like us as far as like comics that have gone from just

3187
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:32.050
putting out a video and then making it huge and big places.

3188
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.020
Russell's the fucking man and he's a sweetheart.

3189
01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:35.460
I,

3190
01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.570
I've hung out with that guy in Vegas so many times.

3191
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:39.430
He came in his fucking watch gave it to me.

3192
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.720
See this watch,

3193
01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.600
this is like a really nice watch is a Breitling and I,

3194
01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:45.550
all I did is I said we were at a bar.

3195
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:46.060
You were there.

3196
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:46.310
I got,

3197
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.601
hey man,

3198
01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:47.770
it's like a $10,000 watch,

3199
01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:47.921
right?

3200
01:32:47.921 --> 01:32:48.521
Or something crazy.

3201
01:32:48.521 --> 01:32:49.510
I don't know what it costs,

3202
01:32:49.511 --> 01:32:49.840
but it's,

3203
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:50.050
it's,

3204
01:32:50.050 --> 01:32:51.480
it's traded watches.

3205
01:32:51.490 --> 01:32:51.950
Alicia,

3206
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:52.660
he threw a year,

3207
01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:53.860
watch away the next day,

3208
01:32:53.861 --> 01:32:55.630
cause that smells my lunch.

3209
01:32:55.631 --> 01:32:56.710
I would wear to the gym.

3210
01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:57.791
Sorry.

3211
01:32:57.791 --> 01:32:59.170
Instead of leather band on it.

3212
01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:00.910
I'd been lifting weights with that watch.

3213
01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:01.841
You should've kept it.

3214
01:33:01.841 --> 01:33:02.321
It smelled,

3215
01:33:02.321 --> 01:33:04.930
it attracted like powerful females.

3216
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.011
Yeah.

3217
01:33:06.011 --> 01:33:06.844
He um,

3218
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:08.800
I've looked at his watch and I go,

3219
01:33:08.801 --> 01:33:09.161
that's cool.

3220
01:33:09.161 --> 01:33:09.820
Watch man.

3221
01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:10.653
Just like that.

3222
01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:11.351
I just go,

3223
01:33:11.351 --> 01:33:12.101
that's a cool watch.

3224
01:33:12.101 --> 01:33:12.431
And he goes,

3225
01:33:12.431 --> 01:33:12.730
here,

3226
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:13.270
it's yours.

3227
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:14.770
And I go get the fuck Outta here man.

3228
01:33:14.771 --> 01:33:15.041
He's like,

3229
01:33:15.041 --> 01:33:15.521
take it,

3230
01:33:15.521 --> 01:33:16.001
tag it,

3231
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:16.301
tag it,

3232
01:33:16.301 --> 01:33:17.230
grabs my hand,

3233
01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.101
sticks it over.

3234
01:33:18.101 --> 01:33:20.280
My hand is ridiculous.

3235
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.820
Or buck angel,

3236
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:23.680
it would attract buck angel.

3237
01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.480
You should probably check my watch.

3238
01:33:25.481 --> 01:33:27.370
Would trek can show how much you want for the Wad.

3239
01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:28.270
That was a Jeremy that,

3240
01:33:28.271 --> 01:33:29.770
that's the last piece to my puzzle.

3241
01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.080
If I put that watch on,

3242
01:33:31.081 --> 01:33:36.081
I know I'll be fucking manly and wonder if like girls who become boys still

3243
01:33:36.431 --> 01:33:37.690
stink like dudes do.

3244
01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:38.561
You know,

3245
01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:42.910
cause dude to put out a certain fucking stinky dudes put out like a certain odor

3246
01:33:42.911 --> 01:33:44.680
that you don't get from stinky chicks.

3247
01:33:44.890 --> 01:33:45.161
You know,

3248
01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:45.641
like in your,

3249
01:33:45.641 --> 01:33:48.640
in the line at the airport when you're going through security.

3250
01:33:48.641 --> 01:33:52.060
So you're forced to be like really close to people and you get a whiff of a

3251
01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:52.913
motherfucker.

3252
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:54.550
It's very rarely a girl.

3253
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:56.260
It's almost always a dude.

3254
01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:57.540
There's always a dude we like,

3255
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:58.390
whoa.

3256
01:33:58.391 --> 01:34:01.210
This mother fucker's stinks that like heavy,

3257
01:34:01.211 --> 01:34:03.070
rotten under smell.

3258
01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:05.111
Apparently.

3259
01:34:05.111 --> 01:34:07.330
I found the answer to our question earlier about,

3260
01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:07.740
uh,

3261
01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.910
underarms and what it was,

3262
01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.360
women's started shaving their legs and it was like the 1940s are like 1915.

3263
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.880
Rather.

3264
01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:19.720
There was a,

3265
01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:19.960
uh,

3266
01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:23.830
a campaign for women to shave their under harm hair.

3267
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:27.610
Cause before nine 1915 women didn't shave their underarm hair.

3268
01:34:27.611 --> 01:34:31.310
They all went straight Madonna and there was this disdain.

3269
01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:36.190
They were brow beaten into this in 1915 apparently I would like to,

3270
01:34:36.191 --> 01:34:37.024
um,

3271
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.540
I,

3272
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.160
I would like to find out what the,

3273
01:34:39.161 --> 01:34:39.310
uh,

3274
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:40.990
what the campaigns look like.

3275
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:43.590
But it was in Harper's bizarre,

3276
01:34:43.591 --> 01:34:45.610
a magazine aimed at the upper crust,

3277
01:34:45.730 --> 01:34:46.930
the first ad feature,

3278
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:50.170
the waist up photograph of a young woman who appears to be dressed in a slip

3279
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:53.050
with a Toga like outfit covering one shoulder.

3280
01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:55.360
Her arms are arched over her head,

3281
01:34:55.361 --> 01:34:58.010
revealing perfectly clear armpits.

3282
01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:03.500
The first part of the ad read summer dress and modern dancing combined to make

3283
01:35:03.501 --> 01:35:06.860
necessary the removal above jection double hair.

3284
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:08.150
So that's what it is.

3285
01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.730
They just showed some women some unrealistic vision,

3286
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:15.260
much like we have seen in our lifetime with pussy,

3287
01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:19.340
like we were talking about earlier when I was a kid of girl would pour pants

3288
01:35:19.341 --> 01:35:20.720
down and you got what you got,

3289
01:35:20.721 --> 01:35:22.220
you got welcome to the jungle,

3290
01:35:22.221 --> 01:35:23.480
you got fucking craziness.

3291
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:24.980
We didn't do anything with our cubes.

3292
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:26.300
They didn't do anything with theirs.

3293
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:28.070
And if a girl did shave her pussy,

3294
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.061
all my God,

3295
01:35:29.061 --> 01:35:30.200
it was like chaos.

3296
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:33.650
I had a girl that broke up with her boyfriend.

3297
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:34.400
Okay.

3298
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.010
And then we got back together again and we couldn't have sex.

3299
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.341
She goes,

3300
01:35:37.341 --> 01:35:37.581
we can't,

3301
01:35:37.581 --> 01:35:38.414
we can't have sex.

3302
01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.433
I go by,

3303
01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:39.831
she goes,

3304
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:40.664
we can't.

3305
01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.061
I go,

3306
01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:41.391
why?

3307
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:41.901
What's wrong?

3308
01:35:41.901 --> 01:35:42.734
She goes,

3309
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.590
I shaped myself down there for him.

3310
01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.450
She was embarrassed that her pussy.

3311
01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:48.500
I hadn't grown back yet.

3312
01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:50.211
So I was like,

3313
01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:51.044
it's alright.

3314
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:52.160
It's not,

3315
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:52.993
it's no big deal.

3316
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.080
You just don't have any pussy hair.

3317
01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:54.914
Come on.

3318
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:56.960
But I don't know the had sex with this guy.

3319
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:57.771
Settle the fuck down.

3320
01:35:57.771 --> 01:35:58.604
I can do too.

3321
01:35:58.730 --> 01:35:59.563
I can do the math.

3322
01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:00.853
You're shit.

3323
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:03.260
She was ashamed.

3324
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.780
She was ashamed that she shaved off her pussy hair for this guy.

3325
01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:06.793
Isn't that hilarious?

3326
01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:07.790
She couldn't just say,

3327
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:08.121
yeah,

3328
01:36:08.121 --> 01:36:08.990
that's my new thing.

3329
01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:09.501
You know,

3330
01:36:09.501 --> 01:36:09.831
fuck,

3331
01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:10.820
fuck pussy hair.

3332
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:11.181
No,

3333
01:36:11.181 --> 01:36:11.960
it was dirty.

3334
01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.010
It was dirty for her.

3335
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:14.060
Like she had done a dirty,

3336
01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:14.571
dirty thing.

3337
01:36:14.571 --> 01:36:15.470
She shaved her pussy.

3338
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.660
You know what I did for him?

3339
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:18.583
What?

3340
01:36:18.730 --> 01:36:19.320
I shaved my,

3341
01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.640
he doesn't know your dad shut up.

3342
01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:23.990
Let me see if I have a talk to you.

3343
01:36:23.991 --> 01:36:26.240
They would get pulled your underwear down and then that girl would go

3344
01:36:26.241 --> 01:36:27.950
immediately until all of her friends.

3345
01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:29.781
That dirty bitch.

3346
01:36:29.781 --> 01:36:30.980
It's shaving her pussy.

3347
01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:32.510
Shut the fuck up.

3348
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:33.471
Give me a sec.

3349
01:36:33.471 --> 01:36:33.830
All right.

3350
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:34.910
I need a cigarette right now.

3351
01:36:34.911 --> 01:36:35.810
I can't believe this.

3352
01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:36.381
Oh my God.

3353
01:36:36.381 --> 01:36:37.214
That whore,

3354
01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:39.590
that whore is shaving that pussy.

3355
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:42.680
All these checks in Boston would sit around smoking cigarettes.

3356
01:36:42.681 --> 01:36:44.510
Talk Shit about if you should have shaved your pussy.

3357
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:46.050
They found out that fucking whole,

3358
01:36:46.051 --> 01:36:46.510
Ah,

3359
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:48.440
why not just put a sign and say come fuck me,

3360
01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.433
Eh,

3361
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:57.910
anti arm hair adds began appearing in middlebrow McCall's in 1917 women's razors

3362
01:37:00.351 --> 01:37:02.180
and depilatory.

3363
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:05.390
What's depilatory I that like pulls it out from the roots.

3364
01:37:05.391 --> 01:37:05.631
Right?

3365
01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:06.464
Those are those,

3366
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:07.790
those horrible ones.

3367
01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:09.050
You ever seen those things?

3368
01:37:09.051 --> 01:37:12.200
They look like fucking strings and they just wrap around your armpit hair and

3369
01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:13.400
yanked him out of the roots.

3370
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:14.330
Yeah.

3371
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:15.163
Fuck that.

3372
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:16.003
Well that's okay.

3373
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:17.300
That's very good.

3374
01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:18.940
That's very,

3375
01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:19.121
eh,

3376
01:37:19.121 --> 01:37:20.120
it's uncomfortable.

3377
01:37:20.150 --> 01:37:20.983
That's uncomfortable.

3378
01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.440
Woo.

3379
01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:24.310
<v 2>The soundbite.</v>

3380
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:25.300
I do this to lean.

3381
01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:26.830
So Instagram a,

3382
01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.940
the president of Instagram,

3383
01:37:27.941 --> 01:37:28.774
please tell me this.

3384
01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:30.330
Originally what happened is this,

3385
01:37:30.331 --> 01:37:35.331
a Instagram supposedly had how have these new rules out saying and in the roles,

3386
01:37:35.861 --> 01:37:38.470
it was a deciphered that Instagram has,

3387
01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:40.780
can sell your photos to a third party.

3388
01:37:40.781 --> 01:37:42.760
So say like you're an advertising company and it's like,

3389
01:37:42.761 --> 01:37:43.061
Hey,

3390
01:37:43.061 --> 01:37:46.870
I want to buy some photos of girls kissing balloons and they so that you could

3391
01:37:46.871 --> 01:37:47.890
go in there and just,

3392
01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.130
they could just buy your photos and make money off your photos.

3393
01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:53.740
Meaning they can turn a profit on your,

3394
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:58.410
so you might be to go to like a store one day to buy mountain dew and there's a

3395
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:00.450
picture of you laughing with a mountain,

3396
01:38:00.451 --> 01:38:02.670
you and your hands you put on your Instagram.

3397
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:08.270
But Instagram just like as within like the next last couple hours like the co

3398
01:38:08.521 --> 01:38:11.550
owner or president or something like that said that this is not the case.

3399
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:12.920
This is just uh,

3400
01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:14.160
you know,

3401
01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:14.640
people are,

3402
01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.870
are taking this wrong.

3403
01:38:15.871 --> 01:38:17.160
We are not starting to photos,

3404
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:18.330
you own the photos,

3405
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.410
blah blah blah.

3406
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:20.340
But you know,

3407
01:38:20.341 --> 01:38:21.600
that's seems kind of weird.

3408
01:38:21.601 --> 01:38:22.141
Like how,

3409
01:38:22.141 --> 01:38:23.670
why is it written down that way?

3410
01:38:23.671 --> 01:38:24.130
So it,

3411
01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:24.963
unless they turn,

3412
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.823
take a,

3413
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:26.310
uh,

3414
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.581
you know,

3415
01:38:26.581 --> 01:38:27.960
they changed the terms.

3416
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:28.530
Uh,

3417
01:38:28.530 --> 01:38:32.280
there's still some question there and I guess there's more developing about it.

3418
01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:33.360
So it should be,

3419
01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:34.230
we'll figure it out soon.

3420
01:38:34.231 --> 01:38:38.760
But do you have till January 16th where this new term kicks in?

3421
01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:43.470
So if you delete your account supposedly in all your photos by that time then

3422
01:38:43.471 --> 01:38:45.120
that they won't have the photos.

3423
01:38:45.121 --> 01:38:47.010
So probably some mad backlash.

3424
01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:47.800
That's what that problem.

3425
01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:48.100
Yeah,

3426
01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:48.811
it looks like it.

3427
01:38:48.811 --> 01:38:49.920
They got caught pretty much.

3428
01:38:49.921 --> 01:38:50.101
And,

3429
01:38:50.101 --> 01:38:54.150
but Instagram is now owned by Facebook and Facebook also is going through the

3430
01:38:54.151 --> 01:38:55.530
same kind of shit right now,

3431
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:56.041
you know,

3432
01:38:56.041 --> 01:38:58.500
with this whole like did they own your property?

3433
01:38:58.500 --> 01:38:58.891
Can they,

3434
01:38:58.891 --> 01:38:59.370
you know,

3435
01:38:59.370 --> 01:38:59.551
well,

3436
01:38:59.551 --> 01:39:00.810
I think it's really important.

3437
01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:01.170
I mean,

3438
01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:02.290
if there's anything that,

3439
01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:02.790
uh,

3440
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:06.120
any like function that groups like anonymous serve,

3441
01:39:06.210 --> 01:39:06.811
you know,

3442
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:08.010
that it's really important.

3443
01:39:08.011 --> 01:39:09.930
It's not just like political and governmental stuff,

3444
01:39:09.931 --> 01:39:12.750
but shit like this to keep companies on their toes,

3445
01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:14.040
like hackers,

3446
01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:18.870
like just the threat of someone realizing that there's an imbalance and wanting

3447
01:39:18.871 --> 01:39:19.704
to correct it.

3448
01:39:20.010 --> 01:39:24.300
You know that these really intelligent kids that are like you were in Russia and

3449
01:39:24.301 --> 01:39:27.180
shit from all sorts of places where you can't get them through a hundred

3450
01:39:27.181 --> 01:39:28.014
proxies,

3451
01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:29.460
they will come down on you men,

3452
01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:30.780
they will come fuck you.

3453
01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:31.681
And you know,

3454
01:39:31.681 --> 01:39:33.480
I think Instagram probably recognize that.

3455
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:36.090
I hope that's not what it was.

3456
01:39:36.091 --> 01:39:39.120
I hope that they really was a misunderstanding in the first place.

3457
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:41.970
You never want to hear that a company is thinking about selling all your fucking

3458
01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:42.290
picture.

3459
01:39:42.290 --> 01:39:42.430
Oh.

3460
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:46.260
You also have to think that a lot of times that this happens all the time.

3461
01:39:46.261 --> 01:39:47.790
You sign up for a website,

3462
01:39:47.850 --> 01:39:48.683
you know,

3463
01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:51.690
and you upload something to their computers.

3464
01:39:51.691 --> 01:39:53.910
They actually do pretty much own that.

3465
01:39:53.911 --> 01:39:54.391
You know,

3466
01:39:54.391 --> 01:39:55.130
it's,

3467
01:39:55.130 --> 01:39:57.590
if you look at it as basic as if uh,

3468
01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.270
you have your own website and,

3469
01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.690
and it's a computer,

3470
01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:01.231
you know,

3471
01:40:01.231 --> 01:40:05.040
hooked up at your house and you have your website on that computer and then

3472
01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:07.740
somebody is putting files on your computer that's like,

3473
01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:08.111
you know,

3474
01:40:08.111 --> 01:40:10.950
a real basic version of what a Facebook is.

3475
01:40:10.951 --> 01:40:11.221
It's a,

3476
01:40:11.221 --> 01:40:12.480
they own all these computers.

3477
01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:14.670
You're putting your information and your stuff.

3478
01:40:14.671 --> 01:40:16.050
And you're putting it on their computer.

3479
01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.370
They do pretty much own it.

3480
01:40:17.371 --> 01:40:18.870
If they went out of business tomorrow,

3481
01:40:18.871 --> 01:40:20.010
just turned off the lights,

3482
01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.770
they could take all those computers and look at all your pictures and own you.

3483
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:23.873
They own your pictures.

3484
01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.990
But I think the real issue in this country,

3485
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:27.150
money try to sell it,

3486
01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:28.101
but it's,

3487
01:40:28.101 --> 01:40:29.300
it's the idea that you,

3488
01:40:29.301 --> 01:40:31.440
you also don't really think like shit.

3489
01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.270
Every single text that I do back and forth between people on Facebook or any

3490
01:40:36.271 --> 01:40:41.040
photo that I have hidden my inbox or anything that got private that,

3491
01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:41.281
you know,

3492
01:40:41.281 --> 01:40:42.840
no one can see except me.

3493
01:40:43.050 --> 01:40:47.610
All that can be seen by somebody and somebody can own that and take that.

3494
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.351
So if you,

3495
01:40:48.351 --> 01:40:48.721
you know,

3496
01:40:48.721 --> 01:40:50.400
ever say or do anything,

3497
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:54.790
they pretty much get to do whatever the fuck they want with it except sell it,

3498
01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:55.780
I guess is the big thing.

3499
01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:56.291
Yeah.

3500
01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:58.130
I think the big thing though is the sell it,

3501
01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:00.280
especially the using it for advertising.

3502
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:01.660
So as long as they're not going to do that,

3503
01:41:01.661 --> 01:41:01.991
they will,

3504
01:41:01.991 --> 01:41:04.180
they will escape the wrath of the fucking legion.

3505
01:41:04.210 --> 01:41:04.271
Yeah.

3506
01:41:04.271 --> 01:41:05.860
But what if it's something like,

3507
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.770
you know how like how this guy is talking today about like,

3508
01:41:08.771 --> 01:41:09.130
you know,

3509
01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:11.320
we are not going to sell your stuff.

3510
01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:12.100
You know,

3511
01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.720
what if he's just also saying that,

3512
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.201
you know,

3513
01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:15.090
like a backlash thing,

3514
01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:16.360
but in a way of like,

3515
01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:16.631
yeah,

3516
01:41:16.631 --> 01:41:17.650
we're not going to sell it.

3517
01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:19.810
We're going to get money to,

3518
01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:24.190
to sponsor a company and then we're just going to give them your photos,

3519
01:41:24.191 --> 01:41:24.371
you know,

3520
01:41:24.371 --> 01:41:24.671
or something.

3521
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:25.211
You know what I mean?

3522
01:41:25.211 --> 01:41:28.360
Like there they're doing some kind of backs snaggle way where they're,

3523
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:28.781
you know,

3524
01:41:28.781 --> 01:41:31.840
they're getting paid for it but just it not directly,

3525
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:32.151
you know,

3526
01:41:32.151 --> 01:41:33.310
if that's possible.

3527
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:35.200
But I think you also have to think of like,

3528
01:41:35.201 --> 01:41:35.471
okay,

3529
01:41:35.471 --> 01:41:38.470
what is this service worth and why am I getting it for free?

3530
01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:40.060
What am I giving them?

3531
01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.610
I'm giving them a bunch of users.

3532
01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:41.751
Well,

3533
01:41:41.751 --> 01:41:45.040
a bunch of users ain't worth shit unless you can get something out of it.

3534
01:41:45.041 --> 01:41:46.000
So what is it worth?

3535
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:49.630
Is it worth that they put a little ad in the corner of your picture when people

3536
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:49.931
go to look,

3537
01:41:49.931 --> 01:41:50.710
I mean like what is the,

3538
01:41:50.710 --> 01:41:51.970
where's the line that you draw?

3539
01:41:51.971 --> 01:41:55.330
Because we're basically getting this free service where we get to upload these

3540
01:41:55.331 --> 01:41:56.110
photos.

3541
01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:59.410
And one of the things that you and I know about from doing this podcast is that

3542
01:41:59.411 --> 01:42:01.030
bandwidth costs a lot of fucking money.

3543
01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:02.051
If you're,

3544
01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:02.884
if you're like,

3545
01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:03.521
if you're,

3546
01:42:03.521 --> 01:42:04.241
you know,

3547
01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:05.620
a company like Instagram,

3548
01:42:05.650 --> 01:42:09.700
they must be dealing in insane gigabytes to run their servers.

3549
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:12.640
But that's why you don't understand how Instagram even became big.

3550
01:42:12.641 --> 01:42:13.780
I know it's the filter thing.

3551
01:42:13.781 --> 01:42:15.570
Everyone wants to see the filters and like,

3552
01:42:15.571 --> 01:42:15.631
oh,

3553
01:42:15.631 --> 01:42:16.120
that's like,

3554
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:17.320
filters are so big right now.

3555
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.800
That's what it is.

3556
01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.600
It's girls pretending to look different than they look.

3557
01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:24.010
But they didn't have superior companies like flicker who I've been using for a

3558
01:42:24.011 --> 01:42:24.844
long time.

3559
01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:25.241
Uh,

3560
01:42:25.241 --> 01:42:26.740
where you pay a little bit,

3561
01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:28.510
I think it's like 40 bucks a year,

3562
01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:29.920
but you own everything.

3563
01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:32.320
You don't have to worry about this Instagram shit like that.

3564
01:42:32.321 --> 01:42:32.711
And you know,

3565
01:42:32.711 --> 01:42:33.700
when it comes to filters,

3566
01:42:33.701 --> 01:42:37.840
half the apps that you have on your phone just make filters and you just send it

3567
01:42:37.841 --> 01:42:38.321
to flicker.

3568
01:42:38.321 --> 01:42:38.470
You,

3569
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:41.140
the thing about Instagram though is it became,

3570
01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:41.531
um,

3571
01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:42.520
a phone thing,

3572
01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:44.710
whereas flicker was like a computer thing.

3573
01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:49.240
Instagram became a way of peep for people like to communicate like Twitter

3574
01:42:49.241 --> 01:42:49.750
style,

3575
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:50.590
Twitter picture.

3576
01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.190
Right.

3577
01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:53.770
But I don't know why it became an entity on its own.

3578
01:42:53.771 --> 01:42:57.490
Like why didn't they just use twit pic builtin Twitter?

3579
01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.750
It's because of the filters.

3580
01:42:58.751 --> 01:42:59.770
I think it's just the APP.

3581
01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:00.250
Yeah,

3582
01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:01.120
those tricky bitches.

3583
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:04.810
They want to look like Magenta hued to look like they're living in a dream.

3584
01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:05.650
And there's only like what,

3585
01:43:05.710 --> 01:43:07.590
eight different filters in that you get.

3586
01:43:07.591 --> 01:43:10.330
You get like a APP that I like.

3587
01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.250
There's one called a hundred cameras,

3588
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.741
you know,

3589
01:43:12.741 --> 01:43:14.790
where it has a hundred different apps,

3590
01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:15.400
uh,

3591
01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.300
filters,

3592
01:43:16.301 --> 01:43:16.690
you know,

3593
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:19.130
and it's like 99 cents and it just sends it to your Twitter,

3594
01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:19.930
your Twitter,

3595
01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:20.980
your twit pic or whatever.

3596
01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:21.191
Yeah,

3597
01:43:21.191 --> 01:43:22.330
there's a bunch of them like that,

3598
01:43:22.331 --> 01:43:22.541
right?

3599
01:43:22.541 --> 01:43:23.500
That like connect with it.

3600
01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:23.680
Yeah.

3601
01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.940
It's probably better than Instagram,

3602
01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:28.060
but I've got like 50,000 fucking people on my instruments.

3603
01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:29.310
The profit at this point in time.

3604
01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.750
How many of those are not on my Twitter?

3605
01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:32.950
Like I can't abandon them.

3606
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:36.290
Everybody in a bandage it because of this new policy.

3607
01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:40.300
So if it stays how it originally was,

3608
01:43:40.301 --> 01:43:43.570
where they do get to do whatever the fuck they went to and they will,

3609
01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.210
uh,

3610
01:43:44.210 --> 01:43:47.410
I probably will delete my account cause I only went on Instagram because

3611
01:43:47.411 --> 01:43:48.280
everyone told me to.

3612
01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:48.670
And it's like,

3613
01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:48.791
oh,

3614
01:43:48.791 --> 01:43:49.601
it's so popular.

3615
01:43:49.601 --> 01:43:50.110
And I'm like,

3616
01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:50.291
yeah,

3617
01:43:50.291 --> 01:43:50.831
I don't get it.

3618
01:43:50.831 --> 01:43:51.170
You know,

3619
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:51.951
can use twit pic,

3620
01:43:51.951 --> 01:43:52.040
you

3621
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.131
<v 0>know,</v>

3622
01:43:52.131 --> 01:43:53.780
remember every last told me I have to use it.

3623
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:54.480
Yeah.

3624
01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.600
Came in and said that people been in a man.

3625
01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:59.210
Do you don't use your Instagram was really what's wrong,

3626
01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:00.190
a tweeter down.

3627
01:44:00.191 --> 01:44:00.920
That's about it.

3628
01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:01.101
Yeah.

3629
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:03.950
But you know what's going on now for whatever fucking reason.

3630
01:44:03.951 --> 01:44:05.090
Even though I've updated it,

3631
01:44:05.091 --> 01:44:08.480
my iPhone does not want to connect with the fucking Instagram.

3632
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:13.680
My iPhone is not interested in sending pictures through Instagram smart.

3633
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:15.800
He knew this whole fucking thing was going to happen.

3634
01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:18.670
He's just good doing good.

3635
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.120
I got a new iPhone and it's like,

3636
01:44:20.121 --> 01:44:21.050
fuck you bitch.

3637
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:21.860
Fuck.

3638
01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:23.690
Every time I tried to send pictures through Iphone,

3639
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:28.730
I was trying to spend this Instagram photo because I took a photo of Brad Pitt

3640
01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:30.440
with Chanel number five.

3641
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:35.060
Brad Pitt's got to fucking men's Cologne commercial looking at,

3642
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:36.703
I don't know,

3643
01:44:36.810 --> 01:44:41.810
but I was trying to put on Twitter or on Instagram that if you buy this stinky

3644
01:44:42.411 --> 01:44:42.771
shit,

3645
01:44:42.771 --> 01:44:44.690
I hope nobody fucks you for the rest of your life.

3646
01:44:44.691 --> 01:44:45.770
I was trying to put that out,

3647
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:49.890
which I thought it'd be nice and witty on my way home from the airport and uh,

3648
01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:51.380
your anticline and all the way.

3649
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:52.280
It's fucking gross,

3650
01:44:52.281 --> 01:44:52.670
man.

3651
01:44:52.670 --> 01:44:55.640
I did one little spray of Timberlake before I leave every day.

3652
01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:56.620
That's confused as well.

3653
01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:57.041
<v 5>Animal.</v>

3654
01:44:57.041 --> 01:44:57.610
No,

3655
01:44:57.610 --> 01:44:58.640
I don't trust the eyes.

3656
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:02.200
If I smell Colona the guy,

3657
01:45:03.570 --> 01:45:06.130
but I put my lake and he gets a good smell.

3658
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:06.700
Timberlake.

3659
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.533
The fucking sentence.

3660
01:45:08.210 --> 01:45:09.250
You probably can't even smell it.

3661
01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.290
Smelled a little bit.

3662
01:45:10.290 --> 01:45:11.230
I don't want to smell nobody.

3663
01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.041
Trust me.

3664
01:45:12.041 --> 01:45:13.390
I'll fucking fart right on your legs.

3665
01:45:14.710 --> 01:45:15.940
Don't come over here and fuck.

3666
01:45:15.941 --> 01:45:16.481
I don't want small,

3667
01:45:16.481 --> 01:45:16.810
local,

3668
01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:17.171
whatever.

3669
01:45:17.171 --> 01:45:17.351
Yeah,

3670
01:45:17.351 --> 01:45:18.490
whatever your stinking of.

3671
01:45:18.491 --> 01:45:20.010
He just not the of on don't do it.

3672
01:45:20.011 --> 01:45:22.690
I told him I can't tell him do a Joey,

3673
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:23.381
don't do it.

3674
01:45:23.381 --> 01:45:24.170
Don't let them,

3675
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:25.460
don't let him should go away.

3676
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:26.420
Cock suck.

3677
01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:33.083
I suck.

3678
01:45:33.130 --> 01:45:34.360
I'll stab you with this coffee.

3679
01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:35.140
Pick it.

3680
01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:35.801
Was that Mitzi?

3681
01:45:35.801 --> 01:45:36.690
Who are you doing?

3682
01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:39.993
Joey D is,

3683
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:41.750
<v 0>I'll,</v>

3684
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:44.250
I'll tweet you guys this picture later after the show.

3685
01:45:44.850 --> 01:45:47.970
One of the problems that might be one of his last time you reset your phone.

3686
01:45:47.971 --> 01:45:49.170
I noticed it.

3687
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:50.100
Yeah,

3688
01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:50.761
I did everything.

3689
01:45:50.761 --> 01:45:51.451
I disconnected.

3690
01:45:51.451 --> 01:45:52.470
I deleted Twitter.

3691
01:45:52.471 --> 01:45:53.670
I deleted Instagram.

3692
01:45:53.671 --> 01:45:54.750
I reinstalled both of them.

3693
01:45:54.751 --> 01:45:55.540
It won't work.

3694
01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:55.941
Uh,

3695
01:45:55.941 --> 01:45:58.500
have you put in your password lately on Instagram?

3696
01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.910
Maybe hiring a wrong password?

3697
01:45:59.950 --> 01:46:00.180
No.

3698
01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:00.361
No.

3699
01:46:00.361 --> 01:46:00.901
It's all right.

3700
01:46:00.901 --> 01:46:01.734
Everything's right.

3701
01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:02.671
It's just not,

3702
01:46:02.671 --> 01:46:02.971
won't,

3703
01:46:02.971 --> 01:46:03.271
won't,

3704
01:46:03.271 --> 01:46:06.450
won't reach the server logs on the Instagram won't reach server.

3705
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:07.440
Some,

3706
01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.210
some wacky bullshit.

3707
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:10.350
Are you in the Verizon network?

3708
01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.071
You know what it is?

3709
01:46:11.071 --> 01:46:11.290
It's,

3710
01:46:11.290 --> 01:46:15.150
it understands that I like my Samsung Galaxy s three a little bit better.

3711
01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.840
My Samsung Galaxy s three from ting mobile.

3712
01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:20.490
I like it a little better.

3713
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:20.940
Really?

3714
01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.560
Like this wacky fucking phone.

3715
01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:23.370
How about that?

3716
01:46:23.370 --> 01:46:24.060
Huh?

3717
01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:24.630
That's crazy.

3718
01:46:24.630 --> 01:46:25.463
Talk.

3719
01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:26.041
Crazy talk.

3720
01:46:26.041 --> 01:46:27.240
But you'll like your iPhone dog.

3721
01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:29.190
I liked the Samsung Galaxy s three better.

3722
01:46:29.191 --> 01:46:30.660
I think that fucking big screen.

3723
01:46:30.661 --> 01:46:32.880
And how's that camera compare that fat ass.

3724
01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:33.740
Oh,

3725
01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:34.610
you like the Samsung.

3726
01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:35.491
You can't,

3727
01:46:35.491 --> 01:46:36.324
they're both awesome.

3728
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:41.230
The Samsung Galaxy s three as I fucking iPhone cameras.

3729
01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:42.840
You'd see the showtime special.

3730
01:46:42.841 --> 01:46:43.651
You know what else it does?

3731
01:46:43.651 --> 01:46:44.101
You know what else?

3732
01:46:44.101 --> 01:46:44.341
Yes sir.

3733
01:46:44.341 --> 01:46:44.700
He does.

3734
01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:45.990
I can take a burst of photos.

3735
01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:49.770
You could jump up in the air and I'll take a burst of photos up and down.

3736
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:50.910
It tastes like a ship.

3737
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:52.170
This is on the Verizon network.

3738
01:46:52.171 --> 01:46:52.640
Correct.

3739
01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:52.950
Um,

3740
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:54.210
I think you can get it on Verizon.

3741
01:46:54.211 --> 01:46:57.960
I know you can get it on sprints cause we have it on [inaudible],

3742
01:46:57.990 --> 01:47:00.750
which is on sprint and I know you can get it on 18 t two.

3743
01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:01.950
It's a fucking wicked.

3744
01:47:01.951 --> 01:47:04.050
Those big screens are wicked and it's good.

3745
01:47:04.051 --> 01:47:05.150
And like everything else it doesn't,

3746
01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:06.013
it's good enough.

3747
01:47:06.090 --> 01:47:06.990
How much shit do you need?

3748
01:47:06.991 --> 01:47:07.830
How many apps do you need,

3749
01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:08.640
goddammit?

3750
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.300
Except blades.

3751
01:47:10.301 --> 01:47:15.301
Linear from kerosene games coming out in January on the android application.

3752
01:47:16.831 --> 01:47:19.440
I listened to a some Pablo Francisco and the other day.

3753
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:21.390
What are you doing with this Brad Picker Marshall?

3754
01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:22.820
You really plan a Brad Pitt commercial.

3755
01:47:22.821 --> 01:47:23.340
You fuck.

3756
01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:24.173
It's not a journey.

3757
01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:25.860
Every journey ends,

3758
01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:26.723
but we go on.

3759
01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:27.683
I'd let them fuck me.

3760
01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:30.270
Twirled turns when we turn with it.

3761
01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.590
What's your too deep?

3762
01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:34.260
Deep Man's disappear put in my mouth.

3763
01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:35.670
Dreams takeover.

3764
01:47:35.730 --> 01:47:36.600
Oh,

3765
01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.180
but wherever I go,

3766
01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.113
oh,

3767
01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.520
there you are.

3768
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:42.250
I bet his kisses.

3769
01:47:42.250 --> 01:47:44.070
Salty luck.

3770
01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:45.203
My fate,

3771
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:47.303
my porch.

3772
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:49.410
<v 5>Chanel number five.</v>

3773
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:50.071
Whoa.

3774
01:47:50.071 --> 01:47:50.881
No you didn't.

3775
01:47:50.881 --> 01:47:51.271
Brad.

3776
01:47:51.271 --> 01:47:52.104
Brad,

3777
01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:52.921
Brad,

3778
01:47:52.921 --> 01:47:53.251
Brad.

3779
01:47:53.251 --> 01:47:55.770
Brad does not enough money in the world for that.

3780
01:47:55.771 --> 01:47:56.310
Brad,

3781
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:57.510
who's your fucking agent?

3782
01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:00.930
You could have caught it off before you said Chanel number five.

3783
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:02.190
You would have been okay.

3784
01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:04.590
You would've been okay as long as you mention her name.

3785
01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:06.120
What gave you the fucking,

3786
01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.520
they'll eat a beet and comes this shit on number five.

3787
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:11.940
No,

3788
01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:12.151
no,

3789
01:48:12.151 --> 01:48:12.361
no.

3790
01:48:12.361 --> 01:48:15.360
He has to end it and let someone else like Morgan Freeman.

3791
01:48:15.450 --> 01:48:17.010
So you should nail number five.

3792
01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:19.350
Someone else says the Chanel number five.

3793
01:48:19.710 --> 01:48:21.120
Someone unrelated to that.

3794
01:48:21.121 --> 01:48:22.860
Really Corny fucking snitch.

3795
01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:25.700
<v 0>Every walk ends,</v>

3796
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:26.683
but we go on

3797
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:30.260
the stick flies and we chase after it.

3798
01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.900
Training disappears.

3799
01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:35.280
Instincts take over.

3800
01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:37.190
Do not change the channel,

3801
01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:38.420
but wherever I fetch,

3802
01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:40.213
there you are.

3803
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:42.223
My Wag,

3804
01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:43.813
my tree,

3805
01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.373
my belly rub,

3806
01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:49.270
<v 6>Ken l number five</v>

3807
01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:50.780
<v 5>that's a joke.</v>

3808
01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:52.350
When I was a junk one.

3809
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:53.050
Meanwhile,

3810
01:48:53.050 --> 01:48:53.760
by the way,

3811
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.593
less opportunities,

3812
01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:59.040
less pretentious than the Brad Pitt one.

3813
01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:01.380
It was resident.

3814
01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:04.350
I would rather the lots of the Brad Pitt one,

3815
01:49:04.351 --> 01:49:07.380
and let's examine this because this is one of the most preposterous commercials

3816
01:49:07.381 --> 01:49:12.381
I've seen since the baby just for men commercial where the baby drives a

3817
01:49:12.571 --> 01:49:13.404
Porsche.

3818
01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:14.430
<v 0>Every journey ends,</v>

3819
01:49:14.431 --> 01:49:15.264
but we go on,

3820
01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.810
the world turns when we turn with him,

3821
01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:22.070
plans disappear.

3822
01:49:23.210 --> 01:49:24.230
Dreams take over.

3823
01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.100
<v 6>But wherever I go there you are</v>

3824
01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:32.853
luck.

3825
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:33.783
My fate,

3826
01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:35.853
my fortune.

3827
01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:37.990
Chanel number five

3828
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:40.660
I get the habitable.

3829
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:43.100
<v 5>I guess there's more of them were saying,</v>

3830
01:49:43.210 --> 01:49:46.500
we got to find more of them because I'll never listen to award.

3831
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.220
That motherfucker says ever again.

3832
01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:52.810
<v 0>Unless they gave all that money to pregnant babies in Africa.</v>

3833
01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:58.060
Unless all a hundred percent of that money went to the pregnant babies.

3834
01:49:58.290 --> 01:49:59.123
Right?

3835
01:49:59.230 --> 01:49:59.770
What's that?

3836
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:00.101
What is it?

3837
01:50:00.101 --> 01:50:01.000
Fuck with Brad Pitt,

3838
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.450
they thought,

3839
01:50:01.450 --> 01:50:01.991
you know,

3840
01:50:01.991 --> 01:50:02.950
just that commercial.

3841
01:50:02.951 --> 01:50:06.520
I just saw the picture of him was Chanel number five and I just was going to

3842
01:50:06.521 --> 01:50:07.930
tweet something silly about it,

3843
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:11.620
but I didn't know that there was a whole goddamn advertising campaign that has

3844
01:50:11.621 --> 01:50:13.270
the most preposterous ads ever.

3845
01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:13.910
Here we go,

3846
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:15.320
but we go on please.

3847
01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:16.173
Hold on.

3848
01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:19.140
<v 1>It's not a journey.</v>

3849
01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.753
Every journey.

3850
01:50:21.150 --> 01:50:21.871
That's the same thing.

3851
01:50:21.871 --> 01:50:22.704
Go on.

3852
01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.440
<v 6>We'll turn to return.</v>

3853
01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:28.220
Was it plans disappear,

3854
01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.300
dreams Chicco

3855
01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:32.773
wherever I go.

3856
01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:35.163
There you are.

3857
01:50:38.130 --> 01:50:38.963
My say,

3858
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:40.833
my fortune

3859
01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:44.140
Chanel number five is none.

3860
01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:44.680
Stop.

3861
01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.030
<v 1>There's nothing that pussy in the world.</v>

3862
01:50:46.031 --> 01:50:47.380
Give me the talk like that ever.

3863
01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:50.680
I just want you to know there's not enough money and just not that you couldn't,

3864
01:50:50.681 --> 01:50:51.970
you couldn't stack it high enough.

3865
01:50:51.971 --> 01:50:52.421
I'd be like,

3866
01:50:52.421 --> 01:50:52.990
stop it.

3867
01:50:52.990 --> 01:50:54.160
I can't say that.

3868
01:50:55.090 --> 01:50:56.470
That's why it doesn't make any sense.

3869
01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.000
This is the chick from Avatar.

3870
01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.500
They got out of the basement.

3871
01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:00.530
She's got us.

3872
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:01.660
They just brought her over.

3873
01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:06.720
Ain't gonna suck is the big blue crazy Dee.

3874
01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:09.910
She's gonna suck his fucking yank tonight.

3875
01:51:09.911 --> 01:51:11.140
What are you fucking nuts?

3876
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:12.410
Wherever I go,

3877
01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:15.970
<v 0>they were all turns.</v>

3878
01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:16.790
We turn with it,

3879
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:17.070
right?

3880
01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:18.020
What have mill.

3881
01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.220
Why did you write that down?

3882
01:51:19.221 --> 01:51:20.900
Why did you even write that down in the world?

3883
01:51:20.901 --> 01:51:21.111
No,

3884
01:51:21.111 --> 01:51:21.860
the guy who wrote it,

3885
01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:23.510
the world terminals and you turn with it.

3886
01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:24.573
What?

3887
01:51:24.650 --> 01:51:24.980
Come on,

3888
01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:25.610
stop it.

3889
01:51:25.610 --> 01:51:26.211
You breathe in,

3890
01:51:26.211 --> 01:51:27.044
you breathe out,

3891
01:51:27.170 --> 01:51:27.791
your step left.

3892
01:51:27.791 --> 01:51:28.580
Who Step right?

3893
01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:29.360
You open the door,

3894
01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:30.193
then you shut it.

3895
01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:31.551
You get in your car,

3896
01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:31.971
you drive.

3897
01:51:31.971 --> 01:51:32.810
Then you hit the brakes.

3898
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:35.290
Like what fucking rope is that?

3899
01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:37.160
It's like some of the most preposterous silly.

3900
01:51:37.161 --> 01:51:37.250
Yeah.

3901
01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:38.083
<v 1>Horse Shit.</v>

3902
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:40.320
And it's not coming out of it.

3903
01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:41.161
<v 0>Struggling actor.</v>

3904
01:51:41.161 --> 01:51:41.371
Okay.

3905
01:51:41.371 --> 01:51:43.320
If you're a struggling actor and you know,

3906
01:51:43.321 --> 01:51:47.940
and someone comes up to you and they give you a break and it's to do this crazy

3907
01:51:47.941 --> 01:51:49.650
corny Chanel number five commercial,

3908
01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:51.390
that wasn't a struggling actor.

3909
01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:52.950
That's a motherfucking multimillionaire.

3910
01:51:53.010 --> 01:51:54.450
We need to find out where that money went.

3911
01:51:54.630 --> 01:51:55.860
It might go to pregnant babies.

3912
01:51:56.010 --> 01:51:56.970
If it goes to pregnant,

3913
01:51:56.971 --> 01:51:58.350
starving babies with aids.

3914
01:51:58.740 --> 01:51:59.580
We'll let him slide.

3915
01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:01.920
Pay The fucking village off by a village.

3916
01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:02.490
I wonder.

3917
01:52:02.490 --> 01:52:03.091
I just asked you.

3918
01:52:03.091 --> 01:52:03.924
We think you'd go for that.

3919
01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:07.290
You'd have to give him like something like that right here.

3920
01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:08.310
Goddamn Brad Pitt.

3921
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:09.780
He's gotta get me a fee.

3922
01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.010
If it was Brad Pitt's agent,

3923
01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:11.251
I mean,

3924
01:52:11.251 --> 01:52:15.510
he's Brad motherfucking pit holes that he has big commercials overseas.

3925
01:52:15.511 --> 01:52:16.290
Like,

3926
01:52:16.290 --> 01:52:16.770
Oh yes.

3927
01:52:16.770 --> 01:52:19.020
We do them in big Pan and she had a lot of them.

3928
01:52:19.021 --> 01:52:19.301
Shit.

3929
01:52:19.301 --> 01:52:23.430
That's why a lot of American celebrities feel like you can't,

3930
01:52:23.431 --> 01:52:26.180
you're not supposed to do a commercial because if you do commercial like uh,

3931
01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:26.740
you know,

3932
01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:27.510
if you like,

3933
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:28.530
if you're a movie star,

3934
01:52:29.370 --> 01:52:30.203
well you watch him.

3935
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:33.340
<v 6>What is this red tape?</v>

3936
01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:34.320
Japanese commercial

3937
01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.130
pushing a car.

3938
01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:40.290
He's dressed up like a goofball.

3939
01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:47.890
He's dressed up weird like Jim style on this Horse Dung moving like Charlie

3940
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:49.423
Chaplin.

3941
01:52:57.370 --> 01:52:58.240
<v 0>See that's fine.</v>

3942
01:52:58.241 --> 01:53:00.520
That's just him moving around and taking a picture.

3943
01:53:00.521 --> 01:53:01.600
I don't have any problem with that.

3944
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:02.441
I've got a problem.

3945
01:53:02.441 --> 01:53:04.150
When you're staring at the camera,

3946
01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:07.820
talking about the world turns and you turn away.

3947
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:12.510
<v 5>I touched my tongue TRS</v>

3948
01:53:14.190 --> 01:53:16.810
balance

3949
01:53:21.930 --> 01:53:22.411
that they say,

3950
01:53:22.411 --> 01:53:23.244
Joey Diaz,

3951
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:25.080
fuck big pussy in Japan.

3952
01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:36.220
See these are great because he's not talking in English.

3953
01:53:36.850 --> 01:53:37.661
He doesn't say anything.

3954
01:53:37.661 --> 01:53:38.950
He's just playing a character.

3955
01:53:39.130 --> 01:53:40.690
These might as well be.

3956
01:53:41.230 --> 01:53:42.610
I mean he might as well be in a movie.

3957
01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:42.911
Look,

3958
01:53:42.911 --> 01:53:43.270
he,

3959
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:45.850
I mean he's a very clever about the way he did this.

3960
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:46.840
Like the first one.

3961
01:53:46.841 --> 01:53:48.520
He's clearly acting,

3962
01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:49.481
he's got a weird,

3963
01:53:49.481 --> 01:53:49.960
crazy,

3964
01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:52.830
cooky yellow outfit on and in this one he's,

3965
01:53:52.831 --> 01:53:53.071
he's,

3966
01:53:53.071 --> 01:53:57.670
he's playing a role and he's pretending to pick this giant fucking sumo guy up.

3967
01:53:58.420 --> 01:53:59.770
That shit is impossible.

3968
01:53:59.771 --> 01:54:00.604
I want you to know,

3969
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:02.950
because Joey Diaz is not as big as that guy,

3970
01:54:03.250 --> 01:54:05.970
but I'm probably stronger than Brad Pitt and I tried to pick up

3971
01:54:06.010 --> 01:54:08.710
<v 0>Joey up once when he was seated and it was no dice.</v>

3972
01:54:09.070 --> 01:54:10.960
I went double under hooks on Joey's back.

3973
01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:12.070
I got a gable grip.

3974
01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:13.480
It wasn't happening man.

3975
01:54:14.410 --> 01:54:18.400
Even though the big guy from the US from pride couldn't pick me up over his

3976
01:54:18.401 --> 01:54:18.820
head.

3977
01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:19.361
Really?

3978
01:54:19.361 --> 01:54:22.930
Bob Sapp upside one of the most uncomfortable things for everybody.

3979
01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:24.790
How high did it get you up there?

3980
01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.620
If he was having a heart,

3981
01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:28.740
I was really like top heavy or something.

3982
01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:31.363
<v 5>I was fine,</v>

3983
01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:33.180
but Bob was never,

3984
01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:35.940
for years people would put computers on me or what not.

3985
01:54:35.941 --> 01:54:36.541
Cell phones,

3986
01:54:36.541 --> 01:54:37.171
all that stuff,

3987
01:54:37.171 --> 01:54:37.801
and my friend said,

3988
01:54:37.801 --> 01:54:38.370
listen,

3989
01:54:38.370 --> 01:54:42.000
go to godaddy.com I went over to go daddy.com I didn't know about computers.

3990
01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.620
I know about social networks.

3991
01:54:43.621 --> 01:54:44.430
I knew nothing.

3992
01:54:44.430 --> 01:54:45.420
I went to go daddy.

3993
01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:46.500
They had a web builder,

3994
01:54:46.590 --> 01:54:46.921
one,

3995
01:54:46.921 --> 01:54:47.101
two,

3996
01:54:47.101 --> 01:54:48.060
three boom.

3997
01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:51.180
Step by step that with your right the way once you do it,

3998
01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:52.433
within minutes,

3999
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:53.580
your web pages up.

4000
01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.080
I didn't have that online presence.

4001
01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:58.950
People that had a call here like it was still 1969 but ever since I got to go

4002
01:54:58.951 --> 01:55:00.600
daddy or get pay pal.

4003
01:55:00.690 --> 01:55:01.980
I take visa online.

4004
01:55:02.130 --> 01:55:03.480
They got the open table,

4005
01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:07.080
not to mention my Yelp reviews and great Frank's pizza is number one.

4006
01:55:07.110 --> 01:55:09.180
Go to Frank's the services exceptional.

4007
01:55:09.210 --> 01:55:12.720
Frank's delivery system is always on time and the pizza's always warm.

4008
01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:14.670
If you want to build your empire like me,

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:18.301
Nothing.

4012
01:55:18.301 --> 01:55:19.710
I'm just calling you to see what's cracking.

4013
01:55:19.711 --> 01:55:20.544
I have a good day.

4014
01:55:22.930 --> 01:55:23.200
<v 6>Okay,</v>

4015
01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:24.170

4016
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:24.850
I fucker.

4017
01:55:24.850 --> 01:55:26.650
That's how much of that did you write?

4018
01:55:26.651 --> 01:55:30.250
80% of it come on dog and you have no idea what you're talking about.

4019
01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:34.400
They just give you like a rough thing doctor that morning.

4020
01:55:34.570 --> 01:55:34.760
Do

4021
01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:36.060
<v 0>you know the points for this thing?</v>

4022
01:55:36.061 --> 01:55:36.241
I'm like,

4023
01:55:36.241 --> 01:55:36.481
well no,

4024
01:55:36.481 --> 01:55:38.130
I didn't get the thing and they go,

4025
01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:38.791
these are good points.

4026
01:55:38.791 --> 01:55:39.541
You got to say,

4027
01:55:39.541 --> 01:55:43.550
and it was in between like shooting like it was in between shooting Mike's

4028
01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.150
Inbetween like they came old already.

4029
01:55:45.210 --> 01:55:45.510
Right.

4030
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:46.730
Let's pick it up from the other thing.

4031
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:49.410
I had to go back and pick up pay pal,

4032
01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.360
pickup that the tanning booth like that.

4033
01:55:53.610 --> 01:55:53.911
Man,

4034
01:55:53.911 --> 01:55:55.710
that was fucking crazy that morning.

4035
01:55:55.711 --> 01:55:56.544
I was quite,

4036
01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:57.151
yeah,

4037
01:55:57.151 --> 01:55:58.350
that seems like that's a,

4038
01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:01.290
that's a great utilization of you like let,

4039
01:56:01.291 --> 01:56:01.531
yeah,

4040
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:04.290
just give me a given the points and let them rant a little bit.

4041
01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:08.620
Why fuck around and curse Brad Pitt doesn't have to say breathe in,

4042
01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:09.361
breathe in,

4043
01:56:09.361 --> 01:56:12.920
breathe out the world saying you turn away.

4044
01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:16.170
That's the first time I ever saw Brad Pitt in the commercial or am I

4045
01:56:16.171 --> 01:56:16.980
hallucinating?

4046
01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:17.341
No,

4047
01:56:17.341 --> 01:56:17.941
that's a,

4048
01:56:17.941 --> 01:56:20.280
I think he's sold his soul down the river.

4049
01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:20.791
I think.

4050
01:56:20.791 --> 01:56:21.150
Uh,

4051
01:56:21.150 --> 01:56:23.340
how many kids you got kids,

4052
01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:26.730
she's got a lot of houses and he spent on a lot of shit movies lately and

4053
01:56:26.731 --> 01:56:28.070
Angelina has been pulling all the weight.

4054
01:56:28.170 --> 01:56:29.760
And when's the last time Brad was in a big head?

4055
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:33.480
Moneyball was that big yet wasn't the baseball movie.

4056
01:56:33.481 --> 01:56:34.314
I didn't see that.

4057
01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:34.800
Okay.

4058
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:35.633
So I'm wrong.

4059
01:56:35.850 --> 01:56:37.650
So how much money you think you made from that enough to,

4060
01:56:37.651 --> 01:56:40.960
for 80 kids and type point you just to talk to him.

4061
01:56:41.970 --> 01:56:45.330
20 cause what they get from movie got to give him 20 just to talk.

4062
01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:46.860
Maybe that's not enough.

4063
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:48.690
The way they're balling and fucking,

4064
01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:52.200
you know Gucci clothes for little babies and shit.

4065
01:56:52.650 --> 01:56:53.490
20 million.

4066
01:56:53.491 --> 01:56:54.880
The movie he does three,

4067
01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:55.753
that's 60.

4068
01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:57.060
She does the same.

4069
01:56:57.061 --> 01:56:59.310
That's a buck 20 kind of ease.

4070
01:56:59.910 --> 01:57:00.270
That's,

4071
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:02.440
that's some fucking cash dog fucking,

4072
01:57:02.730 --> 01:57:04.590
I wonder how much they've given him for the movies.

4073
01:57:05.070 --> 01:57:06.910
20 I worked for him rather for uh,

4074
01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.440
these commercials for fuck cause that whole campaign he said,

4075
01:57:10.441 --> 01:57:13.220
let's shoot five or six little call.

4076
01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:17.550
If he got together with his silly black and white commercial and they overlapped

4077
01:57:17.551 --> 01:57:18.710
it with Stephen Dorff,

4078
01:57:18.810 --> 01:57:20.700
silly black and white commercial items.

4079
01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.400
They just spliced it back and forth.

4080
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:25.770
You went from one douchey statement to the other.

4081
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:26.783
I think that would be,

4082
01:57:27.090 --> 01:57:27.541
listen,

4083
01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:28.470
mischief maker,

4084
01:57:28.471 --> 01:57:29.610
we know you're out there.

4085
01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:31.190
We're calling you were,

4086
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:35.010
we're setting the freak flag up over the rug and compound.

4087
01:57:35.110 --> 01:57:37.630
We need you to put together the possibly do.

4088
01:57:37.631 --> 01:57:42.060
She has commercials of all time together with kiss the song kissing me in the

4089
01:57:42.061 --> 01:57:42.740
background.

4090
01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:43.350
Yes,

4091
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.831
those man.

4092
01:57:43.831 --> 01:57:47.400
We don't want to fuck with your artistic integrity by giving you a suggestion

4093
01:57:47.401 --> 01:57:48.234
that you haven't.

4094
01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:49.021
But Brandon,

4095
01:57:49.021 --> 01:57:49.491
you know what?

4096
01:57:49.491 --> 01:57:50.310
You know what to do,

4097
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.611
you know,

4098
01:57:50.611 --> 01:57:51.444
to do the right thing.

4099
01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:52.433
Go Man,

4100
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:54.500
this fucking guy was very good money.

4101
01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:56.400
I bet he's a great actor.

4102
01:57:56.401 --> 01:57:58.020
He was great in an interview with a vampire.

4103
01:57:58.470 --> 01:58:00.690
I loved them and that I loved them in a lot of moves,

4104
01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.610
grades in the fight clubs.

4105
01:58:01.611 --> 01:58:02.670
But I just bullshitting.

4106
01:58:02.671 --> 01:58:04.890
But I just wish he didn't do that fucking commercial.

4107
01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:05.101
I mean,

4108
01:58:05.101 --> 01:58:09.240
that's just seems like so Horesh you know I should talk.

4109
01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:11.700
I did fear factor for six years.

4110
01:58:11.701 --> 01:58:12.990
Then I went back and did it again.

4111
01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:15.680
But even I wouldn't do that shit.

4112
01:58:15.681 --> 01:58:16.514
Hell commercial.

4113
01:58:16.770 --> 01:58:17.161
Sure.

4114
01:58:17.161 --> 01:58:17.820
You what?

4115
01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:18.653
I think point

4116
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:22.031
Joe rode off.

4117
01:58:22.031 --> 01:58:24.840
No Fi ring.

4118
01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:26.940
You should smell really stinky.

4119
01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.390
This is the new UFC Chandela dish.

4120
01:58:29.391 --> 01:58:29.731
First of all,

4121
01:58:29.731 --> 01:58:31.620
I could never do it because it's been widely,

4122
01:58:31.650 --> 01:58:35.160
I've said it a hundred times in the podcast that I hate all that stuff.

4123
01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:37.650
I don't like any form of Cologne.

4124
01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:39.990
I wear deodorant because if I don't,

4125
01:58:39.991 --> 01:58:41.250
I smell really,

4126
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:43.690
I smell like meat,

4127
01:58:43.890 --> 01:58:44.500
Sicilian,

4128
01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:45.333
old meat.

4129
01:58:45.370 --> 01:58:46.360
You smells as silly.

4130
01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:47.210
My underarms,

4131
01:58:47.210 --> 01:58:48.500
I want to shave my under

4132
01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:53.590
a Rugala plus you know what folks I get through life,

4133
01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.270
I exude a lot of energy.

4134
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:56.140
You know what I'm saying?

4135
01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.820
I don't half ass things so I'm,

4136
01:58:57.821 --> 01:59:00.250
I'm putting forth effort all day.

4137
01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:01.690
And when you putting forth effort,

4138
01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:03.510
oh shake comes out grinding,

4139
01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:07.870
sweating and shit is going down inside your body and when it comes out of your

4140
01:59:07.871 --> 01:59:09.520
armpits it smells horrible.

4141
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:11.380
So I'll wear a little deodorant.

4142
01:59:11.650 --> 01:59:12.670
So if you smell me and you're like,

4143
01:59:12.671 --> 01:59:13.360
what a hypocrite.

4144
01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:14.710
It's wearing some fucking clothes.

4145
01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:15.280
I'm not,

4146
01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:16.330
that's just old spice.

4147
01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:17.200
That's what I prefer.

4148
01:59:17.201 --> 01:59:18.280
Old Spice Sport.

4149
01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:21.760
Not antiperspirant cause I'm not trying to stop sweating.

4150
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:23.130
I like sweating a little bullshit.

4151
01:59:23.131 --> 01:59:25.240
You sweat a little baby CK one,

4152
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:30.840
<v 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

4153
01:59:30.841 --> 01:59:34.470
Just in case I got reframes me and I got a suit on or something.

4154
01:59:35.010 --> 01:59:35.640
<v 0>And that other one,</v>

4155
01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:35.900

4156
01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:37.350
I'll put a little dab on my neck.

4157
01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:37.931
What is this one?

4158
01:59:37.931 --> 01:59:40.560
What does this commercial with the fuck is going on here?

4159
01:59:40.561 --> 01:59:41.394
Right.

4160
01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.520
<v 8>Big Brother's about to show you that same Christmas.</v>

4161
02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:04.180
Oh this is the thing that you did with Dean Cain.

4162
02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:05.153
This is the latest,

4163
02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:09.370
this is the one for this year called that the dog was saved.

4164
02:00:09.371 --> 02:00:10.204
The holidays.

4165
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:13.210
Very balance on

4166
02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.353
Shelley long.

4167
02:00:26.690 --> 02:00:27.523
Joey Lawrence.

4168
02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:27.870
Oh,

4169
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:29.530
that's me as Zeus.

4170
02:00:30.050 --> 02:00:31.360
You need a little backup on this one.

4171
02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.153
<v 1>Top</v>

4172
02:00:35.690 --> 02:00:36.690

4173
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.391
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4174
02:00:37.391 --> 02:00:37.841
What is that?

4175
02:00:37.841 --> 02:00:39.580
You can't even get top billing or Shelley long.

4176
02:00:39.610 --> 02:00:40.630
You fucking believe this shit.

4177
02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:42.933
What the fuck?

4178
02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:44.920
This fucking day and age is like respect.

4179
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:45.910
Did you get billing at all?

4180
02:00:45.911 --> 02:00:47.170
Did they even mention your names?

4181
02:00:47.171 --> 02:00:47.741
My fucking,

4182
02:00:47.741 --> 02:00:48.010
yeah,

4183
02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:50.850
I get like they treat me like a fucking Puerto Rico in this sport.

4184
02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:54.160
But did you like working with Dean Cain?

4185
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:54.521
Yeah,

4186
02:00:54.521 --> 02:00:55.350
I did like five,

4187
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:56.680
five foot fucking movies.

4188
02:00:56.681 --> 02:01:00.430
Five of those days hanging out with Michael Gross and my last Joey Lawrence or

4189
02:01:00.431 --> 02:01:00.581
no,

4190
02:01:00.581 --> 02:01:01.480
I didn't bother nobody.

4191
02:01:02.170 --> 02:01:05.320
Michael Gross is one of those guys as it had been a bunch of movies and he's a

4192
02:01:05.321 --> 02:01:06.380
really good actor like you.

4193
02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:07.780
And then you see him in that and you go,

4194
02:01:07.810 --> 02:01:09.460
oh that's what that guy's name is.

4195
02:01:09.670 --> 02:01:11.650
I seen that guy in a bunch of things that guys good.

4196
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:13.480
How many times you know what I watched today,

4197
02:01:13.481 --> 02:01:13.750
man?

4198
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:15.760
I started recording it here on the studio.

4199
02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:17.111
Some Walker,

4200
02:01:17.111 --> 02:01:17.980
Texas ranger.

4201
02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:20.230
Oh my goodness.

4202
02:01:20.231 --> 02:01:21.460
It's fucking good.

4203
02:01:21.461 --> 02:01:22.930
Cause it's so funny.

4204
02:01:23.050 --> 02:01:23.381
I want to,

4205
02:01:23.381 --> 02:01:26.260
I want to play a little bit of it for you cause it's so ridiculous.

4206
02:01:26.261 --> 02:01:27.790
I recorded on the Dvr,

4207
02:01:27.970 --> 02:01:29.620
I forgot how good that show is.

4208
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:31.300
That show is like,

4209
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:36.230
might as well be a comic book that was written in 1950 you know what I mean?

4210
02:01:36.231 --> 02:01:38.280
When he walk up on paying everything,

4211
02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:41.510
oh it's this side kick was a red,

4212
02:01:41.511 --> 02:01:41.900
this leak.

4213
02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:42.710
Is it a fight?

4214
02:01:42.710 --> 02:01:45.890
He gets in a fight in this bad guy's office and the t two bad guys,

4215
02:01:45.891 --> 02:01:48.170
henchmen tried to close in on him and he's strong.

4216
02:01:48.230 --> 02:01:49.610
He's in a little crow's environment,

4217
02:01:49.611 --> 02:01:52.050
but he's strong like mad karate kicks and shed talking to her,

4218
02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:52.761
don't play games,

4219
02:01:52.761 --> 02:01:54.070
throw a wheel kicks and shit is,

4220
02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.270
and we read off the badge,

4221
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:57.020
throws wheel kicks with cowboy boots on.

4222
02:01:57.021 --> 02:01:57.530
Shit.

4223
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:57.831
Anyway,

4224
02:01:57.831 --> 02:02:00.050
knock this guy out and then goes up to him,

4225
02:02:00.051 --> 02:02:00.650
grabs him,

4226
02:02:00.650 --> 02:02:00.981
you know,

4227
02:02:00.981 --> 02:02:04.580
and it starts questioning them and the acting that came out of this meathead

4228
02:02:04.610 --> 02:02:05.660
that was lying down on the ground.

4229
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:09.270
It might be the worst is acting ever recorded on Phelan put on salvation.

4230
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:10.340
I it's,

4231
02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:11.173
it's beautiful.

4232
02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:13.360
It's a great show.

4233
02:02:13.810 --> 02:02:14.351
Those shows,

4234
02:02:14.351 --> 02:02:17.730
like you watch those shows and you wonder what they were really going to read

4235
02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:18.760
bag fortunately.

4236
02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:19.460
Why?

4237
02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:21.850
What's going on it jelly.

4238
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:22.960
What's the show?

4239
02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:24.250
What's your character's name in that?

4240
02:02:24.251 --> 02:02:24.791
Nickelodeon.

4241
02:02:24.791 --> 02:02:25.660
So Joey Lasagna.

4242
02:02:25.690 --> 02:02:26.523
What do you pull it off?

4243
02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:27.220
Meatballs.

4244
02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:28.120
Joey meatballs.

4245
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:29.870
Totally beat the beat.

4246
02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:31.360
Bulking meatball king.

4247
02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.080
It's so funny seeing Joey now out in public and like people come up like,

4248
02:02:35.230 --> 02:02:36.940
can you sign this for my daughter?

4249
02:02:36.941 --> 02:02:37.361
And you're like,

4250
02:02:37.361 --> 02:02:38.610
what the fuck is that?

4251
02:02:38.670 --> 02:02:43.240
And then you realize that he's known for this character called Joey meatballs.

4252
02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:46.090
What shows us king cake of it.

4253
02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:46.520
Yeah.

4254
02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:47.650
Kicking what is kicking it?

4255
02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:50.050
It's a show on Disney XD now.

4256
02:02:50.051 --> 02:02:53.350
What if these people ever see you on stage or listen to one of these fucking

4257
02:02:53.351 --> 02:02:53.931
podcasts?

4258
02:02:53.931 --> 02:02:54.320
Yes.

4259
02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:54.530
<v 8>No,</v>

4260
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:54.770
no.

4261
02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:57.140
The funny thing is that these kick in,

4262
02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.113
it's

4263
02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:03.340
<v 0>the funny thing is that all these shows to advertise them that put on there by</v>

4264
02:03:03.341 --> 02:03:04.210
the networks.

4265
02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:08.140
Nickelodeon knows that if they gonna pull out a trailer and the commercial,

4266
02:03:08.410 --> 02:03:10.450
it's a lot cheaper to put the trailer on Youtube.

4267
02:03:10.730 --> 02:03:10.961
Right.

4268
02:03:10.961 --> 02:03:12.640
Kids will know that they come up and they'll hit it.

4269
02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:13.060
Yeah.

4270
02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:15.580
There's thousands of hits on these trailers for kicking it,

4271
02:03:15.581 --> 02:03:16.414
right?

4272
02:03:16.530 --> 02:03:17.480
You go on to the trailer,

4273
02:03:17.481 --> 02:03:19.210
the how mom and you got to see what it says.

4274
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:20.703
If you ain't hide right,

4275
02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.390
<v 1>two o'clock,</v>

4276
02:03:21.390 --> 02:03:23.440
I'll fuck your mother Lucy.

4277
02:03:23.441 --> 02:03:24.071
Slow Bush.

4278
02:03:24.071 --> 02:03:25.800
I want to eat your pussy and Queloz.

4279
02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:27.150
You got to see like

4280
02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:28.300
<v 0>one for like,</v>

4281
02:03:28.301 --> 02:03:29.134
uh,

4282
02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:30.830
uh,

4283
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:31.730
<v 8>pull up the comments.</v>

4284
02:03:31.731 --> 02:03:32.540
Brian,

4285
02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:33.373
what is this word?

4286
02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:36.410
That's why you came to your center.

4287
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:38.510
This is where my money.

4288
02:03:39.170 --> 02:03:40.080
What is this?

4289
02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:41.250
You got Mike Go.

4290
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:42.913
Yeah,

4291
02:03:45.070 --> 02:03:45.903
sure,

4292
02:03:46.450 --> 02:03:46.760
sure.

4293
02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.870
You'd be making a delivery.

4294
02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:49.790
I'm done with the library,

4295
02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:51.470
but don't take a job with you.

4296
02:03:51.471 --> 02:03:52.940
I didn't know what kind of person you were,

4297
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:54.513
but I do now.

4298
02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.280
What are you doing here with?

4299
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:57.643
Go for it.

4300
02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:59.053
Go for it.

4301
02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:01.540
<v 1>He's got lots of breaks.</v>

4302
02:04:02.650 --> 02:04:03.590
You might even know him.

4303
02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:05.990
Stop before I get retarded.

4304
02:04:07.770 --> 02:04:09.200
That might turn me down.

4305
02:04:10.190 --> 02:04:10.930
That's worse.

4306
02:04:10.930 --> 02:04:11.511
The Walker,

4307
02:04:11.511 --> 02:04:12.344
Texas Ranger.

4308
02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:13.130
Listen,

4309
02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:14.510
we're going to have to compare.

4310
02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:16.850
We're going to have to compare that to Walker,

4311
02:04:16.851 --> 02:04:21.140
Texas ranger because I'm telling you pretty damn quick.

4312
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:29.050
<v 8>One second.</v>

4313
02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:32.993
Yeah,

4314
02:04:34.230 --> 02:04:35.063
<v 0>that was nice.</v>

4315
02:04:35.970 --> 02:04:36.990
That was not good.

4316
02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.050
Can you imagine if

4317
02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:40.840
<v 4>he was really fighting with these kids?</v>

4318
02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.490
You know,

4319
02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:44.590
you know what the worst thing is when you first come to Hollywood and you meet

4320
02:04:44.591 --> 02:04:45.490
somebody like that,

4321
02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:49.930
that somebody that's been in one of these really horrible shows and they make

4322
02:04:49.931 --> 02:04:51.500
you watch it all the time,

4323
02:04:51.530 --> 02:04:53.230
they're real and you try to go to their house.

4324
02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:54.400
Have you ever had that happen?

4325
02:04:54.730 --> 02:04:55.563
Oh please.

4326
02:04:56.110 --> 02:04:56.321
Oh,

4327
02:04:56.321 --> 02:04:57.154
it's the worst.

4328
02:04:58.110 --> 02:04:59.020
When people email.

4329
02:04:59.021 --> 02:04:59.860
You should still,

4330
02:05:00.340 --> 02:05:03.410
I still get shit on Facebook and Twitter.

4331
02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:05.530
Watched my reel and tell me what you think.

4332
02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:08.770
Why would you ask a guy like me at five in the morning?

4333
02:05:08.771 --> 02:05:09.890
It was fucking stolen.

4334
02:05:12.190 --> 02:05:12.630
<v 6>Okay.</v>

4335
02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:13.810
<v 4>That beanie,</v>

4336
02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:15.950
that Diana Red Beanie.

4337
02:05:15.951 --> 02:05:17.580
You going back to Columbus for the holidays?

4338
02:05:17.770 --> 02:05:18.510
No,

4339
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:20.030
but I'm going back in March,

4340
02:05:20.050 --> 02:05:20.391
uh,

4341
02:05:20.391 --> 02:05:23.000
with Joe Rogan and look at this shit.

4342
02:05:23.050 --> 02:05:25.910
Are you turn around and look at this Tara,

4343
02:05:28.890 --> 02:05:31.080
we can't show this on TV cause we don't have the rights for it.

4344
02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:32.461
It's chuck,

4345
02:05:32.461 --> 02:05:33.540
Doris just,

4346
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:34.920
I mean it's like,

4347
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:36.040
it's hilarious.

4348
02:05:36.041 --> 02:05:37.710
Doe Watch this one dude though.

4349
02:05:37.711 --> 02:05:38.730
This is my favorite.

4350
02:05:38.910 --> 02:05:41.970
After he smashes this guy and then the big guy grabs him.

4351
02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:43.260
Now Watch this move.

4352
02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:44.490
Kickoff the wall.

4353
02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:45.061
Boom.

4354
02:05:45.061 --> 02:05:45.894
Throw him down.

4355
02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:48.420
Now check this Anderson Silva like elbow.

4356
02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:49.670
Now Watch this acting.

4357
02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:51.570
This is the worst acting ever.

4358
02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:53.773
<v 6>This girl,</v>

4359
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:58.900
I told the other guys what guys give their names.

4360
02:06:02.970 --> 02:06:03.840
<v 4>Chuck is excellent.</v>

4361
02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:05.070
How bad is the goon?

4362
02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:06.573
And he's just out.

4363
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:07.800
He's just out again.

4364
02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:10.560
And then there's some kids that he has to hug.

4365
02:06:11.550 --> 02:06:12.383
That's what he does.

4366
02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:13.470
Saves your world and hugs.

4367
02:06:13.471 --> 02:06:14.790
Who Kids fucking shows.

4368
02:06:14.791 --> 02:06:15.624
Great.

4369
02:06:15.930 --> 02:06:18.720
Especially when you're as high as the national deficit.

4370
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.221
Let me tell you something.

4371
02:06:20.221 --> 02:06:25.221
The other day I was cleaning up my fucking room and I found a package for 18

4372
02:06:25.681 --> 02:06:26.730
wheels of justice.

4373
02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:28.571
No show,

4374
02:06:28.571 --> 02:06:28.820
right?

4375
02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:30.600
The first show I ever shot.

4376
02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:31.980
That wasn't Lorenzo Lamas,

4377
02:06:31.981 --> 02:06:32.610
right?

4378
02:06:32.610 --> 02:06:35.010
So one of those fucking actors down and whatever,

4379
02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:37.440
I forgot all about it.

4380
02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:41.940
18 wheels of justice was the first booking of him before I wanted to tell me the

4381
02:06:41.941 --> 02:06:43.830
ladies a fucking old lady,

4382
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:45.131
she'll torture you.

4383
02:06:45.131 --> 02:06:48.600
You I want in their book the book he role where I had a smack,

4384
02:06:48.601 --> 02:06:52.170
a fucking a playmate in the ass and she walks out of the room,

4385
02:06:52.650 --> 02:06:54.090
18 wheels of justice.

4386
02:06:54.090 --> 02:06:59.090
It was in 2000 I shot one of those episodes in San Diego on them and they gave

4387
02:06:59.431 --> 02:07:01.830
me 60 bucks for per diem.

4388
02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:02.671
Oh my God.

4389
02:07:02.671 --> 02:07:03.420
I didn't eat nothing.

4390
02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:03.961
I saved it.

4391
02:07:03.961 --> 02:07:04.950
The dual grammar blow.

4392
02:07:05.230 --> 02:07:06.240
It wasn't uh,

4393
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:07.110
Lorenzo.

4394
02:07:07.110 --> 02:07:07.441
No,

4395
02:07:07.441 --> 02:07:09.960
with some other news.

4396
02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:11.671
Oh my God.

4397
02:07:11.671 --> 02:07:12.630
See what else he's shot.

4398
02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:13.950
Suzanne lucky the news.

4399
02:07:13.951 --> 02:07:18.720
He's fucking working in the Tampa revival group right down reviving fucking

4400
02:07:18.721 --> 02:07:19.500
Godspell.

4401
02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:24.500
This guy was the head guy in the show and they don't even have a photo of him.

4402
02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:26.120
I am DV.

4403
02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.193
Is this it?

4404
02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:30.270
G Gordon Liddy man.

4405
02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:31.500
It's how they grew up in a house.

4406
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:35.210
Yeah,

4407
02:07:35.210 --> 02:07:36.043
that's it.

4408
02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:43.681
<v 0>Oh God.</v>

4409
02:07:43.681 --> 02:07:44.514
That was the guy

4410
02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:47.970
and he was like trying to like,

4411
02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:50.610
that was guys what spike,

4412
02:07:50.611 --> 02:07:52.530
which was 10 ed at the time.

4413
02:07:52.590 --> 02:07:53.401
Oh that's right.

4414
02:07:53.401 --> 02:07:54.234
It was the national,

4415
02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.220
that was what they tried to do.

4416
02:07:56.490 --> 02:07:57.750
Original programming.

4417
02:07:57.751 --> 02:07:58.470
That was it.

4418
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:59.220
That was hard.

4419
02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:00.053
Yup.

4420
02:08:03.590 --> 02:08:04.520
<v 9>That's a good idea.</v>

4421
02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:07.480
<v 0>I have a show called the national network and you're like,</v>

4422
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:07.840
listen,

4423
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:08.673
this is what we got.

4424
02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:10.120
We got a lot of truckers,

4425
02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:11.170
a lot of truckers watch.

4426
02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:12.430
How about a trucker superhero?

4427
02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:16.740
How about truck or superhero that had just an ordinary guys just backed into

4428
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:19.300
extraordinary circumstances and uh,

4429
02:08:19.301 --> 02:08:20.290
he's forced to,

4430
02:08:20.291 --> 02:08:20.570
you know,

4431
02:08:20.570 --> 02:08:24.160
man up and pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become a reluctant hero.

4432
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.700
I mean,

4433
02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.950
I think it's basically Bj and the bear,

4434
02:08:26.951 --> 02:08:27.784
but no chimp,

4435
02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:29.643
one of the,

4436
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:32.350
one of the best shows of all time Bj and the bear.

4437
02:08:32.590 --> 02:08:35.170
Remember back when Bj and the bear was on and we thought champs were like these

4438
02:08:35.171 --> 02:08:38.260
little cute things that you could hug before they started eating people's faces

4439
02:08:38.261 --> 02:08:38.640
and fighting.

4440
02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:39.610
It ticks off and shit.

4441
02:08:40.090 --> 02:08:42.900
And he never heard about that when our kids never heard about a champ bite and

4442
02:08:42.901 --> 02:08:43.780
people's faces off.

4443
02:08:44.170 --> 02:08:45.100
[inaudible]

4444
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:47.620
that's the fucking problem.

4445
02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:47.901
Well,

4446
02:08:47.901 --> 02:08:52.090
it wasn't that one that one lady that lived in Connecticut that had the pet

4447
02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:52.480
chimp,

4448
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:54.070
she was feeding that fucking champ.

4449
02:08:54.071 --> 02:08:54.904
Xanax.

4450
02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:58.090
She's feeding it Xanax and was drinking wine.

4451
02:08:58.450 --> 02:08:59.170
Yeah,

4452
02:08:59.170 --> 02:09:01.270
the bitch was taken Xanax so she would leave.

4453
02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.490
The chimp wants is asked to give him a fucking Xanex.

4454
02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:05.081
Give me a Xanax.

4455
02:09:05.081 --> 02:09:05.950
He's going to eat your face.

4456
02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:07.070
Give him a fucking sonics.

4457
02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:08.850
That probably is why eight,

4458
02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:09.723
that chick's face,

4459
02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:11.670
he was probably coming down from xanaxes

4460
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:16.000
is all Zadie out red bag,

4461
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:22.410
pork champ between an edible did HIV something.

4462
02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:24.370
I don't know why he kicked in about 10 minutes ago.

4463
02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:25.440
He hit the wall.

4464
02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:27.880
Why do we call it the Eddie Bravo post one hour wall?

4465
02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:28.973
What?

4466
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:30.781
Why?

4467
02:09:30.781 --> 02:09:31.550
What have I hit?

4468
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:32.380
No fucking wall.

4469
02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:36.120
Eddie probably goes guns blazing for the first hour of podcast and then,

4470
02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:37.420
and then like an hour and he goes,

4471
02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:38.853
so what,

4472
02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:39.330
anything.

4473
02:09:39.330 --> 02:09:40.163
No,

4474
02:09:40.770 --> 02:09:41.501
you fucking guys.

4475
02:09:41.501 --> 02:09:41.801
I'm looking,

4476
02:09:41.801 --> 02:09:42.100
I don't know.

4477
02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:43.590
He's Rambo town is striking.

4478
02:09:43.591 --> 02:09:46.090

fens and he's the shit.

4481
02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:53.350
He's got his own podcast and he just started doing called Eddie Bravo radio and

4482
02:09:53.351 --> 02:09:53.510

4483
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:55.060

4484

4485
02:09:57.310 --> 02:10:02.310

4492
02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:19.990
All these guys that we trained Jujitsu with.

4493
02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.420
I don't know if he's going to do it with them every episode or if he's just

4494
02:10:22.810 --> 02:10:24.310
doing it like that for now.

4495
02:10:24.311 --> 02:10:27.190

02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.883

4503
02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:37.740
Yay.

4504
02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:38.171
I'm Joe.

4505
02:10:38.171 --> 02:10:40.220
It is here way back machine.

4506
02:10:40.221 --> 02:10:42.260
What did you find that those,

4507
02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:42.681
look,

4508
02:10:42.681 --> 02:10:43.760
you've got to icehouse banner.

4509
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.980
No,

4510
02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:45.620
that you don't come and want to see what,

4511
02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:48.700
there was a chicken there that sent me a message on me.

4512
02:10:48.701 --> 02:10:50.440
I want to see if it's still on that Hoopa.

4513
02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:51.201
Don't,

4514
02:10:51.201 --> 02:10:52.130
don't show it online.

4515
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:58.420
Is that online still this thing and the Internet archives.

4516
02:10:58.421 --> 02:10:58.761
So they look,

4517
02:10:58.761 --> 02:11:01.730
here's the picture of Pablo from back in the day that you probably forgot about.

4518
02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:02.930
That's what I was just saying,

4519
02:11:02.931 --> 02:11:05.000
that it was listening to Pablo on the way over here.

4520
02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:05.720
Um,

4521
02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:06.231
they had,

4522
02:11:06.231 --> 02:11:06.560
uh,

4523
02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:08.780
it was on the Jamie Foxx is a thing.

4524
02:11:09.170 --> 02:11:10.030
The foxhole,

4525
02:11:10.150 --> 02:11:13.610
it's the same one where he's interviewing Quentin Tarantino and uh,

4526
02:11:13.611 --> 02:11:18.611
I was listening to a Pablo and Pablo is so fucking entertaining that do,

4527
02:11:19.971 --> 02:11:24.971
did nothing but Jackie Chan like elect Jackie Chan like trailer like jokes,

4528
02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:26.091
you know,

4529
02:11:26.091 --> 02:11:29.210
like he's the nicest guy in the world,

4530
02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:29.691
you know,

4531
02:11:29.691 --> 02:11:30.501
like I'm so nice.

4532
02:11:30.501 --> 02:11:31.520
Why you have to fight me?

4533
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.840
And it was,

4534
02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:36.550
he just did nothing but dad for 10 minutes and I'm just laughing like,

4535
02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:39.290
like a fool in my car,

4536
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:40.640
giggling on the way up here.

4537
02:11:41.150 --> 02:11:41.811
What are you doing Brian?

4538
02:11:41.811 --> 02:11:44.680
You're distracting the shit out of him and all this at it.

4539
02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:48.040
[inaudible]

4540
02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:53.400
you're definitely [inaudible] I haven't been smoking weed for the solid science

4541
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:59.660
from the solid sense of the vapors.

4542
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:02.990
That vaporizer is very good,

4543
02:12:02.991 --> 02:12:04.250
but it's not as good as smoking weed.

4544
02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:04.440
No,

4545
02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:04.621
no,

4546
02:12:04.621 --> 02:12:04.750
no,

4547
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:05.000
no.

4548
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:05.630
That's what I'm saying.

4549
02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:06.463
It's pretty good.

4550
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:07.910
It's pretty close in the morning.

4551
02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.970
I think it's the right amount before you go on stage.

4552
02:12:11.010 --> 02:12:12.400
That's why the phone I switched up.

4553
02:12:12.410 --> 02:12:14.790
Do you have to switch up the capsules because you get used to it?

4554
02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:17.820
She got to have a sativa and I got to do that when I smoke weed.

4555
02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:18.873
Do the same thing.

4556
02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:19.251
Yeah.

4557
02:12:19.251 --> 02:12:21.650
You always [inaudible] it up the whole fucking day.

4558
02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:23.600
We're different like that though.

4559
02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:24.620
I don't mind smoking.

4560
02:12:24.621 --> 02:12:26.990
I say we'd all the toxic smoke the same week for like six months.

4561
02:12:27.190 --> 02:12:27.901
<v 4>Oh No,</v>

4562
02:12:27.901 --> 02:12:28.081
no,

4563
02:12:28.081 --> 02:12:28.221
no,

4564
02:12:28.221 --> 02:12:28.371
no,

4565
02:12:28.371 --> 02:12:28.511
no,

4566
02:12:28.511 --> 02:12:28.660
no,

4567
02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:28.881
no.

4568
02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:29.680
I live understood.

4569
02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:32.690
Stood somebody about bought a pound of weed every time you went out and got the

4570
02:12:32.691 --> 02:12:33.540
same fucking weed.

4571
02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:34.221
You're killing me.

4572
02:12:34.221 --> 02:12:36.380
I got this bitch up.

4573
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:38.590
I think you and I do very different things with the week.

4574
02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:38.880
No,

4575
02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:39.021
no,

4576
02:12:39.021 --> 02:12:39.171
no,

4577
02:12:39.171 --> 02:12:39.350
no.

4578
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:42.340
Even if you smoke it like some mornings you want to smoke a,

4579
02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:43.401
excuse me.

4580
02:12:43.401 --> 02:12:44.234
It's a Tiva.

4581
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:47.870
Some mornings you know you want to the sativas I love Sativa.

4582
02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:49.370
I mean and how high are you getting?

4583
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.620
Are you getting like stupid high in the mornings anymore?

4584
02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:56.970
Like I used to know that like when you were switching to Muslim bro,

4585
02:12:56.971 --> 02:12:58.620
when I was waking up and smoking mad,

4586
02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:03.670
so g at four 45 of the ham by five 30 you're drooling that Endeca a sativa

4587
02:13:07.791 --> 02:13:09.320
fucking grind together.

4588
02:13:09.590 --> 02:13:10.201
I get out,

4589
02:13:10.201 --> 02:13:11.180
jump in a pool,

4590
02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:12.193
you got to do something,

4591
02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:12.951
you gotta do something,

4592
02:13:12.951 --> 02:13:14.120
you gotta get on a bicycle.

4593
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:16.280
It's like that shit that Lance Armstrong,

4594
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:17.290
I am be,

4595
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:19.880
what would they shoot their legs that they gotta to get up at three in the

4596
02:13:19.881 --> 02:13:20.714
fucking morning.

4597
02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:22.100
EPL,

4598
02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:22.761
same thing.

4599
02:13:22.761 --> 02:13:24.800
I was getting that type of reaction from the weed,

4600
02:13:24.801 --> 02:13:25.634
which I love.

4601
02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:30.940
I love getting a sudden urge to go hit the bag for 30 minutes or glow kits.

4602
02:13:31.651 --> 02:13:34.260
I liked that where 15 minutes and you're like,

4603
02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:35.190
oh my God,

4604
02:13:35.190 --> 02:13:36.760
I'm 15 minutes said right.

4605
02:13:37.530 --> 02:13:38.363
Why don't you fucking yeah.

4606
02:13:39.090 --> 02:13:39.241
Yeah.

4607
02:13:39.241 --> 02:13:40.920
It feels good to move your body around.

4608
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:43.290
Well the thing that comes with weed when you,

4609
02:13:43.291 --> 02:13:43.980
you know,

4610
02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:44.440
you get,

4611
02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:46.650
especially if you get like that full body high,

4612
02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:51.570
why like deep indicas you know you get that like real sensitivity to like all of

4613
02:13:51.571 --> 02:13:52.051
your body.

4614
02:13:52.051 --> 02:13:54.240
Like all the different aspects of your body,

4615
02:13:54.241 --> 02:13:57.390
all the different muscle fibers and shit.

4616
02:13:57.391 --> 02:13:59.130
You feel it moving around and shit.

4617
02:13:59.910 --> 02:14:01.830
I've done everything pretty much.

4618
02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:03.270
I've tried pretty much.

4619
02:14:03.271 --> 02:14:04.770
I want to live in Colorado tribe,

4620
02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:05.551
you know,

4621
02:14:05.551 --> 02:14:07.020
a climbing a wall and everything.

4622
02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:10.080
The easiest to things I've done high,

4623
02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:11.400
which I really enjoy it.

4624
02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:13.020
Number one on the list is yoga.

4625
02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:14.430
Yoga is amazing.

4626
02:14:14.431 --> 02:14:15.181
It's amazing.

4627
02:14:15.181 --> 02:14:15.830
Really high.

4628
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:20.590
So it gills I ever bullets better because you get more energy,

4629
02:14:20.610 --> 02:14:23.190
your lungs to to hold the poses and shit like that.

4630
02:14:23.191 --> 02:14:24.390
They're switching over you like a cookie.

4631
02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:26.370
But who's really good at 6:00 AM yoga.

4632
02:14:26.371 --> 02:14:29.510
You've got to get up at three 30 feet of fucking that up where you're a savage.

4633
02:14:29.530 --> 02:14:34.530
So what they say the best thing with the yoga is the real aficionados eating

4634
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.650
hashish.

4635
02:14:35.650 --> 02:14:36.040
Hashish.

4636
02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:36.311
Yeah,

4637
02:14:36.311 --> 02:14:37.290
a little cookie.

4638
02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:41.990
And then an hour and 20 minutes later you do the yoga when they've run.

4639
02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:42.771
Bruce Lee died.

4640
02:14:42.771 --> 02:14:43.620
What was the system?

4641
02:14:43.621 --> 02:14:45.330
THC as she,

4642
02:14:45.331 --> 02:14:46.230
she neither one.

4643
02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:48.390
I mean I'm sure he had some stuff in the system,

4644
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:50.050
but he died from a cerebral,

4645
02:14:50.051 --> 02:14:51.120
but I understand that though.

4646
02:14:51.121 --> 02:14:55.440
I have nothing with the cause he died from the fucking Yakuza and the fucking

4647
02:14:55.441 --> 02:14:56.190
Chinese.

4648
02:14:56.190 --> 02:14:56.431
Yeah,

4649
02:14:56.431 --> 02:14:57.264
cause they killed them.

4650
02:14:57.330 --> 02:14:58.230
He stopped making money.

4651
02:14:58.231 --> 02:14:59.250
But you think so?

4652
02:14:59.340 --> 02:14:59.580
Yeah.

4653
02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:01.080
He once he went over to Warner brothers,

4654
02:15:01.081 --> 02:15:02.610
how was I going to clean Colin's damn money?

4655
02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:04.390
Is that like the conspiracy theories that,

4656
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:05.290
look,

4657
02:15:05.290 --> 02:15:06.600
he made three movies over there.

4658
02:15:06.601 --> 02:15:07.890
He made four movies over there.

4659
02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:08.760
Right.

4660
02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:09.481
But he came over.

4661
02:15:09.481 --> 02:15:11.160
He wants to do a and for the dragon.

4662
02:15:11.161 --> 02:15:13.770
Then he went back to release the movie and he died or something.

4663
02:15:14.070 --> 02:15:15.030
So you think they whacked him?

4664
02:15:15.690 --> 02:15:16.501
I don't know what happened,

4665
02:15:16.501 --> 02:15:18.620
but I know those movies have made gazillions.

4666
02:15:18.630 --> 02:15:19.890
Like they look at all these people,

4667
02:15:19.891 --> 02:15:20.071
all,

4668
02:15:20.071 --> 02:15:21.150
they made this move for this.

4669
02:15:21.450 --> 02:15:24.120
What do you think of cost to make fists of Fury and the Philippines?

4670
02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:24.810
50 bucks.

4671
02:15:24.810 --> 02:15:25.501
50 bucks.

4672
02:15:25.501 --> 02:15:27.130
How many millions do you can they've made?

4673
02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:28.140
I said,

4674
02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:29.050
it's probably the lands.

4675
02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:31.200
You know what's crazy if you're looking at in some million,

4676
02:15:31.201 --> 02:15:31.831
if you look at,

4677
02:15:31.831 --> 02:15:32.664
if you look up,

4678
02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:33.533
uh,

4679
02:15:33.570 --> 02:15:35.160
what was the producer on those movies?

4680
02:15:35.161 --> 02:15:35.701
He did run,

4681
02:15:35.701 --> 02:15:36.360
run chow.

4682
02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:36.690
I don't,

4683
02:15:36.690 --> 02:15:41.690
Raymond Chow was the producers and all those movies that picture after 1973 I

4684
02:15:42.841 --> 02:15:45.120
want you to look at how many movies,

4685
02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:45.491

4688
02:15:48.990 --> 02:15:50.370
You know it's from Joe where?

4689
02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:50.641
Oh,

4690
02:15:50.641 --> 02:15:51.400

4691
02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:51.780
Austin.

4692
02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:56.400
Motherfucking that a one place that we always stay at their place.

4693
02:15:56.850 --> 02:16:00.420
If you're looking to see you after Bruce Lee died in 73,

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:06.160
well,

4698
02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:07.350
there was a big market for those.

4699
02:16:07.351 --> 02:16:08.200
Bruce Lyman.

4700
02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:09.570
Not Bruce Lie.

4701
02:16:09.571 --> 02:16:11.460
He directed definitely with Charles Bronson,

4702
02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:13.590
Wayman Zhao,

4703
02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:16.920

I don't know what's going on here.

4708
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:21.361
Tell me.

4709
02:16:21.361 --> 02:16:23.220
Raymond Chow had his own fucking company,

4710
02:16:23.850 --> 02:16:25.650
so just called whatever movies,

4711
02:16:25.651 --> 02:16:27.200

I was here for the brute.

4728
02:16:51.090 --> 02:16:53.430
I was here when everybody was walking around with Chinese shoes.

4729
02:16:53.810 --> 02:16:57.030
Shout with known CFA Raymond Chow.

4730
02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:59.700
He's exactly the kind of producer was like every single movie in the road.

4731
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.983
Okay.

4732

<v 5>All those goddamn movies.</v>

4741
02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:23.620
That's the craziest Shit I've ever seen in my life.

4742
02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:24.490
That guy,

4743
02:17:24.490 --> 02:17:26.590
that guy that rented a hundred fucking movies.

4744
02:17:26.770 --> 02:17:27.820

Does it say [inaudible] 60 he produced shit.

4750
02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:39.160
<v 4>But you could like be produced in a couple of different movies at a time.</v>

4751
02:17:39.161 --> 02:17:39.850
You can't really,

4752
02:17:39.850 --> 02:17:40.683
can you really

4753
02:17:42.010 --> 02:17:44.290
look at that paper does keep balling slowly,

4754
02:17:44.291 --> 02:17:45.124
slowly,

4755
02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:46.180
slowly.

4756
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:47.143
Fuck

4757
02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:49.000
I,

4758
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.500
but keep going up up,

4759
02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:52.690
up the other way.

4760
02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:53.531
The other way,

4761
02:17:53.531 --> 02:17:54.470
the other way up.

4762
02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:54.800
Up.

4763
02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:57.460
I'm Sloan out Bra.

4764
02:17:59.160 --> 02:17:59.993
Oh He's,

4765
02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:01.440
that was the worst one ever.

4766
02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:04.500
Look at these movies is mother dead

4767
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:07.440
looking at shit breakthrough.

4768
02:18:07.470 --> 02:18:07.871
Look at us.

4769
02:18:07.871 --> 02:18:08.700
Keep going.

4770
02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:09.370
Keep going.

4771
02:18:09.370 --> 02:18:10.151
Let's break through.

4772
02:18:10.151 --> 02:18:10.984
Who the fuck knows?

4773
02:18:16.550 --> 02:18:20.320
He did the cannonball run one and two about the law.

4774
02:18:21.550 --> 02:18:23.080
Oh Wow.

4775
02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:25.300
He did ever police story too.

4776
02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:27.640
He did everything but the law.

4777
02:18:27.641 --> 02:18:28.900
A lot of Chinese movies,

4778
02:18:28.901 --> 02:18:29.500
Huh?

4779
02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:29.741
Yeah.

4780
02:18:29.741 --> 02:18:34.120
That's where the two needs with Ninja turtles too.

4781
02:18:34.121 --> 02:18:35.830
And once upon a time in China,

4782
02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:39.010
he just muscled themself into those while he just,

4783
02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:40.180
they just bring them to him.

4784
02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:41.980
What'd you mind being at this?

4785
02:18:41.981 --> 02:18:42.371
Look at this.

4786
02:18:42.371 --> 02:18:43.360
So walk who?

4787
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:44.203
Everything.

4788
02:18:44.970 --> 02:18:47.460
I see Sangha Brown.

4789
02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:49.900
You got to stop with that dumb fake gay voice.

4790
02:18:50.170 --> 02:18:51.370
That's really in your Internet.

4791
02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:52.571
You're,

4792
02:18:52.571 --> 02:18:52.811
you're,

4793
02:18:52.811 --> 02:18:53.740
you're doing so well.

4794
02:18:53.741 --> 02:18:54.940
And then you do that and everybody goes,

4795
02:18:54.941 --> 02:18:55.774
God damn it.

4796
02:18:56.470 --> 02:18:56.951
Stop it.

4797
02:18:56.951 --> 02:18:57.784
You know what it is?

4798
02:18:58.310 --> 02:18:58.890
Shut your,

4799
02:18:58.890 --> 02:18:59.723

4800
02:19:01.250 --> 02:19:02.780
<v 5>how dare you.</v>

4801
02:19:03.890 --> 02:19:04.160
Shit.

4802
02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:05.430
Joey Diaz.

4803
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.970
So what's next Joey?

4804
02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:09.290
You know me baby.

4805
02:19:09.710 --> 02:19:10.440
You know what's fucking,

4806
02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:11.480
that was Friday night.

4807
02:19:11.481 --> 02:19:11.931
Friday night,

4808
02:19:11.931 --> 02:19:16.340
the 21st at eight o'clock we'll turn motherfucking data and meeting the first

02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:20.090

4814
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:29.323
<v 3>I'm doing everything.</v>

4815
02:19:29.510 --> 02:19:31.370
We want to extend a formal invitation.

4816
02:19:31.410 --> 02:19:32.181
John McAfee,

4817

4818

we have two tickets for you for the Wiltern theater.

4819
02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:40.400
He would sit right next to Brian red band and his date for the evening.

4820
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:41.770
Where you're bringing Brian,

4821
02:19:41.771 --> 02:19:42.650

4822

no bath salts at the Wiltern please folks is the end of the world.

4823
02:19:46.641 --> 02:19:48.590
We can go bath salt free for one night.

4824
02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:50.660
Shall we keep it together?

4825
02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:52.580
Joe Diaz,

4826
02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:52.981
Doug,

4827
02:19:52.981 --> 02:19:53.271
Stan,

4828
02:19:53.271 --> 02:19:54.081
hope honey,

4829
02:19:54.081 --> 02:19:56.200
honey and me and Doug.

4830
02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:58.220
Stan will be on the podcast on Saturday,

4831
02:19:58.221 --> 02:19:59.810
the day after the end of the world.

4832
02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:02.120
If there is world to return to.

4833
02:20:02.390 --> 02:20:04.120
We would do the Doug Stan podcast,

4834
02:20:04.130 --> 02:20:04.970
Saturday afternoon.

4835
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:06.590
Dirty fucks.

4836
02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:07.880
All right folks.

4837
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:09.090
Oh My,

4838
02:20:09.090 --> 02:20:09.411
my,

4839
02:20:09.411 --> 02:20:09.590
uh,

4840
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:10.210
specials out.

4841
02:20:10.210 --> 02:20:11.043
It's out right now.

4842
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:12.201
So,

4843
02:20:12.201 --> 02:20:12.890
um,

4844
02:20:12.890 --> 02:20:14.420
if you're a inclined,

4845
02:20:14.421 --> 02:20:15.740
if you go to Joe rogan.net,

4846
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:17.750
it's called live from the Tabernacle.

4847
02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:18.200
Um,

4848
02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:19.280
I think is my best one yet.

4849
02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:20.690
It's going to be on iTunes also.

4850
02:20:20.691 --> 02:20:22.640
So like maybe eventually through iTunes,

4851
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:23.623
maybe eventually,

4852
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:25.970
but right now it's just through my website for the,

4853
02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:26.990
probably the longest time,

4854
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:29.190
maybe like a year or two for the rest of my life.

4855
02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:30.890
It's a unprotected file.

4856
02:20:30.891 --> 02:20:32.840
So you can just tape it onto like a computer and stuff.

4857
02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:33.360
Yeah,

4858
02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:33.610
yeah.

4859
02:20:33.610 --> 02:20:33.770
It's,

4860
02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:34.281
what is it called?

4861
02:20:34.281 --> 02:20:35.180
Drm Free.

4862
02:20:35.420 --> 02:20:36.170
Is that what it's called?

4863
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:36.501
Yeah,

4864
02:20:36.501 --> 02:20:37.070
no,

4865
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:38.630
it's the same way Louis CK did it.

4866
02:20:38.631 --> 02:20:40.670
I completely stole everything he did.

4867
02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:42.560
And if you have an apple TV,

4868
02:20:42.561 --> 02:20:46.130
all you do is you open it up in iTunes and on the top right hand button you

4869
02:20:46.131 --> 02:20:47.600
could send it to your apple TV.

4870
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:48.340
So yeah,

4871
02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:48.831
you can just dream.

4872
02:20:48.831 --> 02:20:50.000
And there's a lot of ways you can stream it.

4873
02:20:50.090 --> 02:20:50.330
Yeah,

4874
02:20:50.330 --> 02:20:50.601
there's,

4875
02:20:50.601 --> 02:20:52.670
there's all sorts of ways you could watch it on television.

4876
02:20:52.700 --> 02:20:53.181
I don't,

4877
02:20:53.181 --> 02:20:55.310
I'm not the most technologically inclined,

4878
02:20:55.311 --> 02:20:58.570
but we tried to make it as easy as possible and uh,

4879
02:20:58.580 --> 02:20:59.810
the feedback has been amazing.

4880
02:20:59.811 --> 02:21:00.830
So thank you very much.

4881
02:21:00.831 --> 02:21:01.001
I'm,

4882
02:21:01.001 --> 02:21:01.270
I'm,

4883
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:03.400
I'm real excited that so many people decided to date.

4884
02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:05.113
Thanks man.

4885
02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:05.470
I'm,

4886
02:21:05.470 --> 02:21:06.350
I'm very happy.

4887
02:21:06.351 --> 02:21:06.591
You know,

4888
02:21:06.591 --> 02:21:11.240
like I think what Louie did was really important for us for standup comedians.

4889
02:21:11.241 --> 02:21:11.660
You know,

4890
02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:13.100
his idea was perfect.

4891
02:21:13.101 --> 02:21:13.934
It was brilliant.

4892
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:15.830
The amount of money was the right amount of money.

4893
02:21:15.831 --> 02:21:16.760
Five bucks is,

4894
02:21:16.761 --> 02:21:18.980
I mean he could have made it 10 and probably the same amount of people would

4895
02:21:18.981 --> 02:21:19.101
buy,

4896
02:21:19.101 --> 02:21:21.410
but five is like really like honest.

4897
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:22.131
It's like,

4898
02:21:22.131 --> 02:21:22.371
you know,

4899
02:21:22.371 --> 02:21:24.200
you're getting a recording of the live performance,

4900
02:21:24.201 --> 02:21:26.570
you're not getting the live performance and so I'll be getting on the recording.

4901
02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:27.553
It's worth five bucks.

4902
02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:29.440
You'd had the best thing that you're doing awesome.

4903
02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:32.080
Is the ability to send it as a gift.

4904
02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.380
So like I've already sent it to a few people,

4905
02:21:34.381 --> 02:21:37.130
like you just put their email address and then you pretty much buy it and then

4906
02:21:37.131 --> 02:21:39.260
just send it to them and they get download instructions.

4907
02:21:39.261 --> 02:21:41.480
So like you could send it to your friends or families.

4908
02:21:41.820 --> 02:21:43.160
We wanted to have it set up like that.

4909
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:46.250
We wanted to have it so that you could send it to people if,

4910
02:21:46.251 --> 02:21:46.730
you know,

4911
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:47.563
if you dug it up.

4912
02:21:47.570 --> 02:21:49.360
People love sending people like,

4913
02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:51.320
like a lot of people send me music.

4914
02:21:51.350 --> 02:21:53.330
It's con like that's how we found out about honey honey.

4915
02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:53.971
That's how I,

4916
02:21:53.971 --> 02:21:55.790
I constantly hear about new bands.

4917
02:21:55.791 --> 02:21:58.790
That's how I found out about a roadkill goes choir.

4918
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:59.721
Somebody sent it to me.

4919
02:21:59.721 --> 02:22:00.531
I love that.

4920
02:22:00.531 --> 02:22:02.480
And people love doing that with comics too.

4921
02:22:02.481 --> 02:22:03.530
And so if you want to send mine,

4922
02:22:03.531 --> 02:22:03.951
you can do that.

4923
02:22:03.951 --> 02:22:04.461
And there's a,

4924
02:22:04.461 --> 02:22:04.911
there's a,

4925
02:22:04.911 --> 02:22:05.570
you can,

4926
02:22:05.570 --> 02:22:06.403
you can gift it.

4927
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:07.423
And um,

4928
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:07.791
Joe,

4929
02:22:07.791 --> 02:22:08.070
when he,

4930
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:09.020
when's the next thing that,

4931
02:22:09.021 --> 02:22:09.200
uh,

4932
02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:10.033
people could see you?

4933
02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:11.031
What's the next,

4934
02:22:11.031 --> 02:22:11.360
uh,

4935
02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:15.880
January 17th at the Irvine Improv after the birth of my fucking daughter.

4936
02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:18.290
The next couple of weeks I'll just chill,

4937
02:22:18.940 --> 02:22:21.170
kick kickbox and lifting weights.

4938
02:22:21.171 --> 02:22:22.050
I'm trying to do everything.

4939
02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:23.660
What day is January 17th.

4940
02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:25.040
Wednesday,

4941
02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:25.040
Thursday,

4942
02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:25.470
Thursday.

4943
02:22:25.470 --> 02:22:25.980
So that's

4944
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:26.701
<v 0>a the next time.</v>

4945
02:22:26.701 --> 02:22:27.201
And when,

4946
02:22:27.201 --> 02:22:28.740
when are you going to release something line?

4947
02:22:28.741 --> 02:22:29.940
Because I have no fucking idea.

4948
02:22:29.970 --> 02:22:30.571
Let's do that.

4949
02:22:30.571 --> 02:22:30.810
Can,

4950
02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:31.643
can I produce that?

4951
02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:32.963
How about we'll do that.

4952
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.320
How about the next thing that I do through talking monkey incorporated.

4953
02:22:36.350 --> 02:22:36.470
Dot.

4954
02:22:36.470 --> 02:22:38.490
We'll just produce your shit and release it the same way.

4955
02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:39.010
Dot.

4956
02:22:39.010 --> 02:22:39.220
Okay.

4957
02:22:39.220 --> 02:22:40.190
I'll your webpage.

4958
02:22:40.210 --> 02:22:40.491
Yeah.

4959
02:22:40.491 --> 02:22:41.850
We'll or yours or whatever.

4960
02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:43.950
We'll send yourself the same way.

4961
02:22:44.110 --> 02:22:44.651
Okay,

4962
02:22:44.651 --> 02:22:45.484
let's do it.

4963
02:22:46.170 --> 02:22:46.860
Let's do it.

4964
02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:47.101
Yeah.

4965
02:22:47.101 --> 02:22:47.401
Let's,

4966
02:22:47.401 --> 02:22:47.910
um,

4967
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:49.050
we'll put together,

4968
02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:49.860
you know,

4969
02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:51.150
a time where we can,

4970
02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:51.630
you know,

4971
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:56.250
record you at some club and I think for you what would really be bad ass.

4972
02:22:56.251 --> 02:23:01.050
One of the cool ways to deal with you is to take you from the fucking green

4973
02:23:01.051 --> 02:23:01.560
room,

4974
02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:04.980
like one camera from the green room all the way out to this stage.

4975
02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:06.720
Follow you through the whole thing.

4976
02:23:07.570 --> 02:23:07.970
One,

4977
02:23:07.970 --> 02:23:10.410
which just one crazy wild fucking take.

4978
02:23:10.411 --> 02:23:13.590
And then you sneak out the back door to four shows,

4979
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:14.790
two four shows,

4980
02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:15.291
got picked.

4981
02:23:15.291 --> 02:23:16.440
The one you liked the best.

4982
02:23:16.441 --> 02:23:17.370
Release the hounds.

4983
02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:17.730
Dot.

4984
02:23:17.730 --> 02:23:18.121
We could say,

4985
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:18.391
you know,

4986
02:23:18.391 --> 02:23:18.781
I get it.

4987
02:23:18.781 --> 02:23:21.600
I get these emails from people all the time when it's Joey Coco Diaz going to

4988
02:23:21.601 --> 02:23:23.370
have some kind of comedy special.

4989
02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:25.300
I always want him to,

4990
02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:30.300
one of the talks that squad motherfucker records in full effect and we're going

4991
02:23:30.481 --> 02:23:32.140
to be at the Improv third sector.

4992
02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:34.650
You're going to be their busiest prop tonight with already,

4993
02:23:34.651 --> 02:23:36.530
if the story tellers show great fit something.

4994
02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:38.970
A couple of people come on by,

4995
02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:40.650
Greg [inaudible],

4996
02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:42.051
five bucks,

4997
02:23:42.051 --> 02:23:46.230
five bucks and it's a family and it's really fun.

4998
02:23:46.231 --> 02:23:51.231
That's a a really a fun time at eight o'clock or eight o'clock Thursday and

4999
02:23:51.551 --> 02:23:53.600
prof.com it's the Hollywood improv,

5000
02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:55.560
17th of January and Irvine,

5001
02:23:55.561 --> 02:23:57.030
but that time you'll have your first check.

5002
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:58.050
Everything will be real for you.

5003
02:23:58.051 --> 02:24:01.980
Really get the hopefully or the aliens will have landed and the money will be

5004
02:24:01.981 --> 02:24:02.814
worthless.

5005
02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:03.810
Those.

5006
02:24:03.810 --> 02:24:04.830
Fuck Mel Gibson.

5007
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:09.000
Brian bags are already wearing our NASA outfits,

5008
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:09.600
right?

5009
02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:13.710
Because we are volunteering for volunteer NASA because there'll be a volunteer

5010
02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:14.610
NASA in the future,

5011
02:24:14.611 --> 02:24:16.200
just like volunteer fire department.

5012
02:24:16.380 --> 02:24:19.050
I'm just trick doing it because I went to tricare Santa Maria,

5013
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:21.720
they think you're smart move.

5014
02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:22.990
I like,

5015
02:24:22.990 --> 02:24:23.940
I like what you're doing.

5016
02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:25.110
I think it'll work.

5017
02:24:25.610 --> 02:24:25.921
I don't know.

5018
02:24:25.921 --> 02:24:26.311
I think,

5019
02:24:26.311 --> 02:24:26.551
yeah,

5020
02:24:26.551 --> 02:24:29.370
I think as long as you make the effort to try to trick her should just play

5021
02:24:29.371 --> 02:24:32.550
along and you're golden and then it's like your whole life is like fantasy role

5022
02:24:32.551 --> 02:24:33.120
playing game.

5023
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:33.721
That's kind of cool.

5024
02:24:33.721 --> 02:24:36.720
You pretend you're the super scientist in NASA and even though you're just

5025
02:24:36.721 --> 02:24:37.381
leaving our house,

5026
02:24:37.381 --> 02:24:38.700
you telling me you gotta have to go to the moon.

5027
02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:40.320
That's a great idea.

5028
02:24:40.321 --> 02:24:43.500
I'll print out like fake NASA documents and I would carry them around all the

5029
02:24:43.501 --> 02:24:44.790
time out on a clipboard.

5030
02:24:44.850 --> 02:24:46.380
It reminds me of a Robin Harris bit.

5031
02:24:46.381 --> 02:24:50.250
Robin Harris is one of the last comics that nobody ever talks about and a DL

5032
02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:51.390
Hughley sort of,

5033
02:24:51.391 --> 02:24:51.630
um,

5034
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:53.130
was influenced by him quite a lot.

5035
02:24:53.131 --> 02:24:55.050
Like especially like early in deals career.

5036
02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:55.953
You too.

5037
02:24:56.250 --> 02:24:57.270
Robin Harris is really,

5038
02:24:57.271 --> 02:24:58.020
really funny,

5039
02:24:58.020 --> 02:24:59.160
but one of the things he,

5040
02:24:59.161 --> 02:24:59.430
uh,

5041
02:24:59.430 --> 02:25:00.450
he had a great joke about,

5042
02:25:00.451 --> 02:25:01.500
he said a man,

5043
02:25:01.610 --> 02:25:02.500
but ain't no pretty woman.

5044
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:03.840
It goes pretty women,

5045
02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:04.380
man.

5046
02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:05.213
Too much work.

5047
02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:06.170
He goes,

5048
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.600
well man,

5049
02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:08.340
you could tell it anything bitch.

5050
02:25:08.341 --> 02:25:09.300
I'm going to the moon.

5051
02:25:15.810 --> 02:25:16.800
And he was like,

5052
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:21.950
so like casual and his delivery and like relaxed and he just made you smile.

5053
02:25:23.441 --> 02:25:24.160
Just looking

5054
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:27.030
<v 4>at it with sweet Willie and do the right thing.</v>

5055
02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:29.500
And he was tremendous as who's,

5056
02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:31.220
who else would have a character name?

5057
02:25:31.221 --> 02:25:33.460
Sweet Dick Willie.

5058
02:25:33.850 --> 02:25:34.683
Yeah.

5059
02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:37.810
I'm going to want me to tell her anything big time going to the moon.

5060
02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:42.190
I'll never get listened to that man.

5061
02:25:42.191 --> 02:25:42.311
He,

5062
02:25:42.311 --> 02:25:42.441
yeah,

5063
02:25:42.441 --> 02:25:44.890
I think there's a special called babies kids.

5064
02:25:45.490 --> 02:25:45.881
Yeah,

5065
02:25:45.881 --> 02:25:46.561
I think you could.

5066
02:25:46.561 --> 02:25:47.170
You could.

5067
02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:48.310
I don't know if you can watch it,

5068
02:25:48.311 --> 02:25:49.510
but you could definitely listen to it.

5069
02:25:49.511 --> 02:25:51.610
I used to listen to that shit on cassette.

5070
02:25:51.850 --> 02:25:52.630
Okay.

5071
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:54.610
I had that thing on fucking cassette.

5072
02:25:54.970 --> 02:25:59.590
I used to listen to that and my Volkswagon Corrado who drive around listening to

5073
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:01.151
Jodi,

5074
02:26:01.151 --> 02:26:01.610
TNC,

5075
02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:02.443
Yana,

5076
02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:03.850
I've always showed him brother,

5077
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:04.541
what's the matter man?

5078
02:26:04.541 --> 02:26:05.300
You're not getting sleep.

5079
02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:06.133
Are you nervous?

5080
02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:07.170
They'll be Kinda,

5081
02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:10.270
I was up at fucking fought dirty.

5082
02:26:10.450 --> 02:26:12.100
Are you up at the sun and gone with the wind?

5083
02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:13.270
Yeah,

5084
02:26:13.270 --> 02:26:15.450
I went to bed early last night and got up early.

5085
02:26:15.690 --> 02:26:15.940
Yeah.

5086
02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:16.773
It's just,

5087
02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:17.590
yeah,

5088
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:18.311
you were always up,

5089
02:26:18.311 --> 02:26:18.551
man.

5090
02:26:18.551 --> 02:26:20.110
I text you at six o'clock in the morning.

5091
02:26:20.111 --> 02:26:20.830
He texted me back.

5092
02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:21.011
Yeah,

5093
02:26:21.011 --> 02:26:21.880
I was ready to rock.

5094
02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:26.110
Says I said fucking eight o'clock this morning and we'll go to the kitchen

5095
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:29.830
making a protein shake and fucking going.

5096
02:26:29.831 --> 02:26:30.664
Wow.

5097
02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:34.530
It's eight o'clock and they have already done 30 fucking things.

5098
02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:36.100
That's Robin Harris right there.

5099
02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:36.371
Yeah,

5100
02:26:36.371 --> 02:26:36.880
right there.

5101
02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:38.110
Like I didn't leave the house,

5102
02:26:38.111 --> 02:26:40.350
but I had already done dirty fucking things of that house.

5103
02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:42.130
Showered breakfast,

5104
02:26:42.131 --> 02:26:42.701
protein,

5105
02:26:42.701 --> 02:26:44.020
shake emails,

5106
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:45.340
phone calls,

5107
02:26:45.341 --> 02:26:46.300
the whole fucking deal.

5108
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:47.743
Reefer.

5109
02:26:48.970 --> 02:26:53.110
Have you thought about moving to the suburbs where we're all raised,

5110
02:26:53.111 --> 02:26:55.660
their babies get to stay in the hood?

5111
02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:56.950
No,

5112
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:57.491
I'm all right.

5113
02:26:57.491 --> 02:26:58.530
I'm all right where I'm at.

5114
02:26:58.570 --> 02:26:58.810
Be like,

5115
02:26:58.810 --> 02:26:58.910
well,

5116
02:26:58.910 --> 02:26:59.270
yeah.

5117
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.591
Yeah.

5118
02:26:59.591 --> 02:27:00.820
I'm going to stay there for a few months.

5119
02:27:00.821 --> 02:27:02.080
Not about moving in Nashville too,

5120
02:27:02.081 --> 02:27:02.440
Huh?

5121
02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:02.980
I taught a lot.

5122
02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:03.970
A lot of fucking things.

5123
02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:04.631
Talk to honey,

5124
02:27:04.631 --> 02:27:04.871
honey,

5125
02:27:04.871 --> 02:27:05.704
you'll move there.

5126
02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:06.370
They love it there.

5127
02:27:06.370 --> 02:27:09.040
I know a lot of people love it except everyone's armed.

5128
02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:10.181
They said that's a problem.

5129
02:27:10.181 --> 02:27:12.070
Like everybody's know somebody that's been shot.

5130
02:27:12.490 --> 02:27:16.590
Well she shot him and then he shot her back and woo,

5131
02:27:17.090 --> 02:27:17.740
he's fucking up.

5132
02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:18.271
But you don't want to,

5133
02:27:18.271 --> 02:27:19.630
I don't run in those circles.

5134
02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:24.370
Have you ever seen a the a wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia?

5135
02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:25.600
I heard about it.

5136
02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:26.520
I'm getting you that for Kras.

5137
02:27:26.530 --> 02:27:26.860
Yes.

5138
02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:27.730
I don't want to have to get you that.

5139
02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:29.031
No circles.

5140
02:27:29.031 --> 02:27:29.741
So I'm not worried.

5141
02:27:29.741 --> 02:27:30.400
You know,

5142
02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:30.911
weapons.

5143
02:27:30.911 --> 02:27:35.440
When I did carry a weapon when I was 27 I was a coke dealer and I carried the

5144
02:27:35.441 --> 02:27:40.441
Miami vice with the upside down piece with the two clips with 16 and the fuck 14

5145
02:27:41.321 --> 02:27:42.490
and how old were you?

5146
02:27:42.610 --> 02:27:45.310
I was probably 27 when I thought I was Don Johnson.

5147
02:27:45.730 --> 02:27:47.470
And you were just walking around with a gun for how long?

5148
02:27:48.310 --> 02:27:51.010
I get paranoid looking at windows fucking night.

5149
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:55.030
Like if I had to go pick up $80 from you had put the gun up like Whoa,

5150
02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:55.691
really?

5151
02:27:55.691 --> 02:27:55.991
You know,

5152
02:27:55.991 --> 02:27:57.610
it's just not that I do it to show it to you,

5153
02:27:57.611 --> 02:27:59.260
but I have it on me just in case.

5154
02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:00.970
And it was just weird that,

5155
02:28:00.971 --> 02:28:01.540
uh,

5156
02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:03.670
things would happen around me when I had that gun.

5157
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:06.970
And then one day I stopped wearing the gun and those things disappeared.

5158
02:28:07.270 --> 02:28:10.510
So say that before they were magnet brother.

5159
02:28:11.350 --> 02:28:12.183
Fuck yeah.

5160
02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:13.473
Fuck yeah.

5161
02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:16.150
Web Mindset that you have while you're carrying it,

5162
02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:18.160
that makes you a magnet for problems.

5163
02:28:18.490 --> 02:28:19.323
You know what,

5164
02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:24.480
when I carried God was the only time somebody opened that jacket to me one time

5165
02:28:24.721 --> 02:28:27.140
and let me know they had a gun on somebody they were with,

5166
02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:28.251
you know,

5167
02:28:28.251 --> 02:28:30.320
one time it happened in El Paso,

5168
02:28:30.321 --> 02:28:31.280
but that's just gonna happen.

5169
02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:34.160
I'll pass you by and blow it for the morning with somebody,

5170
02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:34.850
his wife,

5171
02:28:34.850 --> 02:28:35.600
you know,

5172
02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:36.580
I would imagine it'd be a shame.

5173
02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:37.813
So,

5174
02:28:37.870 --> 02:28:38.150
uh,

5175
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:39.260
just like knives,

5176
02:28:39.261 --> 02:28:43.280
I've seen people get stabbed and I got into fights when I'd have a knife on me.

5177
02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:45.500
What the fuck am I going to carry a knife on me fucking for,

5178
02:28:45.501 --> 02:28:46.334
for what?

5179
02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:48.800
You know when you carry it and you know gets cut when you carry a knife,

5180
02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:49.520
you do.

5181
02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:50.600
You dumb mother fucker.

5182
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:53.480
That's who gets called when you stabbed somebody as shit.

5183
02:28:53.481 --> 02:28:54.314
You're not used to.

5184
02:28:54.350 --> 02:28:56.240
Even when you train with fucking knives,

5185
02:28:56.241 --> 02:28:58.530
you'll cut your hands if they don't have the,

5186
02:28:58.910 --> 02:29:01.700
the guards at the end because the shit slips up.

5187
02:29:01.701 --> 02:29:03.500
That's the first thing that it's just a,

5188
02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:04.780
if you don't know how to use a knife,

5189
02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:05.980
you should not fuck with one.

5190
02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:07.550
You only going to hurt your fucking hands.

5191
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.050
You really are listening.

5192
02:29:09.051 --> 02:29:11.720
How many people really know how to use it and not men.

5193
02:29:11.780 --> 02:29:15.170
They think they watch fucking Boyz in the hood and all of a sudden they fucking

5194
02:29:15.171 --> 02:29:16.010
go out and buy a switch.

5195
02:29:16.011 --> 02:29:17.840
But you had no idea.

5196
02:29:17.841 --> 02:29:18.674
My friend,

5197
02:29:18.890 --> 02:29:20.690
you have no idea when you get a knife,

5198
02:29:20.691 --> 02:29:21.660
it's a bone.

5199
02:29:21.690 --> 02:29:23.360
The twist and pop side.

5200
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:27.200
I've seen people with knives get the shit knocked out of him pulling out a

5201
02:29:27.201 --> 02:29:30.710
fucking knife is him one time at port authority in New York,

5202
02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:32.600
I seen something go down.

5203
02:29:32.601 --> 02:29:32.841
I call,

5204
02:29:32.841 --> 02:29:34.430
you know when you catch the tail end the sentence.

5205
02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:36.080
That's what it happened.

5206
02:29:36.081 --> 02:29:38.330
This guy pulled out a knife with a stab,

5207
02:29:38.331 --> 02:29:39.940
a dude with a leather jacket on human,

5208
02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:40.720
no dangerous,

5209
02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.690
stupid human,

5210
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:43.401
no danger.

5211
02:29:43.401 --> 02:29:44.570
Like he hit him in the elbow.

5212
02:29:44.571 --> 02:29:47.660
The guy caught it and this guy just knocked off,

5213
02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:48.750
flopped out of him,

5214
02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:50.180
broke his fucking lip.

5215
02:29:50.390 --> 02:29:51.223
It was beautiful.

5216
02:29:51.470 --> 02:29:53.540
So you're saying if you live in a dangerous area,

5217
02:29:53.541 --> 02:29:54.650
get some chain mail,

5218
02:29:55.210 --> 02:29:57.170
gets himself a nice coat of armor.

5219
02:29:57.260 --> 02:29:58.490
You have a nice leather jacket,

5220
02:29:58.491 --> 02:30:01.220
but who's going to wear that when it's 150 fucking degrees in Atlanta?

5221
02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:01.460
When?

5222
02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:02.540
How are you going to do that in Atlanta,

5223
02:30:02.541 --> 02:30:03.290
New York,

5224
02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:03.981
Miami,

5225
02:30:03.981 --> 02:30:04.970
there's all listen,

5226
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:06.490
stay in the fucking Monday.

5227
02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:07.430
Got Their business.

5228
02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:09.770
Even when you carried new checks as a kid,

5229
02:30:09.890 --> 02:30:11.840
you met other motherfuckers went blue chucks.

5230
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:14.240
I never carry nunchucks as a kid that you pass that.

5231
02:30:14.241 --> 02:30:15.050
That was a great time.

5232
02:30:15.050 --> 02:30:16.190
I had a knife for awhile.

5233
02:30:16.250 --> 02:30:19.310
I have one of those double o seven new chunks hit everybody you looked at

5234
02:30:19.311 --> 02:30:23.270
instead of having tattoos that bruises with everybody carried new chunks.

5235
02:30:23.271 --> 02:30:24.110
Everybody had bruises.

5236
02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:25.080
The back of their album.

5237
02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:27.313
Oh my God.

5238
02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:30.560
The fucking mid seventies from Bruce Lee came out like this.

5239
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.790
In fist it,

5240
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:34.430
I think he picked the China and Chinese connection.

5241
02:30:34.850 --> 02:30:36.110
When he took those new chucks,

5242
02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:37.153
it was done.

5243
02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:39.890
Then there was another movie that came out called Corrado,

5244
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:41.180
the Hong Kong cat.

5245
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:45.530
That is not documented that I've been hunting for fucking years because his new

5246
02:30:45.531 --> 02:30:47.660
Chuck's had copper on the corners.

5247
02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:50.270
So this motherfucker took to,

5248
02:30:50.300 --> 02:30:52.310
like Bruce Lee took two brooms.

5249
02:30:52.670 --> 02:30:53.421
You took a hole,

5250
02:30:53.421 --> 02:30:54.070
you're drilling,

5251
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:56.240
you put eye hooks and you took two chains.

5252
02:30:56.390 --> 02:30:57.320
Those were new chucks,

5253
02:30:57.650 --> 02:30:58.640
not Hong Kong cat.

5254
02:30:58.670 --> 02:31:00.650
He took it to a different mother fucking level.

5255
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:02.360
He took two new checks like this,

5256
02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:03.433
drilled them,

5257
02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:07.490
but instead of putting just a thing and he put metal caps with the eye and then

5258
02:31:07.491 --> 02:31:08.900
he put an eye hook into that.

5259
02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:10.820
Not to mention the bottom.

5260
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:15.200
He'd go to the hardware store to a plumbing supply and put caps on the bottom,

5261
02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:17.440
copper caps and crazy glue Monday.

5262
02:31:17.770 --> 02:31:20.890
So when you got hit in the head when you got hit and I would capa instead of

5263
02:31:20.891 --> 02:31:22.850
fucking would honk Kong with it.

5264
02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:26.210
He had it a whole different dimensions to a new chunk world over that.

5265
02:31:26.211 --> 02:31:27.970
And then checks made me realize,

5266
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.171
uh,

5267
02:31:28.171 --> 02:31:29.980
about the differences in woods.

5268
02:31:30.610 --> 02:31:32.440
That's how I found out about different kinds of woods.

5269
02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:35.800
Nunchucks cause you would go to like the by him on those catalogs,

5270
02:31:35.801 --> 02:31:37.150
they will have like Coco Bolo.

5271
02:31:37.151 --> 02:31:40.510
You want to Coco Bolo woodchucks a very dark dense wood.

5272
02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:41.441
Very heavy.

5273
02:31:41.441 --> 02:31:41.650
Like,

5274
02:31:41.650 --> 02:31:43.480
oh those would make some bad ass noon chunks.

5275
02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:46.540
That's how I found out about like Coco Bolo and oak.

5276
02:31:46.541 --> 02:31:49.910
Like what the harder woods where it was like what they were making nunchucks out

5277
02:31:49.911 --> 02:31:50.020
of.

5278
02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:51.070
Oh it was the hardest ones.

5279
02:31:51.071 --> 02:31:51.904
Vocal Bolo.

5280
02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:53.690
Coca Bola was pretty hard as it the hard way.

5281
02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.680
<v 0>But if he could get real ebony,</v>

5282
02:31:56.740 --> 02:31:57.700
that's really hard to,

5283
02:31:58.090 --> 02:31:58.811
it's really hard,

5284
02:31:58.811 --> 02:31:59.644
really heavy.

5285
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:05.000
There's some dense dark woods mostly or usually the harder woods,

5286
02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:07.120
like ebony is an extremely heavy,

5287
02:32:07.121 --> 02:32:07.954
dense wood.

5288
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:09.190
That's why they use it a lot.

5289
02:32:09.191 --> 02:32:11.080
Like a lot of people like it for pool cues.

5290
02:32:11.470 --> 02:32:11.651
You know,

5291
02:32:11.651 --> 02:32:11.891
they will,

5292
02:32:11.891 --> 02:32:13.900
they make them out of ebony because it's so dense.

5293
02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:14.590
Heavy.

5294
02:32:14.590 --> 02:32:16.600
It's just tough to get up an ebony pool cue.

5295
02:32:16.601 --> 02:32:18.160
That's like a lightweight one.

5296
02:32:19.310 --> 02:32:19.600
<v 4>You know.</v>

5297
02:32:19.600 --> 02:32:20.470
It's crazy though.

5298
02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:21.510
I see.

5299
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:24.670
Growing up I see the thousands of white kids with new chucks.

5300
02:32:25.210 --> 02:32:26.650
Black people loved who?

5301
02:32:26.651 --> 02:32:27.910
Chuck [inaudible] Peterson.

5302
02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:29.650
Bruce Lee right there.

5303
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:31.150
Way before this.

5304
02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:34.390
The Chinese connection was where he took them to a little bit.

5305
02:32:34.391 --> 02:32:34.870
Look at this.

5306
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:35.703
By this time he,

5307
02:32:35.770 --> 02:32:36.150
yeah,

5308
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:41.150
the fuckers once he took it from the wound so you can hear it cause it sounds,

5309
02:32:41.231 --> 02:32:42.064
it's crazy.

5310
02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:45.120
It doesn't have sound.

5311
02:32:45.121 --> 02:32:46.090
The video doesn't have sound.

5312
02:32:46.860 --> 02:32:51.860
That was July of [inaudible] 73 this fucking country lost and then lost their

5313
02:32:52.081 --> 02:32:52.440
mind.

5314
02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:56.520
They lost that black people at the movie theater lost their fucking,

5315
02:32:56.730 --> 02:32:59.130
I was living in an apartment and the superintendent,

5316
02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:00.740
the other word for Chinese collection,

5317
02:33:00.741 --> 02:33:01.471
new chuck right there.

5318
02:33:01.471 --> 02:33:02.304
Is that it?

5319
02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:03.460
<v 6>Okay.</v>

5320
02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:04.480
<v 4>I was living in this apartment</v>

5321
02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:04.911
<v 0>and the,</v>

5322
02:33:04.911 --> 02:33:05.430
the uh,

5323
02:33:05.430 --> 02:33:06.690
superintendent that,

5324
02:33:06.691 --> 02:33:07.140
uh,

5325
02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:07.450
what,

5326
02:33:07.450 --> 02:33:08.190
whatever it was.

5327
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.341
Yeah.

5328
02:33:08.341 --> 02:33:09.360
I guess it was a superintendent.

5329
02:33:09.361 --> 02:33:10.380
The guy who takes care of the building,

5330
02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:11.460
his family.

5331
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:14.970
He had a son that was like my age and that's how I found out about Bruce Lee.

5332
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.421
They're like,

5333
02:33:15.421 --> 02:33:16.201
you don't know about Bruce Lee.

5334
02:33:16.201 --> 02:33:16.441
I was like,

5335
02:33:16.441 --> 02:33:17.250
what's Bruce Lee?

5336
02:33:17.250 --> 02:33:18.031
And I went over their house.

5337
02:33:18.031 --> 02:33:18.781
They was showing me these,

5338
02:33:18.781 --> 02:33:19.740
Bruce Lee puts was like,

5339
02:33:19.741 --> 02:33:20.161
whoa.

5340
02:33:20.161 --> 02:33:21.060
He had to like a poster,

5341
02:33:21.061 --> 02:33:22.020
like enter the Dragon.

5342
02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:25.830
You know what the fucking cuts on them with the blood or what is this?

5343
02:33:26.040 --> 02:33:26.551
And then,

5344
02:33:26.551 --> 02:33:26.850
uh,

5345
02:33:26.850 --> 02:33:28.920
I think they took me to see a movie.

5346
02:33:28.921 --> 02:33:29.071
You know,

5347
02:33:29.071 --> 02:33:30.420
you didn't have VCRs back then.

5348
02:33:30.421 --> 02:33:30.541
Seed.

5349
02:33:30.541 --> 02:33:31.800
I had to actually go to the movies.

5350
02:33:31.980 --> 02:33:34.890
I'm pretty sure they took me to see the first Bruce Lee movie I ever saw.

5351
02:33:34.891 --> 02:33:35.371
And I was like,

5352
02:33:35.371 --> 02:33:36.204
wow.

5353
02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:37.133
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

5354
02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:40.160
<v 4>this is Chinese connection.</v>

5355
02:33:40.190 --> 02:33:43.270
This is a really good together real.

5356
02:33:44.010 --> 02:33:45.640
I would've been the fourth grade,

5357
02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:50.320
a sacred heart school for boys watching happy days on a Tuesday fucking night.

5358
02:33:50.650 --> 02:33:54.940
And all of a sudden right there see the trailer for the Chinese connection and

5359
02:33:54.941 --> 02:33:56.920
Joe Rogan losing my fucking mind.

5360
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:58.660
That was a bad ass.

5361
02:33:58.690 --> 02:33:59.640
That was his basketball.

5362
02:33:59.740 --> 02:33:59.891
Yeah.

5363
02:33:59.891 --> 02:34:01.930
There was no crazy character.

5364
02:34:01.931 --> 02:34:02.141
Like,

5365
02:34:02.141 --> 02:34:02.451
look at the,

5366
02:34:02.451 --> 02:34:02.981
who's that guy?

5367
02:34:02.981 --> 02:34:03.521
What's his name?

5368
02:34:03.521 --> 02:34:04.354
Joe Rogan.

5369
02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:05.050
Sam Ohana.

5370
02:34:05.050 --> 02:34:05.883
Literally Shit.

5371
02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:08.680
This is into things that Sam long.

5372
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:10.503
Yeah,

5373
02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:11.240
look at Chuck.

5374
02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:12.910
Chuck Norris and him Duking it out.

5375
02:34:12.970 --> 02:34:14.080
That's Chuck Norris.

5376
02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:15.160
A lot of people don't know you.

5377
02:34:15.161 --> 02:34:15.821
They see him money.

5378
02:34:15.821 --> 02:34:19.390
He's like 60 years old and Texas ranger and you don't know the history.

5379
02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:22.780
Chuck Norris was like a real kickboxing champion,

5380
02:34:23.050 --> 02:34:26.850
like one of the first a karate tournament champion in the show.

5381
02:34:26.851 --> 02:34:30.040
When I first saw that scene that destroyed America.

5382
02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:30.873
That was it.

5383
02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:33.340
That after that American never recover from that.

5384
02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:35.290
People are eating Chinese food.

5385
02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:37.300
Kids were going to China town.

5386
02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:37.931
You know,

5387
02:34:37.931 --> 02:34:39.790
it completely opened up a new door,

5388
02:34:39.791 --> 02:34:40.330
bro.

5389
02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:41.620
Instead of going to the fucking,

5390
02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:43.630
the roller skating on Saturdays,

5391
02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:45.010
we would go into Chinatown.

5392
02:34:45.310 --> 02:34:45.431
Well,

5393
02:34:45.431 --> 02:34:46.264
you remember when,

5394
02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:48.370
remember when people started wearing Chinese slippers?

5395
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:50.620
My mother thought I was crazy.

5396
02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:54.810
I used to wear sandals and fucking incense in the house with the that.

5397
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:56.050
That's just amazing.

5398
02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:59.680
The Chinese connection is just a tremendous fucking movie.

5399
02:34:59.681 --> 02:35:00.640
If you've never seen it.

5400
02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:05.080
He's raw and you know he's on the phone with the whole time Joe Rogan and after

5401
02:35:05.081 --> 02:35:07.090
this we got to go cause she can't top this.

5402
02:35:07.390 --> 02:35:10.810
When he shot the Chinese connection the whole time he's on the phone with Steve

5403
02:35:10.811 --> 02:35:13.630
motherfucking McQuade the whole time.

5404
02:35:13.631 --> 02:35:13.901
He's like,

5405
02:35:13.901 --> 02:35:14.770
what do I do?

5406
02:35:14.771 --> 02:35:15.640
I'm just a tiny,

5407
02:35:15.641 --> 02:35:17.410
what the fuck do I do?

5408
02:35:17.700 --> 02:35:18.310
That's what,

5409
02:35:18.310 --> 02:35:22.000
that's what gave me the idea to hang motherfuckers can the Chinese connection,

5410
02:35:22.001 --> 02:35:23.890
he killed the mother fuckers and he hung them.

5411
02:35:24.130 --> 02:35:26.560
Didn't you like do a take lessons?

5412
02:35:26.561 --> 02:35:29.830
Steve McQueen and James James Coburn.

5413
02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:30.970
Oh please.

5414
02:35:30.970 --> 02:35:31.271
He did.

5415
02:35:31.271 --> 02:35:32.680
Didn't you do a movie with James Coburn?

5416
02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:34.420
You did something with James Coburn.

5417
02:35:34.421 --> 02:35:35.254
What'd you do with them?

5418
02:35:35.350 --> 02:35:35.981
Oh I did.

5419
02:35:35.981 --> 02:35:40.710
I did a couple of wireless and wireless and episode Harless.

5420
02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:41.920
I ended up American gun with them.

5421
02:35:42.250 --> 02:35:43.080
What's American gun?

5422
02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:43.691
I reckon gun.

5423
02:35:43.691 --> 02:35:44.530
There's a movie with,

5424
02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:45.393
uh,

5425
02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:50.380
about a kid who he's a father is his daughter gets shot by a gun and he does

5426
02:35:50.381 --> 02:35:51.100

5427
02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:52.360
the background that a gun.

5428
02:35:52.570 --> 02:35:52.901
When's,

5429
02:35:52.901 --> 02:35:53.170

02:35:55.950 --> 02:35:56.011
Well,

5433
02:35:56.011 --> 02:35:59.190
I can't go to December 29th and then maybe one of the ones that Jackie,

5434
02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:00.033

5435
02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:01.120
I miss him too.

5436
02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:01.480
Dot.

5437
02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:03.380
[inaudible] forth the

5438
02:36:05.050 --> 02:36:07.650
dove versus Frankie Edgar and funding.

5439
02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:11.340
Remind me Alistair Overeem versus big foot Silva please.

5440
02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:15.310
Son Los Vegas.

5441
02:36:15.860 --> 02:36:20.080
Please go to that one because that's also the one we have the Gig on Friday

5442
02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:21.040
night he got in front of and you know,

5443
02:36:21.041 --> 02:36:21.281
look,

5444
02:36:21.281 --> 02:36:22.160
I look at this guy.

5445
02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:23.980
Think that one's good.

5446
02:36:23.981 --> 02:36:24.220
Good.

5447
02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:25.053
It is.

5448
02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:28.450
I just want to go to the fucking UFC dog.

5449
02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:28.631
Well,

5450
02:36:28.631 --> 02:36:29.230
come on man.

5451
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:29.401
Let's,

5452
02:36:29.401 --> 02:36:32.530
do you ever see your books and I'm think I'm booked for the Irvine one,

5453
02:36:32.650 --> 02:36:34.450
but are you booked for that February weekend?

5454
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:39.750
At first I got to look at to the first week of February or the week before that

5455
02:36:39.940 --> 02:36:42.820
I'm booking all you motherfuckers have careers now and this is very

5456
02:36:42.821 --> 02:36:43.330
disappointing.

5457
02:36:43.330 --> 02:36:43.600
Fine.

5458
02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:44.580
Korea has done already.

5459
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:47.710
She fears booked every God damn week he was supposed to come with me to Ohio.

5460
02:36:47.711 --> 02:36:48.521
Remember that Brian?

5461
02:36:48.521 --> 02:36:49.390
We advertise them

5462
02:36:51.730 --> 02:36:52.660
book to governors.

5463
02:36:52.990 --> 02:36:53.141
Yeah,

5464
02:36:53.141 --> 02:36:55.150
he's just taking bookings over this.

5465
02:36:55.151 --> 02:36:55.810
The motherfucker.

5466
02:36:55.810 --> 02:36:57.790
He's going money taking money.

5467
02:36:58.310 --> 02:37:02.050
Needs to call his agent up and tell him he's already booked when if he told the

5468
02:37:02.051 --> 02:37:04.690
people on the internet or I should fear you'd be coming to Columbus,

5469
02:37:04.691 --> 02:37:06.330
Ohio to fucking go to the

5470
02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:10.601
mumble.

5471
02:37:10.601 --> 02:37:10.931
Mumble,

5472
02:37:10.931 --> 02:37:11.764
mumble,

5473
02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:12.851
mumble,

5474
02:37:12.851 --> 02:37:13.151
mumble,

5475
02:37:13.151 --> 02:37:13.984
mumble.

5476
02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:14.801
Powerful.

5477
02:37:14.801 --> 02:37:16.070
Ari Superior just released to set.

5478
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:17.900
<v 0>He's going to a release rather his uh,</v>

5479
02:37:17.901 --> 02:37:19.520
his second recording,

5480
02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:20.121
whatever it is.

5481
02:37:20.121 --> 02:37:20.601
DVD,

5482
02:37:20.601 --> 02:37:21.340
CD I,

5483
02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:22.430
that was my old house man.

5484
02:37:22.590 --> 02:37:23.540
How would that Joey Diaz,

5485
02:37:23.870 --> 02:37:24.703
yeah,

5486
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:26.190
that was the early we'd spoken day.

5487
02:37:26.191 --> 02:37:28.460
So it was like the first year of me smoking weed.

5488
02:37:28.970 --> 02:37:30.920
That was my full gaming rig set up,

5489
02:37:30.921 --> 02:37:32.120
see all that shit in the background.

5490
02:37:32.210 --> 02:37:32.440
Yeah,

5491
02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:32.660
it does.

5492
02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:34.520
I built that computer behind Joey's head.

5493
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:36.470
I put that mother fucker together myself.

5494
02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:37.310
Yep.

5495
02:37:37.310 --> 02:37:38.870
I built that thing from scratch.

5496
02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:39.733
Motherboard,

5497
02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:42.470
add hard drives a whole deal cause I used to do that shit back then.

5498
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:46.370
I used to make my own gaming computers because if you made them you could like,

5499
02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:46.941
you know,

5500
02:37:46.941 --> 02:37:47.230
under,

5501
02:37:47.230 --> 02:37:49.820
you understood like it was really not very hard.

5502
02:37:49.850 --> 02:37:50.900
It's really pretty easy.

5503
02:37:50.930 --> 02:37:52.490
You just did you follow instructions?

5504
02:37:52.730 --> 02:37:53.001
You know,

5505
02:37:53.001 --> 02:37:55.910
all you have to do is just put the stuff in the right place to set the jumpers.

5506
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.660
Remember that Brian?

5507
02:37:56.660 --> 02:37:57.590
Remember setting jumpers?

5508
02:37:57.591 --> 02:37:58.160
Yeah,

5509
02:37:58.160 --> 02:37:58.431
that was,

5510
02:37:58.431 --> 02:37:59.660
it was annoying shit ever.

5511
02:37:59.690 --> 02:37:59.991
Yeah.

5512
02:37:59.991 --> 02:38:03.380
We used to have to have tweezers and used to have to have them pull these little

5513
02:38:03.381 --> 02:38:06.080
plastic things out and stick them in the right slots.

5514
02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:09.410
They had to be in the right slots for various reasons.

5515
02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:09.860
Right?

5516
02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:10.310
Yeah.

5517
02:38:10.310 --> 02:38:10.430
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

5518
02:38:10.430 --> 02:38:11.320
Cause he's like,

5519
02:38:12.250 --> 02:38:16.300
if you want like certain things had to be on different frequencies and they,

5520
02:38:16.301 --> 02:38:16.870
they,

5521
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:17.560
you know,

5522
02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:19.150
and then you had to flash your bios.

5523
02:38:19.210 --> 02:38:20.060
Oh Jeez.

5524
02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:21.220
Shit.

5525
02:38:21.220 --> 02:38:21.971
What the fuck?

5526
02:38:21.971 --> 02:38:22.720
Joe Diaz,

5527
02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:23.680
he never did nothing like that.

5528
02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:27.140
He just got a website from Godaddy.

5529
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:29.710
You ever have a hard time changing a fucking flat tire?

5530
02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:30.610
When are you doing?

5531
02:38:30.670 --> 02:38:31.410
Are you doing the church?

5532
02:38:31.410 --> 02:38:32.880
<v 0>What's happening now on Ustream at all?</v>

5533
02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:33.691
No,

5534
02:38:33.691 --> 02:38:35.190
I'm still on with the other guys.

5535
02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:35.910
Stick Cam.

5536
02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:37.380
What do you on steady cam stick yet?

5537
02:38:38.730 --> 02:38:41.970
But I'm going to start doing the show live with them on Wednesdays.

5538
02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:43.050
The Nerdist studios.

5539
02:38:43.410 --> 02:38:43.681
Oh,

5540
02:38:43.681 --> 02:38:44.101
beautiful.

5541
02:38:44.101 --> 02:38:48.700
What is it that the calming is kind of the day though in the morning at 6:00 AM,

5542
02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:51.070
but they have a comic book stories now where they have it set up.

5543
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:53.010
Hit the fucking standup is off the chain.

5544
02:38:53.430 --> 02:38:53.540
Well,

5545
02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:54.540

5546
02:38:54.541 --> 02:38:55.374

30 studios.

5549
02:38:57.141 --> 02:38:57.831
I had the fucking,

5550
02:38:57.831 --> 02:39:02.120
one night there were two of the people watching comedies.

5551
02:39:02.420 --> 02:39:04.570
They tell me you can't even get parking spots down there.

5552
02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:05.583
Wow.

5553
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:06.500
Nerdist studio.

5554
02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:06.890
Well,

5555
02:39:06.890 --> 02:39:07.400

Oh yeah.

5559
02:39:09.811 --> 02:39:10.700
I used to go there before.

5560
02:39:10.701 --> 02:39:10.901
Nervous.

5561
02:39:10.901 --> 02:39:11.734
Is that right?

5562
02:39:12.250 --> 02:39:13.110
It's really small though.

5563
02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:13.430
Ooh,

5564
02:39:13.430 --> 02:39:14.450

5565

5626
02:40:36.450 --> 02:40:38.040
A man first week of February,

5627

5637
02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:55.700
Whoever who could to possibly tell you to do something other than what you want

5638
02:40:55.701 --> 02:40:56.360
to do.

5639
02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:56.550
Well,

5640

We get the sand manual casino tomorrow.

5646
02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:06.511
Oh come on man.

5647
02:41:06.511 --> 02:41:11.511
That's where the less black show is that we're seeing manual together.

5648
02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:15.640
Fucking far dog [inaudible] afternoon.

5649
02:41:16.070 --> 02:41:17.830
Is that like west palms or no,

5650
02:41:17.890 --> 02:41:18.870
you got to go early.

5651
02:41:18.871 --> 02:41:19.800
Like three is shot.

5652
02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:24.110
It's where the drug mules stop.

5653
02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:26.070
Oh fuck this.

5654
02:41:26.071 --> 02:41:30.120

5656
02:41:31.471 --> 02:41:32.304
Listen,

5657
02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:37.240
but out here in Nashville for awhile and a lot of pretty girls love y'all.

5658
02:41:38.940 --> 02:41:41.670
Parker Parker talking about some,

5659
02:41:41.671 --> 02:41:45.270
a karate look at what was going a big believer in the arts.

5660
02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:46.560
This doesn't look that bad,

5661
02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:48.550
but I don't want to own their own down.

5662
02:41:48.940 --> 02:41:49.980
I don't look like that.

5663
02:41:50.430 --> 02:41:53.190
You know what's important is that they show this old Indian dude,

5664
02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:58.740
why don't you guys show me some hot bitches that are also going to this casino?

5665
02:41:58.890 --> 02:42:00.150
Why are you showing me an old Indian?

5666
02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:01.660
There has to be a hot pitch right here.

5667
02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:02.010
Yeah,

5668
02:42:02.010 --> 02:42:03.570
you don't have to show me a dream catcher.

5669
02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:05.310
He's saying a fucking Stephen King Book.

5670
02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:05.970
Okay.

5671
02:42:05.970 --> 02:42:07.020
Show me some hot bitches.

5672
02:42:07.021 --> 02:42:07.801
I get it.

5673
02:42:07.801 --> 02:42:08.850
It's an Indian casino.

5674
02:42:08.910 --> 02:42:09.960
I got it.

5675
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.823
I get it.

5676
02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:13.050
You're not advertising the correct way.

5677
02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:15.460
Old Indians rarely get people to go visit him.

5678
02:42:16.470 --> 02:42:17.970
Where he got that girl in the corner.

5679
02:42:18.450 --> 02:42:21.300
She's fucking barely finder,

5680
02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:23.130
cold hard cash.

5681
02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:24.181
Those,

5682
02:42:24.181 --> 02:42:25.014
um,

5683
02:42:26.010 --> 02:42:26.311
those,

5684
02:42:26.311 --> 02:42:26.460
uh,

5685
02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:27.510
those places are interesting.

5686
02:42:27.511 --> 02:42:28.271
We used to go to,

5687
02:42:28.271 --> 02:42:28.550
well there's,

5688
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:29.370
or that's pretty girl.

5689
02:42:29.370 --> 02:42:32.550
We used to go to a lot of those Indian casinos back in the day when I'm mixed.

5690
02:42:32.551 --> 02:42:34.230
Martial arts was illegal in California.

5691
02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:36.450
Eddie Bravo and I used to drive out to,

5692
02:42:36.451 --> 02:42:36.990
uh,

5693
02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:38.610
to see the king of the cages and shit.

5694
02:42:38.611 --> 02:42:39.360
We used to go out.

5695
02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:40.320
They were always in these.

5696
02:42:41.090 --> 02:42:41.521
It's funny,

5697
02:42:41.521 --> 02:42:43.650
right when you said it pulled up king in a cage.

5698
02:42:43.690 --> 02:42:44.523
Perfect.

5699
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:45.450
Yeah.

5700
02:42:45.450 --> 02:42:47.550
Well can you have the cage is a good,

5701
02:42:47.551 --> 02:42:47.701
uh,

5702
02:42:47.701 --> 02:42:48.900
I think that's Tony Lopez.

5703
02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:53.010
A King of the cage is a good January.

5704
02:42:53.210 --> 02:42:54.043
No,

5705
02:42:54.450 --> 02:42:55.283
go back to Canaan.

5706
02:42:55.650 --> 02:42:59.400
December one December 20th tomorrow.

5707
02:42:59.770 --> 02:43:00.320
What does that do?

5708
02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:01.050
That's just,

5709
02:43:01.050 --> 02:43:03.190
I'm going to be there to save time as king a cage.

5710
02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:05.393
Fuck Dude.

5711
02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:06.433

02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:09.930
no.

5714
02:43:09.930 --> 02:43:10.770
That's Thursday.

5715
02:43:10.860 --> 02:43:11.270
No,

5716
02:43:11.270 --> 02:43:11.510
no.

5717
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:13.570
It was December 20th I said Wednesday,

You lucked out the man.

5724
02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:21.311

5735
02:43:36.611 --> 02:43:38.440

5736
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:40.540

02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:04.930
your quest to make black people out.

5755
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:07.180
I suggest you not do any of your racist jokes.

5756
02:44:07.210 --> 02:44:07.361
No,

5757
02:44:07.361 --> 02:44:08.194
I will not.

5758
02:44:08.430 --> 02:44:09.700
I only have one black Joe.

5759
02:44:09.730 --> 02:44:10.950
It's barely racers and spare.

5760
02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:11.833
I'm on your side,

5761
02:44:11.890 --> 02:44:15.190
but I suggest to dance around that and start strong.

5762
02:44:15.220 --> 02:44:17.110
You've got to start strong and no slurring,

5763
02:44:18.330 --> 02:44:19.660
no smoking weed before that.

5764
02:44:19.661 --> 02:44:20.440
No probate Joe.

5765
02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:22.630
Maybe a little bit of that property or you need to get yourself a doctor.

5766
02:44:22.631 --> 02:44:23.350
I know.

5767
02:44:23.350 --> 02:44:25.150
Powerful Joe Diaz.

5768
02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:26.260

5778
02:44:46.250 --> 02:44:47.620
I almost like surface.

5779
02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:49.870
Then I realized what I was saying as I was saying it.

5780
02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:51.410
It's an amazing serve.

5781
02:44:51.411 --> 02:44:52.200
This,

5782
02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:53.080
I use it,

5783
02:44:53.310 --> 02:44:53.570
uh,

5784
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:58.270
use it for a while and the book I'm reading from it right now is called sex at

5785
02:44:58.271 --> 02:45:01.150
dawn by Christopher Ryan who will be on the podcast soon.

5786
02:45:01.151 --> 02:45:01.361
We're,

5787
02:45:01.361 --> 02:45:03.550
we're going back and forth about this right now,

5788
02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:05.390
but I got a lot of people booked already.

5789
02:45:05.530 --> 02:45:06.340
Bitches,

5790
02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:07.750
shit is blowing up.

5791
02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:10.270
I'm hooking you up with some fresh guests.

5792
02:45:10.510 --> 02:45:11.380
I talked to Tom Green.

5793
02:45:11.381 --> 02:45:11.891
He wants to do it.

5794
02:45:11.891 --> 02:45:13.960
Come back on powerful Tom Green.

5795
02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:15.340
I want Tom Green on.

5796
02:45:15.341 --> 02:45:18.280
I was really impressed with Tom Green special.

5797
02:45:18.470 --> 02:45:18.761
Um,

5798
02:45:18.761 --> 02:45:20.710
I watched for comedy specials in a row,

5799
02:45:20.711 --> 02:45:21.730
which I don't usually do.

5800
02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.370
And Tom Green was the one that made me laugh and I thought that was really

5801
02:45:24.371 --> 02:45:25.330
awesome because you know,

5802
02:45:25.331 --> 02:45:27.580
Tom Green's only been doing standup for like five years.

5803
02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:29.830
I think he has really been good that long.

5804
02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:30.610
We had him on the,

5805
02:45:30.610 --> 02:45:32.230
on that podcast last night,

5806
02:45:32.290 --> 02:45:33.430
and he was saying that he,

5807
02:45:33.431 --> 02:45:35.530
he sold his whole entire studio.

5808
02:45:35.531 --> 02:45:37.270
He had a TV studio in his house.

5809
02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:41.140
He sold the whole thing and just got rid of all his stuff that's not there in

5810
02:45:41.141 --> 02:45:41.974
his house anymore.

5811
02:45:42.190 --> 02:45:45.460
And he's now just thinking about coming back and doing a podcast now again.

5812
02:45:45.730 --> 02:45:46.240
Uh,

5813
02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:46.511
but,

5814
02:45:46.511 --> 02:45:46.870
uh,

5815
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:48.370
he's just going to get focused on comedy.

5816
02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:49.030
Yeah.

5817
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.271
Well,

5818
02:45:49.271 --> 02:45:49.990
you can tell,

5819
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:51.820
you can tell if you see his last special.

5820
02:45:51.850 --> 02:45:52.840
It was really good.

5821
02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:54.490
I think he did it from Australia.

5822
02:45:54.491 --> 02:45:55.810
I want to say he did it from Australia.

5823
02:45:55.811 --> 02:45:57.130
I might not be right about that though,

5824
02:45:57.370 --> 02:45:58.810
but whatever it was,

5825
02:45:58.840 --> 02:45:59.740
it was really good.

5826
02:45:59.741 --> 02:46:00.011
I mean,

5827
02:46:00.011 --> 02:46:00.740
Tom's a,

5828
02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:01.491
and he's a great guy.

5829
02:46:01.491 --> 02:46:02.440
I would love to have them on.

5830
02:46:02.830 --> 02:46:03.191
And,

5831
02:46:03.191 --> 02:46:03.431
uh,

5832
02:46:03.431 --> 02:46:03.970
so that's it.

5833
02:46:03.970 --> 02:46:04.211
Doug.

5834
02:46:04.211 --> 02:46:05.740
Stan hope will be joining us.

5835
02:46:05.741 --> 02:46:07.840
You dirty bitches on a Saturday.

5836
02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:12.800
That's depending on whether or not Saturday actually exists.

We didn't start this thing off thinking it would ever become what it is now.

5920
02:48:13.521 --> 02:48:13.711
We,

5921
02:48:13.711 --> 02:48:14.140
we,

5922
02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:14.410
you know,

5923
02:48:14.410 --> 02:48:17.060
we just started off for a goof and three years later,

5924
02:48:17.061 --> 02:48:18.950
here we are and we've had a great fucking time.

5925
02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:23.240
We appreciate all you piece of people that say nice things about it that enjoy

5926
02:48:23.241 --> 02:48:26.390
it and say that it enhances your life and it enhances ours too.

5927
02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:28.250
We would never get to have,

5928
02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:32.540
even though we have cool friends like Joey Diaz and you know Doug Stan hope and

5929
02:48:32.541 --> 02:48:33.374
all these people,

5930
02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:36.380
it's really hard to get all these people to sit down and talk with you for three

5931
02:48:36.381 --> 02:48:38.870
hours at a time like this unless you broadcasting it.

5932
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:43.160
There's the fact that it's going out to all you actually benefits us just as

5933
02:48:43.161 --> 02:48:44.210
much as it benefits you.

5934
02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:45.860
So we're all in this together.

5935
02:48:45.861 --> 02:48:46.540
You fucks.

5936
02:48:46.540 --> 02:48:47.030
All right.

5937
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:51.140
Keep it together and we'll see you on Saturday or we'll see you Friday at the

5938
02:48:51.141 --> 02:48:51.974
end of the world show.

5939
02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:54.410
We'll see you Thursday at the Improv.

5940
02:48:54.470 --> 02:48:55.520
I wouldn't lie to you at night.

5941
02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:55.941
I don't know.

5942
02:48:55.941 --> 02:48:56.750
What the fuck are you doing?

5943
02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:59.390
I might run in the out there out in the wild.
