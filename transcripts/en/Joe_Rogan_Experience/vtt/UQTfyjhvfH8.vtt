00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 2>The people have spoken.</v>

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you for having me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thanks for being here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

7
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I became a fan of yours when I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

8
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.480
<v Speaker 2>with what the fuck is his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CNN asshole.</v>

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Piers Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was glorious when you went after </v>

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.020
<v Speaker 2>him with the sandy hook thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right away.</v>

12
00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

13
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 2>it was just glorious and you could tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he didn't know what to do with it </v>

14
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 2>and he literally said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you,</v>

15
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 2>which is what I say to people all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time when I'm joking you was one of my </v>

16
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 2>friends had it looked like he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>clutching his pearls.</v>

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.130
<v Speaker 2>He was really pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was really good.</v>

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.830
<v Speaker 2>It was a two segment interview and </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the break I said to him,</v>

19
00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 2>thanks so much for having me on any kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of growled at me.</v>

20
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 2>He was not a happy camper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

21
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you crushed him.</v>

22
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 2>And the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my other favorite ones was </v>

23
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Chelsea handler crushing him where she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was literally talking like,</v>

24
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 2>you don't even talk to me in the break </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the break.</v>

25
00:00:57.851 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 2>You're checking your phone and checking </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and,</v>

26
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could tell he was like,</v>

27
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just came from that Weird British </v>

28
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.471
<v Speaker 2>tabloid environment and you found out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the company that he worked for did </v>

29
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>really creepy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like check people's voicemails.</v>

30
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 2>They hacked into people's people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead and they gave the family false hope</v>

31
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:20.851
<v Speaker 2>because they had checked the voicemail </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they found out that someone checked </v>

32
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:20.851
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought,</v>

33
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe she's still alive.</v>

34
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 2>And then we made him a host on like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>x factor.</v>

35
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I brought him on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN is awesome.</v>

36
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I just don't make any decisions on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around why CNN thought that we have this</v>

37
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 2>fascination with British people.</v>

38
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a British accent,</v>

39
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.350
<v Speaker 2>we automatically add 20 points here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Icu.</v>

40
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're great for like selling mops,</v>

41
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:42.661
<v Speaker 2>late night and nonstick cookware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I enjoyed John Oliver.</v>

42
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I think John Oliver's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And apparently he has a,</v>

43
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people think of all British </v>

44
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 2>accents as being the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has like a blue collar British </v>

45
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 2>accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>

46
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell the difference too much </v>

47
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>except for when I'm watching my fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>lady or something.</v>

48
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could tell people from Manchester and </v>

49
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

50
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like the sort of way of </v>

51
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 2>talking so fast that all the words kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of pile into each other.</v>

52
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

53
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Oliver's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his uh,</v>

54
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 2>his recent one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo got really mad at it.</v>

55
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>The recent one about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones is fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've seen it.</v>

57
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible to make something</v>
<v Speaker 2>not funny about Alex Jones.</v>

58
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 2>You've got to meet Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you met him?</v>

59
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that given how much I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>made fun of him.</v>

60
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says strip off his shirt and he might</v>

61
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.020
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd calm down.</v>

62
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 2>You're a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're basically on the same team.</v>

63
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.850
<v Speaker 2>He would come around if you remember the</v>
<v Speaker 2>piers Morgan thing happened two nights </v>

64
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 2>after Alex was on Piers Morgan said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elena.</v>

65
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.420
<v Speaker 2>So appears was like flying high because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had that whole debate with Alex and </v>

66
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.741
<v Speaker 2>Alex did his shtick and it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the top and he thought I was going </v>

67
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:52.861
<v Speaker 2>to be like Alex Jones prior to and who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be peers succeeds again and </v>

68
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Alex and I could not be more different </v>
<v Speaker 2>than our britches.</v>

69
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very rational and very reasonable</v>

70
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 2>and we've been talking about some your </v>
<v Speaker 2>debates.</v>

71
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of guys like you out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

72
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 3>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're a fast thinking,</v>

73
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:11.011
<v Speaker 3>fast talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very smart young guy who's also a </v>

74
00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:14.641
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's not a lot of those out </v>

75
00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:14.641
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of the things that we're</v>

76
00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 3>encountering today is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in college campuses,</v>

77
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.110
<v Speaker 3>there's this very strange separation </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the left and the right to the </v>

78
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 3>point where the right is like almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonexistent or at least doesn't have any</v>

79
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 3>representation and they're actively </v>
<v Speaker 3>shunning that representation.</v>

80
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Like they're pushing people out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what's going on with you in </v>

81
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has that been written seven resolved?</v>

82
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that uh,</v>

83
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.960
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Berkeley,</v>

84
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:39.390
<v Speaker 4>after the publicity they said they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to explain to people if they don't</v>

85
00:03:39.391 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 4>know the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

86
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 4>So UC Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you recall,</v>

87
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:46.881
<v Speaker 4>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually spoke there before any of </v>

88
00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:48.891
<v Speaker 4>this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spoke to UC Berkeley and April 2016 </v>

89
00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:51.350
<v Speaker 4>and then Milo was supposed to speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and he actually went there and </v>

90
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.651
<v Speaker 4>there was a riot where antifa </v>
<v Speaker 4>infiltrated the student community and </v>

91
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:58.220
<v Speaker 4>there are all these pictures of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>bombing things and blowing up cars and </v>

92
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.460
<v Speaker 4>then understanding them in a fire at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least in and throwing things at windows.</v>

93
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.640
<v Speaker 4>And so Berkeley shut down that event for</v>
<v Speaker 4>safety reasons.</v>

94
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:06.080
<v Speaker 4>Then Ann Coulter wanted to speak there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they basically used what they called</v>

95
00:04:06.081 --> 00:04:11.081
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>place and manner restrictions to stop </v>

96
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:11.081
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kept saying,</v>

97
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:11.081
<v Speaker 4>well we have safety problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't figure out how to do the event.</v>

98
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.980
<v Speaker 4>And in the end they just canceled it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they didn't have security.</v>

99
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 4>And then young Americans foundation </v>
<v Speaker 4>which sponsors me to go to a lot of </v>

100
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 4>these campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

101
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.480
<v Speaker 4>So we want Shapiro to come and again I </v>
<v Speaker 4>spoke to like a year and a half ago and </v>

102
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.720
<v Speaker 4>they give them two and a half months </v>
<v Speaker 4>advance and Berkeley said,</v>

103
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 4>well we have no venues available and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>this seemed to be another cover for.</v>

104
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:34.071
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to allow a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>on campus because their security </v>

105
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we made that public and then Berkeley</v>

106
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

107
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:35.040
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

108
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

109
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.960
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll make,</v>

110
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.660
<v Speaker 4>we'll make sure that you get in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They give us an alternative venue and do</v>

111
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.160
<v Speaker 4>they even said they covered the security</v>
<v Speaker 4>things?</v>

112
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.300
<v Speaker 4>They didn't like the bad publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

113
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 4>well that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.740
<v Speaker 4>So that should be good.</v>

115
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Well you know what happened with Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson yesterday?</v>

116
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

117
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:51.661
<v Speaker 3>just yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson was banned from youtube </v>

118
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:54.400
<v Speaker 3>and Youtube has a new policy that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

119
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 3>it's very weirdly worded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently they're allowed to block </v>

120
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:04.531
<v Speaker 3>and restrict any kind of videos that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>about religion or that could be deemed </v>

121
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 3>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is almost everything.</v>

122
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

123
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.120
<v Speaker 4>And anything that's remotely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I mean,</v>

124
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 4>anything that's interesting is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to be offensive to somebody.</v>

125
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 3>So won't be monetize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also won't be in the videos of </v>

126
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 3>interest or</v>

127
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 4>I know they did this to a prager </v>
<v Speaker 4>university as well.</v>

128
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 4>They had blocked like 10 of their videos</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of months ago.</v>

129
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.580
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

130
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is nasty stuff and listen,</v>

131
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 4>youtube as a private company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the right to do what they want</v>

132
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 4>but don't proclaim that are a free </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech promoting institution.</v>

133
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:31.500
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to block people like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan,</v>

134
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.430
<v Speaker 3>well the the problem is they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocking things that are offensive to </v>

135
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.860
<v Speaker 3>other people there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not blocking certain things that</v>

136
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:42.170
<v Speaker 3>are representing Islam in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>

137
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of weirdness with this </v>

138
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.381
<v Speaker 3>left wing choice of what to sensor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what not to censor and it's not just </v>

139
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:56.291
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also bad for the whole idea of </v>

140
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:58.920
<v Speaker 3>being a progressive or being liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it makes you look.</v>

141
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.510
<v Speaker 3>It makes them look really petty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really weird and really resistant and </v>

142
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 3>hesitant to actually have real debate.</v>

143
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

144
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.300
<v Speaker 4>And this is one of the reasons why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>very meticulous in my terminology about </v>

145
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.750
<v Speaker 4>people who are on the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>aisle,</v>

146
00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:14.970
<v Speaker 4>actually separate people who are liberal</v>
<v Speaker 4>from people who are leftists.</v>

147
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.710
<v Speaker 4>So when there are people who try to band</v>
<v Speaker 4>speech,</v>

148
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 4>I call them leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if they are not interested in </v>

149
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 4>banding speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then their liberal,</v>

150
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.650
<v Speaker 4>meaning they want bigger government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they disagree with me on politics,</v>

151
00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:27.651
<v Speaker 4>but they're still willing to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation and they want an open </v>

152
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.411
<v Speaker 4>forum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who are on the hard left think </v>

153
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:30.570
<v Speaker 4>that it's actually an insult to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity to disagree with them.</v>

154
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.220
<v Speaker 4>And this is what I experienced sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

155
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.150
<v Speaker 4>on campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

156
00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:35.430
<v Speaker 4>at cal state la where there's a near </v>
<v Speaker 4>riot when I speak,</v>

157
00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:40.431
<v Speaker 4>or University of Wisconsin where people </v>
<v Speaker 4>stormed the stage and stand in front of </v>

158
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:40.440
<v Speaker 4>it and won't leave or state where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

159
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another near violence incident over at </v>

160
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 4>Penn state or depaul where they actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>banned me outright.</v>

161
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.020
<v Speaker 4>So sometimes you get this routine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

162
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.150
<v Speaker 4>from people who think that they conflate</v>
<v Speaker 4>their viewpoint with their identity.</v>

163
00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:52.890
<v Speaker 4>And then if you have a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint,</v>

164
00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:54.990
<v Speaker 4>you're denying them their humanity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

165
00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:56.010
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not the nine years.</v>

166
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.820
<v Speaker 4>I just think what you're saying is dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

167
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.720
<v Speaker 3>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point is that they </v>

168
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.120
<v Speaker 3>have their identity completely connected</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their ideology.</v>

169
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.410
<v Speaker 3>And when you oppose these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have these debates or these </v>

170
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.621
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really fascinating is the level </v>

171
00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:14.500
<v Speaker 3>of a stereo that gets reached while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're staying calm.</v>

172
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've noticed is that there's</v>

173
00:07:16.661 --> 00:07:18.190
<v Speaker 4>a ton of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

174
00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:20.320
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tend to keep relatively calm just as a</v>

175
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:22.950
<v Speaker 4>human being and very often when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>debating someone,</v>

176
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.990
<v Speaker 4>you see them getting more and more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more emotional and people on the right </v>

177
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.511
<v Speaker 4>love this because of course it's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>triggering of the snowflakes are the </v>

178
00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:33.211
<v Speaker 4>easiest thing in the world to do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger some idiot college kid who </v>

179
00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:33.211
<v Speaker 4>doesn't know his ass from a hole in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground and what.</v>

180
00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 4>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's hard to do is actually discuss </v>

181
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 4>issues with somebody who is intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to make the,</v>

182
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.780
<v Speaker 4>to make the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's the level of hysteria on the </v>

183
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:42.940
<v Speaker 4>campuses has really increased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

184
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.330
<v Speaker 4>I know you have to travel with two </v>
<v Speaker 4>members of security to every campus just</v>

185
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.040
<v Speaker 4>because you don't know which campus is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to go off.</v>

186
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.570
<v Speaker 4>I never had to travel security before.</v>

187
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.030
<v Speaker 4>It's the weirdest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long ago did this start happening?</v>

188
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in February of Twenty 16 is when I </v>

189
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 4>started traveling with security,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I spoke at University of Missouri.</v>

190
00:07:57.341 --> 00:08:02.341
<v Speaker 4>They remember they had the big blow up a</v>
<v Speaker 4>university of Missouri with black lives </v>

191
00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:05.641
<v Speaker 4>matter taking over campus offices and </v>
<v Speaker 4>suggesting that there was some sort of </v>

192
00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:06.580
<v Speaker 4>big racism problem at Missou,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just ridiculous.</v>

193
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 4>And so they flew me and I did a speech </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and then the next time I spoke was</v>

194
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.300
<v Speaker 4>cal state La and they brought in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of security guys and I was like,</v>

195
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.330
<v Speaker 4>what do I need security for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm just speaking on a campus who </v>

196
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.611
<v Speaker 4>cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get to the campus and they had </v>

197
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:20.611
<v Speaker 4>already tried to cancel my speech </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of security and I said,</v>

198
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:21.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm coming anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So tough.</v>

199
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I had to be escorted in by 20 armed </v>
<v Speaker 4>police officers.</v>

200
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.020
<v Speaker 4>I had to be escorted off campus by </v>
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle cops flashing their lights.</v>

201
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:34.170
<v Speaker 4>There were 300 students who had blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of the entrances were physically </v>

202
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 4>assaulting people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get into the theater.</v>

203
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.000
<v Speaker 4>The police had to sneak the students in </v>
<v Speaker 4>two by two into the theater.</v>

204
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.340
<v Speaker 4>They told them that until I left the </v>
<v Speaker 4>campus,</v>

205
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:44.490
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't actually let the kids out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the theater because they were afraid </v>

206
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:44.490
<v Speaker 4>that if they let the kids out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>theater,</v>

207
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:44.710
<v Speaker 4>there'd be attacked as they got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as they were released.</v>

208
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.780
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one was pretty well.</v>

209
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:47.710
<v Speaker 4>It's after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was okay.</v>

210
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:49.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess the security is necessary.</v>

211
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is shifting?</v>

212
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

213
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 3>what is ramping things up?</v>

214
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 4>I think the identity is ramping things</v>

215
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think there's a new mentality out </v>

216
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.321
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this intersectionality politics on </v>

217
00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:06.111
<v Speaker 3>the left that says that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of victim groups basically are </v>

218
00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 3>there blacks and Hispanics and gays and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews and Asians.</v>

219
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:11.481
<v Speaker 3>They're all victim groups and we get </v>
<v Speaker 3>those all those people together to </v>

220
00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 3>attack the system because the system is </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping them down and if you.</v>

221
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a hierarchy among these </v>

222
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 3>victim groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you are a straight white male,</v>

223
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 3>you're at the very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very bottom of the hierarchy in terms of</v>

224
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 3>viewpoints that should be acknowledged </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're the creators of this vast</v>

225
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 3>white supremacist system that keeps down</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>

226
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a black woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're near the top right?</v>

227
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 3>If you're LGBT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at the top.</v>

228
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 3>If you're a white guy and you challenged</v>
<v Speaker 3>the viewpoint of a black woman,</v>

229
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 3>your viewpoint is an attack on her </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity and therefore she has the right</v>

230
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 3>to shut you down.</v>

231
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.560
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is that your words are </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence to her identity and therefore </v>

232
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:47.751
<v Speaker 3>she has the right to react.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the term you hear on campus a </v>

233
00:09:47.751 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 3>lot is microaggressions as idea that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion microaggressive you know,</v>

234
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.190
<v Speaker 3>even that terminology I think is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid because normally in regular life </v>

235
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 3>we would say that's insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said something,</v>

236
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Microaggression suggests aggression.</v>

237
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm actually doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive to you.</v>

238
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:07.250
<v Speaker 3>And the rational response to someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressing you is to use physical force </v>

239
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.250
<v Speaker 3>in response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you start,</v>

240
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 3>you start to see a more violent </v>
<v Speaker 3>response.</v>

241
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 3>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been growing in our politics.</v>

242
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:12.830
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a reactionary side on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right that's,</v>

243
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.870
<v Speaker 3>that's growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if there's an identity politics on </v>

244
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.870
<v Speaker 3>the left that says now black identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

245
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 3>gay identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female identity politics,</v>

246
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:24.651
<v Speaker 3>I think you're starting to see in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas of white identity politics that's </v>

247
00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:24.651
<v Speaker 3>almost formed in response.</v>

248
00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:24.651
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

249
00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:26.610
<v Speaker 3>well if everybody else gets to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>their identity politics,</v>

250
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 3>why can't we defend ourselves on those </v>
<v Speaker 3>same grounds?</v>

251
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.670
<v Speaker 3>I hate that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

252
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 3>I hate that shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would like to find the person who </v>

253
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.210
<v Speaker 3>invented the term microaggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucker,</v>

254
00:10:37.211 --> 00:10:38.630
<v Speaker 3>whoever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

255
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 3>They created quite a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

256
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you saw what happened at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Evergreen with Bret Weinstein.</v>

257
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.650
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're literally left is eating itself </v>

258
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.650
<v Speaker 3>and that's where it gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

259
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.901
<v Speaker 3>you're not progressive enough unless </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're literally submitting to leaving </v>

260
00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:56.971
<v Speaker 3>your class because you're white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't be there because you're </v>

261
00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:58.180
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want a day of absence,</v>

262
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.820
<v Speaker 3>meaning the professors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white people.</v>

263
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 3>And then when you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're somehow in other racist and a </v>

264
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

265
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.261
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing was very bizarre to </v>

266
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:10.261
<v Speaker 3>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

267
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:15.150
<v Speaker 3>but not not surprising because you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>it so much so often all over the country</v>

268
00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:20.461
<v Speaker 3>right now and it's almost like some new </v>
<v Speaker 3>flower of ridiculous thinking and </v>

269
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:23.230
<v Speaker 3>behavior has blossomed and it's in bloom</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

270
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 3>And when people can point to it existing</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other places,</v>

271
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:28.630
<v Speaker 3>like in Missouri where that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was her name?</v>

272
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Who was that woman who got the click?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

273
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.810
<v Speaker 3>whatever her name was that when you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in video,</v>

274
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.560
<v Speaker 3>when you see her on video saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we get some muscle over here?</v>

275
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Like this is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

276
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.860
<v Speaker 3>you're telling a photographer and by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

277
00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:49.861
<v Speaker 3>a minority and Asian Asian man taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>photos of a public place that you've </v>

278
00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:52.530
<v Speaker 3>created some safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

279
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this weird thing where it's half of</v>

280
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 3>it is identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also wrapped up in this need to</v>

281
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 3>control people and control people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

282
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Control their vernacular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>control the way they communicate.</v>

283
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:10.951
<v Speaker 3>And how you know how much you give in to</v>
<v Speaker 3>group think it's weird.</v>

284
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:17.090
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a Jonathan Heit who's a social </v>

285
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.431
<v Speaker 4>psychologist over at Nyu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did a really good piece for the </v>

286
00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:20.220
<v Speaker 4>Atlantic in 2015 about this phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this kind of safe space,</v>

287
00:12:20.221 --> 00:12:25.221
<v Speaker 4>trigger warning phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This idea that you must never be forced </v>

288
00:12:25.221 --> 00:12:26.460
<v Speaker 4>into a position where someone has an </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that opposes yours.</v>

289
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.410
<v Speaker 4>And what he said is it basically makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>people crazy.</v>

290
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.680
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually makes you crazy that the </v>

291
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.601
<v Speaker 4>idea in psychology is that if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>chain of thoughts leading to a bad </v>

292
00:12:35.601 --> 00:12:39.561
<v Speaker 4>outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're depressed or if you're an </v>

293
00:12:39.561 --> 00:12:40.771
<v Speaker 4>oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have a chain of thoughts </v>

294
00:12:40.771 --> 00:12:42.141
<v Speaker 4>leading to a bad outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way that psychologists deal with </v>

295
00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:42.141
<v Speaker 4>that is with cognitive behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 4>therapy.</v>

296
00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:42.141
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

297
00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:43.560
<v Speaker 4>we're in this chain of thoughts are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going wrong.</v>

298
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.540
<v Speaker 4>Are you attributing to somebody a motive</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have?</v>

299
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.340
<v Speaker 4>Or does your wife really being nasty?</v>

300
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:52.340
<v Speaker 4>Or is it you just attributing nasty to </v>
<v Speaker 4>her and that's why you're getting </v>

301
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:52.340
<v Speaker 4>depressed or spinning off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

302
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Try to control your own chain of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts.</v>

303
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.260
<v Speaker 4>What the microaggression trigger warning</v>
<v Speaker 4>culture does is it actually grants down.</v>

304
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.090
<v Speaker 4>The more you are offended,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more value you are granted,</v>

305
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.790
<v Speaker 4>and therefore you have actually an </v>
<v Speaker 4>interest in being offended.</v>

306
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.150
<v Speaker 4>We give you awards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're offended by your,</v>

307
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.160
<v Speaker 4>your treasured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're offended because it </v>

308
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:10.160
<v Speaker 4>demonstrates that you're woke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

309
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:10.160
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The more you are offended,</v>

310
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.390
<v Speaker 4>the more we can show that you are woke </v>
<v Speaker 4>and because you are woke.</v>

311
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Therefore your granted this virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to Lord it over everyone else.</v>

312
00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:16.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say in my speeches,</v>

313
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.010
<v Speaker 4>if we could somehow identify like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>LGBT,</v>

314
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 4>half black,</v>
<v Speaker 4>half Hispanic,</v>

315
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.080
<v Speaker 4>one quarter native American little </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

316
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we would finally have the,</v>

317
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:31.891
<v Speaker 4>the person who we could go to dance for </v>
<v Speaker 4>all of our questions because their </v>

318
00:13:31.891 --> 00:13:31.891
<v Speaker 4>identity would be unquestionable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be Yoda,</v>

319
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we could find yoga,</v>

320
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.510
<v Speaker 4>we could just get rid of democracy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion altogether.</v>

321
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.260
<v Speaker 4>He can just rule from on high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

322
00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:39.240
<v Speaker 4>she and I don't want to put a gender on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Yoda,</v>

323
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Yodas gender does Yoda.</v>

324
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be a guy or deep voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we're being rude by incidents.</v>

325
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

326
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 3>you're absolutely right because no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a no one's left enough.</v>

327
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

328
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.250
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where the limit is and it's</v>

329
00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:01.340
<v Speaker 4>there so far left that they've actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>made common cause with the people they </v>

330
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:01.340
<v Speaker 4>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

331
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.060
<v Speaker 4>So when they talk about safe spaces and </v>
<v Speaker 4>saw it,</v>

332
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:07.070
<v Speaker 4>you had misery and all these black </v>
<v Speaker 4>students protesting and they actually </v>

333
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.871
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't want white people who think </v>

334
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:09.871
<v Speaker 4>like us and who want to help us in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>safe spaces.</v>

335
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:11.920
<v Speaker 4>We feel insulted by that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just thought to myself,</v>

336
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:13.390
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the KKK agrees,</v>

337
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 4>like if you want to do safe spaces for </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate races,</v>

338
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 4>I can find some Jim Crow racist are </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally up for that from like 1962.</v>

339
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the really bizarre statement </v>

340
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.701
<v Speaker 3>that I've heard over and over again that</v>
<v Speaker 3>black people cannot be racist against </v>

341
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:28.250
<v Speaker 3>white people because they don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 3>power over white people.</v>

342
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

343
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Which is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

344
00:14:34.111 --> 00:14:37.050
<v Speaker 4>it's an an inane statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This idea that you have to.</v>

345
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:42.140
<v Speaker 4>You have to have power in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>superstructure in order for you to even </v>

346
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.171
<v Speaker 4>to be erased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could understand the argument if they </v>

347
00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:45.171
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

348
00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:45.390
<v Speaker 4>you being racist is not connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist action.</v>

349
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.880
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have the capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 4>action that affects people,</v>

350
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 4>then your personal racism is not as </v>
<v Speaker 4>important as the of people in power.</v>

351
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.250
<v Speaker 4>Then at least is an argument where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that you can't be racist at all if </v>

352
00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.781
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're black because black people </v>

353
00:15:01.781 --> 00:15:01.781
<v Speaker 4>don't have enough pat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

354
00:15:01.781 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 4>the idea that black people have no power</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the United States is utterly crazy.</v>

355
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's utterly crazy.</v>

356
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when it was going on while </v>

357
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:09.850
<v Speaker 4>Mama was president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the attorney general was the president.</v>

358
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 4>I always said this about Baltimore.</v>

359
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 4>We kept hearing in Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

360
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:13.420
<v Speaker 4>Would they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The riots they'd bought,</v>

361
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 4>they'd riots and they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

362
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Baltimore PD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

363
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're cracking down on black people.</v>

364
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.020
<v Speaker 4>I'll get the chief of police was black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The majority of the city council was </v>

365
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:23.020
<v Speaker 4>black and Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The entire,</v>

366
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.720
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deputy district attorney who was </v>

367
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.741
<v Speaker 4>prosecuting the case was black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The majority of the police department </v>

368
00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:32.381
<v Speaker 4>was minority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The attorney general of the United </v>

369
00:15:32.381 --> 00:15:32.381
<v Speaker 4>States was black and the president of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States was black,</v>

370
00:15:32.381 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 4>but apparently the majority of the city </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Baltimore is black,</v>

371
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.830
<v Speaker 4>but apparently it's the white guys felt </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just at some point,</v>

372
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna have to make your ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually work in concert with reality.</v>

373
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this with you.</v>

374
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever step back and look at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>trend and look at what's going on in </v>

375
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:54.130
<v Speaker 3>popular culture and looking what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on with identity politics in this war </v>

376
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 3>between the left and the right and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder where it's going.</v>

377
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it feels like the people on the left </v>

378
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 3>are completely emboldened by the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have this guy in office who has</v>

379
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:09.731
<v Speaker 3>said things like grabbing by the pussy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he lives all the time and makes fun </v>

380
00:16:09.731 --> 00:16:14.441
<v Speaker 3>of people's plastic surgery and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that having this guy in in this </v>

381
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:20.231
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess in some way emboldens them and </v>

382
00:16:20.231 --> 00:16:21.650
<v Speaker 3>makes them even more convinced the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're right.</v>

383
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

384
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.660
<v Speaker 3>but put up the resistance and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hashtag resistance.</v>

385
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag resist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all over the place.</v>

386
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Where does this go?</v>

387
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.080
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

388
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:31.740
<v Speaker 4>no place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

389
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:36.741
<v Speaker 4>I think what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's one of the things that I </v>

390
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:39.051
<v Speaker 4>personally am not a fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this goes all the way back to the </v>

391
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:41.361
<v Speaker 4>piers Morgan debate you mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I started off that debate with </v>

392
00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:43.851
<v Speaker 4>Piers Morgan saying to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to attribute intent to me </v>

393
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:43.851
<v Speaker 4>that I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

394
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 4>You're standing on the grades,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids at Sandy Hook in order to </v>

395
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.601
<v Speaker 4>promote your political agenda implying I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't care enough about dead kids </v>

396
00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:53.840
<v Speaker 4>because I don't agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the sweet spot where a lot of </v>

397
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.960
<v Speaker 4>people like to live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is if we disagree on politics,</v>

398
00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:56.370
<v Speaker 4>is because you're an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

399
00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.140
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not because we disagree on the best</v>

400
00:16:58.141 --> 00:17:03.141
<v Speaker 4>methods you get to the goal or we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>different goals is because you're a bad </v>

401
00:17:03.141 --> 00:17:06.360
<v Speaker 4>person and I think that what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing is with trump there an attempt to</v>

402
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:10.320
<v Speaker 4>cast all of his voters as people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>love all of the things that are bad that</v>

403
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:15.321
<v Speaker 4>he does and says is that that they voted</v>
<v Speaker 4>for him because they thought Hillary </v>

404
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Clinton was the worst presidential </v>
<v Speaker 4>candidate in the history of America,</v>

405
00:17:15.391 --> 00:17:16.020
<v Speaker 4>which is true.</v>

406
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they voted for him because they liked</v>

407
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:19.710
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grab them by the p word stuff,</v>

408
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They voted for him because they liked </v>

409
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's vulgar and he lies a lot.</v>

410
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.200
<v Speaker 4>They voted for him because they are bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>people right there.</v>

411
00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:30.201
<v Speaker 4>This is why people misread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Hillary Clinton's deplorable </v>

412
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:30.201
<v Speaker 4>speech it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The implication was,</v>

413
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody who voted for trump is a bad </v>

414
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 4>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tried this with Rami too.</v>

415
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.111
<v Speaker 4>I mean they tried to castigate Romney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's whatever you can say about Mitt </v>

416
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:39.111
<v Speaker 4>Romney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mitt Romney was maybe the most honorable</v>

417
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:43.611
<v Speaker 4>person ever to run for the presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tried to cast him as Joe Biden's </v>

418
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:44.620
<v Speaker 4>had a guy who wants to put y'all back in</v>
<v Speaker 4>chains or he said that he.</v>

419
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.610
<v Speaker 4>He straps dogs at the top of his car is </v>
<v Speaker 4>an evil,</v>

420
00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:49.660
<v Speaker 4>nasty guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

421
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was a big issue in the campaign is </v>

422
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:54.740
<v Speaker 4>dogs.</v>

423
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:54.740
<v Speaker 4>So there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>

424
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.710
<v Speaker 4>there was a story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's in the Boston Globe about </v>

425
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.051
<v Speaker 4>how like back in 1982,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went on a family vacation and when </v>

426
00:18:00.051 --> 00:18:03.501
<v Speaker 4>they're traveling he put the dog in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cage and put the dog on the top of his </v>

427
00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:03.501
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this was.</v>

428
00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 4>And this was like a big campaign issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

429
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.560
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember binders full of women </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you remember you remember 47 percent</v>

430
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.290
<v Speaker 4>number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right.</v>

431
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:15.291
<v Speaker 4>He's mean he hates the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hates what the binders full of women </v>

432
00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 4>thing was particularly stupid because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire point he was making is that I</v>

433
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:17.270
<v Speaker 4>was trying to recruit women to my </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration,</v>

434
00:18:17.271 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 4>so they'd bring binders full of female </v>
<v Speaker 4>resumes to me,</v>

435
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:25.130
<v Speaker 4>second staff moral women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they turned it into binders full of </v>

436
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.651
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like Hugh hefner and Mitt Romney </v>

437
00:18:27.651 --> 00:18:27.651
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

438
00:18:27.651 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 4>So this attempt to castigate the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>side is really bad and I think that you </v>

439
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 4>see some of that on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's more reactionary.</v>

440
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:37.521
<v Speaker 4>I think that that the unearned moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>superiority that the left likes to kind </v>

441
00:18:37.521 --> 00:18:40.641
<v Speaker 4>of wallow in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's more on the left </v>

442
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:42.871
<v Speaker 4>than on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although I think that there is an </v>

443
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:42.871
<v Speaker 4>attempt by some on the right now in </v>
<v Speaker 4>response to it to do some of that.</v>

444
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes these sticking points that </v>

445
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 3>you use to win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

446
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.651
<v Speaker 3>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes something that people </v>

447
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:50.651
<v Speaker 3>repeat over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

448
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:51.370
<v Speaker 3>like the deplorable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is this sexist,</v>

449
00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:52.180
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobe.</v>

450
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.930
<v Speaker 3>It's just what I was walking down New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York City down the street.</v>

451
00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right after trump won when they were </v>

452
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.180
<v Speaker 3>protesting and there was this guy right </v>
<v Speaker 3>next to me fucking screaming.</v>

453
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.760
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't even in the actual parade </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

454
00:19:03.761 --> 00:19:07.090
<v Speaker 3>He was like on the sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was screaming,</v>

455
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump KKK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

456
00:19:10.631 --> 00:19:12.320
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti gay.</v>

457
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Just boiled it down to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the best part about it was he saw a </v>

458
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.650
<v Speaker 3>black guy coming towards him and he just</v>
<v Speaker 3>started screaming black lives matter,</v>

459
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.240
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just,</v>

460
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him.</v>

461
00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:31.291
<v Speaker 3>I saw his soul like in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that one move shift to screaming </v>

462
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:32.920
<v Speaker 3>black lives banner when he saw a black </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

463
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the intersectionality for you,</v>

464
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:40.551
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to know how to appeal to every </v>

465
00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:40.551
<v Speaker 4>racial group on the basis of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stereotype.</v>

466
00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 4>It could have been Thomas Sowell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't have known.</v>

467
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like the laziness in having </v>

468
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.031
<v Speaker 3>the ability to communicate is one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But having the ability to express a </v>

469
00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:55.051
<v Speaker 3>complete thought that covers something </v>
<v Speaker 3>as nuanced and as complex as American </v>

470
00:19:55.421 --> 00:19:58.390
<v Speaker 3>politics in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's too hard.</v>

471
00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.170
<v Speaker 3>So let's just yell out Donald Trump KKK </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

472
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 3>this ability to like boil down what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between the left and the </v>

473
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.170
<v Speaker 3>right to like a little statement is or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

474
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.500
<v Speaker 3>a bucket of deplorable basket of </v>
<v Speaker 3>deplorables,</v>

475
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:12.520
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

476
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.280
<v Speaker 3>binders of women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so tempting because it's like,</v>

477
00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:18.550
<v Speaker 3>it's so powerful that it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could put it on the back of a bumper</v>

478
00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.220
<v Speaker 3>sticker.</v>

479
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 4>I think we've also been shaped a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit by a lot.</v>

480
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:22.940
<v Speaker 4>We all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all live in Hollywood.</v>

481
00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:27.941
<v Speaker 4>I mean you live in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in Hollywood that that means </v>

482
00:20:27.941 --> 00:20:27.941
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think all of America lives in that</v>

483
00:20:27.941 --> 00:20:29.540
<v Speaker 4>milieu because everyone watches tv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody watches movies,</v>

484
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.840
<v Speaker 4>so when we do politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we tend to see it through the prism of </v>

485
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.140
<v Speaker 4>house of cards or or any of the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>political movies you've ever seen.</v>

486
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.090
<v Speaker 4>And that means there's a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

487
00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:39.020
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bad guy.</v>

488
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.230
<v Speaker 4>The villain and the villain has to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't just be the villain is somebody</v>

489
00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:44.240
<v Speaker 4>who's incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like usually in politics,</v>

490
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 4>if somebody is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they have a level point of </v>

491
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 4>view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty rare.</v>

492
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 4>Usually it's somebody who's misguided </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it had some bad ideas.</v>

493
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 4>Usually they're just stupid or </v>
<v Speaker 4>incompetent.</v>

494
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Like this is what I keep saying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who oppose trump.</v>

495
00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Like why are you attributing to him </v>
<v Speaker 4>malice when stupidity would do like you </v>

496
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.100
<v Speaker 4>keep saying that everything trump is </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing is out of some sort of malicious </v>

497
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.100
<v Speaker 4>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are we watching the same film?</v>

498
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.320
<v Speaker 4>Like if you have a problem with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to have a solution for the </v>

499
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:10.320
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

500
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 4>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they really hate trump this much,</v>

501
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought Obama was a crappy president.</v>

502
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:17.641
<v Speaker 4>I have a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about we just minimize the power of </v>

503
00:21:17.641 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Washington DC and we don't have to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>a crap whose the president of the United</v>

504
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think anybody in 18,</v>

505
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:21.850
<v Speaker 4>32 really cared who the president was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had no impact on their lives.</v>

506
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 4>But now the presidency has this outsized</v>
<v Speaker 4>impact.</v>

507
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:27.060
<v Speaker 4>We care about Washington all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We treated them in.</v>

508
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 4>The truth is we watch it for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

509
00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last week,</v>

510
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 4>particularly with Scaramucci,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

511
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:34.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's impossible not to watch it for fun,</v>

512
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.670
<v Speaker 4>but it's actually kind of serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>

513
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 4>Like there are other world leaders who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are actually looking at this.</v>

514
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:41.350
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this impacts my nation for us.</v>

515
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:42.490
<v Speaker 4>We look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

516
00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what's on TV on tonight's </v>
<v Speaker 4>episode of trump the series.</v>

517
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say reduce the power of the </v>

518
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.861
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of people that </v>

519
00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:53.271
<v Speaker 3>would think that would be a great idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>because having one person has the </v>

520
00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:56.300
<v Speaker 3>authority over 300 plus million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of ridiculous this point in </v>

521
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.060
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how would you go about doing that?</v>

522
00:21:57.061 --> 00:21:59.250
<v Speaker 3>Like what would be the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>implement something like,</v>

523
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean it really isn't just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>presidents that you'd have to reduce the</v>

524
00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:03.570
<v Speaker 4>power of Congress as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you'd have to.</v>

525
00:22:03.571 --> 00:22:07.860
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to go back to a federalist </v>
<v Speaker 4>based system where localities and states</v>

526
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:13.130
<v Speaker 4>have more power over over local issues </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the federal government isn't that </v>

527
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.761
<v Speaker 4>powerful because what's happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically in the constitutional </v>

528
00:22:16.761 --> 00:22:20.031
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the federal government was never </v>

529
00:22:20.031 --> 00:22:20.031
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be anywhere near this big </v>
<v Speaker 4>right there.</v>

530
00:22:20.031 --> 00:22:21.900
<v Speaker 4>There are very certain delegated powers </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the constitution of the United States</v>

531
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.080
<v Speaker 4>that Congress has and they are very </v>
<v Speaker 4>small things like building post offices </v>

532
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.560
<v Speaker 4>and interstate roads and regulating </v>
<v Speaker 4>interstate commerce,</v>

533
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.090
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that they could regulate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

534
00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:35.091
<v Speaker 4>your toilet flushing is just silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the founders would have thought </v>

535
00:22:35.091 --> 00:22:38.571
<v Speaker 4>that was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet you have a federal government that </v>

536
00:22:38.571 --> 00:22:38.571
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's that big,</v>

537
00:22:38.571 --> 00:22:39.660
<v Speaker 4>so congress regulates on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're in Congress,</v>

538
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.030
<v Speaker 4>the last thing you want is to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>answerable for that.</v>

539
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.340
<v Speaker 4>So what you do instead is you drop vague</v>
<v Speaker 4>statutes,</v>

540
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say things like,</v>

541
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.870
<v Speaker 4>we hope that we're passing a law that </v>
<v Speaker 4>says that we should fix the environment,</v>

542
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:54.170
<v Speaker 4>and then you kick it over to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>executive branch and the executive </v>

543
00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:54.170
<v Speaker 4>branch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

544
00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.111
<v Speaker 4>run by president trump or president </v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama has a bunch of executive branch </v>

545
00:22:57.111 --> 00:23:00.471
<v Speaker 4>agencies like the EPA and the EPA puts </v>
<v Speaker 4>together all of these regulations that </v>

546
00:23:00.471 --> 00:23:00.471
<v Speaker 4>you've never seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never heard of.</v>

547
00:23:00.471 --> 00:23:05.391
<v Speaker 4>You never elected these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put together all the regulations </v>

548
00:23:05.391 --> 00:23:05.391
<v Speaker 4>and then those are the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually govern your lives.</v>

549
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.770
<v Speaker 4>So if you're in Congress and things go </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>

550
00:23:07.771 --> 00:23:08.160
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

551
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:13.190
<v Speaker 4>that's not what I meant to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told them to do good stuff and the </v>

552
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.190
<v Speaker 4>bureaucrats were not elected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't have to care.</v>

553
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.640
<v Speaker 4>So basically we have everyone kicking </v>
<v Speaker 4>the can to the other person for purposes</v>

554
00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:22.641
<v Speaker 4>of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way this is going to happen is </v>

555
00:23:22.641 --> 00:23:25.011
<v Speaker 4>if the American people just decide </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're sick of the federal government </v>

556
00:23:25.011 --> 00:23:27.800
<v Speaker 4>running all this stuff and they start </v>
<v Speaker 4>actively working to elect people who </v>

557
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.400
<v Speaker 4>want to minimize their own power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is difficult.</v>

558
00:23:29.401 --> 00:23:34.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people in power don't want to </v>

559
00:23:34.401 --> 00:23:34.401
<v Speaker 4>minimize their own power.</v>

560
00:23:34.401 --> 00:23:34.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems almost impossible.</v>

561
00:23:34.401 --> 00:23:38.900
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the one who's worked so </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to get to the top of the game is </v>

562
00:23:39.261 --> 00:23:39.480
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

563
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other way to do it is to elect </v>

564
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:44.780
<v Speaker 4>people on the state level who are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>zealous about their own authority.</v>

565
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.300
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've seen from like Greg Abbott in </v>

566
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.300
<v Speaker 4>Texas</v>

567
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.300
<v Speaker 2>that every so often he'll say to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federal government,</v>

568
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.490
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're telling me to do something.</v>

569
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Go screw yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

570
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.570
<v Speaker 2>what are you gonna do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

571
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Texas is a weird one though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're almost ready to leave,</v>

572
00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 2>like at any point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's related to put a fence up and go,</v>

573
00:23:59.091 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

574
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 2>weren't there for the longest time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

575
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:05.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were not really a state right now.</v>

576
00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.040
<v Speaker 2>They're still called the Republic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

577
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that so yeah,</v>

578
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it didn't.</v>

579
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

580
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:15.860
<v Speaker 2>When you drive through Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single store is called lone star,</v>

581
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:21.790
<v Speaker 2>lone star brewery or Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This everything is named after the </v>

582
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.671
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nothing is really named after the </v>

583
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:24.671
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all named after the state.</v>

584
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:27.731
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of state pride in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of state pride maybe more </v>

585
00:24:27.731 --> 00:24:27.731
<v Speaker 2>than any place else I've ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

586
00:24:27.731 --> 00:24:32.261
<v Speaker 2>well not a lot of state pride in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California because everybody's a </v>

587
00:24:32.261 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 2>transplant and it also like some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

588
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.480
<v Speaker 2>people who got here and it represents </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they always wanted some </v>

589
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.681
<v Speaker 2>sort of a liberal paradise where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could get famous for doing nothing.</v>

590
00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.010
<v Speaker 2>There's some city pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's Hollywood pride,</v>

591
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.780
<v Speaker 2>San Jose Pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like California pride.</v>

592
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people who run the state are </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiots.</v>

593
00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Will California so confused?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have a grizzly bear on our </v>

594
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.060
<v Speaker 2>flag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have Chrisley bears.</v>

595
00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.420
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a team called the Los Angeles </v>

596
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Lakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lake in the state.</v>

597
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Our lakes are all manmade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to keep pumping water in because</v>

598
00:25:03.751 --> 00:25:08.751
<v Speaker 2>they fucking dry up a river is just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant concrete ravine over is hilarious.</v>

599
00:25:10.671 --> 00:25:13.000
<v Speaker 2>When I've shown people the La River,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fest,</v>

600
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:13.720
<v Speaker 2>La River,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

601
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.360
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

602
00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:18.300
<v Speaker 2>The Romantic river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

603
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:18.670
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

604
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.130
<v Speaker 2>The La River.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is la.</v>

605
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:27.131
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking concrete shitty slide for</v>
<v Speaker 2>water and that the city is so dirty.</v>

606
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like I've grown up my entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>life here.</v>

607
00:25:32.181 --> 00:25:37.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was born in Burbank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up in north Hollywood like this is </v>

608
00:25:37.181 --> 00:25:37.181
<v Speaker 2>that I've lived here my entire life.</v>

609
00:25:37.181 --> 00:25:41.440
<v Speaker 2>The first time I realized I liked it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I moved to Boston for law school </v>

610
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:41.440
<v Speaker 2>because at least the weather here is </v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

611
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.770
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's gotten so shabby lately.</v>

612
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.260
<v Speaker 2>It's such a shabby city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weather's amazing,</v>

613
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been to Mexico City?</v>

614
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been a couple times for UFC events.</v>

615
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:55.031
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going back because I would get </v>
<v Speaker 2>headaches from the pollution in Mexico </v>

616
00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:00.070
<v Speaker 2>City to me is like Ellie in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with zero respect for the traffic </v>

617
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 2>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I mean zero,</v>

618
00:26:01.521 --> 00:26:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

619
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.860
<v Speaker 2>They're very nice people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's worried about getting </v>

620
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.811
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find Mexican people to be some of the </v>

621
00:26:10.811 --> 00:26:11.840
<v Speaker 2>nicest people and real friendly and easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get along with,</v>

622
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 2>but they don't give a fuck about traffic</v>
<v Speaker 2>lights.</v>

623
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.780
<v Speaker 2>When we were stuck in traffic was bumper</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bumper and it's a green light going </v>

624
00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.740
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cars just go in front of you and they </v>

625
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.991
<v Speaker 2>just sort of make their way through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people hit the brakes and they make </v>

626
00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:30.341
<v Speaker 2>their way through the intersection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a straight up red light and they </v>

627
00:26:30.341 --> 00:26:31.650
<v Speaker 2>just go and it's not just one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy goes and another guy goes behind</v>

628
00:26:31.651 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 2>them and then he got like 20 cars and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just gridlock.</v>

629
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.140
<v Speaker 2>It's actually indicative of why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States works,</v>

630
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 2>that people actually follow traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>

631
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.230
<v Speaker 2>like it's true in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also true in Israel,</v>

632
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 4>like when I visited Israel with my wife </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we got married,</v>

633
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.380
<v Speaker 4>like no one pays attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>traffic rules.</v>

634
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.970
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's honking their horns at each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

635
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

636
00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.040
<v Speaker 4>why are these people so rude all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time?</v>

637
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.800
<v Speaker 4>Mom honked the horn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

638
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 4>but it is why in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we have a baseline,</v>

639
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.140
<v Speaker 4>this is what I think is breaking down </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

640
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 4>so not to get too deep on a point about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexican city traffic,</v>

641
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:05.150
<v Speaker 4>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

642
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.430
<v Speaker 4>the country was based on this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a social fabric.</v>

643
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:13.431
<v Speaker 4>We all have respect for each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough that we're going to follow the </v>

644
00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:13.800
<v Speaker 4>basic rules of the game and that's true </v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as traffic lights,</v>

645
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 4>it's true as far as financial dealings </v>
<v Speaker 4>with one another and when you lose that,</v>

646
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 4>when you lose the basic respect for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who lives next to you,</v>

647
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to get through the red light in</v>

648
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 4>a screw him.</v>

649
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.500
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if it's red,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's kind of indicative of a </v>

650
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.831
<v Speaker 4>culture in collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Generally when small rules start to go </v>

651
00:27:30.831 --> 00:27:31.220
<v Speaker 4>broken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in Italy,</v>

652
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.500
<v Speaker 4>in Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that 50 percent of their economies </v>

653
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:36.500
<v Speaker 4>black market because they have high tax </v>
<v Speaker 4>rates and no one pays them.</v>

654
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:41.450
<v Speaker 4>You're starting to set in California to </v>
<v Speaker 4>California is the highest taxes in the </v>

655
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:44.301
<v Speaker 4>country by far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We also have the number one rate of </v>

656
00:27:44.301 --> 00:27:47.061
<v Speaker 4>deductions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we pass all these high Texas so we </v>

657
00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:49.161
<v Speaker 4>can congratulate ourselves for social </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice and then we avoid all the taxes </v>

658
00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 4>as much as we possibly can for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>accountants.</v>

659
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

660
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people are making on a fricking </v>

661
00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.080
<v Speaker 4>fortune.</v>

662
00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just also feel like when you get a </v>

663
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.280
<v Speaker 5>giant number of people smashed into a </v>
<v Speaker 5>small area and La,</v>

664
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:05.300
<v Speaker 5>it's not even a small area includes </v>
<v Speaker 5>Greater Orange County and it goes into </v>

665
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Speaker 5>the Conejo valley and it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many of us,</v>

666
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:12.290
<v Speaker 5>there's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like you get that sort of </v>

667
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.711
<v Speaker 5>diffusion of responsibility thing where </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just too many people to care </v>

668
00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Speaker 5>about and you lose this feeling of value</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you have for fellow people.</v>

669
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.260
<v Speaker 5>I lived in boulder for a little while </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when I lived there,</v>

670
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 5>the People's Republic of Boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to talk about lefties?</v>

671
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:25.920
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

672
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:28.950
<v Speaker 5>If you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you had a right wing anything on your</v>

673
00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:31.020
<v Speaker 5>lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a sign for someone running for,</v>

674
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 5>they would take it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They literally take things down,</v>

675
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:39.350
<v Speaker 5>but when I was there I was amazed at how</v>
<v Speaker 5>many people are polite when they drive </v>

676
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.000
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wave and like there's only 100,000</v>

677
00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:42.150
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

678
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.210
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

679
00:28:43.211 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I was gonna send me.</v>

680
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:45.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking it up while we're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

681
00:28:45.101 --> 00:28:46.480
<v Speaker 4>It's like 110,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in.</v>

682
00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:49.480
<v Speaker 4>The other population of La County is 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million people.</v>

683
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

684
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.970
<v Speaker 5>plus Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotTa Count Mexicans and then you </v>

685
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.651
<v Speaker 5>got account.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's connected to all the other </v>

686
00:28:58.651 --> 00:28:58.651
<v Speaker 5>counties around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like there's some</v>

687
00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:00.780
<v Speaker 4>border and we just drive around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly right.</v>

688
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 4>So it is in the first time I visited </v>
<v Speaker 4>Oklahoma,</v>

689
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 4>I had this and I was in Oklahoma for </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing radio show.</v>

690
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.360
<v Speaker 5>When you look at the 23 point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$7 million.</v>

691
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

692
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

693
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:16.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean Oklahoma and I'm walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 4>street and the first thing that and and </v>

694
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 4>just some lady and I catch eyes now in </v>
<v Speaker 4>La,</v>

695
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:18.810
<v Speaker 4>you're from La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look away,</v>

696
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:20.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You only got stabbed in others.</v>

697
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 4>If you catch eyes with somebody you </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet,</v>

698
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:27.921
<v Speaker 4>it's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't catch eyes with people at La </v>

699
00:29:27.921 --> 00:29:27.921
<v Speaker 4>and among that street we catch eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lady Goes,</v>

700
00:29:27.921 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Speaker 4>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called my father.</v>

701
00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:29.710
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

702
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.620
<v Speaker 4>Where am I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on here?</v>

703
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:36.621
<v Speaker 4>Like this is not regular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do think that there is something </v>

704
00:29:36.621 --> 00:29:36.621
<v Speaker 4>to the idea that if you have too many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in too small a space,</v>

705
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:42.050
<v Speaker 4>we're all up in each other's business so</v>
<v Speaker 4>much that it's very hard to say to </v>

706
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:42.050
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

707
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 4>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stay away from one another,</v>

708
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.740
<v Speaker 4>leave each other alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

709
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:49.741
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he lives next door and he's a </v>

710
00:29:49.741 --> 00:29:49.741
<v Speaker 4>jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hate that guy because he's like,</v>

711
00:29:49.741 --> 00:29:53.340
<v Speaker 4>right next to you run Oklahoma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy next to you is three miles down </v>

712
00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:53.340
<v Speaker 4>the road.</v>

713
00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:53.340
<v Speaker 3>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also,</v>

714
00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:58.071
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been replicated in rat population </v>

715
00:29:58.071 --> 00:29:59.160
<v Speaker 3>density studies that you get more mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>illness,</v>

716
00:29:59.161 --> 00:30:04.161
<v Speaker 3>you get more weird aggressive behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they stack rats in these cubicles </v>

717
00:30:05.431 --> 00:30:07.680
<v Speaker 3>and then jam them closer and closer </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

718
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:13.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what's happening with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to what Manhattan is famous for </v>

719
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.010
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

720
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:17.451
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy visiting Manhattan and every </v>

721
00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:17.451
<v Speaker 3>time I'm there I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

722
00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't live here.</v>

723
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too many</v>

724
00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.160
<v Speaker 4>when I was there last week and I liked </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sky.</v>

725
00:30:21.161 --> 00:30:23.350
<v Speaker 4>So you can't actually see the sky in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Manhattan,</v>

726
00:30:23.351 --> 00:30:28.351
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you just see the brick buildings </v>

727
00:30:28.351 --> 00:30:28.351
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 stories high.</v>

728
00:30:28.351 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 4>And I noticed that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were walking past the store and there</v>

729
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:33.310
<v Speaker 4>was a shirt on sale and the shirts </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire tax was after you.</v>

730
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:36.100
<v Speaker 4>You effing F and I thought only in New </v>
<v Speaker 4>York could you sell this,</v>

731
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

732
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 4>you try to take this anywhere else and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people would have been like,</v>

733
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what now?</v>

734
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 4>But New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that the best seller.</v>

735
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.450
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honestly I think it's one of the reasons</v>

736
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 4>why trump won is because he's basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>just a guy from New York.</v>

737
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.300
<v Speaker 4>He's like a taxi driver from New York is</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

738
00:30:49.301 --> 00:30:52.840
<v Speaker 4>really wealthy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does what a taxi driver from New York</v>

739
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:54.010
<v Speaker 4>we do if you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really wealthy.</v>

740
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.560
<v Speaker 4>He marries models and builds gold </v>
<v Speaker 4>toilets and all this kind of stuff.</v>

741
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 4>And people in the rest of the country </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually take that language seriously.</v>

742
00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:02.520
<v Speaker 4>So when he says stuff like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to bomb the shit out of him,</v>

743
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in New York like,</v>

744
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:04.660
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we do,</v>

745
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people in Oklahoma like,</v>

746
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.600
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's serious.</v>

747
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.930
<v Speaker 4>Like that's actually gonna happen and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably not probably that's just </v>

748
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.920
<v Speaker 4>how people from New York we saw this </v>
<v Speaker 4>last week,</v>

749
00:31:14.921 --> 00:31:19.921
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's talking about the cops and he was </v>

750
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:21.301
<v Speaker 4>saying this thing about covering their </v>
<v Speaker 4>heads before he's talking like a long </v>

751
00:31:21.301 --> 00:31:21.301
<v Speaker 4>island or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about like,</v>

752
00:31:21.301 --> 00:31:21.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

753
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:26.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they throw him in the back of the paddy </v>

754
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.630
<v Speaker 4>wagon and we do all the and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you don't put your head on that it,</v>

755
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:27.310
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they bumped their head,</v>

756
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:28.030
<v Speaker 4>they just killed somebody.</v>

757
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 4>And so the entire meeting went and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>dare he.</v>

758
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 4>He's talking about how cops should rub </v>
<v Speaker 4>people up.</v>

759
00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:37.201
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it appropriate for the president of </v>

760
00:31:37.201 --> 00:31:37.201
<v Speaker 4>the United States to talk like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>about treatment of suspects know is,</v>

761
00:31:37.201 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 4>are we supposed to take this super </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously?</v>

762
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.620
<v Speaker 4>Like this is like trump is actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>recommending a policy change with regard</v>

763
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:43.360
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he does.</v>

764
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.680
<v Speaker 4>He works the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>

765
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 4>he's a New York real estate guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>works the room and more than anything </v>

766
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.501
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you understand New York and you </v>

767
00:31:52.501 --> 00:31:52.501
<v Speaker 4>understand La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you understand trump.</v>

768
00:31:52.501 --> 00:31:52.501
<v Speaker 4>He's not a giant mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

769
00:31:52.501 --> 00:31:54.960
<v Speaker 4>He's just any other reality TV star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a reality.</v>

770
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:56.590
<v Speaker 4>He's a marketing image guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

771
00:31:56.591 --> 00:31:57.280
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what he does.</v>

772
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Like he's not even that great at real </v>
<v Speaker 4>estate.</v>

773
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.580
<v Speaker 4>He puts his name on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He brands himself,</v>

774
00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:01.930
<v Speaker 4>he puts his name on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 4>buildings.</v>

775
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:07.020
<v Speaker 4>They pay him not to be involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>real estate business so they can put </v>

776
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.020
<v Speaker 4>trump on the side of his hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

777
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what he does.</v>

778
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.270
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm kind of shocked that he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kinda crappy at the imaging.</v>

779
00:32:10.271 --> 00:32:11.350
<v Speaker 4>As far as being a president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't.</v>

780
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.970
<v Speaker 4>You'd imagine that you'd be better at </v>
<v Speaker 4>this part of it.</v>

781
00:32:12.971 --> 00:32:13.300
<v Speaker 4>At least.</v>

782
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.560
<v Speaker 3>I just think he didn't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>volume of hate that was going to come </v>

783
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.920
<v Speaker 3>his way and I think he's such an </v>
<v Speaker 3>EGOMANIAC.</v>

784
00:32:19.921 --> 00:32:24.921
<v Speaker 3>He has a hard time dealing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess a hard time separating and </v>

785
00:32:24.921 --> 00:32:28.251
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that I've read </v>
<v Speaker 3>about him that he's getting better at </v>

786
00:32:28.251 --> 00:32:29.400
<v Speaker 3>getting away from the comments and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading comments on twitter,</v>

787
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.910
<v Speaker 3>but he fucking blocks people know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

788
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.200
<v Speaker 3>Too many sued him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

789
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Well there's people at Book Group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people suing them and now they're </v>

790
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 3>actually starting to rule against public</v>
<v Speaker 3>people</v>

791
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
<v Speaker 5>who are in the public light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Being able to block citizens and having </v>

792
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 5>their own opinion about what this </v>
<v Speaker 5>person's doing or not doing.</v>

793
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.750
<v Speaker 5>So then you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well are you allowed to be vulgar </v>

794
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.750
<v Speaker 5>towards the president?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

795
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 5>how far does that go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

796
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 5>what are you allowed to say?</v>

797
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe it usually be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the hell you want about </v>

798
00:32:59.760 --> 00:32:59.760
<v Speaker 4>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you can't threaten them,</v>

799
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.780
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does go more to the level of,</v>

800
00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.290
<v Speaker 4>of pettiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the most powerful man on the planet</v>

801
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.660
<v Speaker 4>is busy blocking people on twitter at </v>
<v Speaker 4>3:00</v>

802
00:33:07.661 --> 00:33:12.180
<v Speaker 4>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Scarborough and what is her name was</v>

803
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.080
<v Speaker 4>facing.</v>

804
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.870
<v Speaker 5>He was saying that she should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the fucking president.</v>

805
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:22.050
<v Speaker 5>He's saying she showed up with bloody </v>
<v Speaker 5>scars or she was bleeding from her </v>

806
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:22.650
<v Speaker 5>recent facelift.</v>

807
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.700
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's first of all,</v>

808
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.140
<v Speaker 4>it turns out that it probably wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>

809
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 4>but second it wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

810
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.270
<v Speaker 4>fuck goes out when you're bleeding it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

811
00:33:31.271 --> 00:33:32.440
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's it.</v>

812
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.920
<v Speaker 4>But this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote a piece about it in national </v>

813
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:37.920
<v Speaker 4>review about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

814
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.340
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say that the level of hatred </v>

815
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.781
<v Speaker 4>directed toward trump is warping trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's also a warping some </v>

816
00:33:42.781 --> 00:33:45.841
<v Speaker 4>people on my side of the aisle who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are so interested in the fight that </v>

817
00:33:45.841 --> 00:33:48.100
<v Speaker 4>they're less interested in advancing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>policies that I'd like to see achieved.</v>

818
00:33:48.101 --> 00:33:49.780
<v Speaker 4>So I think there's a whole group of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people where,</v>

819
00:33:49.781 --> 00:33:51.370
<v Speaker 4>let's say that trump would just resign </v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow.</v>

820
00:33:51.371 --> 00:33:52.210
<v Speaker 4>He'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I've had at,</v>

821
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:57.270
<v Speaker 4>screw it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm out and Mike Pence becomes </v>

822
00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.071
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Mike Pence proceeds to do all </v>

823
00:33:59.071 --> 00:33:59.071
<v Speaker 4>the things conservatives want them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

824
00:33:59.071 --> 00:34:02.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get tax reform and we limit </v>

825
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:02.520
<v Speaker 4>immigration and we do all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

826
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.940
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he does not tweet about Mika </v>

827
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Speaker 4>Brzezinski bloody face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a whole group of people </v>

828
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Speaker 4>on the right will be pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That miss it.</v>

829
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that right now because it's fun.</v>

830
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.680
<v Speaker 4>What exactly what they want is somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>who pisses off the left more than beats.</v>

831
00:34:14.681 --> 00:34:16.990
<v Speaker 4>The left pisses them off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you piss off the left.</v>

832
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.960
<v Speaker 4>I think Obama sort of trialed some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right into insanity.</v>

833
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.610
<v Speaker 4>I think there are a lot of people on our</v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

834
00:34:21.611 --> 00:34:23.770
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like this jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

835
00:34:23.771 --> 00:34:25.720
<v Speaker 4>he keeps saying things just to Piss us </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

836
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.840
<v Speaker 4>And Obama did do some of that and so pro</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump is kind of a twitter troll and so </v>

837
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.030
<v Speaker 4>he does the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

838
00:34:31.031 --> 00:34:32.380
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>

839
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.410
<v Speaker 4>Like two days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump or yesterday,</v>

840
00:34:35.411 --> 00:34:38.080
<v Speaker 4>there was a report that trump said that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he thinks the White House's shabby.</v>

841
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Now I can say is somebody on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative right my entire life.</v>

842
00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:46.081
<v Speaker 4>If Obama said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would not let him forget that for </v>

843
00:34:46.081 --> 00:34:46.081
<v Speaker 4>1000 years that the White House is </v>
<v Speaker 4>shabby.</v>

844
00:34:46.081 --> 00:34:50.041
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an ass move to say the people's </v>

845
00:34:50.041 --> 00:34:50.050
<v Speaker 4>house is shit first of all to mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

846
00:34:50.051 --> 00:34:51.220
<v Speaker 4>Like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And second of all,</v>

847
00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.550
<v Speaker 4>this is the most iconic building on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>face of the planet is,</v>

848
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's shabby.</v>

849
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.890
<v Speaker 4>How is it chat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was he saying?</v>

850
00:34:56.891 --> 00:34:58.170
<v Speaker 4>It was shabby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said.</v>

851
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.070
<v Speaker 4>He said they were asking him why he gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>his visits,</v>

852
00:35:00.071 --> 00:35:01.990
<v Speaker 4>his golf courses so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

853
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:02.560
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because?</v>

854
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.680
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because my golf courses are nicer </v>

855
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.301
<v Speaker 4>because the White House has shabby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are people in the right for </v>

856
00:35:09.301 --> 00:35:09.301
<v Speaker 4>like five and it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

857
00:35:09.301 --> 00:35:10.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least he's trolling the left.</v>

858
00:35:10.391 --> 00:35:15.391
<v Speaker 4>At least it's ticking them off and say </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys ticking off the left is not a </v>

859
00:35:15.391 --> 00:35:18.571
<v Speaker 4>substitute for defeating the left if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually care about the feeding the </v>

860
00:35:18.571 --> 00:35:21.211
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is one of the things that </v>

861
00:35:21.211 --> 00:35:21.211
<v Speaker 4>drives me nuts because my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

862
00:35:21.211 --> 00:35:22.740
<v Speaker 4>my life goal has been to promulgate </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular ideas,</v>

863
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:27.770
<v Speaker 4>not just to piss off the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that in the fight there are </v>

864
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.841
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people who have fallen into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trap of thinking these two things are </v>

865
00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:30.841
<v Speaker 4>identical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

866
00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:30.841
<v Speaker 4>You piss off the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means you're winning.</v>

867
00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:33.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like no pissing off the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe part of it,</v>

868
00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:38.461
<v Speaker 4>but that's not how you win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You win by saying things that are true </v>

869
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:38.461
<v Speaker 4>and if they get pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get</v>

870
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:38.461
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My good friend,</v>

871
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:43.451
<v Speaker 3>Bill Byrd did this piece about Obama </v>
<v Speaker 3>back when Obama was mocking trump and </v>

872
00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:49.570
<v Speaker 3>saying the one thing that I am that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll never be the president of United </v>

873
00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:49.580
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crowd went nuts.</v>

874
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Remember when he did that and Obama was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying this on stage and you see trump </v>

875
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.510
<v Speaker 3>in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boiling was big frog.</v>

876
00:35:56.511 --> 00:36:01.511
<v Speaker 3>Double Chin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sitting there eating it all and </v>

877
00:36:01.511 --> 00:36:02.240
<v Speaker 3>that fucking stuck in his craw.</v>

878
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.630
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole story that came out from</v>

879
00:36:04.631 --> 00:36:07.840
<v Speaker 4>buzzfeed about his interaction with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy named Mckay coppins,</v>

880
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.800
<v Speaker 4>a reporter for buzzfeed in which was </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically like saying to trump like,</v>

881
00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:12.850
<v Speaker 4>you're a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to run.</v>

882
00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:18.540
<v Speaker 4>I think trump ran just to just because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was sick of people telling him that </v>

883
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.200
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't going to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think that's.</v>

884
00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 4>That's half of what drives him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that he can't do the </v>

885
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope he does do good things.</v>

886
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.141
<v Speaker 4>He's the president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't every president to do things I </v>

887
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:30.031
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know he's going to have to get </v>

888
00:36:30.031 --> 00:36:31.600
<v Speaker 4>it under control a little bit because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was willing to keep the MOOC.</v>

889
00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Mooc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the MOOC was only ousted because.</v>

890
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Kelly and the MOOC is.</v>

891
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.090
<v Speaker 4>Was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did the MOOC say?</v>

892
00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:40.750
<v Speaker 4>What was this was about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

893
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.280
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>About him performing.</v>

894
00:36:42.281 --> 00:36:47.281
<v Speaker 4>It asks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would he think that he could say </v>

895
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:47.281
<v Speaker 4>that once he's in the office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

896
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:47.281
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking to see Ben and could even</v>

897
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:47.770
<v Speaker 4>possibly do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

898
00:36:47.771 --> 00:36:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Ban is not that flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know Steve That's not,</v>

899
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Speaker 4>that's not something repertoire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a giant</v>

900
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.730
<v Speaker 3>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

901
00:36:54.731 --> 00:36:59.731
<v Speaker 3>Just the idea that he would think he </v>
<v Speaker 3>must be emboldened by the fact that </v>

902
00:36:59.731 --> 00:36:59.731
<v Speaker 3>trump has said</v>

903
00:36:59.731 --> 00:37:00.430
<v Speaker 4>so many outrageous things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

904
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean there were reports from the New </v>
<v Speaker 4>York Post that,</v>

905
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.450
<v Speaker 4>that he actually had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The trump liked it,</v>

906
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 4>that all that happened is that there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much blow back that he had to replace</v>

907
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:09.690
<v Speaker 4>Kelly Kelly in there and Kelly's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do this,</v>

908
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:10.740
<v Speaker 4>and trump's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

909
00:37:10.741 --> 00:37:14.430
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't it seem more crazy to fire a</v>

910
00:37:14.431 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 4>guy after 10 days and it does to sit him</v>
<v Speaker 4>down and say,</v>

911
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't say that again.</v>

912
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.670
<v Speaker 4>You would think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

913
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.840
<v Speaker 4>let's move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they should've done the next</v>

914
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.510
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is he.</v>

915
00:37:22.511 --> 00:37:27.511
<v Speaker 4>He'd been doing it for a week at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>point and he was out there like saying </v>

916
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:30.141
<v Speaker 4>that Ryan priebus was leaking on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>president and was an enemy of the </v>

917
00:37:30.141 --> 00:37:32.691
<v Speaker 4>president for a week and you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he was gonna get him fired and at </v>

918
00:37:32.691 --> 00:37:32.691
<v Speaker 4>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember,</v>

919
00:37:32.691 --> 00:37:36.741
<v Speaker 4>this is the same week that trump himself</v>
<v Speaker 4>is tweeting out that attorney general </v>

920
00:37:36.741 --> 00:37:37.260
<v Speaker 4>sessions who is his most loyal supporter</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a year and a half,</v>

921
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.090
<v Speaker 4>that that guy is like a trader.</v>

922
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:44.150
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that he wishes he would go away </v>

923
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.150
<v Speaker 4>because he recused himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

924
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.570
<v Speaker 4>trump can fire any of these people at </v>
<v Speaker 4>any time.</v>

925
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:50.571
<v Speaker 4>Like this is very passive aggressive for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy who made his living saying you're </v>

926
00:37:50.571 --> 00:37:53.661
<v Speaker 4>fired on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that all the people that </v>

927
00:37:53.661 --> 00:37:56.541
<v Speaker 4>trump has fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been fired actually through </v>

928
00:37:56.541 --> 00:37:56.541
<v Speaker 4>surrogates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

929
00:37:56.541 --> 00:37:56.541
<v Speaker 4>But Mike Flynn resigned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

930
00:37:56.541 --> 00:38:00.560
<v Speaker 4>James Comey was fired basically through </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rod Rosenstein and sessions and then </v>

931
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Rosenstein had to recuse himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is how you get the special counsel</v>

932
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.400
<v Speaker 4>and Comi found out on television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>TV,</v>

933
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:08.210
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Emissary to go to La and,</v>

934
00:38:08.211 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Speaker 4>and give them a letter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like everyone,</v>

935
00:38:10.261 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 4>he fires has to be fired in the most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roundabout.</v>

936
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that trump actually this,</v>

937
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I think the dirty little secret is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure trump actually looks firing</v>

938
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:16.830
<v Speaker 4>people and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

939
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:18.230
<v Speaker 4>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he kinda like toward,</v>

940
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:23.260
<v Speaker 4>at any handling torturing people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not sure that he actually likes </v>

941
00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:23.260
<v Speaker 4>firing them.</v>

942
00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he doesn't like people being mad </v>
<v Speaker 3>at him face to face.</v>

943
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.960
<v Speaker 3>I think he wants them to love him in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of his face.</v>

944
00:38:27.961 --> 00:38:29.780
<v Speaker 3>So like when he's not there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

945
00:38:29.781 --> 00:38:33.690
<v Speaker 3>you can make a phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>firearm jetson and hang up the phone and</v>

946
00:38:33.691 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to actually see the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants</v>

947
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.320
<v Speaker 2>that guy to like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

948
00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall me thing was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre because it was like,</v>

949
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>

950
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Like there's this guy is looking into </v>
<v Speaker 2>improprieties and you can just say,</v>

951
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that anymore.</v>

952
00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 2>You're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't look into the things I've done</v>

953
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was eight.</v>

954
00:38:53.021 --> 00:38:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he did it was the stupid part.</v>

955
00:38:54.671 --> 00:38:56.980
<v Speaker 2>So I was calling for me to be fired </v>
<v Speaker 2>since last year.</v>

956
00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:01.981
<v Speaker 2>I thought the way he handled the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary thing from beginning to end was </v>

957
00:39:01.981 --> 00:39:04.261
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that trump should have </v>

958
00:39:04.261 --> 00:39:04.261
<v Speaker 2>replaced him before he became basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>day one.</v>

959
00:39:04.261 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Here's my new cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call me.</v>

960
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.220
<v Speaker 2>You did a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

961
00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 2>usher him out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing somebody new.</v>

962
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:13.320
<v Speaker 2>He kept him around and then the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing he said to Komi you remember was </v>

963
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:13.320
<v Speaker 2>when you met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

964
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 2>you're more famous than I am.</v>

965
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when trump says that to you,</v>

966
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 2>that's the writing on the wall right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

967
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.770
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true,</v>

968
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.920
<v Speaker 2>but second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe there was also a part of </v>

969
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:25.920
<v Speaker 2>the problem was a comb is a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

970
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.340
<v Speaker 2>The trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he?</v>

971
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

972
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:28.420
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

973
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:29.140
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>96.</v>

974
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Get giant dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Towered over.</v>

975
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Crossing is such a comedy and call </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying he was trying to hide in the </v>

976
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.511
<v Speaker 2>curtains to avoid trump saying he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>see Herman Munster over there hiding in </v>

977
00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:43.300
<v Speaker 2>the we're now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you enjoying the show?</v>

978
00:39:43.511 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I didn't think that nuclear war was a</v>

979
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:51.541
<v Speaker 2>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I see a fucking Korean missile </v>

980
00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:51.541
<v Speaker 2>headed our way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be pissed.</v>

981
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:57.210
<v Speaker 2>When colby was handling the email thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what specifically did you not like about</v>

982
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I thought it was was crazy was when</v>

983
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:04.250
<v Speaker 2>he restarted or reopen the case because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Houma,</v>

984
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:08.790
<v Speaker 2>having used her cruiser with Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wiener's,</v>

985
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not enough.</v>

986
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Like that seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The deleting the emails to me seemed </v>

987
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:20.971
<v Speaker 2>like I had Mike Baker on from the CIA </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said essentially anyone else </v>

988
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.500
<v Speaker 2>would be in jail for what she did for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

989
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.400
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

990
00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

991
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 2>call me if this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he screwed it up and then he really </v>

992
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 2>screwed it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he originally said publicly,</v>

993
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.630
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to prosecute Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>

994
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.820
<v Speaker 2>He was doing something he didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the authority to do.</v>

995
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.040
<v Speaker 2>The FBI does not decide whether to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecute people.</v>

996
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.280
<v Speaker 2>They refer the information to the DOJ </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the DOJ decides whether to </v>

997
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:41.280
<v Speaker 2>prosecute people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Attorney General,</v>

998
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Loretta Lynch's decision whether to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecute or not.</v>

999
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 2>The statute itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1000
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The statute itself did not say,</v>

1001
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:52.050
<v Speaker 2>do you have intent to commit espionage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have intent to to make classified</v>

1002
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 2>secrets public or expose them to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of being made.</v>

1003
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Public intent is not an element of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>

1004
00:40:57.251 --> 00:40:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do it,</v>

1005
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my wife as a doctor,</v>

1006
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.490
<v Speaker 2>and that means that she is under hipaa </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirements.</v>

1007
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.200
<v Speaker 2>There is no element under hippa that </v>
<v Speaker 2>says that if she reveals somebody,</v>

1008
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:12.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proprietary medical information by </v>

1009
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.470
<v Speaker 2>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's no intent,</v>

1010
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.880
<v Speaker 2>so she's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not part of the statute.</v>

1011
00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:17.881
<v Speaker 2>If she brings some of these medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>records out to her car and somebody </v>

1012
00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:17.881
<v Speaker 2>steals the medical records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1013
00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 2>if she's working at the va or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a crime.</v>

1014
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:21.280
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if she intended to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and just left it in her purse.</v>

1015
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.850
<v Speaker 2>So Komi read the element of intense into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crime to get hillary off.</v>

1016
00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 2>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1017
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to prosecute this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to leave it alone.</v>

1018
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.620
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't have intervened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

1019
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Remember he made an entire case </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically for why she should be </v>

1020
00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:34.690
<v Speaker 2>prosecuted and then at the end he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>

1021
00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:34.850
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

1022
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:39.851
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He also said we're going to keep </v>

1023
00:41:39.851 --> 00:41:39.851
<v Speaker 4>Congress updated on any future </v>
<v Speaker 4>development.</v>

1024
00:41:39.851 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 4>Well you get to October and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>future development.</v>

1025
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:46.931
<v Speaker 4>They found this laptop with all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>information on it with new emails from </v>

1026
00:41:46.931 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton that they haven't seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

1027
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:52.750
<v Speaker 4>and now he has an obligation to inform </v>
<v Speaker 4>Congress because he told them that he </v>

1028
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.331
<v Speaker 4>would and so he screwed the pooch again </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's afraid that if he doesn't </v>

1029
00:41:55.331 --> 00:41:57.560
<v Speaker 4>reveal that information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary goes on to win and then it comes</v>

1030
00:41:57.561 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something criminal.</v>

1031
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Then people are going to blame him for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary winning and putting a criminal </v>

1032
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:03.880
<v Speaker 4>and the White House since they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1033
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.160
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be fully transparent.</v>

1034
00:42:04.161 --> 00:42:06.920
<v Speaker 4>I have to honor my institution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to put this out there.</v>

1035
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then hillary loses and now he screwed up</v>

1036
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:15.281
<v Speaker 4>twice and then he gets into the White </v>
<v Speaker 4>House and now he's supposed to be </v>

1037
00:42:15.281 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 4>investigating the trump Russia stuff at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same time,</v>

1038
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 4>so now he's investigating basically both</v>
<v Speaker 4>candidates in the 2016 election.</v>

1039
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:25.750
<v Speaker 4>He handled this the wrong way every step</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the way because he was so focused on </v>

1040
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:30.550
<v Speaker 4>what will uphold the integrity of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>FBI and the integrity of the </v>

1041
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 4>investigation and the integrity of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>DOJ.</v>

1042
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.260
<v Speaker 4>He was less worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1043
00:42:33.261 --> 00:42:34.340
<v Speaker 4>what do I actually have to do under the </v>
<v Speaker 4>law?</v>

1044
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:39.341
<v Speaker 4>What's my obligation under the law is </v>
<v Speaker 4>obligation under the law is to shut us </v>

1045
00:42:39.341 --> 00:42:39.341
<v Speaker 4>pie hole and the information over to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lynch.</v>

1046
00:42:39.341 --> 00:42:40.280
<v Speaker 4>If Lynch wanted to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigation,</v>

1047
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 4>let her do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in a sense trump was right and saying</v>

1048
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:44.840
<v Speaker 4>that he's a grandstander yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1049
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that part was right,</v>

1050
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 4>but that the problem remember was not </v>
<v Speaker 4>the firing of Comey.</v>

1051
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.170
<v Speaker 4>It was the two days after he fired </v>
<v Speaker 4>comey,</v>

1052
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:55.580
<v Speaker 4>he went to Lester Holt on NBC and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said the reason I fired Columbia was not</v>

1053
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.130
<v Speaker 4>all the excuses I gave about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hillary stuff.</v>

1054
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.340
<v Speaker 4>It's because of the Russia stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was angry about how he was handling </v>

1055
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1056
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.620
<v Speaker 4>that's really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's intensely stupid.</v>

1057
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:11.650
<v Speaker 4>It's intensely stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also strange that it didn't go </v>

1058
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:11.650
<v Speaker 4>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1059
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Like that was it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's against the law.</v>

1060
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

1061
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1062
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.270
<v Speaker 4>obstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So obstruction.</v>

1063
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.520
<v Speaker 4>Looking at the statutes obstruction is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit more than that.</v>

1064
00:43:19.521 --> 00:43:24.521
<v Speaker 4>So you have to actually obstruct an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ongoing investigation into criminal </v>

1065
00:43:24.521 --> 00:43:27.971
<v Speaker 4>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a counter intelligence </v>

1066
00:43:27.971 --> 00:43:27.971
<v Speaker 4>investigation going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not necessarily a criminal one.</v>

1067
00:43:27.971 --> 00:43:31.250
<v Speaker 4>So not to get too specific about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you should get specific about it.</v>

1068
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean the obstruction laws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've looked into kind of the </v>

1069
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.351
<v Speaker 4>statutes that they've used to suggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>obstruction and it's not clear that </v>

1070
00:43:38.351 --> 00:43:39.080
<v Speaker 4>there is any statute that specifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>governance,</v>

1071
00:43:39.081 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 4>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plus it is true that trump does have the</v>

1072
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:46.571
<v Speaker 4>power as the chief executive to fire as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the commander in chief to fire the FBI </v>

1073
00:43:46.571 --> 00:43:47.420
<v Speaker 4>director for any reason he chooses.</v>

1074
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.860
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that said,</v>

1075
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 4>he can be impeached for any reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Criminal or noncriminal,</v>

1076
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.940
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Impeachment is not a,</v>

1077
00:43:52.941 --> 00:43:54.950
<v Speaker 4>you don't actually have to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>committed a crime to be impeached.</v>

1078
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't even understand what a</v>

1079
00:43:56.611 --> 00:44:01.611
<v Speaker 4>peach means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think that somehow or another </v>

1080
00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:01.611
<v Speaker 4>impeach means that you kicked out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>office,</v>

1081
00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:01.611
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not rent.</v>

1082
00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:06.171
<v Speaker 4>It is there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the house and they have to vote </v>

1083
00:44:06.171 --> 00:44:06.171
<v Speaker 4>to impeach you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1084
00:44:06.171 --> 00:44:06.171
<v Speaker 4>and then there's the senate and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to vote by two thirds.</v>

1085
00:44:06.171 --> 00:44:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Majority or a 68.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1086
00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:10.160
<v Speaker 4>I think it's two thirds majority to </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually convict.</v>

1087
00:44:10.161 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 4>You have a set of crimes that they come </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with,</v>

1088
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 4>but these are all political definitions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1089
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:15.740
<v Speaker 4>When it says high crimes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>misdemeanors,</v>

1090
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.930
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean they actually have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecute.</v>

1091
00:44:17.931 --> 00:44:22.931
<v Speaker 4>You likely wouldn't have criminal court </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd have to go to jail or any of </v>

1092
00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:22.931
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff.</v>

1093
00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:22.931
<v Speaker 4>Like they could impeach anybody at </v>
<v Speaker 4>anytime.</v>

1094
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.560
<v Speaker 4>Clinton didn't even have to commit </v>
<v Speaker 4>perjury.</v>

1095
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 4>If they didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they wanted to impeach him,</v>

1096
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Speaker 4>they could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could have impeached doubly.</v>

1097
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.350
<v Speaker 4>Every president you can impeach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a vote.</v>

1098
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:35.710
<v Speaker 4>It's just about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all the talk about what's criminal </v>

1099
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.710
<v Speaker 4>and what's not criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem for trump,</v>

1100
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.951
<v Speaker 4>there are two ways of reading trump's </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior in the whole Russia thing </v>

1101
00:44:39.951 --> 00:44:39.951
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way.</v>

1102
00:44:39.951 --> 00:44:42.591
<v Speaker 4>One is he's got something to hide and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the most obvious way he's got </v>

1103
00:44:42.591 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 4>something to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why he gets rid of Flynn.</v>

1104
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:45.600
<v Speaker 4>We don't know why he got rid of Flynn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets rid of Comey.</v>

1105
00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:50.601
<v Speaker 4>We don't really know why he got rid of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Columbia and then brags to the Russians </v>

1106
00:44:50.601 --> 00:44:50.601
<v Speaker 4>that it's a pressure off him on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia stuff.</v>

1107
00:44:50.601 --> 00:44:55.100
<v Speaker 4>So it's a way one is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's hiding something and now he's </v>

1108
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:55.100
<v Speaker 4>firing everybody who gets in the way and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1109
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chain of evidence does not fit that.</v>

1110
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:57.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1111
00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the people he's angry at in order </v>

1112
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.061
<v Speaker 4>our attorney general sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deputy attorney general Rod </v>

1113
00:45:05.061 --> 00:45:05.061
<v Speaker 4>Rosenstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the former head of the FBI,</v>

1114
00:45:05.061 --> 00:45:06.330
<v Speaker 4>James Comey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the acting head of the FBI,</v>

1115
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:07.360
<v Speaker 4>McCabe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1116
00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:12.480
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the special prosecutor Robert </v>

1117
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.830
<v Speaker 4>Mueller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those are all people involved with </v>

1118
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:17.541
<v Speaker 4>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the only people he's really </v>

1119
00:45:17.541 --> 00:45:18.861
<v Speaker 4>angry at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's something to be said for the </v>

1120
00:45:18.861 --> 00:45:18.861
<v Speaker 4>idea that maybe trying to hide </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1121
00:45:18.861 --> 00:45:22.670
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we haven't actually seen any hard </v>

1122
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.191
<v Speaker 4>evidence of collusion itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we saw an attempt to collude by </v>

1123
00:45:25.191 --> 00:45:28.341
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump jr,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we haven't actually seen any </v>

1124
00:45:28.341 --> 00:45:31.611
<v Speaker 4>evidence that the Russians were </v>
<v Speaker 4>providing special information to the </v>

1125
00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:34.431
<v Speaker 4>trump administration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was then being weaponized for use </v>

1126
00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:34.431
<v Speaker 4>in the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We haven't seen any of that stuff.</v>

1127
00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 4>So here's the other plausible theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this goes to trump's personality.</v>

1128
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:42.200
<v Speaker 4>He's so petty and he wants to be loved </v>
<v Speaker 4>so much that he is angry that people </v>

1129
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.740
<v Speaker 4>keep saying he run because he won </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the Russians.</v>

1130
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:47.940
<v Speaker 4>And so now every time people say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just gets pissed and he fires people.</v>

1131
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 4>So Comi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is totally plausible,</v>

1132
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:55.791
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Komi comes to him and he said privately </v>

1133
00:45:55.791 --> 00:45:56.910
<v Speaker 4>that you are not under investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And trump says to him,</v>

1134
00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.160
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you just say that?</v>

1135
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.330
<v Speaker 4>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1136
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 4>I can't say that because if I say that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to update congress.</v>

1137
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:05.430
<v Speaker 4>If you do fall under investigation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump doesn't like that,</v>

1138
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.290
<v Speaker 4>he wants the public to know he's free </v>
<v Speaker 4>and clear.</v>

1139
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.080
<v Speaker 4>So he fires call me and then he goes up </v>
<v Speaker 4>public and he says,</v>

1140
00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:11.310
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like how he was handling the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia thing.</v>

1141
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why will these people leave me alone?</v>

1142
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:14.510
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

1143
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 4>So there's two ways to read this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either he's totally innocent but stupid,</v>

1144
00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.030
<v Speaker 4>or he's trying to hide something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the only two plausible ways of</v>

1145
00:46:21.031 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 4>reading the situation.</v>

1146
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 4>The Donald trump junior thing was really</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre because he released all the </v>

1147
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 4>emails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just,</v>

1148
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.380
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1149
00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:29.610
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got nothing to hide.</v>

1150
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.640
<v Speaker 4>Like you aren't supposed to do any of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things you're saying in these </v>

1151
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:34.650
<v Speaker 4>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1152
00:46:34.651 --> 00:46:36.570
<v Speaker 4>That was not a good moment for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for trump,</v>

1153
00:46:36.571 --> 00:46:41.571
<v Speaker 4>jr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you'd go and then you hear </v>

1154
00:46:41.571 --> 00:46:41.760
<v Speaker 4>that he was coached by his dad again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1155
00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:42.990
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of this is gooD stuff.</v>

1156
00:46:42.991 --> 00:46:45.630
<v Speaker 4>I think that Donald Trump jr releasing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1157
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:50.750
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is imperative to note eight minutes </v>

1158
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.750
<v Speaker 4>later the New York times released </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically the email chain.</v>

1159
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was meeting,</v>

1160
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.000
<v Speaker 4>he was beating it out of the gate and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>he puts that out there,</v>

1161
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 4>which was a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1162
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.470
<v Speaker 4>it would be smart if it would be smart </v>
<v Speaker 4>if he had found a way to spin it,</v>

1163
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:59.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1164
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.650
<v Speaker 4>Like if you'd done it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this is the thing in politics,</v>

1165
00:47:01.651 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 4>now the way politics works now is your </v>
<v Speaker 4>smartest move.</v>

1166
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:09.440
<v Speaker 4>If there's dirt about you is to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first person out the gate with it and </v>

1167
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:09.440
<v Speaker 4>you put a spin on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1168
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 4>So like barack obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine if obama hadn't said anything in</v>

1169
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:16.611
<v Speaker 4>2008 and then we found out a week before</v>
<v Speaker 4>the election that he did coke in high </v>

1170
00:47:16.611 --> 00:47:17.430
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now a lot of people wouldn't care.</v>

1171
00:47:17.431 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people would write in 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 4>George W.</v>

1172
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Bush was hit with a dui charge from like</v>
<v Speaker 4>1973 and it probably last him a point in</v>

1173
00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:29.181
<v Speaker 4>the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what obama did is he wrote an entire </v>

1174
00:47:29.181 --> 00:47:29.890
<v Speaker 4>memoir and he just kind of dismissed it </v>
<v Speaker 4>right in the middle of the memoir.</v>

1175
00:47:29.891 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1176
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.870
<v Speaker 4>when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a little bloke,</v>

1177
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 4>no problem.</v>

1178
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.310
<v Speaker 4>Did a little blow everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone.</v>

1179
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did low blow,</v>

1180
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.010
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1181
00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:41.110
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're going to release this kind </v>

1182
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:41.110
<v Speaker 4>of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to put a spin on it.</v>

1183
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:45.240
<v Speaker 4>Trump juNior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't he just put out the emails and </v>

1184
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:45.240
<v Speaker 4>the emails themselves contain the </v>
<v Speaker 4>damning material,</v>

1185
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says right in there,</v>

1186
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a russian government lawyer,</v>

1187
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:53.190
<v Speaker 4>the russian government sees this as part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of its effort to aid mr trump's </v>

1188
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.161
<v Speaker 4>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And donald jr is like thumbs up guys </v>

1189
00:47:56.161 --> 00:47:56.161
<v Speaker 4>like I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds awesome.</v>

1190
00:47:56.161 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that does not look good.</v>

1191
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:03.420
<v Speaker 4>it's not quite as much as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People on the left want to say it as </v>

1192
00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.021
<v Speaker 4>meaning that there's no evidence yet </v>
<v Speaker 4>that any information was actually </v>

1193
00:48:06.021 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 4>exchanged with the russians or that </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything came of the meeting.</v>

1194
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:12.450
<v Speaker 4>Most of the people in the meeting who </v>
<v Speaker 4>said something and said nothing came of </v>

1195
00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:15.121
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know whether trump knew </v>

1196
00:48:15.121 --> 00:48:15.121
<v Speaker 4>about the meeting.</v>

1197
00:48:15.121 --> 00:48:15.121
<v Speaker 4>I find it kind of hard to believe he </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

1198
00:48:15.121 --> 00:48:19.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>considering every major campaign figure </v>

1199
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:19.110
<v Speaker 4>was there but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then then they,</v>

1200
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.910
<v Speaker 4>then they just keep lying and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the part that's,</v>

1201
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:27.210
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they lyIng because they just think </v>

1202
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.241
<v Speaker 4>they can get away with it anD they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid or they lying because they're </v>

1203
00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:30.241
<v Speaker 4>actually being meticulous about their </v>
<v Speaker 4>allies.</v>

1204
00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:35.040
<v Speaker 4>And I Tend to think the former,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this isn't a professional </v>

1205
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.040
<v Speaker 4>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think these,</v>

1206
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 4>I think trump fibs a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says things that are,</v>

1207
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean like on stupid things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says things like,</v>

1208
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.220
<v Speaker 4>the leader of the boy scouts called me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and told me that he loved my specialist,</v>

1209
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:43.900
<v Speaker 4>whichever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then leader of the boy scouts,</v>

1210
00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:44.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1211
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:45.350
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1212
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:50.610
<v Speaker 4>so is that a calculated lie to hide </v>
<v Speaker 4>something or is it just the trump lies </v>

1213
00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:51.250
<v Speaker 4>by nature and so he does it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think he's just so used to it</v>

1214
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:55.050
<v Speaker 3>putting that spin on things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicity span.</v>

1215
00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that he said about this </v>

1216
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:00.990
<v Speaker 3>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what politics is what happens in</v>

1217
00:49:00.991 --> 00:49:04.290
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get dirt about your enemy and people</v>

1218
00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:06.150
<v Speaker 3>exchange inFormation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just what happens.</v>

1219
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just you're seeing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people like.</v>

1220
00:49:08.311 --> 00:49:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that makes sense.</v>

1221
00:49:09.211 --> 00:49:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1222
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:10.980
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that again,</v>

1223
00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.630
<v Speaker 4>I think that were shaped by hollywood a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

1224
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Politics is dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of this stuff is not usual,</v>

1225
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:21.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually not particularly usual to </v>

1226
00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.881
<v Speaker 4>meet with a government that is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>not friendly to the United States to </v>

1227
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:24.060
<v Speaker 4>receive information about your political</v>
<v Speaker 4>opponents.</v>

1228
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.010
<v Speaker 4>But if you've watched house of cards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

1229
00:49:26.011 --> 00:49:31.011
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like two steps down from </v>

1230
00:49:31.011 --> 00:49:31.011
<v Speaker 4>throwing somebody under the subway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's the big deal?</v>

1231
00:49:31.011 --> 00:49:34.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't because I work in politics and </v>

1232
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:37.041
<v Speaker 4>when I go home at night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last thing I want to do is watch </v>

1233
00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:37.041
<v Speaker 4>entertainment about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now watch game of thrones.</v>

1234
00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:37.041
<v Speaker 4>That's his political.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1235
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.000
<v Speaker 3>House of cards is a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it's half right?</v>

1236
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I always wonder the thiNg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that gets me is when people </v>

1237
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.280
<v Speaker 3>suicide themselves that are on their waY</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try out,</v>

1238
00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1239
00:49:48.771 --> 00:49:53.771
<v Speaker 3>I don'T want to be that fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be that tin foil hat </v>

1240
00:49:53.771 --> 00:49:54.470
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how many people are going to suicide</v>

1241
00:49:54.471 --> 00:49:55.970
<v Speaker 3>themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1242
00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:00.230
<v Speaker 3>for sure someone's been murdered </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along the line.</v>

1243
00:50:00.231 --> 00:50:05.231
<v Speaker 3>Someone knew something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some powerful people got to them and </v>

1244
00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:05.231
<v Speaker 3>they murder him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1245
00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:06.200
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has happened.</v>

1246
00:50:06.201 --> 00:50:06.830
<v Speaker 3>It must've had.</v>

1247
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it happens a lot in Russia.</v>

1248
00:50:09.281 --> 00:50:12.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe what trump said.</v>

1249
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:17.131
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is why trump has a skewed </v>

1250
00:50:17.131 --> 00:50:18.991
<v Speaker 4>vision of what politics is and because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he thinks that the outer limit of </v>

1251
00:50:18.991 --> 00:50:20.530
<v Speaker 4>politics is Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks any thing inside that limit is</v>

1252
00:50:20.531 --> 00:50:25.531
<v Speaker 4>now okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But do you think it's ever happened in </v>

1253
00:50:25.531 --> 00:50:25.531
<v Speaker 4>the United States or just in Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like political assassinations?</v>

1254
00:50:25.531 --> 00:50:27.470
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't name a specific example of where</v>

1255
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 4>it has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that.</v>

1256
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:30.580
<v Speaker 4>Are you open to the possibility?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm open to.</v>

1257
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone shows me man johnson,</v>

1258
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.850
<v Speaker 4>lyndon johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you pick somebody?</v>

1259
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think lyndon johnson whacked</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody about kennedy.</v>

1260
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:38.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that kennedy whacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody,</v>

1261
00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 4>but hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1262
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't think hillary clinton</v>

1263
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.270
<v Speaker 3>the fiat up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had my last thousand bucks,</v>

1264
00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.910
<v Speaker 3>I'd be supeR tempted to bet on black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be super tempted to go.</v>

1265
00:50:48.911 --> 00:50:50.920
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think She went dark.</v>

1266
00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:54.790
<v Speaker 3>She's whacked a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what we've got here.</v>

1267
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Like I want to see white water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd want to see vince foster.</v>

1268
00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:00.640
<v Speaker 3>I want to see that enron guy who shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself in the head twice.</v>

1269
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.270
<v Speaker 3>If I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could really,</v>

1270
00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1271
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.110
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's happened,</v>

1272
00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know.</v>

1273
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

1274
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.610
<v Speaker 4>if I don't know if one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm hesitant to,</v>

1275
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:18.050
<v Speaker 4>I think that we and I think that we tend</v>
<v Speaker 4>to think things are regular when they </v>

1276
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:18.050
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they never really irregular,</v>

1277
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:22.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we tend to think that this stuff is </v>

1278
00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:22.980
<v Speaker 4>happening every day and that's why you </v>
<v Speaker 4>see trump on tv saying,</v>

1279
00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.510
<v Speaker 4>well putin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like America hasn't killed people.</v>

1280
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.590
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>

1281
00:51:25.591 --> 00:51:30.591
<v Speaker 4>not quite like putin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like putting legitimately </v>

1282
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:30.591
<v Speaker 4>murders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His,</v>

1283
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:33.050
<v Speaker 4>his journalistic enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen you trying to double tap </v>

1284
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:33.870
<v Speaker 4>jake tapper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure.</v>

1285
00:51:33.871 --> 00:51:35.400
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a regular thing around here.</v>

1286
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Even obama wasn't trying to like kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>chris wallace.</v>

1287
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But maybe the,</v>

1288
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:42.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I don't know what boot is.</v>

1289
00:51:42.821 --> 00:51:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the extreme example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1290
00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Well obviously the extreme example is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea,</v>

1291
00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:52.570
<v Speaker 3>but putin is in that range of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a totally feared,</v>

1292
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.550
<v Speaker 3>essentially a dictator who's a,</v>

1293
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:55.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1294
00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:57.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean airline in Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1295
00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.350
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The maduro a song,</v>

1296
00:51:59.360 --> 00:51:59.830
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Assad now in Venezuela who's literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a complete dictatorship,</v>

1298
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:08.600
<v Speaker 4>and this is very recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but America is a.</v>

1299
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you believe it if I said like </v>

1300
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 4>leaders in France had people regularly </v>
<v Speaker 4>whacked and find it a little bit hard to</v>

1301
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:19.211
<v Speaker 4>believe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we're significantly worse </v>

1302
00:52:19.211 --> 00:52:21.161
<v Speaker 4>than France and the whacking people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics business I don't think </v>

1303
00:52:21.161 --> 00:52:23.981
<v Speaker 4>regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think every now and then the move </v>

1304
00:52:23.981 --> 00:52:24.500
<v Speaker 4>is I'm open to the possibility that I'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to see the evidence.</v>

1305
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:29.700
<v Speaker 4>The lawyer in me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't think we're a house of </v>

1306
00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:29.700
<v Speaker 4>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's gets that ridiculous,</v>

1307
00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.710
<v Speaker 4>but the point I'm making is if you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a regular thing,</v>

1308
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:33.350
<v Speaker 4>if you think that it not like a rare </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and maybe once in a while,</v>

1309
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:38.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once every 20 years somebody gets </v>

1310
00:52:38.351 --> 00:52:39.821
<v Speaker 4>whacked quietly for political reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think that's like a regular </v>

1311
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:42.761
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then fibbing is like way inside the </v>

1312
00:52:42.761 --> 00:52:42.761
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1313
00:52:42.761 --> 00:52:43.160
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you hiding documents is really.</v>

1314
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:48.490
<v Speaker 4>Or are you like writing your son's </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid statement about a stupid email </v>

1315
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 4>exchange and then fitting about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>publicly.</v>

1316
00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Like that's really inside the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

1317
00:52:51.561 --> 00:52:53.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some of this,</v>

1318
00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.370
<v Speaker 4>I have a rule about the trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration.</v>

1319
00:52:55.371 --> 00:53:00.371
<v Speaker 4>I never attribute to malevolence what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can attribute to stupidity because I </v>

1320
00:53:00.371 --> 00:53:01.670
<v Speaker 4>think that that's more likely to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>

1321
00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:03.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like the outcomes razor of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>trumpet.</v>

1322
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:09.150
<v Speaker 3>I think that is a smart way to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think sometimes malevolence is </v>

1323
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:12.901
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the gary condit chandra levy </v>

1324
00:53:12.901 --> 00:53:12.901
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1325
00:53:12.901 --> 00:53:16.441
<v Speaker 3>that was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a weird one for people don't </v>

1326
00:53:16.441 --> 00:53:16.540
<v Speaker 3>know the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy was having an affair.</v>

1327
00:53:16.541 --> 00:53:21.541
<v Speaker 3>The girl turned up dead and then nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 11 happened right away afterwards,</v>

1328
00:53:21.581 --> 00:53:23.990
<v Speaker 3>so people kind of forgot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>

1329
00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 3>They found her body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the park and everybody was like,</v>

1330
00:53:26.401 --> 00:53:31.401
<v Speaker 3>jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a woman that was about to </v>

1331
00:53:31.401 --> 00:53:34.881
<v Speaker 3>testify that she was having an affair </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this guy and that one was a good </v>

1332
00:53:34.881 --> 00:53:36.960
<v Speaker 3>one in terms of not a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a good one.</v>

1333
00:53:36.961 --> 00:53:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Obviously a terrible</v>

1334
00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.620
<v Speaker 4>in terms of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let me say this.</v>

1335
00:53:39.621 --> 00:53:42.290
<v Speaker 4>I think that if there's murder and </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics that will probably tend to fall</v>

1336
00:53:42.291 --> 00:53:43.880
<v Speaker 4>more into the personal and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>political.</v>

1337
00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:45.950
<v Speaker 4>It'll probably fall less in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1338
00:53:45.951 --> 00:53:48.470
<v Speaker 4>I have a political vendetta against this</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy and I'm going to kill him.</v>

1339
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:51.740
<v Speaker 4>We haven't really done much of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>since Alexander Hamilton and burr.</v>

1340
00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:52.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

1341
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.300
<v Speaker 4>But there are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1342
00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:59.350
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>teddy kennedy left a woman in the back </v>

1343
00:53:59.350 --> 00:53:59.350
<v Speaker 4>of his car and a body of water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

1344
00:53:59.350 --> 00:53:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drunk driving.</v>

1345
00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing with him.</v>

1346
00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:03.050
<v Speaker 3>He just didn't want to be responsible </v>
<v Speaker 3>for something horrible that he did.</v>

1347
00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Similar to dick cheney not meeting with </v>

1348
00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.100
<v Speaker 3>the police for like something like 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours after he shot his friend in the </v>

1349
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:12.100
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

1350
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1351
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:17.061
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>assassinate his friend is drunk hunting </v>

1352
00:54:17.061 --> 00:54:17.061
<v Speaker 4>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1353
00:54:17.061 --> 00:54:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>

1354
00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:20.100
<v Speaker 4>I can't rule that one out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

1355
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

1356
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:28.430
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll fantastic kennedy a little more </v>

1357
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:29.811
<v Speaker 4>suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You leave the woman in the back of the </v>

1358
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:29.811
<v Speaker 4>car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swim out of the car,</v>

1359
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:29.811
<v Speaker 4>go into a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep,</v>

1360
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:30.780
<v Speaker 4>come back the next day and oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's dead.</v>

1361
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:31.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1362
00:54:31.381 --> 00:54:33.690
<v Speaker 4>it turns out when you leave somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>underwater for 12 hours,</v>

1363
00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:36.030
<v Speaker 4>they tend to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird how that works</v>

1364
00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.590
<v Speaker 3>well less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so drunk that he didn't know what</v>

1365
00:54:38.591 --> 00:54:40.120
<v Speaker 3>he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which can happen.</v>

1366
00:54:40.121 --> 00:54:42.610
<v Speaker 3>You can get black out drunk or you wake </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and you go,</v>

1367
00:54:42.611 --> 00:54:44.260
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I crash my car</v>

1368
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.200
<v Speaker 4>so I don't drink that heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that really a thing?</v>

1369
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:47.870
<v Speaker 4>Like he climbed out the window,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the card,</v>

1370
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.820
<v Speaker 4>swim out to the river bank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to somebodies house,</v>

1371
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.630
<v Speaker 4>come back like a day later you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

1372
00:54:54.631 --> 00:54:56.020
<v Speaker 4>There was a girl in the backseat.</v>

1373
00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.490
<v Speaker 3>I've never had it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have had.</v>

1374
00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:04.030
<v Speaker 3>I've had what I would call slide nights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know where I get hammered and then like </v>

1375
00:55:05.481 --> 00:55:08.250
<v Speaker 3>a wake up in the morning with a pounding</v>
<v Speaker 3>headache and is,</v>

1376
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:11.420
<v Speaker 3>have these flashes in my head like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is that person?</v>

1377
00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Like where was I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where were we?</v>

1378
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was that.</v>

1379
00:55:14.721 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 3>And then that you'll eat breakfast with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your friends that go.</v>

1380
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.660
<v Speaker 3>You remember that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you go,</v>

1381
00:55:17.661 --> 00:55:19.430
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jesus,</v>

1382
00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:25.920
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily blackout like I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>something horrible and I completely </v>

1383
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.480
<v Speaker 3>forgot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I forgot a lot of it.</v>

1384
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:29.780
<v Speaker 3>But some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend and he goes,</v>

1385
00:55:29.781 --> 00:55:34.781
<v Speaker 3>job allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a switch that goes off three or </v>

1386
00:55:34.781 --> 00:55:36.720
<v Speaker 3>four shots in and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gone and he's not there anymore and</v>

1387
00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:41.740
<v Speaker 3>you almost kinda like nerf the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>around him and protect him and get him </v>

1388
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:41.740
<v Speaker 3>in his bed and he wakes up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

1389
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:46.331
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't know a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know a thing about what </v>

1390
00:55:46.331 --> 00:55:46.331
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1391
00:55:46.331 --> 00:55:47.040
<v Speaker 3>And it's really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's illegitimate,</v>

1392
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.520
<v Speaker 3>terrible things to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know I wasn't nice to him.</v>

1393
00:55:49.521 --> 00:55:54.521
<v Speaker 3>But your instinct is to get the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>away from him and he just let horrible </v>

1394
00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:56.780
<v Speaker 3>things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1395
00:55:56.781 --> 00:55:58.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stories are legendary,</v>

1396
00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.620
<v Speaker 3>but he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets sharp eyes.</v>

1397
00:56:00.621 --> 00:56:05.621
<v Speaker 3>He gets these black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like soulless eyes where he's gone and </v>

1398
00:56:05.621 --> 00:56:05.621
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

1399
00:56:05.621 --> 00:56:06.650
<v Speaker 3>he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1400
00:56:06.651 --> 00:56:08.990
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm wondering what that is.</v>

1401
00:56:08.991 --> 00:56:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's a neurological issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like if,</v>

1402
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:16.800
<v Speaker 3>if alcohol does that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably some switches that </v>

1403
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.380
<v Speaker 3>aren't connected right in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagined a seven gun on,</v>

1404
00:56:18.381 --> 00:56:19.820
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1405
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:21.290
<v Speaker 3>So teddy kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>

1406
00:56:21.291 --> 00:56:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was obviously a raging</v>

1407
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 2>and that could have been a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1408
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean he literally might have gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

1409
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:29.770
<v Speaker 2>not even knowing that he killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

1410
00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd have to be as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's only defense.</v>

1411
00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:37.190
<v Speaker 2>So you imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was one of the things that </v>

1412
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:39.841
<v Speaker 2>they said that they would have used as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>defense against with oj the oj with the </v>

1413
00:56:39.841 --> 00:56:44.810
<v Speaker 2>cte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he might not have even known what </v>

1414
00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:47.221
<v Speaker 2>he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he might have flown into some </v>

1415
00:56:47.221 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 2>blackout rage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be an amazing defense.</v>

1416
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I would like to hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everyone who has cte now gets to </v>

1417
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:55.051
<v Speaker 2>like run around chopping up their ex </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and randos who end up at their </v>

1418
00:56:55.051 --> 00:56:55.400
<v Speaker 2>house like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a hell of a defense.</v>

1419
00:56:55.401 --> 00:56:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like the twinkie defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1420
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the twinkie defense was hilarious,</v>

1421
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:04.080
<v Speaker 2>but there are people that think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to see more and more </v>

1422
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 2>things like that at a former nfl players</v>
<v Speaker 2>with massive brain trauma issues.</v>

1423
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a serious legal question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1424
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:15.950
<v Speaker 2>like there was a couple of weeks ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid doesn't even know he did this.</v>

1425
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>

1426
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Former nfl player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Devonne hall accused of kIlling his </v>

1427
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.470
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't remember.</v>

1428
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 2>He's in jail right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't recall.</v>

1429
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's real.</v>

1430
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:26.390
<v Speaker 2>It's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1431
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't find that wildly implausible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the fact is that we have an </v>

1432
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:33.670
<v Speaker 2>insanity defense and what it means you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know right from wrong.</v>

1433
00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what you're doing,</v>

1434
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:36.520
<v Speaker 2>like this is something they teach in law</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

1435
00:57:36.521 --> 00:57:41.521
<v Speaker 2>If you're sleepwalking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kill somebody and there's no motive </v>

1436
00:57:41.521 --> 00:57:44.880
<v Speaker 2>sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to like you need mental </v>

1437
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:44.880
<v Speaker 2>treatment but it should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You be in jail for that.</v>

1438
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

1439
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:49.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've had cases where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like sleepwalking and they think </v>

1440
00:57:49.531 --> 00:57:52.621
<v Speaker 2>that in their dreaming at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they think that their wife is </v>

1441
00:57:52.621 --> 00:57:54.811
<v Speaker 2>actually like this defense has been used</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they think they're the wife of </v>

1442
00:57:54.811 --> 00:57:54.811
<v Speaker 2>some sort of monster in the room.</v>

1443
00:57:54.811 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 2>So they clobbered to death and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up and like,</v>

1444
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:58.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my wife.</v>

1445
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a really creative defense or it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1446
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the toe so well,</v>

1447
00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:08.370
<v Speaker 2>if we know that people can go crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that brain trauma is a real </v>

1448
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:09.160
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two of them together,</v>

1449
00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:13.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's something about getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked around in the head where it's so</v>

1450
00:58:13.901 --> 00:58:18.901
<v Speaker 2>completely unpredictable and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>add in this impulsive nature of their </v>

1451
00:58:18.901 --> 00:58:22.771
<v Speaker 2>behavior that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something really weird about a </v>

1452
00:58:22.771 --> 00:58:25.240
<v Speaker 2>brain trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It causes a lot of very strange,</v>

1453
00:58:25.241 --> 00:58:30.241
<v Speaker 2>impulsive behavior in people with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really can't understand even why </v>

1454
00:58:30.241 --> 00:58:31.000
<v Speaker 2>they're behaving the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaving.</v>

1455
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Just not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously this is way off track,</v>

1456
00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:38.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's far from politics to brand </v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma.</v>

1457
00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:41.620
<v Speaker 2>You don't want a former nfl player being</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking president.</v>

1458
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a cte study.</v>

1459
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:48.280
<v Speaker 2>There was a hundred and 11 players and </v>
<v Speaker 2>110 of them had cte.</v>

1460
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you tell me,</v>

1461
00:58:50.441 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1462
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:51.760
<v Speaker 2>you have more experience at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1463
00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't find that shocking at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've been calling people punch</v>

1464
00:58:54.151 --> 00:58:57.580
<v Speaker 2>drunk since 1910 and so we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

1465
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:02.850
<v Speaker 2>when you get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get to the slurring your words </v>

1466
00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:02.850
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so gone,</v>

1467
00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:08.010
<v Speaker 2>you're already gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that have cte </v>

1468
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:11.071
<v Speaker 2>that speak really well and they're very </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate and they're very reasonable </v>

1469
00:59:11.071 --> 00:59:13.360
<v Speaker 2>and you wouldn't even understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dealing with all these,</v>

1470
00:59:13.361 --> 00:59:18.010
<v Speaker 2>this host of neurological issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The by the time you avoid,</v>

1471
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:23.040
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm not a neuRologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by the time this has been explained </v>

1472
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:23.040
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your voice</v>

1473
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:27.250
<v Speaker 3>is slurring and you're dealing with like</v>
<v Speaker 3>real heavy duty symptoms like you're </v>

1474
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:28.910
<v Speaker 3>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're so gone.</v>

1475
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1476
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.820
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're way off.</v>

1477
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.660
<v Speaker 4>Here's a weird question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1478
00:59:33.661 --> 00:59:34.920
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you do about like,</v>

1479
00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:36.990
<v Speaker 4>I think the nfl is gonna start losing </v>
<v Speaker 4>viewers because of us.</v>

1480
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.420
<v Speaker 4>I think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right and you know,</v>

1481
00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:40.710
<v Speaker 4>I wonder about mma.</v>

1482
00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:43.510
<v Speaker 3>It's a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a,</v>

1483
00:59:43.511 --> 00:59:48.511
<v Speaker 3>there's two things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the bucket factor where people </v>

1484
00:59:48.511 --> 00:59:48.511
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

1485
00:59:48.511 --> 00:59:48.511
<v Speaker 3>I want to watch people get their ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked.</v>

1486
00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:49.780
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting.</v>

1487
00:59:49.781 --> 00:59:51.760
<v Speaker 3>People love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's consensual.</v>

1488
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:52.990
<v Speaker 3>It's primal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1489
00:59:52.991 --> 00:59:54.970
<v Speaker 3>and people know what they're signing up </v>
<v Speaker 3>for when they do it,</v>

1490
00:59:54.971 --> 00:59:59.971
<v Speaker 3>they know the consequences of it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth the glory to be the guy who </v>

1491
00:59:59.971 --> 01:00:00.970
<v Speaker 3>delivers it versus the guy who receives </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1492
01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:06.420
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's also look the colin </v>

1493
01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.180
<v Speaker 3>kaepernick thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

1494
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:10.300
<v Speaker 4>probably costs a lot of ratings for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nfl.</v>

1495
01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Did that poll that came out that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think of the 12 percent of people who </v>

1496
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.050
<v Speaker 4>said that they were not watching nfl </v>
<v Speaker 4>games last year,</v>

1497
01:00:17.051 --> 01:00:22.051
<v Speaker 4>28 percent of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>12 percent said that the cabernet </v>

1498
01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:22.051
<v Speaker 4>national anthem thing was the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1499
01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:26.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some small percentage probably </v>

1500
01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:28.441
<v Speaker 4>emboldened them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably liked it and they wanted </v>

1501
01:00:28.441 --> 01:00:30.451
<v Speaker 4>to watch it more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is fascinating about the cultural </v>

1502
01:00:30.451 --> 01:00:32.431
<v Speaker 4>breakdown of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically white people hated black </v>

1503
01:00:32.431 --> 01:00:32.431
<v Speaker 4>people loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is it.</v>

1504
01:00:32.431 --> 01:00:36.250
<v Speaker 4>This is how the polls where it's like 72</v>
<v Speaker 4>percent of black people thought it was </v>

1505
01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.911
<v Speaker 4>great and like an equal percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>white people thought that it was just </v>

1506
01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:38.911
<v Speaker 4>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1507
01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:43.160
<v Speaker 4>which is a fascinating look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of how race relations work in the </v>

1508
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.230
<v Speaker 4>country at large is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'S actually one of the reasons I think</v>

1509
01:00:44.231 --> 01:00:49.231
<v Speaker 4>that espn has been losing ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I used to watch espn religiously </v>

1510
01:00:49.231 --> 01:00:49.231
<v Speaker 4>and now I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1511
01:00:49.231 --> 01:00:53.460
<v Speaker 4>all I want is to just watch my sports </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not Be bothered with the politics </v>

1512
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.730
<v Speaker 4>because I say I do that during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a pet peeve of mine and every time </v>

1513
01:00:56.730 --> 01:01:00.061
<v Speaker 4>I turn on espn I have to lecture about </v>
<v Speaker 4>caitlyn jenner or about black lives </v>

1514
01:01:00.061 --> 01:01:00.061
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like shut up.</v>

1515
01:01:00.061 --> 01:01:02.740
<v Speaker 4>Caitlin jenner hasn't even been </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletically relevant fOr since before I</v>

1516
01:01:02.741 --> 01:01:04.210
<v Speaker 4>was born.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was born in 1984.</v>

1517
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Well the caitlyn jenner piece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they did it for espn,</v>

1518
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if this is true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the word was that her getting </v>

1519
01:01:12.781 --> 01:01:17.781
<v Speaker 3>athlete of the year or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>award was like the hero of the year </v>

1520
01:01:17.781 --> 01:01:22.611
<v Speaker 3>award arrow a was directly tied to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer.</v>

1521
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:29.910
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sold the two of them together as a </v>

1522
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.910
<v Speaker 3>package deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I buy a hundred percent and if you</v>

1523
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:31.500
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>

1524
01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:33.590
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's think about where he works,</v>

1525
01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.830
<v Speaker 3>if that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She came from.</v>

1526
01:01:34.831 --> 01:01:36.780
<v Speaker 3>She's a fucking car dash 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1527
01:01:36.781 --> 01:01:38.620
<v Speaker 3>She's a giant kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1528
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:42.630
<v Speaker 3>That's what she is now known as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying she saying she,</v>

1529
01:01:42.631 --> 01:01:44.550
<v Speaker 3>I would say very politically correct and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1530
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the video where they circled her </v>

1531
01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:51.570
<v Speaker 3>house and she was like moving and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shadows behind the drapes.</v>

1532
01:01:51.571 --> 01:01:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1533
01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.500
<v Speaker 3>it was wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was wOnderful.</v>

1534
01:01:55.650 --> 01:02:00.650
<v Speaker 3>She made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like the first time she was </v>

1535
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.710
<v Speaker 3>revealing herself as this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're circling her house.</v>

1536
01:02:01.711 --> 01:02:06.711
<v Speaker 3>She's this gloria's house and looks like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in malibu or somewhere where </v>

1537
01:02:06.711 --> 01:02:08.640
<v Speaker 3>they're circling the house and it's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hills with helicopter,</v>

1538
01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:11.180
<v Speaker 3>like filming I guess like fucking high </v>
<v Speaker 3>production values.</v>

1539
01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't just like,</v>

1540
01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:13.860
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1541
01:02:13.861 --> 01:02:15.690
<v Speaker 3>we've met with caitlin and home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caitlin,</v>

1542
01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.900
<v Speaker 3>tell us your troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1543
01:02:16.901 --> 01:02:19.110
<v Speaker 3>like kristen beck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the former navy</v>

1544
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 2>who just sits down very reasonably and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1545
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 2>this just feels better for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is who I am right now.</v>

1546
01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Know that there was like curtains and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadows and it was mysterious.</v>

1547
01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 2>And then she starts talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1548
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:32.110
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all.</v>

1549
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh god.</v>

1550
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weirdest part where she said she got</v>

1551
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:41.400
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make me any.</v>

1552
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like I was any less of a man </v>

1553
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.030
<v Speaker 2>or less of a woman before the surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1554
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>this is the case is about gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1555
01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why get the surgery?</v>

1556
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:54.831
<v Speaker 2>That was like this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of questions as to the </v>

1557
01:02:54.831 --> 01:02:56.310
<v Speaker 2>logic of all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get you call it caitlyn jenner sheet.</v>

1558
01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Caitlyn jenner is a biological man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1559
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.480
<v Speaker 2>That triggered sat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry to break this to some of the all </v>

1560
01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:04.480
<v Speaker 2>the people who listened to your show.</v>

1561
01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Caitlyn jenner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it like.</v>

1562
01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.251
<v Speaker 2>I had a tweet this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the people that listen to probably </v>

1563
01:03:09.251 --> 01:03:10.410
<v Speaker 2>agree with you at least a good good </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount to the number one retweet a tweet</v>

1564
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:15.411
<v Speaker 2>I have ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had 100 and I tweeted I think a day ago </v>

1565
01:03:15.411 --> 01:03:16.210
<v Speaker 2>and it has 120,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>lakes and it's.</v>

1566
01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:21.220
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a headline from cnn that said </v>

1567
01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.400
<v Speaker 2>transgender man gives birth to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transient lesbians,</v>

1568
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.440
<v Speaker 2>transgender man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a signed the female sex at birth gives </v>

1569
01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.370
<v Speaker 2>birth to a healthy baby boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I tweeted,</v>

1570
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.130
<v Speaker 2>woman gives birth to a boy because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman.</v>

1571
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean like that's not a headline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1572
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:36.800
<v Speaker 2>like I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the woman believes she's a man,</v>

1573
01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.840
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make her a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like biology still exists.</v>

1574
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Sex still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to say she's a woman who </v>

1575
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:44.900
<v Speaker 2>feels like a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1576
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.861
<v Speaker 2>If you want to say that and by that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even care if she gets the hormone </v>

1577
01:03:48.861 --> 01:03:48.861
<v Speaker 2>treatments or if she wants to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>

1578
01:03:48.861 --> 01:03:50.550
<v Speaker 2>like it's a free country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell you want,</v>

1579
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:53.310
<v Speaker 2>but when you start insisting that I use </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1580
01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I just throw biology out the window.</v>

1581
01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why that's any better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is a religious person saying </v>

1582
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:01.410
<v Speaker 2>every time you say something you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>mention god like,</v>

1583
01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:06.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the right to do that to </v>

1584
01:04:06.411 --> 01:04:06.411
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

1585
01:04:06.411 --> 01:04:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Are you fascinated by it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you fascinated by the transgender?</v>

1586
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.340
<v Speaker 2>The I'm fascinated by this obsession </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

1587
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of saying it.</v>

1588
01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:17.250
<v Speaker 2>There's not just a an obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1589
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:23.350
<v Speaker 2>it's compulsory and it's rabid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that there's a couple of </v>

1590
01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:24.960
<v Speaker 2>things that are going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that it's very dark,</v>

1591
01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:27.120
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there is an element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1592
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:30.210
<v Speaker 2>this is different and we get to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get to revel in the,</v>

1593
01:04:30.211 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 2>in the weirdness of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to pretend that it's all</v>

1594
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 2>about the civil rights of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1595
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:35.360
<v Speaker 2>We're going to feel special because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1596
01:04:35.361 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

1597
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Because we're on their side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1598
01:04:37.261 --> 01:04:42.261
<v Speaker 2>When we're not watching caitlyn jenner </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a curiosity and because </v>

1599
01:04:42.261 --> 01:04:45.381
<v Speaker 2>it's weird and entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing it because we're on caitlyn </v>

1600
01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>jenner's side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're feeling really good about </v>

1601
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>people forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1602
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>renee richards was a trans person.</v>

1603
01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 2>It's happened throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1604
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:55.490
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was I reading a couple of days ago </v>

1605
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:58.941
<v Speaker 2>about a roman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was something about reports </v>

1606
01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:03.630
<v Speaker 2>of some trans soldier in the roman army </v>
<v Speaker 2>born a thousand years ago.</v>

1607
01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:08.631
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it exists now and it's existed </v>

1608
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:08.631
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was popular.</v>

1609
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's got to be a lot of people</v>

1610
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:11.580
<v Speaker 2>that turn trans now just because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting.</v>

1611
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

1612
01:05:12.031 --> 01:05:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A trans soldier in the ancient roman.</v>

1613
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Of course it wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>WouldN't be surprised.</v>

1614
01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Not</v>

1615
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 4>shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a condition.</v>

1616
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:25.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean the been called gender identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder and then they called it gender </v>

1617
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.870
<v Speaker 4>dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a condition.</v>

1618
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I'm not saying conditions </v>
<v Speaker 4>for and but that in a lot of people's </v>

1619
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:33.550
<v Speaker 4>mind is labeling it somehow or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative.</v>

1620
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:39.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is highly linked to </v>

1621
01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.521
<v Speaker 4>suicidality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a 40 percent lifetime suicide </v>

1622
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:41.521
<v Speaker 4>rate for people who have this particular</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender disorder.</v>

1623
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 4>That seems to me not to be like a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive.</v>

1624
01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:45.670
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not they transition whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>or not the transition.</v>

1625
01:05:45.671 --> 01:05:50.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if you transition to what </v>

1626
01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:50.671
<v Speaker 4>you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1627
01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:51.280
<v Speaker 4>But the ideA that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we as an entire society,</v>

1628
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:56.281
<v Speaker 4>you have to redefine what sex is and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to blind ourselves to a biology is </v>

1629
01:05:56.281 --> 01:05:59.551
<v Speaker 4>this is something I'm not willing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's actually damaging to </v>

1630
01:05:59.551 --> 01:06:00.640
<v Speaker 4>kids particularly more than willing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>call her she and,</v>

1631
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:02.770
<v Speaker 4>but you can only change the name once.</v>

1632
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to call caitlyn jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>caitlyn jenner.</v>

1633
01:06:04.571 --> 01:06:07.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm not willing to call caitlyn jenner </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue because you can't change your sex.</v>

1634
01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:12.590
<v Speaker 4>Can change your name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can change it into whatever you </v>

1635
01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:12.590
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care,</v>

1636
01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:12.590
<v Speaker 4>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She caitlyn jenner is not a chicken.</v>

1637
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:14.980
<v Speaker 4>Caitlyn jenner is not a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Caitlin jenner is a man,</v>

1638
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:20.100
<v Speaker 4>a biological man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if a man lost his penis and it and </v>

1639
01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:20.100
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1640
01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:20.680
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a tragic accident,</v>

1641
01:06:20.681 --> 01:06:25.681
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't make them a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if he were born with high doses of </v>

1642
01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:26.050
<v Speaker 4>estrogen in his bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would also not be a woman.</v>

1643
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:29.440
<v Speaker 4>You are determined by your chromosomes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not even talking about intersex</v>

1644
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 4>people like intersex is natural status.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Intersex is a biological status,</v>

1645
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.920
<v Speaker 4>but this nonsense that if you joe rogan </v>
<v Speaker 4>decide tomorrow that you are a woman,</v>

1646
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:40.470
<v Speaker 4>no surgeries nor homeowner and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>homeowner,</v>

1647
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.840
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

1648
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.180
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow you wake up and not,</v>

1649
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.920
<v Speaker 4>not the side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you feel like a woman.</v>

1650
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Then you have always been a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We must treat you as a woman.</v>

1651
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:52.860
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to change anything about </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself for us to even determine </v>

1652
01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:52.860
<v Speaker 4>whether you're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just like,</v>

1653
01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:53.530
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1654
01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:58.531
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I had mental illness and I </v>

1655
01:06:58.531 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 4>had a grandfather I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get so much shit for this,</v>

1656
01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:03.850
<v Speaker 4>but I had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not me being unsympathetic to </v>

1657
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:05.971
<v Speaker 4>people who suffer from a condition that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is really tragic and obviously harms </v>

1658
01:07:05.971 --> 01:07:05.971
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1659
01:07:05.971 --> 01:07:06.490
<v Speaker 4>In terms of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1660
01:07:06.491 --> 01:07:08.860
<v Speaker 4>the rates of suicide and depression are </v>
<v Speaker 4>astoundinG.</v>

1661
01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.310
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my grandfather was a,</v>

1662
01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:16.350
<v Speaker 4>was a bipolar schizophrenia and it would</v>
<v Speaker 4>have not been good for him or my family </v>

1663
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:17.320
<v Speaker 4>if people had said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nate,</v>

1664
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:19.330
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the radio is talking to you,</v>

1665
01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 4>nate.</v>

1666
01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:21.760
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The curtains are talking to you.</v>

1667
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:23.740
<v Speaker 4>He Went and they put them in a mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital.</v>

1668
01:07:23.741 --> 01:07:28.741
<v Speaker 4>They gave them lithium and then he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>Better and he could actually live a </v>

1669
01:07:28.741 --> 01:07:28.741
<v Speaker 4>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relatively happy life.</v>

1670
01:07:28.741 --> 01:07:30.490
<v Speaker 4>There's no good treatment for gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity disorder,</v>

1671
01:07:30.491 --> 01:07:31.870
<v Speaker 4>gender dysphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call it,</v>

1672
01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.920
<v Speaker 4>but to suggest that it is a condition </v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't require treatment there.</v>

1673
01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:40.921
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just that you're actually brain </v>

1674
01:07:40.921 --> 01:07:40.921
<v Speaker 4>female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1675
01:07:40.921 --> 01:07:43.831
<v Speaker 4>this is a scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no scientific evidence to back </v>

1676
01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:46.501
<v Speaker 4>this whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even these studies that have been done </v>

1677
01:07:46.501 --> 01:07:46.501
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a female brain and a male brain.</v>

1678
01:07:46.501 --> 01:07:48.010
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you say this to a feminist,</v>

1679
01:07:48.011 --> 01:07:49.270
<v Speaker 4>you're a sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1680
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you say to a feminist,</v>

1681
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:56.100
<v Speaker 4>there's a female brand in the male brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>and male brain works differently than </v>

1682
01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:56.100
<v Speaker 4>the female brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The feminists will look like,</v>

1683
01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:56.350
<v Speaker 4>how dare you?</v>

1684
01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also one of the rare times where </v>

1685
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.170
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to celebrate classic </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitions of female beauty.</v>

1686
01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Speaker 4>When a man embraces somebody becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman lipstick,</v>

1687
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:06.820
<v Speaker 4>high heels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>short skirt.</v>

1688
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:12.090
<v Speaker 4>This is like caitlyn jenner was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Caitlyn jenner was only a woman when </v>

1689
01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:12.240
<v Speaker 4>caitlyn jenner was on the cover of </v>
<v Speaker 4>vanity fair to boost da.</v>

1690
01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1691
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 4>But if he had just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1692
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I look exactly the same as I did </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday,</v>

1693
01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:17.310
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:19.940
<v Speaker 4>If you've got a short haircut and dress </v>
<v Speaker 4>like billie Jean King,</v>

1695
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:24.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the reason why the why the media </v>

1696
01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 4>loves laverne cox because laverne cox </v>
<v Speaker 4>has had surgeries and looks a lot like a</v>

1697
01:08:25.521 --> 01:08:28.730
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know who the guy from.</v>

1698
01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1699
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 4>the transgender woman from orange is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>new black.</v>

1700
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.070
<v Speaker 4>I never watched the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never watched that show either,</v>

1701
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:35.180
<v Speaker 4>but she's on the cover of time magazine.</v>

1702
01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or he's on the cover of time magazine.</v>

1703
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:38.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was the woman in that show.</v>

1704
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that the one where the girl who </v>
<v Speaker 4>ruby rose.</v>

1705
01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:45.050
<v Speaker 4>Is that the girl that's laverne cox?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a woman or man,</v>

1706
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:46.640
<v Speaker 4>that's man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to be a man.</v>

1707
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.460
<v Speaker 4>It used to be a man and a woman now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very tricky know still a man.</v>

1708
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 4>But transgender tipping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So out of the loop.</v>

1709
01:08:52.190 --> 01:08:57.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm not old man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm that old man was one that headline </v>

1710
01:08:57.190 --> 01:08:57.190
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1711
01:08:57.190 --> 01:08:57.190
<v Speaker 4>It says america's next civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 4>frontier.</v>

1712
01:08:57.190 --> 01:09:02.111
<v Speaker 4>And that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a bunch of people in the </v>

1713
01:09:02.111 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 4>United States who are suggesting that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want the next civil rights fight?</v>

1714
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Always the next civil rights fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1715
01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.960
<v Speaker 4>The civil rights fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does immigration or the civil rights </v>

1716
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:08.960
<v Speaker 4>fight is gay marriage or the civil </v>
<v Speaker 4>rights fight is transgenders.</v>

1717
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about this?</v>

1718
01:09:09.351 --> 01:09:14.351
<v Speaker 4>How about there was only one real civil </v>
<v Speaker 4>rights fight and it was about black </v>

1719
01:09:14.351 --> 01:09:16.481
<v Speaker 4>people who had been historically </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressed in the United States for 200 </v>

1720
01:09:16.481 --> 01:09:16.481
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1721
01:09:16.481 --> 01:09:18.380
<v Speaker 4>There had been slaves who had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaves and the transgenders.</v>

1722
01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:19.940
<v Speaker 4>This is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1723
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:24.941
<v Speaker 4>The worst that caitlyn jenner had </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced as being incredibly wealthy </v>

1724
01:09:24.941 --> 01:09:24.941
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

1725
01:09:24.941 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 4>in a high net worth suburb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This transgender people don't,</v>

1726
01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't discriminated against in some,</v>

1727
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:31.490
<v Speaker 4>in some areas of american life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that's true,</v>

1728
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:36.730
<v Speaker 4>but it's also like behavior is not the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same as being born black or being born </v>

1729
01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.050
<v Speaker 4>asian or being born with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1730
01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.840
<v Speaker 4>a disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

1731
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:49.300
<v Speaker 4>if I'm a business owner and I hire you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're a man and you come in the </v>

1732
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.990
<v Speaker 4>next day and you're dressed in a woman's</v>
<v Speaker 4>clothing saying you're a woman,</v>

1733
01:09:50.991 --> 01:09:55.991
<v Speaker 4>but you still have a full beard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't see why I as a business </v>

1734
01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:59.021
<v Speaker 4>owner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm expected to eat the cost of that </v>

1735
01:09:59.021 --> 01:09:59.021
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems.</v>

1736
01:09:59.021 --> 01:09:59.021
<v Speaker 4>That seems bizarre to me.</v>

1737
01:09:59.021 --> 01:10:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Eat the costs is a great way to phrase </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1738
01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.330
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a dog in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1739
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:08.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was completely open and liberal about </v>

1740
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:10.911
<v Speaker 3>it until there was a case where a man </v>
<v Speaker 3>who had been a man for 30 years became a</v>

1741
01:10:11.821 --> 01:10:15.840
<v Speaker 3>woman for a little less than two years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then started mma fighting women.</v>

1742
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.600
<v Speaker 3>YeS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1743
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting the fuck out of these women and </v>

1744
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.230
<v Speaker 3>shy and not prOclaiming that he or she </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be a man because what it in </v>

1745
01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:31.551
<v Speaker 3>quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a medical condition that I did </v>

1746
01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:31.551
<v Speaker 3>not need to disclose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not,</v>

1747
01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking medical conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1748
01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.010
<v Speaker 3>And if you ever watched the fights when </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alan Fox,</v>

1749
01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:38.400
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't winning because she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>skillful.</v>

1750
01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.650
<v Speaker 3>She was fucking manhandling handling </v>
<v Speaker 3>these women.</v>

1751
01:10:40.651 --> 01:10:42.660
<v Speaker 3>It was ugly horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was horrible.</v>

1752
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.690
<v Speaker 4>It's like this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

1753
01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.840
<v Speaker 4>it's so funny how the transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement destroys the feminist movement </v>

1754
01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.350
<v Speaker 4>by living off of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sort of lies that the feminist </v>

1755
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:55.411
<v Speaker 4>movement promulgated to the feminist </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement said stupid things like women </v>

1756
01:10:55.411 --> 01:10:56.630
<v Speaker 4>and men equally athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>proficient with that</v>

1757
01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:01.410
<v Speaker 3>repeated very recently that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological difference in the genders and</v>

1758
01:11:01.411 --> 01:11:02.280
<v Speaker 3>it's all social.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

1759
01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.660
<v Speaker 4>absolute horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1760
01:11:03.661 --> 01:11:08.661
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no scientific evidence to back </v>

1761
01:11:08.661 --> 01:11:11.391
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's particularly true with regard </v>

1762
01:11:11.391 --> 01:11:13.011
<v Speaker 4>to actual physical capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just nonsense that just no </v>

1763
01:11:13.011 --> 01:11:13.360
<v Speaker 4>scientific evidence but a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1764
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean mountain of my favorite study on </v>

1765
01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:18.520
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

1766
01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.290
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember there was that those </v>

1767
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.290
<v Speaker 4>commercials about like throwing like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl running like a girl.</v>

1768
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Remember those feminist commercials </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying what is it to be running like a </v>

1769
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.711
<v Speaker 4>girl named shown an adult woman and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd be running on early and then they </v>

1770
01:11:27.711 --> 01:11:28.410
<v Speaker 4>would show little girl and she's running</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's still a little girly,</v>

1771
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 4>but she's running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1772
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.950
<v Speaker 4>like normally it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only exactly fierce.</v>

1773
01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:34.560
<v Speaker 4>It's the only society that has forced </v>
<v Speaker 4>the little girl to run.</v>

1774
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:35.190
<v Speaker 4>Like when we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1775
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:40.191
<v Speaker 4>I have a three year old girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She runs like a girl second of all and </v>

1776
01:11:40.191 --> 01:11:44.941
<v Speaker 4>it's not because I'm teaching her that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because her mom runs cause she doesn't </v>

1777
01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:44.941
<v Speaker 4>write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she played with dolls because you're</v>

1778
01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:45.180
<v Speaker 4>a sexist pig.</v>

1779
01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.210
<v Speaker 4>It's because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

1780
01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.050
<v Speaker 4>my daughter started off liking trucks </v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the first year and I didn't give</v>

1781
01:11:49.051 --> 01:11:54.051
<v Speaker 4>a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now she likes playing with dolls and </v>

1782
01:11:54.051 --> 01:11:54.051
<v Speaker 4>dressing up in princess dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like who cares?</v>

1783
01:11:54.051 --> 01:11:54.051
<v Speaker 4>She's a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's always been a girl.</v>

1784
01:11:54.051 --> 01:11:55.850
<v Speaker 4>She will always be a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that she likes trucks or whether she</v>

1785
01:11:55.851 --> 01:11:57.720
<v Speaker 4>likes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an issue with one of my daughters</v>

1786
01:11:57.721 --> 01:12:02.721
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My daughter was a little worried about </v>

1787
01:12:02.721 --> 01:12:02.721
<v Speaker 4>argos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's going to be a dyke.</v>

1788
01:12:02.721 --> 01:12:02.721
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1789
01:12:02.721 --> 01:12:03.420
<v Speaker 4>what's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like lesbians,</v>

1790
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.830
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

1791
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:06.990
<v Speaker 4>I do not care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

1792
01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:09.060
<v Speaker 4>and then she turned the corner and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>she got.</v>

1793
01:12:09.061 --> 01:12:10.800
<v Speaker 4>But we just let her be whatever she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1794
01:12:10.801 --> 01:12:12.720
<v Speaker 4>But she was really into like batman for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile,</v>

1795
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:18.010
<v Speaker 4>but my daughter is in a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she was into wonder woman like </v>

1796
01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:18.010
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>

1797
01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 4>But what's funny about this is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>left kept saying,</v>

1798
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.730
<v Speaker 4>even when I met my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1799
01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:22.140
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a conservative,</v>

1800
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 4>and I made her more conservative when we</v>
<v Speaker 4>got married,</v>

1801
01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:26.940
<v Speaker 4>because that's what men tend to do to </v>
<v Speaker 4>their lives,</v>

1802
01:12:26.941 --> 01:12:28.500
<v Speaker 4>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she,</v>

1803
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:31.800
<v Speaker 4>I remember early on we had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation about this and I said,</v>

1804
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.220
<v Speaker 4>women don't throw like men and she got </v>
<v Speaker 4>like all offended and I said,</v>

1805
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:36.540
<v Speaker 4>but that's factually true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Said rigHt?</v>

1806
01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 4>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's insulting.</v>

1807
01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:38.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1808
01:12:38.311 --> 01:12:41.120
<v Speaker 4>that's factually true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm sorry,</v>

1809
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 4>like there've been studies out of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand,</v>

1810
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.280
<v Speaker 4>if you took a woman throwing a baseball </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then a thousand men throwing a </v>

1811
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.491
<v Speaker 4>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman will throw faster than out of </v>

1812
01:12:52.491 --> 01:12:52.491
<v Speaker 4>those thousand men is in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sports gene,</v>

1813
01:12:52.491 --> 01:12:56.120
<v Speaker 4>the one who will throw faster than two </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those men out of a thousand.</v>

1814
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.110
<v Speaker 4>And we're not talking about like goose </v>
<v Speaker 4>gossage here.</v>

1815
01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:03.110
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about the accountant from </v>

1816
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.110
<v Speaker 4>down the block.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about Paul Ryan flinging a</v>

1817
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.280
<v Speaker 4>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1818
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:04.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the way this stuff works.</v>

1819
01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:07.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the counter that found fox used</v>

1820
01:13:07.561 --> 01:13:12.561
<v Speaker 4>was that she actually lost to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She lost a woman named ashley evan </v>

1821
01:13:12.561 --> 01:13:12.720
<v Speaker 4>smith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what I said was,</v>

1822
01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:17.721
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this proves my point is that you're not </v>

1823
01:13:17.721 --> 01:13:17.721
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just a man.</v>

1824
01:13:17.721 --> 01:13:21.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was the john mcenroe got slapped </v>

1825
01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:21.860
<v Speaker 4>all over the lot when he saId about </v>
<v Speaker 4>serena williams.</v>

1826
01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:22.890
<v Speaker 4>She's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of them is great and all.</v>

1827
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:28.070
<v Speaker 4>But if serena williams were compete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said she's the best female player </v>

1828
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.070
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

1829
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not just the best player ever?</v>

1830
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:29.520
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she's a woman,</v>

1831
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 4>like if you were a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd get her ass kicked.</v>

1832
01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:33.210
<v Speaker 4>And everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1833
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 4>how dare you.</v>

1834
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:39.080
<v Speaker 4>There is something called the universal </v>
<v Speaker 4>tennis ranking should rank in the mid </v>

1835
01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.940
<v Speaker 4>ranks of college male players.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were a man and serena williams,</v>

1836
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:45.950
<v Speaker 4>It's like five years ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never want to play with like andy </v>

1837
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.950
<v Speaker 4>roddick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd kill me.</v>

1838
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:49.430
<v Speaker 4>She actually did this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a 200th rank man in the world </v>

1839
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:52.040
<v Speaker 4>who she wanted to just warm up with and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they played a like just a normal match </v>

1840
01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.200
<v Speaker 4>for a one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

1841
01:13:53.201 --> 01:13:54.570
<v Speaker 4>one six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing right.</v>

1842
01:13:54.571 --> 01:13:57.480
<v Speaker 4>And he was and he was like ranked 200th </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world and the only shock was that</v>

1843
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:59.010
<v Speaker 4>he dropped a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dropped a point to her.</v>

1844
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was the issue of renee richards,</v>

1845
01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:06.321
<v Speaker 4>when renee richards started playing </v>
<v Speaker 4>tennis against women and kicking their </v>

1846
01:14:06.321 --> 01:14:09.441
<v Speaker 4>ass and he was a middling player at best</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a woman or as a man rather.</v>

1847
01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 4>But as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a fucking killer.</v>

1848
01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:15.050
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what you didn't solve.</v>

1849
01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 4>Feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It turns out the caitlyn jenner,</v>

1850
01:14:16.391 --> 01:14:21.391
<v Speaker 4>when all these hero of the year awards </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything we met are so great that </v>

1851
01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 4>even when we decided to be women were </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than women.</v>

1852
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:26.971
<v Speaker 4>I was a woman for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's amazing and incredible addict.</v>

1853
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.330
<v Speaker 4>He's just using natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a gold member.</v>

1854
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:34.350
<v Speaker 4>Better even at being women than women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know wonder feminists are pissed </v>

1855
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.350
<v Speaker 4>and they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1856
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:38.191
<v Speaker 4>and this whole glossing over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between feminists who have </v>

1857
01:14:38.191 --> 01:14:41.551
<v Speaker 4>been claiming that women are distinct </v>
<v Speaker 4>from men and important and different and</v>

1858
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:46.681
<v Speaker 4>better in certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't understand how you hold </v>

1859
01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:48.571
<v Speaker 4>these two simultaneous thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary clinton needs to be president </v>

1860
01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:48.670
<v Speaker 4>because we need a female president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also Donald Trump,</v>

1861
01:14:48.671 --> 01:14:50.350
<v Speaker 4>if he said he was a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow would be a woman.</v>

1862
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.700
<v Speaker 4>How Do you hold those two simultaneous </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought?</v>

1863
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:57.900
<v Speaker 4>I always thought that in the last week </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the election of trump thought he was </v>

1864
01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.211
<v Speaker 4>gonna lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should have just declared himself a </v>

1865
01:15:00.211 --> 01:15:00.211
<v Speaker 4>woman and then he too could have run the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first female president.</v>

1866
01:15:00.211 --> 01:15:04.550
<v Speaker 4>I would have been incredible trailer if </v>
<v Speaker 4>he just showed up on the dress and the </v>

1867
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.550
<v Speaker 4>entire left</v>

1868
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:06.670
<v Speaker 5>fires a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the best looking woman ever.</v>

1869
01:15:06.671 --> 01:15:11.671
<v Speaker 5>I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been voted as the best looking </v>

1870
01:15:11.671 --> 01:15:13.141
<v Speaker 5>woman of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great arguments that I got it online </v>

1871
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.300
<v Speaker 5>when wasn't even arguments and put it so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many people were calling me a bigot </v>

1872
01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:18.300
<v Speaker 5>because of this fallon fox thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

1873
01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 5>It was stunning because it was so </v>
<v Speaker 5>confusing to me.</v>

1874
01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:23.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about defending a biological</v>

1875
01:15:23.531 --> 01:15:26.020
<v Speaker 5>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like these biological women,</v>

1876
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:31.021
<v Speaker 5>at least two of them got the fuck beaten</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of them by found fox before they </v>

1877
01:15:31.021 --> 01:15:33.250
<v Speaker 5>found out that she used to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1878
01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:36.460
<v Speaker 5>that's not an issue to these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so this one woman said,</v>

1879
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:38.290
<v Speaker 5>she's always been a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>

1880
01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:40.240
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She gave birth.</v>

1881
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 5>She impregnated a woman and got her </v>
<v Speaker 5>pregnant.</v>

1882
01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.070
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about that?</v>

1883
01:15:44.071 --> 01:15:46.410
<v Speaker 5>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even then he didn't.</v>

1884
01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Then she was a woman.</v>

1885
01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:52.260
<v Speaker 5>She was a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She went and she was fucking a woman </v>

1886
01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:54.301
<v Speaker 5>with her dick and getting that woman </v>
<v Speaker 5>pregnant like we are in fantasy land.</v>

1887
01:15:55.070 --> 01:16:00.070
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy town,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this doesn't mean this is what's </v>

1888
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:03.031
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like yOu can't just because something's </v>

1889
01:16:03.031 --> 01:16:05.431
<v Speaker 5>a logical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't just decide that someone's a </v>

1890
01:16:05.431 --> 01:16:07.420
<v Speaker 5>bigot like you were in a weird area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about bone structure and </v>

1891
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:09.350
<v Speaker 5>here's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>ToDay they are.</v>

1892
01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.020
<v Speaker 5>Here's the crazy thing is that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>always rely on these gender reassignment</v>

1893
01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:18.280
<v Speaker 5>doctors to define the terms and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>really interesting because I got deep,</v>

1894
01:16:18.281 --> 01:16:23.281
<v Speaker 5>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep into the rabbit hole with this </v>

1895
01:16:23.281 --> 01:16:24.841
<v Speaker 5>because I was really shocked at how many</v>
<v Speaker 5>people were angry at me and there was </v>

1896
01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:28.921
<v Speaker 5>one doctor who is a board certified </v>
<v Speaker 5>endocrinologist who's sort of broke it </v>

1897
01:16:28.921 --> 01:16:28.921
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

1898
01:16:28.921 --> 01:16:30.790
<v Speaker 5>not only is the science behind this </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy,</v>

1899
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.700
<v Speaker 5>but when you have gender reassignment </v>
<v Speaker 5>surgery,</v>

1900
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:38.050
<v Speaker 5>one of the big issues with men </v>
<v Speaker 5>transitioning to women as bone density.</v>

1901
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:43.300
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you have gender reassignment </v>

1902
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:43.300
<v Speaker 5>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're taking estrogen,</v>

1903
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.590
<v Speaker 5>which actually preserves bone density.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

1904
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.950
<v Speaker 5>not only do they have less bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once they become a woman,</v>

1905
01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.810
<v Speaker 5>they might have more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1906
01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:55.010
<v Speaker 5>because you're preserving it like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to automatically be </v>

1907
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.260
<v Speaker 5>just like a woman in a year or so.</v>

1908
01:16:56.510 --> 01:17:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Don't think surgeons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know too much about doctoring from </v>

1909
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:04.621
<v Speaker 4>having spent 1000 years with my wife's </v>
<v Speaker 4>medical education to believe that </v>

1910
01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:05.620
<v Speaker 4>doctors have the capacity to magically </v>
<v Speaker 4>change a man into a woman.</v>

1911
01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:06.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1912
01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:11.510
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's going to happen one day with </v>
<v Speaker 5>like crispr or something that when they </v>

1913
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:13.370
<v Speaker 5>start using genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally genetic before birth.</v>

1914
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:16.040
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if you actually read the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chromoSome this before birth,</v>

1915
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:18.350
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like no once.</v>

1916
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.670
<v Speaker 4>Once your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once your genes had been defined.</v>

1917
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:23.860
<v Speaker 4>What's your chromosomes like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is fifth grade science people.</v>

1918
01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 4>it's fifth grade science.</v>

1919
01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:29.970
<v Speaker 5>What scares the shit out of me is when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you hear these stories about people </v>

1920
01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:31.800
<v Speaker 5>deciding that their child who's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight or nine years old,</v>

1921
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:36.830
<v Speaker 5>that beyond belief,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's scary because you see nine year </v>

1922
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.830
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>17 year old doesn't know.</v>

1923
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:38.370
<v Speaker 5>That was the thing about the ruby rose </v>
<v Speaker 5>girl.</v>

1924
01:17:38.371 --> 01:17:40.810
<v Speaker 5>She was saying that when she was young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when she was a teenager,</v>

1925
01:17:40.811 --> 01:17:45.811
<v Speaker 5>she wanted to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She wanted to be transgender and that </v>

1926
01:17:45.811 --> 01:17:48.901
<v Speaker 5>she had gone through that phase and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's so happy that she didn't do </v>

1927
01:17:48.901 --> 01:17:48.901
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

1928
01:17:48.901 --> 01:17:48.901
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they did.</v>

1929
01:17:48.901 --> 01:17:52.350
<v Speaker 4>They say that 80 percent of kids who </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced any sort of gender dysphoria</v>

1930
01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:57.380
<v Speaker 4>as children grow out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you have a society that </v>

1931
01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:58.500
<v Speaker 4>reinforces it and then in Canada they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>now having their passing laws.</v>

1932
01:17:58.501 --> 01:18:03.501
<v Speaker 4>Now that say that if a kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you have a girl and the girl </v>

1933
01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:03.501
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a boy and she's three,</v>

1934
01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:06.120
<v Speaker 4>that the government can come into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and take the kid because obviously</v>

1935
01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 4>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't want to humor the kid and </v>

1936
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:11.700
<v Speaker 4>get the kid treatment or surgery or </v>
<v Speaker 4>hormone blockers,</v>

1937
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.710
<v Speaker 4>then you're obviously doing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong to the kid.</v>

1938
01:18:13.711 --> 01:18:15.720
<v Speaker 4>This is just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

1939
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:17.490
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if anyone tried to do that with my kid,</v>

1940
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:18.540
<v Speaker 4>I would meet them at the door with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gun.</v>

1941
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:19.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this is.</v>

1942
01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:22.620
<v Speaker 4>This is the kind of stuff where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking legit civil war.</v>

1943
01:18:22.621 --> 01:18:27.621
<v Speaker 4>Like when when you say that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government can take people's kids from </v>

1944
01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:27.621
<v Speaker 4>them because the government knows better</v>
<v Speaker 4>than you.</v>

1945
01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:32.061
<v Speaker 4>How to parent your kids on basic things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like are you a boy or a girl that's </v>

1946
01:18:32.061 --> 01:18:36.541
<v Speaker 4>going to get violent pretty quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you send someone to my door with a </v>

1947
01:18:36.541 --> 01:18:38.811
<v Speaker 4>gun saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking your daughter from you </v>

1948
01:18:38.811 --> 01:18:40.581
<v Speaker 4>because your daughter says she's a boy </v>
<v Speaker 4>at school and you and you're not going </v>

1949
01:18:40.581 --> 01:18:41.670
<v Speaker 4>to take her to a psychiatrist to start </v>
<v Speaker 4>her transitioning process.</v>

1950
01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:48.090
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>buT how did we get so far down this </v>

1951
01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:48.730
<v Speaker 5>rabbit hole of insanity and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is again,</v>

1952
01:18:48.731 --> 01:18:53.731
<v Speaker 5>this is not taking away the personal </v>
<v Speaker 5>choice of a 60 year old man like bruce </v>

1953
01:18:53.731 --> 01:18:55.420
<v Speaker 5>jenner who decides he wants to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman free country,</v>

1954
01:18:55.450 --> 01:18:57.310
<v Speaker 5>go have at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a good time,</v>

1955
01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:02.610
<v Speaker 5>but how did we get so crazy that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes an option that people aren't </v>

1956
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.970
<v Speaker 5>paying attention to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1957
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:09.990
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the massive variables that a child </v>

1958
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.760
<v Speaker 5>encounters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological variables,</v>

1959
01:19:10.761 --> 01:19:13.330
<v Speaker 5>stress variables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on in the home,</v>

1960
01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:16.030
<v Speaker 5>what's happening hormonally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's happening psychologically,</v>

1961
01:19:16.031 --> 01:19:20.260
<v Speaker 5>what is happening to you and how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can you decide like this is it,</v>

1962
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:25.450
<v Speaker 5>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to allow this kid to make </v>

1963
01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:26.140
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a lockdown decision to begin gender</v>

1964
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:31.350
<v Speaker 5>transition surgery at like nine or 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years old hormone blockers in there to </v>

1965
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.350
<v Speaker 5>an eight year old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:34.420
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they'll show you like this girl</v>

1967
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:38.050
<v Speaker 5>who's like 13 who used to be a boy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1968
01:19:38.051 --> 01:19:42.770
<v Speaker 5>you see her act and talk and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how could you imagine that?</v>

1969
01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:44.830
<v Speaker 5>This isn't a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1970
01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:45.790
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1971
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1972
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:47.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1973
01:19:47.501 --> 01:19:49.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't know what happened.</v>

1974
01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:54.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a y chromosome in every cell of </v>

1975
01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.711
<v Speaker 4>that person's body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except ironically for some of his sperm </v>

1976
01:19:56.711 --> 01:19:56.711
<v Speaker 4>cells to tell me that that's probably a </v>
<v Speaker 4>boy.</v>

1977
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:57.620
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yes,</v>

1978
01:19:57.621 --> 01:20:02.621
<v Speaker 4>you can block the manifestation of some </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical characteristics that does not </v>

1979
01:20:02.621 --> 01:20:06.161
<v Speaker 4>change the chromosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are legitimately intersex </v>

1980
01:20:06.161 --> 01:20:06.161
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1981
01:20:06.161 --> 01:20:09.161
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are people who legitimately have </v>

1982
01:20:09.161 --> 01:20:09.161
<v Speaker 4>conditions like kleinfelter syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1983
01:20:09.161 --> 01:20:09.690
<v Speaker 4>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are actual biological things,</v>

1984
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:11.640
<v Speaker 4>but if you're telling me any boy can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a girl,</v>

1985
01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1986
01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:15.370
<v Speaker 4>The answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

1987
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 4>that's not biologically correct and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing any sort of service to </v>

1988
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:21.360
<v Speaker 4>a child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially evidence list.</v>

1989
01:20:21.361 --> 01:20:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1990
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:27.110
<v Speaker 4>you're doing no service to a child by </v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing bye by humoring what is </v>

1991
01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:30.310
<v Speaker 4>obviously a mental condition and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mental condition.</v>

1992
01:20:30.311 --> 01:20:30.940
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1993
01:20:30.941 --> 01:20:35.941
<v Speaker 4>linked 40 percent lifetime suicide rate </v>
<v Speaker 4>is higher than any other population on </v>

1994
01:20:35.941 --> 01:20:39.871
<v Speaker 4>planet earth by a whopping margin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean telling kids that we are going to</v>

1995
01:20:40.061 --> 01:20:45.061
<v Speaker 4>force you into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you express when you're five that </v>

1996
01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:48.031
<v Speaker 4>you think you're the opposite sex and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now at eight we're going to transition </v>

1997
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:50.431
<v Speaker 4>you into this and your suicide rate is </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same as somebody who didn't </v>

1998
01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:53.041
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Railroad is very similar to someone who </v>

1999
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:55.171
<v Speaker 4>didn't do that and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like this is somehow supposed to </v>

2000
01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:55.171
<v Speaker 4>benefit the person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2001
01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:57.040
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's beyond imagination.</v>

2002
01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.170
<v Speaker 4>I think it's cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's very strange</v>

2003
01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:04.540
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as someone who doesn't experience </v>

2004
01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:04.540
<v Speaker 5>gender dysphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to,</v>

2005
01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:09.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when someone's got some sort of an </v>

2006
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.290
<v Speaker 5>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>

2007
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:11.400
<v Speaker 5>whether you call it an issue or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>condition or whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2008
01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:13.920
<v Speaker 5>and I don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to be as,</v>

2009
01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:17.180
<v Speaker 5>as standoffish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to be as objective.</v>

2010
01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:21.450
<v Speaker 5>I tried to be as kind as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a weird one though.</v>

2011
01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:26.570
<v Speaker 5>This is a weird one because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's become some sort of a fad and any </v>

2012
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:28.830
<v Speaker 5>criticism of it whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even discussion of it,</v>

2013
01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.800
<v Speaker 5>you are labeled as a transphobic piece </v>
<v Speaker 5>of shit.</v>

2014
01:21:31.801 --> 01:21:31.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2015
01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:36.980
<v Speaker 4>I think it's only weird honestly because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's run into the weird sexual politics </v>

2016
01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:38.750
<v Speaker 4>that dominates in the country because if</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're to talk about anorexia,</v>

2017
01:21:38.751 --> 01:21:40.610
<v Speaker 4>which is a form of body dysphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2018
01:21:40.670 --> 01:21:41.820
<v Speaker 4>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if we were to talk about,</v>

2019
01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean there actually is something body </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity,</v>

2020
01:21:43.791 --> 01:21:44.900
<v Speaker 4>integrity disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2021
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Where people want to lose an arm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd be saying,</v>

2022
01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.270
<v Speaker 4>well the problem is in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not in your arm,</v>

2023
01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.580
<v Speaker 4>like chopping off your arm seems a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little extreme,</v>

2024
01:21:52.581 --> 01:21:54.110
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like go ahead.</v>

2025
01:21:54.111 --> 01:21:56.810
<v Speaker 4>But if you were a kid and it's and year </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't say,</v>

2026
01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.550
<v Speaker 4>oh well this kid's gonna suffer with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this their entire life.</v>

2027
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Let's just chop off their arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2028
01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Prevent them from developing like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is not an end to tell the entire society</v>

2029
01:22:05.331 --> 01:22:07.910
<v Speaker 4>that this is a positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good is is a whole nother thing.</v>

2030
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:10.760
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing to try and treat people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who have a disorder humanely.</v>

2031
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
<v Speaker 4>It's another thing to redefine the terms</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the entire civilization as well as </v>

2032
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.471
<v Speaker 4>biology in order to fit that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is valuing the subject of over the </v>

2033
01:22:20.471 --> 01:22:20.570
<v Speaker 4>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Science is objective.</v>

2034
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:22.880
<v Speaker 4>Your feelings about who you are is </v>
<v Speaker 4>subjective.</v>

2035
01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:28.210
<v Speaker 4>You can have those feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once you are trying to translate </v>

2036
01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:28.580
<v Speaker 4>those feelings into the objective </v>
<v Speaker 4>standard,</v>

2037
01:22:28.581 --> 01:22:30.710
<v Speaker 4>we almost told by now you're encroaching</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my territory.</v>

2038
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just you doing what you want to</v>

2039
01:22:32.751 --> 01:22:33.180
<v Speaker 4>do anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2040
01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:34.940
<v Speaker 4>you're telling me what I have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a different thing.</v>

2041
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2042
01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:35.750
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2043
01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:40.640
<v Speaker 5>when people say that there is this 40 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent suicide rate amongst transgender</v>

2044
01:22:40.641 --> 01:22:43.160
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of the arguments that I've heard</v>

2045
01:22:43.161 --> 01:22:45.270
<v Speaker 5>is it's because they're not accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard this too.</v>

2046
01:22:45.271 --> 01:22:45.440
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2047
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:50.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that if they were accepted and then </v>

2048
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.660
<v Speaker 5>they felt themselves and they felt loved</v>
<v Speaker 5>for their true self,</v>

2049
01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.970
<v Speaker 5>then it would be just like everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>else</v>

2050
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:56.240
<v Speaker 4>and I've seen no evidence to suggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>that if,</v>

2051
01:22:56.250 --> 01:23:01.250
<v Speaker 4>if there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there is a decrease based on </v>

2052
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.250
<v Speaker 4>treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's marginal at best.</v>

2053
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:02.380
<v Speaker 5>Dysphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

2054
01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 5>Is it uniform like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like to know like is like gender</v>

2055
01:23:05.831 --> 01:23:10.831
<v Speaker 5>dysphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it in a similar percentile as a </v>

2056
01:23:10.831 --> 01:23:15.480
<v Speaker 5>anorexia or what bodybuilders get or </v>
<v Speaker 5>what strippers get when they get triple </v>

2057
01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:15.580
<v Speaker 5>f tits,</v>

2058
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:21.010
<v Speaker 4>like the anorexic suicide rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dysphoria is a weird thing,</v>

2059
01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:21.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2060
01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:26.580
<v Speaker 4>it's it is that people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a girl that goes to my yoga </v>

2061
01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:28.180
<v Speaker 4>class that's anorexic and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>disturbing.</v>

2062
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:31.000
<v Speaker 4>It's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrifying.</v>

2063
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.140
<v Speaker 4>It's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And listen,</v>

2064
01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:37.141
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that we should mistreat </v>

2065
01:23:37.141 --> 01:23:37.141
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if again,</v>

2066
01:23:37.141 --> 01:23:40.380
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about an entire society </v>
<v Speaker 4>being forced to redefine basic </v>

2067
01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:44.160
<v Speaker 4>biological terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then like it be an adult like live,</v>

2068
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:48.580
<v Speaker 4>like live with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy to treat you with a.</v>

2069
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:51.280
<v Speaker 4>Listen what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would hire a transgender person,</v>

2070
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:56.550
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not going to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to change what reality is </v>

2071
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:57.550
<v Speaker 4>in order to humor you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you call yourself napoleon,</v>

2072
01:23:57.551 --> 01:23:59.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>call you napoleon napoleon.</v>

2073
01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Like this is not something I'm up for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you take</v>

2074
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:03.690
<v Speaker 5>going into consideration though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you were looking at this,</v>

2075
01:24:03.691 --> 01:24:05.320
<v Speaker 5>still goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if someone was really good at their</v>

2076
01:24:05.321 --> 01:24:09.460
<v Speaker 5>job and someone else was equally good at</v>
<v Speaker 5>their job but not transgender?</v>

2077
01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:12.340
<v Speaker 5>Would you lean towards the not </v>
<v Speaker 5>transgender person because you say,</v>

2078
01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:13.480
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the transgender person,</v>

2079
01:24:13.690 --> 01:24:16.270
<v Speaker 5>they're dealing with a host of </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological issues obviously.</v>

2080
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2081
01:24:16.721 --> 01:24:21.721
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that you would have to think </v>

2082
01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:21.721
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2083
01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:24.660
<v Speaker 4>typical aspects of reliability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the same way you would with any </v>

2084
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:24.660
<v Speaker 4>other mental disorder if you knew </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody was,</v>

2085
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:29.610
<v Speaker 4>was manic depressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is super common and you have </v>

2086
01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:29.610
<v Speaker 4>somebody who is equally qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not manic depRessive,</v>

2087
01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:30.990
<v Speaker 4>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that might have an effect on,</v>

2088
01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.380
<v Speaker 4>on how they do their job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.490
<v Speaker 4>so maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2090
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.430
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2091
01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:36.340
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had enough personal experience</v>

2092
01:24:36.341 --> 01:24:41.341
<v Speaker 4>with transgender people to know whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>it would impact a secretarial job or </v>

2093
01:24:41.341 --> 01:24:41.410
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not.</v>

2094
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:42.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably not.</v>

2095
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:46.180
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to pretend that like transgenders in the</v>

2096
01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.920
<v Speaker 4>military,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this seems to me like in a decision that</v>

2097
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 4>should be made my military people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually have to determine how much does</v>

2098
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:53.950
<v Speaker 4>this impact the job and if you already </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a group of people with a 40 percent</v>

2099
01:24:53.951 --> 01:24:57.980
<v Speaker 4>suicide rate who have high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 4>higher levels of instability,</v>

2100
01:24:57.981 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 4>is a group not individually as a group </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're choosing which groups to pick</v>

2101
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:06.451
<v Speaker 4>from to be on the front lines in small </v>
<v Speaker 4>units living under severe pressure for </v>

2102
01:25:06.551 --> 01:25:09.130
<v Speaker 4>months at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is that something that,</v>

2103
01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.030
<v Speaker 4>is that what you're going to go for or </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that something where you,</v>

2104
01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:15.670
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to overcome certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>presumptions in order to get theRe?</v>

2105
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tweeted</v>

2106
01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.210
<v Speaker 5>something that kristen beck wrote the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other day.</v>

2107
01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:22.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when the military band,</v>

2108
01:25:22.971 --> 01:25:24.760
<v Speaker 5>when trump apparently there was not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

2109
01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.120
<v Speaker 4>I know it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean based,</v>

2110
01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.250
<v Speaker 4>just to distract from the sessions </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2111
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.420
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2112
01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:30.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get to 10 minutes later he was back to</v>

2113
01:25:30.951 --> 01:25:35.951
<v Speaker 4>20 minute sessions here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was the part about that I didn't </v>

2114
01:25:35.951 --> 01:25:38.411
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I actually agree that there is a </v>

2115
01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:40.961
<v Speaker 4>question as to whether the military </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be recruiting transgender people </v>

2116
01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:41.680
<v Speaker 4>because I think that the military has </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly it.</v>

2117
01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:46.690
<v Speaker 4>It creates a bunch of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just questions about who showers </v>

2118
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:46.690
<v Speaker 4>with whom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also questions like,</v>

2119
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:47.030
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a transgender man.</v>

2120
01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Does he have to fill the female </v>
<v Speaker 4>standards of fitness or the male </v>

2121
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:52.120
<v Speaker 4>standards standards of fitness or like </v>
<v Speaker 4>these are actual questions,</v>

2122
01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:54.080
<v Speaker 4>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does it work with troop cohesion?</v>

2123
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a group of men and I have men.</v>

2124
01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.700
<v Speaker 4>He's technically a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's had you treat as a woman like </v>

2125
01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:01.700
<v Speaker 4>does he have to carry the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff?</v>

2126
01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Is the guy like how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2127
01:26:02.530 --> 01:26:07.530
<v Speaker 4>It does this the cost of gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>transition surgery and hormones and </v>

2128
01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:09.170
<v Speaker 4>psychologists like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that come into play at all here?</v>

2129
01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Would you recruit from the anorexic </v>
<v Speaker 4>community for the military?</v>

2130
01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.390
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are like real questions,</v>

2131
01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:19.690
<v Speaker 4>but that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why they commissioned a study </v>

2132
01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:19.690
<v Speaker 4>from general mad as hell at department </v>
<v Speaker 4>of defense.</v>

2133
01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:22.180
<v Speaker 4>He was going to look into all of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then give a report in six months and</v>

2134
01:26:22.181 --> 01:26:27.181
<v Speaker 4>trump just sort of tweeted it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree that I think that trump's </v>

2135
01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:27.181
<v Speaker 4>general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2136
01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:31.720
<v Speaker 4>his general attitude on it is probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>correct in terMs of what the military </v>

2137
01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:31.720
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing what,</v>

2138
01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.830
<v Speaker 4>what it's not there to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I don't agree with is how he </v>

2139
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:38.591
<v Speaker 4>did it at all because it's disrespectful</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the people in the military who are </v>

2140
01:26:38.591 --> 01:26:38.591
<v Speaker 4>transgender.</v>

2141
01:26:38.591 --> 01:26:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I wouldn't want to find out </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a tweet.</v>

2142
01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:42.650
<v Speaker 4>I want a better rationale then to tweets</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then we're back to.</v>

2143
01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:43.890
<v Speaker 4>And then we're back to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2144
01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:45.320
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2145
01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.150
<v Speaker 4>they're doing more than I am serving in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the military.</v>

2146
01:26:47.151 --> 01:26:52.151
<v Speaker 4>I didn't serve in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it would be pretty </v>

2147
01:26:52.151 --> 01:26:52.151
<v Speaker 4>hypocritical of me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2148
01:26:52.151 --> 01:26:54.800
<v Speaker 4>it's perfectly respectful to say in two </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweets you're out because that's the way</v>

2149
01:26:54.801 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 4>it is without any sort of supporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>argumentation.</v>

2150
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:58.760
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't actually implement a </v>
<v Speaker 4>policy.</v>

2151
01:26:58.761 --> 01:27:03.761
<v Speaker 4>He didn't give the policy to the defense</v>
<v Speaker 4>department so they could even implement </v>

2152
01:27:03.761 --> 01:27:06.401
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pentAgon says they're not </v>

2153
01:27:06.401 --> 01:27:06.401
<v Speaker 4>implementing it because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>a policy,</v>

2154
01:27:06.401 --> 01:27:07.490
<v Speaker 4>so as a pr thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this is a weirD pr thing,</v>

2155
01:27:07.491 --> 01:27:11.210
<v Speaker 4>but it really stirred up people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>designed to do.</v>

2156
01:27:11.211 --> 01:27:12.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

2157
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:17.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either that or he just felt like </v>

2158
01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:17.410
<v Speaker 4>tweeting.</v>

2159
01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:17.930
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what it was.</v>

2160
01:27:17.931 --> 01:27:22.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean he wanted to shift the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation and it was the funniest </v>

2161
01:27:22.931 --> 01:27:26.291
<v Speaker 4>thing about that is that he did it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>two tweets in the first half of the </v>

2162
01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:26.291
<v Speaker 4>tweet was in consultation with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>generals in my military experts.</v>

2163
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.360
<v Speaker 4>We have decided that we will no longer </v>
<v Speaker 4>accept ellipsis 10 minute gap </v>

2164
01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.940
<v Speaker 4>transgender people in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was a,</v>

2165
01:27:32.970 --> 01:27:37.970
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a story at buzzfeed that was </v>

2166
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:40.541
<v Speaker 4>kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went and interviewed a bunch of </v>

2167
01:27:40.541 --> 01:27:42.101
<v Speaker 4>people in the pentagon and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people in the pentagon or like </v>

2168
01:27:42.101 --> 01:27:45.100
<v Speaker 4>during that 10 minute cap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know whether we were going to </v>

2169
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:45.100
<v Speaker 4>nuclear war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what right.</v>

2170
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Because that first screen we will no </v>
<v Speaker 4>longer could have been north korea's </v>

2171
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.010
<v Speaker 4>missile missile test program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2172
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2173
01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:51.910
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2174
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 4>this again is evidence.</v>

2175
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.750
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2176
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:57.200
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an example of even if I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think the policy is good,</v>

2177
01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:02.410
<v Speaker 4>good policy done the wrong way is </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually counterproductive for the </v>

2178
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:02.410
<v Speaker 4>policies that I want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None,</v>

2179
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.480
<v Speaker 4>like I want it laid out by madison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to lay it out by defense </v>

2180
01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.731
<v Speaker 4>department.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want all the reasons laid out so we </v>

2181
01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:11.561
<v Speaker 4>can have a good discussion over it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really want Just like thought </v>

2182
01:28:11.561 --> 01:28:11.600
<v Speaker 4>vomit on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just not,</v>

2183
01:28:11.601 --> 01:28:12.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2184
01:28:12.651 --> 01:28:17.651
<v Speaker 4>it also seems that this issue is such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hot issue and it's also an issue that </v>

2185
01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:22.961
<v Speaker 4>you're not really allowed to have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion on other than the standard </v>

2186
01:28:22.961 --> 01:28:25.970
<v Speaker 4>opinion is always trapped in a man's </v>
<v Speaker 4>body and this is the way it is.</v>

2187
01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:28.210
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this heart healthy this day.</v>

2188
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Cardia notion that it's like a man then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2189
01:28:30.490 --> 01:28:32.690
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the soul in the machine.</v>

2190
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:37.640
<v Speaker 4>And there was a woman deep down for 40 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years we had three children with a man's</v>

2191
01:28:37.641 --> 01:28:42.641
<v Speaker 4>penis and now is now is escaping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like ghostbusters again goes </v>

2192
01:28:43.410 --> 01:28:46.730
<v Speaker 4>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've seen the man in england,</v>

2193
01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.440
<v Speaker 4>was it in england,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows Germany,</v>

2194
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.470
<v Speaker 4>the man identifies as a six year old </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>

2195
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:56.500
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they turned them into a six year </v>

2196
01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.121
<v Speaker 4>old girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's this clip that clip with me </v>

2197
01:28:58.121 --> 01:29:00.461
<v Speaker 4>that's going around the internet a fair </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit when I'm talking to a college girl </v>

2198
01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:00.461
<v Speaker 4>about this and she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's saying like,</v>

2199
01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 4>men or men can be women and women can be</v>
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>

2200
01:29:00.831 --> 01:29:01.230
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2201
01:29:01.231 --> 01:29:02.880
<v Speaker 4>how old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that clip.</v>

2202
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

2203
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:06.830
<v Speaker 4>why aren't your 60 actually six days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she,</v>

2204
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:12.110
<v Speaker 4>she's like baffled lIke what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it finally hits her and it's </v>

2205
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.110
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2206
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.570
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:17.600
<v Speaker 4>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is what's kind of </v>

2208
01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.120
<v Speaker 4>frightening about the age we live in is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can't even come up with common </v>

2209
01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.391
<v Speaker 4>definitions of basic things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are we Supposed to have </v>

2210
01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:25.221
<v Speaker 4>conversations with each other if we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't decide what a man is or what a </v>

2211
01:29:25.221 --> 01:29:25.920
<v Speaker 4>woman is or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whether a scientific fact ought to be</v>

2212
01:29:25.921 --> 01:29:30.921
<v Speaker 4>relevant or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least we could decide what was the </v>

2213
01:29:30.921 --> 01:29:35.211
<v Speaker 4>scientific fact or not before and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the subjective has just eaten </v>

2214
01:29:35.211 --> 01:29:35.580
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I don't think it's a scientific fact,</v>

2215
01:29:35.581 --> 01:29:36.750
<v Speaker 4>it's no longer a scientific fact</v>

2216
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:40.040
<v Speaker 3>and that's for amateurs of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's become About freedom,</v>

2217
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:43.350
<v Speaker 3>the freedom to be your authentic self </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus biology.</v>

2218
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:44.640
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

2219
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 4>be be be your authentic self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit.</v>

2220
01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.590
<v Speaker 4>They will do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

2221
01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:53.930
<v Speaker 4>more power to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is no longer about your freedom </v>

2222
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:56.631
<v Speaker 4>to be your authentic self when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about either the legislation </v>

2223
01:29:56.631 --> 01:29:58.050
<v Speaker 4>that impacts how I run my business or </v>
<v Speaker 4>how I raised my child or your suggesting</v>

2224
01:29:58.051 --> 01:30:00.300
<v Speaker 4>that it is my duty to humor your </v>
<v Speaker 4>authentic self.</v>

2225
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.000
<v Speaker 4>Like I think there are a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who do stupid crap their entire life.</v>

2226
01:30:03.001 --> 01:30:04.710
<v Speaker 4>It's not my job to humor their authentic</v>
<v Speaker 4>self.</v>

2227
01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:08.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pro drug legalization but I've never</v>

2228
01:30:08.401 --> 01:30:10.290
<v Speaker 4>done drugs and I think the drugs are </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>

2229
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:15.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't tell me that I have to like cheer </v>

2230
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.830
<v Speaker 4>when somebody smokes a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like do what you want,</v>

2231
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:20.541
<v Speaker 4>but don't tell me that I have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>redefine what I think is good and bad </v>

2232
01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:20.541
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>LIke that's silly.</v>

2233
01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2234
01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:26.120
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that it became this </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird political hot point where we're </v>

2235
01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.210
<v Speaker 3>talking about bathrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:28.680
<v Speaker 3>And then it become like the number one.</v>

2237
01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:31.900
<v Speaker 4>It was easy for people to sort of boil </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the argument into that I think,</v>

2238
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:32.050
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2239
01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.080
<v Speaker 3>of course like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about my children?</v>

2240
01:30:34.081 --> 01:30:39.081
<v Speaker 3>My children would you want a bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a man with a dress is going to come </v>

2241
01:30:39.081 --> 01:30:39.210
<v Speaker 3>in and he's going to claim that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>identifying as a woman.</v>

2242
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:44.840
<v Speaker 3>And it got to the point where so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were upset about it that people </v>

2243
01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:45.510
<v Speaker 3>were boycotting South Carolina.</v>

2244
01:30:47.210 --> 01:30:52.210
<v Speaker 4>This one I thought was amazing was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the ncaa saying they were going to </v>

2245
01:30:52.210 --> 01:30:55.961
<v Speaker 4>remove the final four from North </v>
<v Speaker 4>Carolina because they passed the </v>

2246
01:30:55.961 --> 01:30:57.200
<v Speaker 4>bathroom bill in North Carolina and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked online,</v>

2247
01:30:57.201 --> 01:31:02.201
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when are you going to abolish the </v>

2248
01:31:02.201 --> 01:31:02.201
<v Speaker 4>separate male and female divisions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of the ncaa,</v>

2249
01:31:02.201 --> 01:31:06.760
<v Speaker 4>like any you've said that we can't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate male and female bathrooms were </v>

2250
01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:09.610
<v Speaker 4>biological males play and biological </v>
<v Speaker 4>males go to one bathroom and biological </v>

2251
01:31:09.610 --> 01:31:11.360
<v Speaker 4>females go to another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why do you have separate divisions?</v>

2252
01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:13.310
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have an ncaa women's division</v>

2253
01:31:13.311 --> 01:31:15.350
<v Speaker 4>and an ncaa men's division?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2254
01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.670
<v Speaker 4>Where does this go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean eventually it boiled down.</v>

2255
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:22.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean eventually it goes to one place </v>
<v Speaker 4>or another.</v>

2256
01:31:22.191 --> 01:31:24.920
<v Speaker 4>Like either we just say this is a step </v>
<v Speaker 4>too far.</v>

2257
01:31:24.921 --> 01:31:26.060
<v Speaker 4>It gives me a break,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2258
01:31:26.061 --> 01:31:31.061
<v Speaker 4>science has no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or we say anyone can be anything at </v>

2259
01:31:31.061 --> 01:31:34.430
<v Speaker 4>anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A man is a woman and a woman as a man </v>

2260
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.430
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in just pick have you.</v>

2261
01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.920
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing the videos of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are gender fluid.</v>

2262
01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I have seen those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those videos are fascinating.</v>

2263
01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:43.790
<v Speaker 3>They wake up one day and there were a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman and the next day there are man.</v>

2264
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000
<v Speaker 3>And so there was a guy on npr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on radio lab on the podcast who </v>

2265
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:54.610
<v Speaker 3>transitions at times of stress makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect sense to me in the middle of </v>

2266
01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:55.670
<v Speaker 3>having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just switched.</v>

2267
01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm paul now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm amanda.</v>

2268
01:31:57.940 --> 01:31:58.330
<v Speaker 3>When</v>

2269
01:31:58.330 --> 01:32:03.330
<v Speaker 4>he's more stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he switched into a woman because that'd </v>

2270
01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:03.330
<v Speaker 4>be really sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2271
01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:06.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that like if you're stressed at </v>

2272
01:32:06.031 --> 01:32:06.031
<v Speaker 4>work and he switched into a woman and </v>
<v Speaker 4>started crying,</v>

2273
01:32:06.031 --> 01:32:09.570
<v Speaker 4>that seems kind of sexist to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's implying that women are the </v>

2274
01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:09.570
<v Speaker 4>people who cry at work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that is sex.</v>

2275
01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:10.780
<v Speaker 4>So this raises a bunch of other weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions like,</v>

2276
01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:12.190
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're like there's,</v>

2277
01:32:12.191 --> 01:32:14.290
<v Speaker 4>there's been this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>again you want to talk about weird.</v>

2278
01:32:14.291 --> 01:32:15.000
<v Speaker 4>There's been this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2279
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:20.070
<v Speaker 4>this weird push in parts of the trans </v>
<v Speaker 4>community to suggest that a male who </v>

2280
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:23.230
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to have sex with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological male who says he's a female,</v>

2281
01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 4>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is now a sexist against women?</v>

2282
01:32:27.570 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 4>Is it trans folk?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2283
01:32:28.601 --> 01:32:31.320
<v Speaker 4>you're a bad person if you're a man who </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to have sex with a man,</v>

2284
01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:33.820
<v Speaker 4>a biological man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't make you gay to do that.</v>

2285
01:32:33.821 --> 01:32:38.821
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have sex with a biological man </v>

2286
01:32:38.821 --> 01:32:38.821
<v Speaker 4>who says it's a woman that's straight </v>
<v Speaker 4>sex,</v>

2287
01:32:38.821 --> 01:32:39.640
<v Speaker 4>but if you were to have sex with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological woman who says she's a man,</v>

2288
01:32:39.730 --> 01:32:40.210
<v Speaker 4>you're gay.</v>

2289
01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of weird.</v>

2290
01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Definitely weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have seen the arguments in the </v>

2291
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:52.030
<v Speaker 3>blog Posts and the tweets about men who </v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminate against trans women who do </v>

2292
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:53.390
<v Speaker 3>not want to date trans women</v>

2293
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.490
<v Speaker 4>and people keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2294
01:32:54.491 --> 01:32:55.470
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's culturally defined.</v>

2295
01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:55.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2296
01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.960
<v Speaker 4>That's called evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2297
01:32:58.010 --> 01:33:00.160
<v Speaker 4>You have a baby together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct?</v>

2298
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It turns out that evolution wants men to</v>

2299
01:33:02.771 --> 01:33:04.180
<v Speaker 4>have sex with women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2300
01:33:04.181 --> 01:33:09.181
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry to break it to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but evolution really relies on human </v>

2301
01:33:09.181 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 4>reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2302
01:33:10.061 --> 01:33:11.260
<v Speaker 4>If you put that thing in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

2303
01:33:11.261 --> 01:33:13.950
<v Speaker 4>it ain't going to reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's just salary.</v>

2304
01:33:13.951 --> 01:33:18.951
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I have to keep </v>

2305
01:33:18.951 --> 01:33:20.731
<v Speaker 4>apologizing for science and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they say that my party is the </v>

2306
01:33:20.731 --> 01:33:21.940
<v Speaker 4>party of non science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2307
01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Like you're the ones who say that two </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes before my baby is born,</v>

2308
01:33:24.491 --> 01:33:26.620
<v Speaker 4>it's not a baby and a man can be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

2309
01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:28.400
<v Speaker 4>but I'm anti science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>

2310
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:30.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm am wildly confused by this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2311
01:33:30.491 --> 01:33:30.970
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing is</v>

2312
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 3>wildly confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2313
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's just such a strange subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a strange subject that's been </v>

2314
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.391
<v Speaker 3>brought to the fore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's about more of the moral </v>

2315
01:33:41.391 --> 01:33:41.550
<v Speaker 3>posturing than it is about people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually think this is a major issue.</v>

2316
01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:44.490
<v Speaker 3>I think you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think people love to be virtuous.</v>

2317
01:33:44.491 --> 01:33:47.040
<v Speaker 3>They'd love to be on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live to virtue signal.</v>

2318
01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:52.130
<v Speaker 3>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dare you with dick's or lack of fake</v>

2319
01:33:53.491 --> 01:33:55.170
<v Speaker 3>dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really have a lot of fake</v>

2320
01:33:55.171 --> 01:33:56.790
<v Speaker 3>dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really go that far.</v>

2321
01:33:57.210 --> 01:33:59.760
<v Speaker 3>They just sort of take testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see what's up.</v>

2322
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:02.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2323
01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:06.710
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird facet of our society today </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is unexpected.</v>

2324
01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean you go back 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years and it was an oddity and you </v>

2325
01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:12.750
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even during the renee richards thing,</v>

2326
01:34:12.751 --> 01:34:14.520
<v Speaker 3>it was more of an oddity than anything</v>

2327
01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:19.730
<v Speaker 4>I think just sort of accepted that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why I say I think that it's a </v>

2328
01:34:19.730 --> 01:34:22.840
<v Speaker 4>think that a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtue signaling are still treating it </v>

2329
01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:22.840
<v Speaker 4>as an oddity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just won't admit that.</v>

2330
01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.530
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're watching it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a circus to them and I think that's</v>

2331
01:34:24.531 --> 01:34:29.531
<v Speaker 4>actually cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that you should like put </v>

2332
01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:29.531
<v Speaker 4>people who suffer from mental illness on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cover of magazines.</v>

2333
01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:31.370
<v Speaker 4>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's bad strategy.</v>

2334
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:33.690
<v Speaker 4>What about bodybuilders?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2335
01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be honest with you.</v>

2336
01:34:35.001 --> 01:34:36.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that much about </v>
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilding.</v>

2337
01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:36.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they don't.</v>

2338
01:34:36.561 --> 01:34:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Do I look like I know that much about</v>

2339
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.380
<v Speaker 3>the argument that I've heard of crossfit</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2340
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:46.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm more of a marathon runner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I've heard the argument about </v>

2341
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:51.070
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilders that they suffer from it as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well is that in order to get that big,</v>

2342
01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:55.120
<v Speaker 3>you almost have to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>body dysmorphia.</v>

2343
01:34:55.390 --> 01:35:00.390
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to not understand how insanely </v>

2344
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.390
<v Speaker 3>huge</v>

2345
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 2>you are and they'll be really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their argument is they're really into it</v>

2346
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:04.860
<v Speaker 2>and which makes sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard people say that,</v>

2347
01:35:04.861 --> 01:35:09.861
<v Speaker 2>that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like almost like a reverse </v>

2348
01:35:09.861 --> 01:35:11.861
<v Speaker 2>anorexia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never feel like they're big enough </v>

2349
01:35:11.861 --> 01:35:11.861
<v Speaker 2>that people say that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2350
01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that the human mind is </v>

2351
01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:17.810
<v Speaker 2>suspect or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects were really open to suggestion.</v>

2352
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Really open to suggestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what scares people about </v>

2353
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.970
<v Speaker 2>children transitioning for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2354
01:35:22.971 --> 01:35:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2355
01:35:23.511 --> 01:35:28.511
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it in everything including </v>

2356
01:35:28.511 --> 01:35:30.221
<v Speaker 2>fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how many dudes wax their chest now </v>

2357
01:35:30.221 --> 01:35:32.650
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes theiR chest or they waxing </v>

2358
01:35:32.650 --> 01:35:33.290
<v Speaker 2>to waxing jeff chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wax their chest whenever,</v>

2359
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:38.291
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions about the youth are turned to </v>

2360
01:35:38.291 --> 01:35:38.291
<v Speaker 2>young jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2361
01:35:38.291 --> 01:35:41.130
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you watch tv now and every dude on </v>

2362
01:35:41.130 --> 01:35:41.680
<v Speaker 2>tv has a chest as bare as my young 14 </v>
<v Speaker 2>month old son.</v>

2363
01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 2>So I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2364
01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.000
<v Speaker 2>where'd this come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this came from grades.</v>

2365
01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:48.290
<v Speaker 2>We'll look chiseled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also came from tv and tv.</v>

2366
01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:49.850
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be men are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hairless.</v>

2367
01:35:49.851 --> 01:35:54.851
<v Speaker 2>Now this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the new trend of men are going </v>

2368
01:35:54.851 --> 01:35:56.471
<v Speaker 2>to be hairless and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get the burt reynolds like </v>

2369
01:35:56.471 --> 01:35:58.910
<v Speaker 2>bare chest anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if people are susceptible to even</v>

2370
01:35:58.911 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 2>that with regard to fashion like people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have for for five years,</v>

2371
01:36:02.001 --> 01:36:07.001
<v Speaker 2>people convince themselves that skinny </v>
<v Speaker 2>jeans or thing like people are open to </v>

2372
01:36:07.001 --> 01:36:10.360
<v Speaker 2>to virtually any sort of suggestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bell bottoms that come in and come out </v>

2373
01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:10.360
<v Speaker 2>member when they try to bring bell </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottoms back.</v>

2374
01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I did or did not a good call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried and people are like,</v>

2375
01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:15.140
<v Speaker 2>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not this one.</v>

2376
01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Platforms when they used to be our </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform shoes that that's why I'm just </v>

2377
01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:21.080
<v Speaker 2>keeping around all my dad's old clothes </v>
<v Speaker 2>because eventually they're going to come</v>

2378
01:36:21.081 --> 01:36:21.620
<v Speaker 2>back in again.</v>

2379
01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2380
01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:28.280
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of fashion and culture also </v>

2381
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.711
<v Speaker 2>being like the saMe sort of mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>that allows people to be variable when </v>

2382
01:36:32.711 --> 01:36:34.680
<v Speaker 2>it comes to their gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2383
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean you actually see that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>

2384
01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a study in britain or Poland,</v>

2385
01:36:39.081 --> 01:36:44.081
<v Speaker 2>britain about sexual orientation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I found was 95 percent of people </v>

2386
01:36:44.081 --> 01:36:48.401
<v Speaker 2>over the age of 60 identified as </v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusively heterosexual of people who </v>

2387
01:36:48.401 --> 01:36:52.001
<v Speaker 2>are under the age of 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only 42 percent identified as </v>

2388
01:36:52.001 --> 01:36:52.001
<v Speaker 2>exclusively heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2389
01:36:52.001 --> 01:36:56.561
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in two generations it's not that </v>

2390
01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:56.561
<v Speaker 2>half the population became bisexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2391
01:36:56.561 --> 01:37:01.331
<v Speaker 2>That is not a scientific thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that people are open to </v>

2392
01:37:01.331 --> 01:37:01.331
<v Speaker 2>suggestion about their sexual behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you would assume.</v>

2393
01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2394
01:37:02.501 --> 01:37:07.501
<v Speaker 2>so assuming the culture has no impact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this goes against the whole of born </v>

2395
01:37:07.501 --> 01:37:11.141
<v Speaker 2>this way aspect of the homosexual rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and the gay rights movement </v>

2396
01:37:11.141 --> 01:37:11.141
<v Speaker 2>that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2397
01:37:11.141 --> 01:37:11.240
<v Speaker 2>you were born this way.</v>

2398
01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I agree that there's a genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>component to sexual behavior,</v>

2399
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:20.830
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why 50 percent of the uk population has </v>

2400
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:21.680
<v Speaker 2>shifted toward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2401
01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture has something to present at,</v>

2402
01:37:25.190 --> 01:37:30.190
<v Speaker 2>as I say 95 percent people over the age </v>
<v Speaker 2>of 60 and then 42 percent of people </v>

2403
01:37:30.190 --> 01:37:31.620
<v Speaker 2>under the age of 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>

2404
01:37:31.621 --> 01:37:34.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's 42 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that exclusively.</v>

2405
01:37:34.371 --> 01:37:35.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2406
01:37:35.181 --> 01:37:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Forty two percent of people say they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely,</v>

2407
01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.120
<v Speaker 2>extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely,</v>

2408
01:37:38.121 --> 01:37:40.260
<v Speaker 2>a heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely high forties,</v>

2409
01:37:40.630 --> 01:37:42.470
<v Speaker 2>exclusively heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 60 percent,</v>

2410
01:37:42.471 --> 01:37:47.471
<v Speaker 2>nearly 60 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>78 percent say that they are on the </v>

2411
01:37:47.471 --> 01:37:47.471
<v Speaker 2>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not exclusively heterosexual.</v>

2412
01:37:47.471 --> 01:37:51.911
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they only talk to women who </v>

2413
01:37:51.911 --> 01:37:54.221
<v Speaker 2>are drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like young drunk girls.</v>

2414
01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:59.370
<v Speaker 2>They get crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think also for perella thing,</v>

2415
01:37:59.371 --> 01:38:01.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where adam adam has a whole shtick about</v>

2416
01:38:01.231 --> 01:38:06.231
<v Speaker 2>like in the future there's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where guys are considered gay if </v>

2417
01:38:06.231 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 2>they won't kiss another dude.</v>

2418
01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you gay,</v>

2419
01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:10.050
<v Speaker 2>you afraid that your gay kiss another </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't show me you're not gay.</v>

2420
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.880
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've gone.</v>

2421
01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:14.010
<v Speaker 2>We've gone around the bend a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have.</v>

2422
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:20.030
<v Speaker 2>There's also this thing that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when you have to very clear </v>

2423
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.900
<v Speaker 2>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2424
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:25.910
<v Speaker 2>were you have teams and you sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>line in the sand not supposed to cross </v>

2425
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:29.691
<v Speaker 2>and there's the right side and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left side and we have that in this </v>

2426
01:38:29.691 --> 01:38:32.451
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really don't have a third party </v>

2427
01:38:32.451 --> 01:38:32.451
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No third parties are kind of a joke.</v>

2428
01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.090
<v Speaker 2>And whenever you have two opposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints,</v>

2429
01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.060
<v Speaker 2>people dig in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you,</v>

2430
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.710
<v Speaker 2>have you seen this new documentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2431
01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>William F.</v>

2432
01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Buckley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gore vidal.</v>

2433
01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:45.750
<v Speaker 2>And the debate is any good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

2434
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:50.250
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting debates they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the 1968 election.</v>

2435
01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.530
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating to watch some of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>

2436
01:38:52.531 --> 01:38:54.090
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's intense.</v>

2437
01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Particularly the little buckley </v>

2438
01:38:59.440 --> 01:38:59.440
<v Speaker 2>threatens to punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fit all queer and says,</v>

2439
01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:02.470
<v Speaker 2>I'll sock you in the face and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay plastic flask.</v>

2440
01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:05.910
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because it's a pastor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's spectacular.</v>

2441
01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:08.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's such a like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so in the,</v>

2442
01:39:08.170 --> 01:39:10.380
<v Speaker 2>the speak of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2443
01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:11.550
<v Speaker 2>like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>68,</v>

2444
01:39:11.630 --> 01:39:12.660
<v Speaker 2>the brahmin accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2445
01:39:12.661 --> 01:39:13.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

2446
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Like it's almost british accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2447
01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:17.040
<v Speaker 2>it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>

2448
01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:20.010
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these,</v>

2449
01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that thing,</v>

2450
01:39:22.171 --> 01:39:27.171
<v Speaker 2>this my team versus that team and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the left is guilty of it as much</v>

2451
01:39:28.321 --> 01:39:30.460
<v Speaker 2>as the writers guilty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's,</v>

2452
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:35.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a real issue where there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have ideas and opinions.</v>

2453
01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:38.100
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of cross party lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2454
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:40.920
<v Speaker 2>they vote on one side or another and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they vote for their team.</v>

2455
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

2456
01:39:43.170 --> 01:39:45.210
<v Speaker 2>especially in this last election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was true.</v>

2457
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:47.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that people felt so alienated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side,</v>

2458
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:49.770
<v Speaker 2>like to understand a lot of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>voted trump.</v>

2459
01:39:49.771 --> 01:39:54.771
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people in the country who felt </v>

2460
01:39:54.771 --> 01:39:57.741
<v Speaker 2>insulted by the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just sick of being called a </v>

2461
01:39:57.741 --> 01:39:57.741
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>

2462
01:39:57.741 --> 01:40:00.650
<v Speaker 2>homophobes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time someone wanting to advance a </v>

2463
01:40:00.650 --> 01:40:00.650
<v Speaker 2>policy on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they said,</v>

2464
01:40:00.650 --> 01:40:01.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw that,</v>

2465
01:40:01.171 --> 01:40:03.660
<v Speaker 2>or at least trump's not calling me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll do that,</v>

2466
01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:09.020
<v Speaker 2>and then there are a bunch of people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left who now feel insulted by </v>

2467
01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:10.110
<v Speaker 2>trump's even presence and they think all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who voted for trump are those</v>

2468
01:40:10.111 --> 01:40:12.210
<v Speaker 2>people until they're fighting racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism,</v>

2469
01:40:12.211 --> 01:40:14.010
<v Speaker 2>bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and homophobia by voting against trump.</v>

2470
01:40:14.011 --> 01:40:19.011
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go back to this at the end </v>

2471
01:40:19.011 --> 01:40:19.011
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a hardening of of it.</v>

2472
01:40:19.011 --> 01:40:19.380
<v Speaker 2>There's not one bubble in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still,</v>

2473
01:40:19.381 --> 01:40:24.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right likes to accuse the left of </v>

2474
01:40:24.381 --> 01:40:24.381
<v Speaker 2>being in a bubble in the coast.</v>

2475
01:40:24.381 --> 01:40:28.240
<v Speaker 2>There's a bubble on the right to which </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the idea that everybody on every </v>

2476
01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:28.340
<v Speaker 2>piece of the media is lying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2477
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Is fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's fake news.</v>

2478
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These bubbles are not healthy for the </v>

2479
01:40:35.690 --> 01:40:35.690
<v Speaker 2>republic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2480
01:40:35.690 --> 01:40:38.651
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't have conversations with each </v>

2481
01:40:38.651 --> 01:40:38.651
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we,</v>

2482
01:40:38.651 --> 01:40:40.701
<v Speaker 2>if we do this 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no deception is not healthy across the </v>

2483
01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:42.240
<v Speaker 2>board and there's another thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on where everybody's a nazi,</v>

2484
01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:47.930
<v Speaker 2>like I've never heard people called a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nazi more than i have over the last six </v>

2485
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:48.720
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2486
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:50.760
<v Speaker 2>it's been crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you support trump,</v>

2487
01:40:50.761 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you're a nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a neo nazi or you're somehow</v>

2488
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.270
<v Speaker 5>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a fascist.</v>

2489
01:40:55.271 --> 01:40:57.280
<v Speaker 5>If you didn't vote for hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a nazi.</v>

2490
01:40:57.281 --> 01:41:01.630
<v Speaker 5>Like some people have boiled it down to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like the purest form.</v>

2491
01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2492
01:41:03.031 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2493
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:09.090
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it demonstrates tremendous historical </v>

2494
01:41:09.090 --> 01:41:09.090
<v Speaker 4>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forget the holocaust.</v>

2495
01:41:09.090 --> 01:41:09.670
<v Speaker 4>Like you just look at what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who hitler was in the policies.</v>

2496
01:41:09.671 --> 01:41:11.230
<v Speaker 4>He promulgated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he was basically.</v>

2497
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.260
<v Speaker 4>He was all over the place when he wanted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk to socialist.</v>

2498
01:41:14.261 --> 01:41:19.261
<v Speaker 4>He was a socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you wanted to talk to </v>

2499
01:41:19.261 --> 01:41:19.261
<v Speaker 4>capitalist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a capitalist.</v>

2500
01:41:19.261 --> 01:41:21.841
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a top down government guy for </v>

2501
01:41:21.841 --> 01:41:21.841
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he would speak the language of,</v>

2502
01:41:21.841 --> 01:41:21.880
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2503
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 4>what would be considered the european </v>
<v Speaker 4>far right today on a lot of,</v>

2504
01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:31.020
<v Speaker 4>on a lot of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then he would talk about </v>

2505
01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.031
<v Speaker 4>redistribution of resources and </v>
<v Speaker 4>universal healthcare and all this kind </v>

2506
01:41:33.031 --> 01:41:33.031
<v Speaker 4>of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm moving guns,</v>

2507
01:41:33.031 --> 01:41:37.740
<v Speaker 4>but he's just a convenient club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just a convenient club </v>

2508
01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 4>because then and then did this part that</v>
<v Speaker 4>scares me.</v>

2509
01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:43.050
<v Speaker 4>Once you say that somebody is hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it actually becomes obligatory to </v>

2510
01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:44.110
<v Speaker 4>physically resist them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we can say,</v>

2511
01:41:44.111 --> 01:41:47.010
<v Speaker 4>you can't have a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 4>hitler once you say somebody,</v>

2512
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.700
<v Speaker 4>hitler the kkk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you?</v>

2513
01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.680
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's have a conversation with them.</v>

2514
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.800
<v Speaker 4>At the very least you won't talk with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and at the most you might try to </v>

2515
01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:55.800
<v Speaker 4>punch them.</v>

2516
01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.150
<v Speaker 5>That is really a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those the nomenclature,</v>

2517
01:41:58.151 --> 01:42:00.820
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really a problem with identifying</v>

2518
01:42:00.821 --> 01:42:05.170
<v Speaker 5>someone in that way that they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are someone that you have to resist</v>

2519
01:42:05.171 --> 01:42:07.630
<v Speaker 5>and they are someone who cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasoned with.</v>

2520
01:42:07.631 --> 01:42:12.631
<v Speaker 5>The are someone who is absolutely evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no like variables are variants </v>

2521
01:42:12.631 --> 01:42:13.090
<v Speaker 5>in their behavior.</v>

2522
01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:13.800
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and listen,</v>

2523
01:42:13.801 --> 01:42:15.990
<v Speaker 4>I like fiery political rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find it fun,</v>

2524
01:42:15.991 --> 01:42:18.230
<v Speaker 4>but I think once you label somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2525
01:42:18.450 --> 01:42:23.450
<v Speaker 4>completely evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a responsibility not to debate </v>

2526
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:28.251
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First one is really not to talk with </v>

2527
01:42:28.251 --> 01:42:28.251
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the conversation legitimize islam.</v>

2528
01:42:28.251 --> 01:42:29.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that like I'm listening.</v>

2529
01:42:29.341 --> 01:42:34.341
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you're gonna get a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit from people for even having me on </v>

2530
01:42:34.341 --> 01:42:34.341
<v Speaker 4>because the idea is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2531
01:42:34.341 --> 01:42:38.510
<v Speaker 4>how could you have on somebody like </v>
<v Speaker 4>superior legitimizing his point of view </v>

2532
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:39.180
<v Speaker 4>by having them on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people who I politically</v>

2533
01:42:39.181 --> 01:42:40.560
<v Speaker 4>disagree with who've had that </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

2534
01:42:40.561 --> 01:42:42.000
<v Speaker 4>what will have me on their show and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2535
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:45.960
<v Speaker 4>how dare you have shapiro on because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just granting him cover,</v>

2536
01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:46.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2537
01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:49.140
<v Speaker 4>or we can just have a conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we'll disagree.</v>

2538
01:42:49.141 --> 01:42:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll agree.</v>

2539
01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really don't give a fuck about those </v>

2540
01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:54.920
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a silly conversation.</v>

2541
01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:58.080
<v Speaker 5>I feel like you should talk to everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you disagree or agree.</v>

2542
01:42:58.081 --> 01:43:01.320
<v Speaker 5>I have friends on that I owe my friend </v>
<v Speaker 5>yesterday I had on eddie bravo.</v>

2543
01:43:01.321 --> 01:43:03.240
<v Speaker 5>He believes in everything is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy.</v>

2544
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:05.940
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with him wildly and I love </v>
<v Speaker 5>him like a brother.</v>

2545
01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:11.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you have to agree with </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and I don't think you have to at </v>

2546
01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:15.380
<v Speaker 5>the idea that you can't just have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation with someone about </v>

2547
01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.231
<v Speaker 5>something and see if you can find middle</v>
<v Speaker 5>ground or see if you could clearly </v>

2548
01:43:18.231 --> 01:43:21.351
<v Speaker 5>define their point of view or find their</v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective that's missing today in a </v>

2549
01:43:21.351 --> 01:43:23.400
<v Speaker 5>weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and one of the weirdest things about the</v>

2550
01:43:23.401 --> 01:43:28.401
<v Speaker 5>election was the ping pong match between</v>
<v Speaker 5>the left and the right as played out on </v>

2551
01:43:28.401 --> 01:43:30.570
<v Speaker 5>national television by the media.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would watch,</v>

2552
01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.720
<v Speaker 5>especially cable news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would watch fox news and then go to </v>

2553
01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:38.721
<v Speaker 5>cnn and go back and forth flip channels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you have that previous channel </v>

2554
01:43:38.721 --> 01:43:40.230
<v Speaker 5>button down the direct tv.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just put it on both of them go,</v>

2555
01:43:40.231 --> 01:43:41.010
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2556
01:43:41.011 --> 01:43:42.630
<v Speaker 5>What's really happening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's beautiful.</v>

2557
01:43:42.630 --> 01:43:42.630
<v Speaker 5>The</v>

2558
01:43:42.630 --> 01:43:44.790
<v Speaker 4>worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mom said this in 2012 with romney and</v>

2559
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:47.040
<v Speaker 4>obama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you read the right wing media,</v>

2560
01:43:47.130 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 4>there was no way romney was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lose and if you read the left wing </v>

2561
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 4>media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no way romney was going to win</v>

2562
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:53.150
<v Speaker 4>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which one of these do I believe in it,</v>

2563
01:43:53.151 --> 01:43:58.151
<v Speaker 4>so it's probably somewhere in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I have a basic rule which is that </v>

2564
01:43:58.151 --> 01:43:59.080
<v Speaker 4>if you have a New York times report and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have a report from my site that</v>

2565
01:43:59.090 --> 01:44:04.090
<v Speaker 4>daily wire and they share the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can probably assume the facts are </v>

2566
01:44:04.090 --> 01:44:06.821
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the opinions that are embedded with </v>

2567
01:44:06.821 --> 01:44:09.701
<v Speaker 4>the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are opinions and that's what's so </v>

2568
01:44:09.701 --> 01:44:12.371
<v Speaker 4>hard about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the modern mediA landscape is </v>

2569
01:44:12.371 --> 01:44:14.501
<v Speaker 4>trying to separate the facts from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion and so this is why when trump </v>

2570
01:44:14.501 --> 01:44:17.150
<v Speaker 4>says fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not wrong that cnn hates him in the</v>

2571
01:44:17.151 --> 01:44:18.980
<v Speaker 4>New York times hates him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's right about that,</v>

2572
01:44:18.981 --> 01:44:23.981
<v Speaker 4>but just labeling it all fake news is </v>
<v Speaker 4>inaccurate also because most of what </v>

2573
01:44:23.981 --> 01:44:24.440
<v Speaker 4>they're reporting is true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2574
01:44:24.441 --> 01:44:28.210
<v Speaker 4>It's just that it's biased against women</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be both true and biased and I'm true</v>

2575
01:44:28.211 --> 01:44:28.880
<v Speaker 4>and biased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2576
01:44:28.881 --> 01:44:32.240
<v Speaker 4>I say things that I think are factual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm obviously conservative.</v>

2577
01:44:32.241 --> 01:44:33.290
<v Speaker 4>That's my point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2578
01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:34.530
<v Speaker 4>tough shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's.</v>

2579
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:35.300
<v Speaker 4>And you're</v>

2580
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:36.680
<v Speaker 3>commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2581
01:44:36.681 --> 01:44:37.670
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2582
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:39.290
<v Speaker 3>half of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2583
01:44:39.291 --> 01:44:41.900
<v Speaker 3>riling people up saying provocative </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2584
01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:42.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's.</v>

2585
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:47.870
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is where I think the right is </v>

2586
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.870
<v Speaker 4>correct about cnn and the New York times</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of the other networks,</v>

2587
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:48.240
<v Speaker 4>like though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you ask the right,</v>

2588
01:44:48.241 --> 01:44:52.410
<v Speaker 4>what pisses you off more cnn or msnbc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people in the right will say cnn,</v>

2589
01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:57.680
<v Speaker 4>not msnbc because msnbc is honest enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say we're on the left and cnn </v>

2590
01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.420
<v Speaker 4>pretends we have no bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're above all that same thing with the</v>

2591
01:45:00.421 --> 01:45:05.421
<v Speaker 4>New York times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know we're above all that and then they </v>

2592
01:45:05.421 --> 01:45:05.421
<v Speaker 4>run the most egregiously bias headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'd go,</v>

2593
01:45:05.421 --> 01:45:07.440
<v Speaker 4>well that if they're lying about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're lying about everything.</v>

2594
01:45:07.890 --> 01:45:08.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my fast,</v>

2595
01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:12.790
<v Speaker 3>my most fascinating characters of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole play with Scott Adams,</v>

2596
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:16.690
<v Speaker 3>and particularly because Scott Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I had him on my podcast,</v>

2597
01:45:16.691 --> 01:45:18.590
<v Speaker 3>he was saying he doesn't even vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2598
01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:21.350
<v Speaker 3>just like what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I am paying attention to,</v>

2599
01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:26.380
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a trained hypnotist and I'm paying </v>

2600
01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:28.150
<v Speaker 3>attention to the powers of persuasion </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm looking at trends and I'm making</v>

2601
01:45:28.151 --> 01:45:30.160
<v Speaker 3>some predictions that turned out to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>

2602
01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.050
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's looking at trump,</v>

2603
01:45:32.051 --> 01:45:34.780
<v Speaker 3>but he's not talking about trump and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these glowing terms,</v>

2604
01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:40.050
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about him as being an </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective persuader and he lost millions</v>

2605
01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:46.560
<v Speaker 3>of dollars because of that opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about a guy that he's not even </v>

2606
01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:46.560
<v Speaker 3>going to vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2607
01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:49.750
<v Speaker 3>this is all leading up to the election </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people were fucking furious at him</v>

2608
01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:55.050
<v Speaker 3>and even more furious at him after trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>won because he would do those coffee </v>

2609
01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:59.491
<v Speaker 3>with scott.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things we does on periscope where he </v>

2610
01:45:59.491 --> 01:46:02.101
<v Speaker 3>wakes up and he's just starts answering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking questions and he's so measured </v>

2611
01:46:02.101 --> 01:46:06.751
<v Speaker 3>and calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had a podcast recently with sam </v>

2612
01:46:06.751 --> 01:46:10.651
<v Speaker 3>harris where I think it was just like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little too far over the edge of </v>

2613
01:46:10.651 --> 01:46:11.370
<v Speaker 3>apologizing for some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

2614
01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:14.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump's behavior and sort of attributing</v>

2615
01:46:14.261 --> 01:46:18.780
<v Speaker 3>some of trump's behavior too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could say was in competence and</v>

2616
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:19.670
<v Speaker 3>attributed to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some,</v>

2617
01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.000
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a master.</v>

2618
01:46:21.001 --> 01:46:21.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2619
01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:25.000
<v Speaker 4>Smelly quarrel with scott I think is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he tends to believe that everything</v>

2620
01:46:25.001 --> 01:46:27.790
<v Speaker 4>trump does is 987 degree underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upside down,</v>

2621
01:46:27.791 --> 01:46:28.660
<v Speaker 4>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hungry hippos.</v>

2622
01:46:28.810 --> 01:46:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Like everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all just absolute genius and it's </v>

2623
01:46:33.810 --> 01:46:36.040
<v Speaker 4>three steps down the road instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like stumbling his way to victory.</v>

2624
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew everyone involved in the </v>

2625
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.870
<v Speaker 4>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every single person who is involved</v>

2626
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:46.261
<v Speaker 4>in the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew this was a stumble their way to </v>

2627
01:46:46.261 --> 01:46:46.261
<v Speaker 4>victory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is amazing the minds,</v>

2628
01:46:46.330 --> 01:46:51.330
<v Speaker 4>human beings are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to think it's sort of the joker </v>

2629
01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:51.480
<v Speaker 4>says in the dark knight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to think there's a plan.</v>

2630
01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:54.120
<v Speaker 4>We always need to think there's a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if trump won,</v>

2631
01:46:54.121 --> 01:46:57.600
<v Speaker 4>it must be because there was some master</v>
<v Speaker 4>plan that he unveiled over the course of</v>

2632
01:46:57.601 --> 01:47:00.360
<v Speaker 4>the campaign three weeks before the </v>
<v Speaker 4>election.</v>

2633
01:47:00.361 --> 01:47:03.160
<v Speaker 4>He was caught on tape saying that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to grab women by the p word.</v>

2634
01:47:03.710 --> 01:47:05.370
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no master plan.</v>

2635
01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:10.620
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that hillary was an awful </v>

2636
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:10.620
<v Speaker 4>candidate and no one liked her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2637
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:11.000
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2638
01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:16.060
<v Speaker 4>the idea that the trump was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the idea that there was a broad </v>

2639
01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:17.130
<v Speaker 4>national movement for trump that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>there for other candidates.</v>

2640
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.950
<v Speaker 4>He won fewer votes in Wisconsin than </v>
<v Speaker 4>mitt romney did.</v>

2641
01:47:19.951 --> 01:47:23.070
<v Speaker 4>And he won the state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's because no one liked hillary.</v>

2642
01:47:23.071 --> 01:47:28.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the untold story of the </v>

2643
01:47:28.071 --> 01:47:29.181
<v Speaker 4>elections.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was not a referendum on Donald </v>

2644
01:47:29.181 --> 01:47:29.181
<v Speaker 4>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a referendum on hillary clinton,</v>

2645
01:47:29.181 --> 01:47:30.150
<v Speaker 4>particularly in the heartland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people hated her guts,</v>

2646
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:32.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>barack obama won Ohio walking away.</v>

2647
01:47:32.251 --> 01:47:35.370
<v Speaker 4>everyone talks about Michigan and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</v>

2648
01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:38.580
<v Speaker 4>Nobody talks about Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump won Ohio walking away.</v>

2649
01:47:38.581 --> 01:47:41.850
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons he won Ohio walking </v>
<v Speaker 4>away is because in 2012,</v>

2650
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.860
<v Speaker 4>barack obama really drove out the black </v>
<v Speaker 4>vote.</v>

2651
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 4>The percentage of the black vote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>typically in Ohio,</v>

2652
01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 4>it's like 10 percent of the general vote</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 2012 was like 13 to 15 percent of the</v>

2653
01:47:50.611 --> 01:47:53.730
<v Speaker 4>general board and that was the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>margin of victory for obama in the state</v>

2654
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:58.760
<v Speaker 4>of Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary got closer to sort of the </v>

2655
01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.780
<v Speaker 4>traditional percentages and she lost in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a whopping blowout in Ohio.</v>

2656
01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:06.140
<v Speaker 4>No one likes hillary clinton and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>left was so arrogant that they thought </v>

2657
01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:06.420
<v Speaker 4>we can take the most unpopular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unlikable,</v>

2658
01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.880
<v Speaker 4>unqualified,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nasty,</v>

2659
01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:13.440
<v Speaker 4>boring human being anyone has seen for </v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years and we'll run her.</v>

2660
01:48:13.770 --> 01:48:18.770
<v Speaker 4>She's the one will run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But do you understand that the company </v>

2661
01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:21.021
<v Speaker 4>would have to look helen competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be to lose to a celebrity </v>

2662
01:48:21.021 --> 01:48:21.021
<v Speaker 4>game show host.</v>

2663
01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you hAve to suck at this in a royal</v>
<v Speaker 2>manor.</v>

2664
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Where at one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2665
01:48:25.251 --> 01:48:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that thIng,</v>

2666
01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:29.600
<v Speaker 2>the floodgates are open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think senator rock man,</v>

2667
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:33.370
<v Speaker 2>apparently he's like way ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>

2668
01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:35.210
<v Speaker 2>so the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's going to win the primary.</v>

2669
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:40.390
<v Speaker 2>If he didn't win the primary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he would have to run as an </v>

2670
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.390
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he'd be indie rock.</v>

2671
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right kid rock is gonna win the primary.</v>

2672
01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we can only have one,</v>

2673
01:48:46.161 --> 01:48:47.060
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once he's in the office,</v>

2674
01:48:47.061 --> 01:48:48.410
<v Speaker 2>he grows into it and it becomes adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock.</v>

2675
01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.140
<v Speaker 2>How's ted nugent not run for office yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to know.</v>

2676
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:56.270
<v Speaker 2>How does he not know jim rock given a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about running for </v>

2677
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.740
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2678
01:48:56.741 --> 01:48:57.250
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2679
01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.090
<v Speaker 2>if the people really wanted it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would do it.</v>

2680
01:48:59.091 --> 01:49:00.950
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh jesus,</v>

2681
01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I just can't wait for the rock.</v>

2682
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the rock my.</v>

2683
01:49:06.781 --> 01:49:10.610
<v Speaker 2>When the rock might win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If oprah ran in 20,</v>

2684
01:49:10.611 --> 01:49:11.320
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2685
01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Is she the rock with oprah?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking dual take.</v>

2686
01:49:14.681 --> 01:49:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Slam dunk man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rock and oprah together.</v>

2687
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:22.660
<v Speaker 2>So I have this weird idea that we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually reinstitute a monarchy and it </v>

2688
01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:22.850
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't just be ceremonial and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be a celebrity,</v>

2689
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:27.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just make a celebrity monarch and </v>

2690
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.910
<v Speaker 2>that person will just be there to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty and queen of england,</v>

2691
01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.570
<v Speaker 2>but don't really have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No power,</v>

2692
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:33.620
<v Speaker 2>no power because we keep conflating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidency with like who actually has to</v>

2693
01:49:33.621 --> 01:49:38.621
<v Speaker 2>do things right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like people who would want to </v>

2694
01:49:38.621 --> 01:49:38.621
<v Speaker 2>represent the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2695
01:49:38.621 --> 01:49:39.440
<v Speaker 2>We have a popularity contest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who gets to control the nukes?</v>

2696
01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty wild.</v>

2697
01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:42.500
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty wild.</v>

2698
01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:43.860
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2699
01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:49.040
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all think in cinematic terms now and </v>

2700
01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hollywood is run by the dopiest jackass </v>

2701
01:49:52.530 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up with all these people.</v>

2702
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:55.810
<v Speaker 4>These are not people who you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlling the narrative.</v>

2703
01:49:55.811 --> 01:49:56.560
<v Speaker 4>And then we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2704
01:49:56.561 --> 01:49:58.940
<v Speaker 4>Let's take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If tom hanks would only run if tommy,</v>

2705
01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:01.520
<v Speaker 2>what makes you think tom hanks would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a good president?</v>

2706
01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Like did you look at trump and when god </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing such a brilliant job,</v>

2707
01:50:04.191 --> 01:50:07.880
<v Speaker 2>but we really need now is the guy from </v>
<v Speaker 2>castaway and we need as an actor again,</v>

2708
01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:10.760
<v Speaker 2>we did well with reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need another act.</v>

2709
01:50:10.761 --> 01:50:13.750
<v Speaker 2>We did great with swarts and anger is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the governor late.</v>

2710
01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 2>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reagan was governor for 20 years before </v>

2711
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.921
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he was the president of the </v>

2712
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:20.921
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2713
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:20.921
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2714
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:20.921
<v Speaker 2>let's put them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put them through the ringer.</v>

2715
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shorts and I got approved in eight years</v>

2716
01:50:21.411 --> 01:50:24.260
<v Speaker 2>that he was not capable of doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything except kind of sucking will you</v>

2717
01:50:24.261 --> 01:50:25.830
<v Speaker 2>ever heard him talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way it.</v>

2718
01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.380
<v Speaker 2>From his perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lIke,</v>

2719
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:32.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't really understand how much red</v>
<v Speaker 2>tape and bullshit you have to go </v>

2720
01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:32.410
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2721
01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I would meet with people and they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with me that it's a good idea.</v>

2722
01:50:34.071 --> 01:50:36.530
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would say my voters are never going</v>

2723
01:50:36.531 --> 01:50:38.180
<v Speaker 2>to agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to oppose it.</v>

2724
01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.360
<v Speaker 2>So even though I know you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of farmers that are </v>

2725
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.090
<v Speaker 2>going to be mad at me for doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not going to do that.</v>

2726
01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the other thing in politics that</v>

2727
01:50:45.381 --> 01:50:50.381
<v Speaker 2>really drives me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are two promises that </v>

2728
01:50:50.381 --> 01:50:50.381
<v Speaker 2>politicians make that are complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

2729
01:50:50.381 --> 01:50:53.670
<v Speaker 4>The first promise they make is I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go to Washington dc and I'm going to </v>

2730
01:50:53.670 --> 01:50:53.670
<v Speaker 4>get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2731
01:50:53.670 --> 01:50:54.130
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2732
01:50:54.150 --> 01:50:56.170
<v Speaker 4>The system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the system is built for gridlock.</v>

2733
01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:01.200
<v Speaker 4>It's built for gridlock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's why we have two separate houses of </v>

2734
01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.121
<v Speaker 4>congress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's why you have a president who can </v>

2735
01:51:03.121 --> 01:51:03.450
<v Speaker 4>veto is why we have a supreme court that</v>
<v Speaker 4>rules on cases is built for griddle.</v>

2736
01:51:03.451 --> 01:51:05.950
<v Speaker 4>It's wHy we have states that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be able to check the federal</v>

2737
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:07.330
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden the federalist papers,</v>

2738
01:51:07.331 --> 01:51:08.290
<v Speaker 4>it was built for gridlock</v>

2739
01:51:08.290 --> 01:51:13.290
<v Speaker 2>and some people are happy with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's how trump is being like </v>

2740
01:51:13.290 --> 01:51:14.370
<v Speaker 2>sideline that every time he tries to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make something really important,</v>

2741
01:51:14.371 --> 01:51:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2742
01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:19.700
<v Speaker 4>they all should be happy with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the only way things were </v>

2743
01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:19.700
<v Speaker 4>supposed to get pastors with wide public</v>
<v Speaker 4>support,</v>

2744
01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:20.640
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which she's probably a good thing.</v>

2745
01:51:20.641 --> 01:51:25.641
<v Speaker 4>We don't want the government shifting </v>
<v Speaker 4>wildly and veering on its access every </v>

2746
01:51:25.641 --> 01:51:26.760
<v Speaker 4>four years or every two years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked the gridlock.</v>

2747
01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:30.390
<v Speaker 4>My big problem is that the gridlock now </v>
<v Speaker 4>protects a huge system that I don't like</v>

2748
01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:33.450
<v Speaker 4>that's been built up over 100 years and </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the case of growth of government,</v>

2749
01:51:33.451 --> 01:51:38.451
<v Speaker 4>but I liked the gridlock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's one promise that's made and </v>

2750
01:51:38.451 --> 01:51:38.451
<v Speaker 4>then people are disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2751
01:51:38.451 --> 01:51:39.300
<v Speaker 4>if we get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to repeal obamacare.</v>

2752
01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:39.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2753
01:51:39.751 --> 01:51:40.920
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not.</v>

2754
01:51:40.921 --> 01:51:45.921
<v Speaker 4>I mean like you can promise it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now you're not going to do it </v>

2755
01:51:45.921 --> 01:51:47.070
<v Speaker 4>because you're full of crap wHen you </v>
<v Speaker 4>said it and now you're not gonna do it,</v>

2756
01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:50.430
<v Speaker 4>and the gridlock is there and it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>to change things.</v>

2757
01:51:51.110 --> 01:51:56.110
<v Speaker 4>It takes a tremendous effort of will and</v>
<v Speaker 4>electoral power to actually change </v>

2758
01:51:56.110 --> 01:51:56.550
<v Speaker 4>things in a big way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this idea will elect trump and trump,</v>

2759
01:51:56.670 --> 01:51:58.590
<v Speaker 4>like trump would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all going to be so easy.</v>

2760
01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2761
01:51:59.761 --> 01:52:00.390
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

2762
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:05.430
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't easy for obama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama passed obamacare and that was it </v>

2763
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:06.330
<v Speaker 4>for his presidency can do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the next six years.</v>

2764
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:08.610
<v Speaker 4>There were no major pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 4>legislation.</v>

2765
01:52:08.611 --> 01:52:11.280
<v Speaker 4>Nothing happened after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lost congress and that was it.</v>

2766
01:52:11.670 --> 01:52:12.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's a promise.</v>

2767
01:52:12.641 --> 01:52:17.641
<v Speaker 4>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other promise is your anger is </v>

2768
01:52:17.641 --> 01:52:17.641
<v Speaker 4>justified,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is the one I hate even more,</v>

2769
01:52:17.641 --> 01:52:19.920
<v Speaker 4>and that is the idea that you know in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in regular life,</v>

2770
01:52:20.010 --> 01:52:21.360
<v Speaker 4>when you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have kids.</v>

2771
01:52:21.361 --> 01:52:26.361
<v Speaker 4>When you're a kid is angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing you have to teach your </v>

2772
01:52:26.361 --> 01:52:26.361
<v Speaker 4>kid is maybe you're wrong to be angry </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes,</v>

2773
01:52:26.361 --> 01:52:26.361
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2774
01:52:26.361 --> 01:52:28.650
<v Speaker 4>Your anger is not justified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to make good human beings,</v>

2775
01:52:29.130 --> 01:52:31.320
<v Speaker 4>you have to determine whether they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>right to be angry.</v>

2776
01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:33.060
<v Speaker 4>Is he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is your anger correct?</v>

2777
01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Politicians are in the business of </v>
<v Speaker 4>justifying people's anger.</v>

2778
01:52:35.670 --> 01:52:40.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he heard this about the trump voter a </v>

2779
01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:40.670
<v Speaker 4>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2780
01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:40.670
<v Speaker 4>They're so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so angry.</v>

2781
01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:41.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I'm angry too about things,</v>

2782
01:52:41.581 --> 01:52:43.110
<v Speaker 4>but are they angry about the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>things?</v>

2783
01:52:43.610 --> 01:52:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2784
01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:49.180
<v Speaker 4>and trump would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right to be angry because you've </v>

2785
01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:51.461
<v Speaker 4>lost your job in podunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio because it's being stolen by the </v>

2786
01:52:51.461 --> 01:52:52.250
<v Speaker 4>chinese or by the mexicans or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2787
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:57.310
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that factually true or are you just </v>

2788
01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:59.900
<v Speaker 4>are just pandering to the anger and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the left you hear people say this to to </v>

2789
01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:00.830
<v Speaker 4>black folks in the inner city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the system that's keeping you down.</v>

2790
01:53:00.831 --> 01:53:03.080
<v Speaker 4>It's a racist white supremacist system </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's keeping you down.</v>

2791
01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2792
01:53:03.651 --> 01:53:05.810
<v Speaker 4>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I just pandering to the voter because</v>

2793
01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:08.770
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to tell people hard truths </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're not right to be angry.</v>

2794
01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 4>Get off your ass and do something with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>

2795
01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:11.960
<v Speaker 4>and it's true for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless of race,</v>

2796
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:13.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go out there.</v>

2797
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:14.990
<v Speaker 4>No one cares enough to stop you and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2798
01:53:14.991 --> 01:53:19.991
<v Speaker 4>Your life is your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one in the United States cares about </v>

2799
01:53:19.991 --> 01:53:19.991
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to stop you.</v>

2800
01:53:19.991 --> 01:53:21.080
<v Speaker 4>Who wants to throw obstacles up in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own way?</v>

2801
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:24.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure you can win an election on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the basis of go live your own life.</v>

2802
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Even though everyone keeps claiming they</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to live their own life.</v>

2803
01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:32.380
<v Speaker 4>I think most people are full of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think most people don't want to live </v>

2804
01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:32.380
<v Speaker 4>their own life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want a politician to tell them that</v>

2805
01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:36.011
<v Speaker 4>all of their complaints about life being</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfair or justified and the politician </v>

2806
01:53:36.011 --> 01:53:37.070
<v Speaker 4>is going to solve all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want people who stay out of our</v>

2807
01:53:37.071 --> 01:53:42.071
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want people to be mommy and and you </v>

2808
01:53:42.071 --> 01:53:42.071
<v Speaker 4>know that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's attempting,</v>

2809
01:53:42.071 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 4>attempting proposition for politics.</v>

2810
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:48.910
<v Speaker 3>A lot of that when you talk to adults </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're dealing with people that </v>

2811
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:51.671
<v Speaker 3>have the momentum of all their failures </v>
<v Speaker 3>in life and all the different things </v>

2812
01:53:51.671 --> 01:53:55.361
<v Speaker 3>that are not going right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then here they are this moment </v>

2813
01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:55.361
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

2814
01:53:55.361 --> 01:54:00.100
<v Speaker 3>and they want to figure out why and why </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not on track in the how to get </v>

2815
01:54:00.381 --> 01:54:05.381
<v Speaker 3>on track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the easiest way is to point the </v>

2816
01:54:05.381 --> 01:54:06.020
<v Speaker 3>finger or blame someone else and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has their own hand.</v>

2817
01:54:06.021 --> 01:54:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that people's hands or </v>
<v Speaker 3>are fair and that person doesn't have it</v>

2818
01:54:10.221 --> 01:54:11.540
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people that have it easy,</v>

2819
01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.490
<v Speaker 3>I have it easier than a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure for sure.</v>

2820
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:18.520
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is there's a tremendous </v>

2821
01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:21.881
<v Speaker 3>amount of psychological factors that go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into why someone does or does not </v>

2822
01:54:23.271 --> 01:54:27.020
<v Speaker 3>succeed and to placate them or to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2823
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:32.290
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to play on those psychological factors </v>

2824
01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:32.290
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not being their own fault.</v>

2825
01:54:32.690 --> 01:54:34.730
<v Speaker 3>It's very tempting because it works with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2826
01:54:34.731 --> 01:54:39.731
<v Speaker 3>People love to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love to hear that it's not your </v>

2827
01:54:39.731 --> 01:54:39.731
<v Speaker 3>fault.</v>

2828
01:54:39.731 --> 01:54:39.731
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what politicians have</v>

2829
01:54:39.731 --> 01:54:42.470
<v Speaker 4>become in the business of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's both right and left.</v>

2830
01:54:42.471 --> 01:54:47.471
<v Speaker 4>It's just people saying that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>your fault because you're being screwed </v>

2831
01:54:47.471 --> 01:54:51.191
<v Speaker 4>by some foreign country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not your fault because the </v>

2832
01:54:51.191 --> 01:54:51.530
<v Speaker 4>immigrants are doing it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not your fault.</v>

2833
01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:52.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as maybe some.</v>

2834
01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:55.160
<v Speaker 4>Maybe some of that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to show me why it's true.</v>

2835
01:54:55.230 --> 01:54:56.540
<v Speaker 4>You have to show me what the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

2836
01:54:56.750 --> 01:55:01.750
<v Speaker 4>Did you lose your job because of and </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of China or did you lose your </v>

2837
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:06.641
<v Speaker 4>job because you're in an industry that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is being crowded out because of </v>

2838
01:55:06.641 --> 01:55:09.281
<v Speaker 4>technological change and because your </v>
<v Speaker 4>union struck and created wages too high </v>

2839
01:55:09.281 --> 01:55:10.850
<v Speaker 4>to be globally competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like let's look at the actual logic here</v>

2840
01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:12.440
<v Speaker 4>is to enhance and then how can we change</v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2841
01:55:12.441 --> 01:55:13.640
<v Speaker 4>How can we make it better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can we.</v>

2842
01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:18.880
<v Speaker 4>Is it something we have to do or is it a</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter of you need to broaden your </v>

2843
01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:18.880
<v Speaker 4>skillset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you see a lot of people now who are</v>

2844
01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:23.711
<v Speaker 4>stuck in the mindset of 30 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're going to work a job and </v>

2845
01:55:23.711 --> 01:55:26.861
<v Speaker 4>stayed there for 20 years and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to grow and then you're </v>

2846
01:55:26.861 --> 01:55:28.890
<v Speaker 4>gonna leave with the gold watch and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the way the job market works </v>

2847
01:55:28.890 --> 01:55:28.890
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2848
01:55:28.890 --> 01:55:32.801
<v Speaker 4>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're entering the job market right </v>

2849
01:55:32.801 --> 01:55:32.801
<v Speaker 4>now as a college student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can expect that in the next 10 years</v>

2850
01:55:32.801 --> 01:55:33.680
<v Speaker 4>you'll probably work four jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like the,</v>

2851
01:55:33.690 --> 01:55:38.690
<v Speaker 4>the turnover is too great and you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be constantly increasing your skill </v>

2852
01:55:38.690 --> 01:55:38.690
<v Speaker 4>set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also with</v>

2853
01:55:38.690 --> 01:55:42.630
<v Speaker 3>every new innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's businesses that branch out </v>

2854
01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>become new,</v>

2855
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.370
<v Speaker 2>and then there's also businesses that </v>
<v Speaker 2>die and there's no bringing them back.</v>

2856
01:55:47.410 --> 01:55:49.260
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to bring back the </v>
<v Speaker 2>printing press,</v>

2857
01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:52.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stuff that I really got</v>

2858
01:55:52.261 --> 01:55:57.261
<v Speaker 2>into printing press industry and tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that try and get elected from the </v>

2859
01:55:57.261 --> 01:55:57.261
<v Speaker 2>printing press guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2860
01:55:57.261 --> 01:55:58.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean right now they're trying to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>automated cars.</v>

2861
01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a,</v>

2862
01:56:00.490 --> 01:56:01.530
<v Speaker 2>there was a vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2863
01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.560
<v Speaker 2>WaSn't there a vote like within the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>day or two to try to block automated </v>

2864
01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:09.640
<v Speaker 2>trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2865
01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are moving,</v>

2866
01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:16.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient when it's not people.</v>

2867
01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.870
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the great fallacy that's been.</v>

2868
01:56:20.130 --> 01:56:25.130
<v Speaker 2>People have been trying to fight since </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the industrial </v>

2869
01:56:25.130 --> 01:56:25.130
<v Speaker 2>revolution as this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2870
01:56:25.130 --> 01:56:28.131
<v Speaker 2>well the new technology is going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs and then no one will ever work </v>

2871
01:56:28.131 --> 01:56:30.891
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've had the same unemployment rate </v>

2872
01:56:30.891 --> 01:56:31.140
<v Speaker 2>in this country for the last hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and the technology is a little bit</v>

2873
01:56:31.141 --> 01:56:31.440
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2874
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Teamsters convinced congress to block </v>
<v Speaker 2>driverless trucks.</v>

2875
01:56:34.670 --> 01:56:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

2876
01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:37.230
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems crazy.</v>

2877
01:56:37.231 --> 01:56:39.780
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you're fighting an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable tied.</v>

2878
01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean imagine that.</v>

2879
01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Like how is that going to work for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other industries that are affected?</v>

2880
01:56:44.881 --> 01:56:49.881
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that you now have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificially raising the prices of all </v>

2881
01:56:49.881 --> 01:56:53.151
<v Speaker 2>the goods that now have to be brought in</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the teamsters and now it's more </v>

2882
01:56:53.151 --> 01:56:53.190
<v Speaker 2>expensive so it's more money out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket and my pocket.</v>

2883
01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.340
<v Speaker 2>That's money that I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I was willing to buy american,</v>

2884
01:56:56.341 --> 01:56:58.880
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm going to buy chinese because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to feed my family like this is.</v>

2885
01:56:59.410 --> 01:57:01.620
<v Speaker 2>That's not how economics works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not how economics was there.</v>

2886
01:57:01.621 --> 01:57:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Any argument that they're not ready yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these trucks aren't viable,</v>

2887
01:57:04.921 --> 01:57:07.590
<v Speaker 2>so that that's one of the issues is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way with a lot of the.</v>

2888
01:57:07.630 --> 01:57:09.970
<v Speaker 2>So the automated trucks basically in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order for them to work,</v>

2889
01:57:09.971 --> 01:57:13.570
<v Speaker 2>you need dedicated lanes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise human error is,</v>

2890
01:57:13.571 --> 01:57:17.370
<v Speaker 2>is such that if like if there's a google</v>
<v Speaker 2>car on the road and you're a bad driver,</v>

2891
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:22.430
<v Speaker 2>the google car is probably going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a crash or might be more likely to </v>

2892
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.430
<v Speaker 2>get in a crash then that if it were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human driving.</v>

2893
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:27.321
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen people freak out </v>
<v Speaker 2>those tesla cars and seeing what they </v>

2894
01:57:27.321 --> 01:57:27.510
<v Speaker 2>could do to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

2895
01:57:27.690 --> 01:57:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen those tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually saw somebody do it to the </v>

2896
01:57:32.690 --> 01:57:32.690
<v Speaker 2>google car when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2897
01:57:32.690 --> 01:57:34.830
<v Speaker 2>when a car is on that automated thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just swerve at it,</v>

2898
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.440
<v Speaker 2>they slam on the brakes and back up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2899
01:57:37.610 --> 01:57:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Like people have done it to people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>filmed it.</v>

2900
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:43.110
<v Speaker 2>When we see people using automated cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2901
01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:45.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not done.</v>

2902
01:57:45.450 --> 01:57:47.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2903
01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:49.170
<v Speaker 2>it's in the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2904
01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:52.350
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like a hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of fuel efficient,</v>

2905
01:57:52.351 --> 01:57:57.351
<v Speaker 2>lighter cars on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot more dangerous than </v>

2906
01:57:57.351 --> 01:57:57.351
<v Speaker 2>the heavIer cars because they're heavier</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

2907
01:57:57.351 --> 01:57:58.140
<v Speaker 2>The clunkers are still around from 1970 </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their tanks.</v>

2908
01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:03.560
<v Speaker 2>They just run through three prius's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about universal basic </v>

2909
01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:04.710
<v Speaker 2>income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's a subject that comes up a</v>

2910
01:58:04.711 --> 01:58:09.711
<v Speaker 2>lot lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When elon musk is talking about these </v>

2911
01:58:09.711 --> 01:58:12.771
<v Speaker 2>driverless cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things he's saying is that </v>

2912
01:58:12.771 --> 01:58:14.220
<v Speaker 2>one thing that we're going to need is </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income.</v>

2913
01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:19.250
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to figure out some </v>

2914
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:20.160
<v Speaker 2>way to feed all these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get taken out of the job market</v>

2915
01:58:20.161 --> 01:58:21.960
<v Speaker 2>because their jobs have become </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>

2916
01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:27.020
<v Speaker 2>So I think that universal basic income </v>
<v Speaker 2>is for when the technology gets so good </v>

2917
01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 2>that they're legitimately are no jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that we're there yet.</v>

2918
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:31.380
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a machine that can make </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything basically for free,</v>

2919
01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:34.320
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a bunch of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need anymore to do work,</v>

2920
01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:39.740
<v Speaker 2>then you can talk about a universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic income because there's no </v>

2921
01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:42.111
<v Speaker 2>scarcity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scarcity is what creates a need for </v>

2922
01:58:42.111 --> 01:58:42.111
<v Speaker 2>labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if their scarcity in any,</v>

2923
01:58:42.111 --> 01:58:42.111
<v Speaker 2>then there's</v>

2924
01:58:42.111 --> 01:58:44.650
<v Speaker 4>going to be a need for for labor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be need for new labour.</v>

2925
01:58:44.651 --> 01:58:49.651
<v Speaker 4>People are going to still have to work </v>
<v Speaker 4>on these trucks and deal with </v>

2926
01:58:49.651 --> 01:58:50.050
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the computer industry didn't destroy</v>

2927
01:58:50.051 --> 01:58:52.060
<v Speaker 4>jobs all over the United States on </v>
<v Speaker 4>typewriters went out.</v>

2928
01:58:52.061 --> 01:58:55.570
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's a little premature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure there'll ever be a day when</v>

2929
01:58:55.571 --> 01:58:58.840
<v Speaker 4>there's a machine that when the machines</v>
<v Speaker 4>society is so well developed that it can</v>

2930
01:58:58.841 --> 01:59:03.841
<v Speaker 4>take over all jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think you'Re seeing a bifurcation </v>

2931
01:59:03.841 --> 01:59:06.421
<v Speaker 4>in the labor market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So think people who Are in jobs like </v>

2932
01:59:06.421 --> 01:59:06.421
<v Speaker 4>yours and mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're lucky this is a creative job.</v>

2933
01:59:06.421 --> 01:59:10.540
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for machines to create.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for jobs that are single task jobs,</v>

2934
01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:14.800
<v Speaker 4>a lot more of those are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>technologically driven and so people are</v>

2935
01:59:14.801 --> 01:59:15.540
<v Speaker 4>going to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2936
01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:20.580
<v Speaker 4>work the right side of their brain a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit and we're going to have to </v>

2937
01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:20.580
<v Speaker 4>train people in a different way.</v>

2938
01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:23.940
<v Speaker 4>But my perspective on universal basic </v>
<v Speaker 4>income is when you have a four percent </v>

2939
01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:26.881
<v Speaker 4>unemployment rate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to say you need a </v>

2940
01:59:26.881 --> 01:59:26.881
<v Speaker 4>universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's again,</v>

2941
01:59:26.881 --> 01:59:29.500
<v Speaker 4>96 percent of people in the labor market</v>
<v Speaker 4>who can work are working.</v>

2942
01:59:29.501 --> 01:59:31.100
<v Speaker 4>so that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

2943
01:59:31.170 --> 01:59:36.170
<v Speaker 4>that's not suggesting to me that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>this vast underclass of people who are </v>

2944
01:59:36.170 --> 01:59:36.940
<v Speaker 4>totally incapable of working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once you do that,</v>

2945
01:59:36.970 --> 01:59:41.970
<v Speaker 4>you see what you've seen actually with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the disability programs in the United </v>

2946
01:59:41.970 --> 01:59:41.970
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2947
01:59:41.970 --> 01:59:45.210
<v Speaker 4>where now everybody's on disability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the fastest growing government </v>

2948
01:59:45.210 --> 01:59:48.181
<v Speaker 4>program in America is the disability </v>
<v Speaker 4>program or people declare themselves </v>

2949
01:59:48.181 --> 01:59:49.030
<v Speaker 4>disabled so they can get government </v>
<v Speaker 4>pensions basically.</v>

2950
01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Once you have a universal basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there an incentive to work?</v>

2951
01:59:52.601 --> 01:59:55.660
<v Speaker 4>And also I'm not sure that you've solved</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people's problems,</v>

2952
01:59:55.661 --> 01:59:57.700
<v Speaker 4>like people still see need something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do with their day.</v>

2953
01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:03.900
<v Speaker 4>Sixteen year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you see who retire and they're dead </v>

2954
02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:03.900
<v Speaker 4>within three years.</v>

2955
02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:06.570
<v Speaker 3>The utopian ideas that somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another you're going to open up these </v>

2956
02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:07.670
<v Speaker 3>people's inherent creativity and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>find stuff.</v>

2957
02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actually enjoy the country.</v>

2958
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Julio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2959
02:00:09.871 --> 02:00:11.760
<v Speaker 4>how many people say again?</v>

2960
02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:15.590
<v Speaker 3>You said who we like 30 2:33?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2961
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Thirty three to using the term holy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2962
02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2963
02:00:19.710 --> 02:00:21.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2964
02:00:21.630 --> 02:00:22.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2965
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope I'd never retire because I just </v>

2966
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:27.310
<v Speaker 4>know too many people who retired and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2967
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:31.130
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to retire and I'm going to </v>

2968
02:00:31.130 --> 02:00:32.321
<v Speaker 4>golf there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other paint I'm going to trY and six </v>

2969
02:00:32.321 --> 02:00:32.321
<v Speaker 4>months later they're dead.</v>

2970
02:00:32.321 --> 02:00:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well people enjoy doing things and </v>

2971
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.310
<v Speaker 3>feeling like they're valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2972
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:38.630
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if that necessarily has</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a job,</v>

2973
02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:41.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitive test of whether or not you're</v>

2974
02:00:41.931 --> 02:00:46.931
<v Speaker 3>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody gives you money and you get </v>

2975
02:00:46.931 --> 02:00:46.931
<v Speaker 3>that money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2976
02:00:46.931 --> 02:00:46.931
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm valuable.</v>

2977
02:00:46.931 --> 02:00:47.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm contributing.</v>

2978
02:00:47.901 --> 02:00:48.890
<v Speaker 3>I got a check for my.</v>

2979
02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:49.760
<v Speaker 4>We.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2980
02:00:50.130 --> 02:00:55.130
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of hours in the day and </v>

2981
02:00:55.130 --> 02:00:56.791
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be hard to fill that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>watercolor painting and beat poetry </v>

2982
02:00:56.791 --> 02:00:56.791
<v Speaker 4>classes.</v>

2983
02:00:56.791 --> 02:00:56.791
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2984
02:00:56.791 --> 02:00:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I'd find shit to do but I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2985
02:01:00.230 --> 02:01:02.900
<v Speaker 3>I've been fairly self employed most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

2986
02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:04.320
<v Speaker 3>I just have gotten in</v>

2987
02:01:04.670 --> 02:01:06.390
<v Speaker 4>driven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I would find stuff to do too,</v>

2988
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:08.260
<v Speaker 4>but there is a difference in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2989
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:13.270
<v Speaker 4>not all human beings are the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>would actually go out and take classes </v>

2990
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.270
<v Speaker 4>and find things to do.</v>

2991
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Do you have aspirations outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>commentary when it comes to politics?</v>

2992
02:01:16.730 --> 02:01:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some point down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you run for president or </v>

2993
02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:21.730
<v Speaker 3>something like that</v>

2994
02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:21.730
<v Speaker 4>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently anyone can.</v>

2995
02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:22.150
<v Speaker 4>And this is what I'm finding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:01:22.410 --> 02:01:24.640
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're a reasonable guy.</v>

2997
02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

2998
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:30.400
<v Speaker 4>I like what I'm doing in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I get to work on what people believe,</v>

2999
02:01:30.401 --> 02:01:32.650
<v Speaker 4>which I think is sort of the root of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of politics.</v>

3000
02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:36.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure implementing is the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing as I said,</v>

3001
02:01:36.311 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure that the president can get </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm more focused getting people to</v>

3002
02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 2>think in the terms that I'd like them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

3003
02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:47.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about limited government and you taking </v>

3004
02:01:47.741 --> 02:01:47.741
<v Speaker 2>control of your own life and it might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do more good.</v>

3005
02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Promulgating that message using a </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing media.</v>

3006
02:01:50.751 --> 02:01:51.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

3007
02:01:51.181 --> 02:01:51.860
<v Speaker 2>we're very lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3008
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:54.500
<v Speaker 2>the podcast went from having 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>listeners,</v>

3009
02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 300 episodes ago to now we have </v>

3010
02:01:59.990 --> 02:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>listeners a day,</v>

3011
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

3012
02:02:00.121 --> 02:02:01.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it continues to grow.</v>

3013
02:02:01.281 --> 02:02:06.281
<v Speaker 2>So as that crowd continues to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually harder for me to say I'd </v>

3014
02:02:06.281 --> 02:02:06.281
<v Speaker 2>want to jump into politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not easier.</v>

3015
02:02:06.281 --> 02:02:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I think the limited government thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me has always been a fascinating subject</v>

3016
02:02:09.891 --> 02:02:12.200
<v Speaker 2>because the people that don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited government,</v>

3017
02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:16.510
<v Speaker 2>that is the utopian ideal in my mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>that somehow or another the government's</v>

3018
02:02:16.511 --> 02:02:18.500
<v Speaker 2>going to be effective if you give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>more money,</v>

3019
02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:23.940
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this isn't an argument with a </v>

3020
02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:25.961
<v Speaker 2>friend where he wanted people to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxed more because he felt like that </v>

3021
02:02:26.451 --> 02:02:31.451
<v Speaker 2>money could be distributed to people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get more funding for the arts </v>

3022
02:02:32.691 --> 02:02:34.070
<v Speaker 2>was one of his arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

3023
02:02:34.071 --> 02:02:35.600
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thought was like first of all,</v>

3024
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:37.530
<v Speaker 2>the arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they're valued,</v>

3025
02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:39.080
<v Speaker 2>when people like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pay for them.</v>

3026
02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:44.280
<v Speaker 2>If that's not getting funding for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts means you're going to have fucking </v>

3027
02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:45.340
<v Speaker 2>lacma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la county museum of art.</v>

3028
02:02:45.410 --> 02:02:50.410
<v Speaker 2>You have a fuckIng box on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's someone's calling a piece of art </v>

3029
02:02:50.410 --> 02:02:52.300
<v Speaker 2>that guy think he went to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was either in san francisco or lack,</v>

3030
02:02:52.301 --> 02:02:57.301
<v Speaker 2>but where he went there and he took off </v>
<v Speaker 2>his glasses and he just put them on the </v>

3031
02:02:57.301 --> 02:02:58.010
<v Speaker 2>floor and then he stood next to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>going kind of standing there and kind of</v>

3032
02:02:58.011 --> 02:03:03.011
<v Speaker 2>stroking his chin scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were 30 people all around and </v>

3033
02:03:03.011 --> 02:03:03.011
<v Speaker 2>staring at the glasses on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3034
02:03:03.011 --> 02:03:03.150
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3035
02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:04.730
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking horseshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3036
02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.730
<v Speaker 2>That the modern art exhibits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's.</v>

3037
02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>There was another one recently where </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like left behind a pineapple or </v>

3038
02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to the.</v>

3039
02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>I remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3040
02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3041
02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:19.300
<v Speaker 2>It really is crazy and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretentious and it's also a stoking </v>

3042
02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:23.561
<v Speaker 2>those fires of pretension and making </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's not legitimately </v>

3043
02:03:23.561 --> 02:03:23.561
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>

3044
02:03:23.561 --> 02:03:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Making it a celebrated because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really have the ability to create </v>

3045
02:03:27.970 --> 02:03:31.811
<v Speaker 2>something that's legitimately creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>as pointing this out today with regard </v>

3046
02:03:31.811 --> 02:03:35.411
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how a lot of people who want </v>

3047
02:03:35.411 --> 02:03:37.181
<v Speaker 2>bigger government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they embrace states that start to grow </v>

3048
02:03:37.181 --> 02:03:37.181
<v Speaker 2>the government and then when things go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to shit,</v>

3049
02:03:37.181 --> 02:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>they're like nowhere to be found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Venezuela is the most obvious </v>

3050
02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3051
02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela has turned from what was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>richest country in south America and had</v>

3052
02:03:44.271 --> 02:03:46.400
<v Speaker 2>the best oil reserves of anywhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>western hemisphere.</v>

3053
02:03:46.401 --> 02:03:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Basically they've turned it into just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage heap.</v>

3054
02:03:48.681 --> 02:03:50.840
<v Speaker 2>People waiting in lines have a friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>named nami horwitz.</v>

3055
02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Went down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did some documentary stuff down there,</v>

3056
02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.370
<v Speaker 2>and he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's camera man got shot.</v>

3057
02:03:55.580 --> 02:04:00.580
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was watching people like literally </v>

3058
02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:00.580
<v Speaker 2>shooting dogs in the streets for food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

3059
02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>

3060
02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Caracas is the most violent city in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>western hemisphere now.</v>

3061
02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:08.440
<v Speaker 2>And all of this is because google chavez</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a piece of garbage who centralized </v>

3062
02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:13.331
<v Speaker 2>all power to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>redistributed the wealth to all of his </v>

3063
02:04:13.331 --> 02:04:16.301
<v Speaker 2>friends and cronies and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then supposedly uplifted the poor </v>

3064
02:04:16.301 --> 02:04:18.040
<v Speaker 2>except that now everyone is poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>

3065
02:04:18.090 --> 02:04:20.690
<v Speaker 2>wasn't even friends with sean penn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't even know what you're saying.</v>

3066
02:04:20.691 --> 02:04:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3067
02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I might show today I played like sean</v>

3068
02:04:23.901 --> 02:04:26.510
<v Speaker 2>penn and Jesse Jackson and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3069
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:31.750
<v Speaker 2>that freak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jeremy corbyn who's the head of the </v>

3070
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.790
<v Speaker 2>labor party in great britain and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>all just praising chavez,</v>

3071
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>

3072
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:37.440
<v Speaker 2>He waS a hero to the poor and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela is going to shit.</v>

3073
02:04:37.441 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 2>And where all these</v>

3074
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:43.070
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when someone's stick a camera in </v>

3075
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.390
<v Speaker 4>sean penn split face like now and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>asking sean penn,</v>

3076
02:04:43.391 --> 02:04:45.090
<v Speaker 4>so like five minutes ago you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one</v>

3077
02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:50.100
<v Speaker 3>who's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's gotta be some sort of a </v>

3078
02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:50.100
<v Speaker 3>left response for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what is,</v>

3079
02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:50.160
<v Speaker 3>what is their take on why?</v>

3080
02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:52.450
<v Speaker 4>So the no true scotsman fallacy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3081
02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:52.840
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well,</v>

3082
02:04:52.841 --> 02:04:57.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is them living on and it's because </v>

3083
02:04:57.841 --> 02:04:57.841
<v Speaker 4>they never really got rid of enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>private industry.</v>

3084
02:04:57.841 --> 02:04:58.450
<v Speaker 4>If theY just gone further,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have been better.</v>

3085
02:04:58.451 --> 02:05:00.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well the soviet union and it didn't work</v>

3086
02:05:00.101 --> 02:05:03.370
<v Speaker 4>out that great either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I actually got a response.</v>

3087
02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:08.400
<v Speaker 4>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the today I tweeted out that according </v>

3088
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.951
<v Speaker 4>to the world bank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Venezuela has one of the least income </v>

3089
02:05:10.951 --> 02:05:11.860
<v Speaker 4>unequal societies on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's actually pretty income equal,</v>

3090
02:05:12.130 --> 02:05:13.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause nobody has anything right.</v>

3091
02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:16.420
<v Speaker 4>And the end it's garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

3092
02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:21.480
<v Speaker 4>the socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the official socialist party tweeted me </v>

3093
02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:22.660
<v Speaker 4>and they said this is because socialism </v>
<v Speaker 4>has never truly been tried.</v>

3094
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3095
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:27.550
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

3096
02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Well that was the wonderful idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialism is that it's going to even </v>

3097
02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:37.570
<v Speaker 3>everything out and that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get paid more for that no one should get</v>

3098
02:05:37.571 --> 02:05:42.571
<v Speaker 3>paid more and then everyone should have </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a like a peak that you can </v>

3099
02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:42.640
<v Speaker 3>reach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3100
02:05:42.670 --> 02:05:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some sort of competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved,</v>

3101
02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:47.500
<v Speaker 3>but he's got to be some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TheRe's got to be some sort of incentive</v>

3102
02:05:47.501 --> 02:05:48.250
<v Speaker 3>but only so much.</v>

3103
02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:53.300
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like the bernie sanders's </v>

3104
02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:54.441
<v Speaker 4>democratic socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like formal socialism is the state owns </v>

3105
02:05:54.441 --> 02:05:57.021
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But democratic socialism is there's </v>

3106
02:05:57.021 --> 02:05:57.021
<v Speaker 4>private industry but only to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

3107
02:05:57.021 --> 02:05:57.180
<v Speaker 4>And then we tell people no.</v>

3108
02:05:57.550 --> 02:06:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Did you find out about bernie and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife and his wife's idea was to buy up a</v>

3109
02:06:01.281 --> 02:06:06.281
<v Speaker 3>bunch of land and expand the college and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the fucking college went under and </v>

3110
02:06:06.281 --> 02:06:07.920
<v Speaker 3>now they're being sued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3111
02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:10.050
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome</v>

3112
02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:15.240
<v Speaker 4>based on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a lot of mythmaking about like </v>

3113
02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:15.240
<v Speaker 4>western europe in the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3114
02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:17.590
<v Speaker 4>So there's All this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Democratic socialist countries.</v>

3115
02:06:17.591 --> 02:06:18.640
<v Speaker 4>They're working great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

3116
02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:24.060
<v Speaker 4>a car in Denmark has a 60 percent import</v>
<v Speaker 4>tax and costs literally twice what it </v>

3117
02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:27.871
<v Speaker 4>would cost in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tax rates in Denmark are insane except </v>

3118
02:06:27.871 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 4>for corporate taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which the left in the United States </v>

3119
02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3120
02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 4>they love corporate tax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want those higher.</v>

3121
02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Denmark has some of the lowest corporate</v>
<v Speaker 4>taxes and regulations in the </v>

3122
02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:39.541
<v Speaker 4>industrialized world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so everybody is coming in and investing </v>

3123
02:06:39.541 --> 02:06:41.941
<v Speaker 4>in Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only the citizens who are getting </v>

3124
02:06:41.941 --> 02:06:41.941
<v Speaker 4>screwed by paying for this giant welfare</v>
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

3125
02:06:41.941 --> 02:06:42.940
<v Speaker 4>Then their gdp tanked and now they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>had to elect,</v>

3126
02:06:42.941 --> 02:06:45.430
<v Speaker 4>right wing governments just lash back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The the level of government.</v>

3127
02:06:45.431 --> 02:06:50.431
<v Speaker 4>I mean it turns out the capitalism is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the great engine that drives like </v>

3128
02:06:50.431 --> 02:06:50.890
<v Speaker 4>Singapore is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing on Singapore.</v>

3129
02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Singapore is like a rock it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing there.</v>

3130
02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:59.280
<v Speaker 4>Singapore has one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most powerful economIes on earth </v>

3131
02:06:59.280 --> 02:06:59.280
<v Speaker 4>because they basically have no business </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulations,</v>

3132
02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:02.380
<v Speaker 4>no taxes and no tariffs so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>do whatever you want and when people can</v>

3133
02:07:02.381 --> 02:07:07.381
<v Speaker 4>do whatever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make a lot of mutually beneficial </v>

3134
02:07:07.381 --> 02:07:07.381
<v Speaker 4>exchanges and of story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not that difficult,</v>

3135
02:07:07.381 --> 02:07:11.670
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is difficult if you think that </v>

3136
02:07:11.670 --> 02:07:11.670
<v Speaker 4>life is unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3137
02:07:11.670 --> 02:07:14.790
<v Speaker 3>So what would you propose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what would you propose for the </v>

3138
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:17.761
<v Speaker 3>United States?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the United States obviously would </v>

3139
02:07:17.761 --> 02:07:18.460
<v Speaker 3>trump wants to do is reinvigorate </v>
<v Speaker 3>manufacturing,</v>

3140
02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:23.290
<v Speaker 3>make things in America again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring back the labor force,</v>

3141
02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:28.320
<v Speaker 3>make the take away the jobs that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going overseas and other countries in </v>

3142
02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:28.320
<v Speaker 3>south America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3143
02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:33.460
<v Speaker 4>So I think that that's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>slogans from him and I don't think it </v>

3144
02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:33.460
<v Speaker 4>means and it so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so number one,</v>

3145
02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't think a manufacturing job is </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than a tech job.</v>

3146
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:39.220
<v Speaker 4>A job is a job and in industries that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are thriving,</v>

3147
02:07:39.221 --> 02:07:41.950
<v Speaker 4>you actually need more jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>industries tHat are not doing as well.</v>

3148
02:07:41.951 --> 02:07:46.951
<v Speaker 4>If the jobs disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just the wages of a global </v>

3149
02:07:46.951 --> 02:07:46.951
<v Speaker 4>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>

3150
02:07:46.951 --> 02:07:48.460
<v Speaker 4>I know it sounds harsh to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>in those industries,</v>

3151
02:07:48.461 --> 02:07:50.290
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a referendum on you or your</v>
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>

3152
02:07:50.291 --> 02:07:52.030
<v Speaker 4>it's just saying that certain industries</v>
<v Speaker 4>over time,</v>

3153
02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:57.150
<v Speaker 4>always our outsource,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we used to make tee shirts in the </v>

3154
02:07:57.150 --> 02:07:57.150
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't make tee shirts here,</v>

3155
02:07:57.150 --> 02:07:57.940
<v Speaker 4>make them in Vietnam and it costs us </v>
<v Speaker 4>five bucks.</v>

3156
02:07:58.330 --> 02:07:58.660
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3157
02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:01.870
<v Speaker 4>so the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my view is I'm not going to Privilege</v>

3158
02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.820
<v Speaker 4>one day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand a lot of this is politics.</v>

3159
02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:06.370
<v Speaker 4>You want to favor manufacturing basis </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there are a lot of manufacturing</v>

3160
02:08:06.371 --> 02:08:07.540
<v Speaker 4>hubs in Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio,</v>

3161
02:08:07.541 --> 02:08:08.740
<v Speaker 4>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wisconsin.</v>

3162
02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:10.690
<v Speaker 4>But then they vote since I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3163
02:08:10.691 --> 02:08:15.691
<v Speaker 4>Since I'm not a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my view is that if you want a thriving </v>

3164
02:08:15.691 --> 02:08:18.811
<v Speaker 4>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you relieve as much regulation as </v>

3165
02:08:18.811 --> 02:08:18.811
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lowered the taxes for everyone,</v>

3166
02:08:18.811 --> 02:08:22.650
<v Speaker 4>personal and corporate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You attract as much foreign investment </v>

3167
02:08:22.650 --> 02:08:25.021
<v Speaker 4>as possible and you allow people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>build businesses with as little risk as </v>

3168
02:08:25.021 --> 02:08:27.991
<v Speaker 4>possible and then you allow them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>compete and if they succeed they </v>

3169
02:08:27.991 --> 02:08:27.991
<v Speaker 4>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they fail,</v>

3170
02:08:27.991 --> 02:08:32.161
<v Speaker 4>they fail and you get rid of tariffs as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well because I want cheap inputs for my </v>

3171
02:08:32.161 --> 02:08:35.791
<v Speaker 4>products and I want you products on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shelves at the store so I don't have to </v>

3172
02:08:35.791 --> 02:08:35.791
<v Speaker 4>pay a bajillion dollars for a pair of </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>

3173
02:08:35.791 --> 02:08:36.640
<v Speaker 4>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3174
02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:40.030
<v Speaker 4>my view of this is that economics is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>element of freedom.</v>

3175
02:08:40.330 --> 02:08:42.190
<v Speaker 4>I am a free person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get to do with my money.</v>

3176
02:08:42.191 --> 02:08:47.191
<v Speaker 4>What I damn well please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you don't get to stand in my way </v>

3177
02:08:47.191 --> 02:08:47.191
<v Speaker 4>unless there is some sort of moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

3178
02:08:47.191 --> 02:08:47.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>LIke if you,</v>

3179
02:08:47.301 --> 02:08:47.890
<v Speaker 4>if you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3180
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:50.560
<v Speaker 4>let's put sanctions on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's put sanctions on Iran.</v>

3181
02:08:50.561 --> 02:08:51.610
<v Speaker 4>let's put sanctions on China,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3182
02:08:51.611 --> 02:08:54.730
<v Speaker 4>China is funding North Korea right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It hurts our national security.</v>

3183
02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:59.880
<v Speaker 4>We want to put sanctions on China to try</v>
<v Speaker 4>and pressure them into ending North </v>

3184
02:08:59.880 --> 02:08:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a national security thing.</v>

3185
02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:04.140
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that like today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump rolled out this new plan on </v>

3186
02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:05.680
<v Speaker 4>immigration and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to cut down on legal immigration,</v>

3187
02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:11.160
<v Speaker 4>but the reason is because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>raise wages of people in the United </v>

3188
02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:11.160
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

3189
02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:15.181
<v Speaker 4>well that's not productive because what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually doing is you're </v>

3190
02:09:15.181 --> 02:09:17.860
<v Speaker 4>restricting the supply of labor </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificially increasing the wages,</v>

3191
02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:22.980
<v Speaker 4>which artificially increases prices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means it's not competitive on a </v>

3192
02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:23.410
<v Speaker 4>global scale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means the companies outsource,</v>

3193
02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:28.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's the exact same thing as minimum </v>

3194
02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:30.271
<v Speaker 4>wage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You create a minimum wage or </v>

3195
02:09:30.271 --> 02:09:30.271
<v Speaker 4>artificially increasing wages that </v>
<v Speaker 4>increases prices,</v>

3196
02:09:30.271 --> 02:09:31.030
<v Speaker 4>that makes it noncompetitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People outsource.</v>

3197
02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:33.910
<v Speaker 4>So it actually achieves the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're trying to achieve.</v>

3198
02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:39.180
<v Speaker 4>All government intervention in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>economy save for interventions that are </v>

3199
02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:39.880
<v Speaker 4>designed to prevent externalities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3200
02:09:39.881 --> 02:09:42.970
<v Speaker 4>things that I do that hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of those are unjustified in my view.</v>

3201
02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:44.480
<v Speaker 5>What about our environmental?</v>

3202
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:45.970
<v Speaker 4>So those are externalities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3203
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.770
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if I were to pollute a river I,</v>

3204
02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:49.220
<v Speaker 4>it's not my river,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get to pollute it.</v>

3205
02:09:49.610 --> 02:09:51.650
<v Speaker 4>I get to throw my trash over my fence </v>
<v Speaker 4>into your yard.</v>

3206
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:52.280
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3207
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:53.360
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a different thing.</v>

3208
02:09:53.630 --> 02:09:53.900
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

3209
02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:55.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the most distUrbing things</v>

3210
02:09:55.641 --> 02:10:00.641
<v Speaker 5>about this administration is the cutting</v>
<v Speaker 5>the funding for the environmental </v>

3211
02:10:00.641 --> 02:10:03.380
<v Speaker 5>protection agency in the changing of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their Standards are removing some of the</v>

3212
02:10:03.381 --> 02:10:08.381
<v Speaker 5>funding for things like satellites that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they using to track the climate change </v>

3213
02:10:08.381 --> 02:10:10.640
<v Speaker 5>and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I that,</v>

3214
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:13.780
<v Speaker 5>that scares the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it scares the shit out of me.</v>

3215
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:17.960
<v Speaker 5>They're going to ignore the environment </v>
<v Speaker 5>in favor of the economy.</v>

3216
02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:23.020
<v Speaker 4>So I think that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environmental regulations are badly </v>

3217
02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:24.200
<v Speaker 4>drawn and some of them are overwrought </v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to,</v>

3218
02:10:24.201 --> 02:10:25.130
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fracking,</v>

3219
02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:30.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obama pushed a lot of environmental </v>

3220
02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:30.220
<v Speaker 4>regulations on fracking or the keystone </v>
<v Speaker 4>xl pipeline,</v>

3221
02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:31.630
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you feel about fracking?</v>

3222
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:32.280
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3223
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm very in favor of fracking.</v>

3224
02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:38.810
<v Speaker 5>But what do you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you hear stories about more </v>

3225
02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:41.100
<v Speaker 5>earthquakes happening and the in stable.</v>

3226
02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:44.340
<v Speaker 4>So water supplies the water table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from what I've seen,</v>

3227
02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earthquake evidence is </v>

3228
02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily weak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3229
02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:49.740
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from what I've seen,</v>

3230
02:10:49.770 --> 02:10:50.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3231
02:10:50.111 --> 02:10:50.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

3232
02:10:50.761 --> 02:10:52.410
<v Speaker 4>if you present me evidence that I find </v>
<v Speaker 4>convincing,</v>

3233
02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:53.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy to change my mind on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3234
02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:54.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

3235
02:10:54.711 --> 02:10:56.550
<v Speaker 4>as far as the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as water pollution,</v>

3236
02:10:56.551 --> 02:10:57.840
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the evidence has Been pretty weak.</v>

3237
02:10:57.870 --> 02:11:02.250
<v Speaker 4>So if that changes then I'm happy to </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulate it.</v>

3238
02:11:02.251 --> 02:11:04.230
<v Speaker 4>As far as when you say it's been weak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3239
02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:07.590
<v Speaker 4>there has been instances of fracking </v>
<v Speaker 4>leading to pollution,</v>

3240
02:11:07.591 --> 02:11:08.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3241
02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.980
<v Speaker 4>But that's not every fracking leads to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pollution.</v>

3242
02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:16.200
<v Speaker 4>And so the question is coming on as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulation or how many are you willing </v>

3243
02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:16.200
<v Speaker 4>to accept?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3244
02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:17.150
<v Speaker 4>Which is the truth for all business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3245
02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:21.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm like how much we all drive cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much water bottles?</v>

3246
02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Somewhere there's a seagull choking on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cap.</v>

3247
02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.520
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like how much are you willing to </v>

3248
02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.351
<v Speaker 4>accept?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what I don't appreciate is when </v>

3249
02:11:30.351 --> 02:11:30.351
<v Speaker 4>people kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the evidence when it's like,</v>

3250
02:11:30.351 --> 02:11:32.010
<v Speaker 4>oh well I accept my set my water on fire</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of fracking.</v>

3251
02:11:32.011 --> 02:11:32.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3252
02:11:32.641 --> 02:11:34.680
<v Speaker 4>that's not because of fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's because of the ground water.</v>

3253
02:11:34.681 --> 02:11:36.190
<v Speaker 4>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3254
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3255
02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:38.910
<v Speaker 4>as far as the satellites in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in global warming,</v>

3256
02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.510
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

3257
02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:44.400
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's pretty clear that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>climate is warming,</v>

3258
02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:46.620
<v Speaker 4>mean the greenhouse gas effect is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3259
02:11:47.130 --> 02:11:50.130
<v Speaker 4>The question to me is less whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening and more,</v>

3260
02:11:50.131 --> 02:11:55.131
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because even the left seems to have no </v>

3261
02:11:55.131 --> 02:11:58.710
<v Speaker 4>real solutions as to what to do except </v>
<v Speaker 4>for massively cutting economic growth.</v>

3262
02:11:59.130 --> 02:12:02.940
<v Speaker 4>And it seems to me that if we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about an increase according the epcc,</v>

3263
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:07.950
<v Speaker 4>If something like seven degrees </v>
<v Speaker 4>fahrenheit over the course of the next </v>

3264
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:07.950
<v Speaker 4>century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then on average,</v>

3265
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:07.950
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

3266
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:12.530
<v Speaker 4>not universally on average,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it seems to me that it's easier to </v>

3267
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:17.421
<v Speaker 4>just say that the climate changes over </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and maybe cities that are on the </v>

3268
02:12:17.421 --> 02:12:17.430
<v Speaker 4>coast are going to have to pull back a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit over time,</v>

3269
02:12:17.431 --> 02:12:18.720
<v Speaker 4>like a 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a long time,</v>

3270
02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:24.280
<v Speaker 4>a 100 years ago you would've said that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the pollution was the chief thing to </v>

3271
02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:28.881
<v Speaker 4>worry about in the United States because</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were all using smoke stacks and </v>

3272
02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:28.881
<v Speaker 4>parts.</v>

3273
02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:28.881
<v Speaker 4>Intuit's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3274
02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:29.010
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now,</v>

3275
02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:31.980
<v Speaker 4>not relieving to regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just through market competition,</v>

3276
02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:37.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've gotten better environmental </v>

3277
02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.950
<v Speaker 4>products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that the market does take </v>

3278
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:40.560
<v Speaker 4>care of a lot of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't actually want to live in,</v>

3279
02:12:40.710 --> 02:12:42.030
<v Speaker 4>in human waste,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3280
02:12:42.031 --> 02:12:44.550
<v Speaker 4>like we actually don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that has been disturbed.</v>

3281
02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:49.560
<v Speaker 5>Remain recently is how many times I see </v>
<v Speaker 5>bill nye on tv talking about climate </v>

3282
02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:49.560
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>

3283
02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:50.540
<v Speaker 4>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like again,</v>

3284
02:12:50.570 --> 02:12:52.710
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has the same qualifications either.</v>

3285
02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:57.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's like a mechanical engineering </v>

3286
02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:57.720
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3287
02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Well it's kind of a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3288
02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:59.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think he is from my childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3289
02:12:59.150 --> 02:13:01.550
<v Speaker 4>I believe he was a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is a standup guy.</v>

3290
02:13:01.551 --> 02:13:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3291
02:13:02.450 --> 02:13:02.960
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

3292
02:13:03.710 --> 02:13:05.170
<v Speaker 5>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see his,</v>

3293
02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:07.670
<v Speaker 5>his thing with tucker carlson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was great,</v>

3294
02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:09.410
<v Speaker 5>tucker carlson kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3295
02:13:09.590 --> 02:13:14.590
<v Speaker 5>but you're talking about science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So tell me how much of an effect do </v>

3296
02:13:14.590 --> 02:13:16.750
<v Speaker 5>human beings have on climate change and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

3297
02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:18.170
<v Speaker 5>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the science?</v>

3298
02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:21.110
<v Speaker 5>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all he wanted to say was that,</v>

3299
02:13:21.111 --> 02:13:21.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you</v>

3300
02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:23.160
<v Speaker 4>consensus settle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3301
02:13:23.170 --> 02:13:24.020
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

3302
02:13:24.070 --> 02:13:26.680
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the difference is changing,</v>

3303
02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:27.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give me a range.</v>

3304
02:13:27.491 --> 02:13:28.930
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't even have to be an exact</v>
<v Speaker 4>number,</v>

3305
02:13:28.931 --> 02:13:30.670
<v Speaker 4>but give me a range and then tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3306
02:13:30.671 --> 02:13:33.270
<v Speaker 4>what we have to do in order in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion,</v>

3307
02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:38.271
<v Speaker 4>in order to stop the climate change </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it stands or if we can't do that </v>

3308
02:13:38.271 --> 02:13:39.270
<v Speaker 4>in order to minimize it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the actual risk?</v>

3309
02:13:39.271 --> 02:13:44.271
<v Speaker 4>Also like people keep giving these </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic scenarios where it looks </v>

3310
02:13:44.271 --> 02:13:45.210
<v Speaker 4>like the day after tomorrow and dennis </v>
<v Speaker 4>quaid running into subways and shit.</v>

3311
02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:50.390
<v Speaker 4>It'S like weirder ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said was that we were supposed to </v>

3312
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:52.911
<v Speaker 4>have an ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's not gonna happen like jesus </v>

3313
02:13:52.911 --> 02:13:52.911
<v Speaker 4>christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

3314
02:13:52.911 --> 02:13:52.911
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3315
02:13:52.911 --> 02:13:54.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>randall carlson has been on my podcast a</v>

3316
02:13:54.391 --> 02:13:59.391
<v Speaker 4>few times and he's an expert in </v>
<v Speaker 4>collisions and asteroid collisions and </v>

3317
02:13:59.391 --> 02:14:02.190
<v Speaker 4>one of the things he said is he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>global warming is not great.</v>

3318
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:05.100
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's way better than global cooling.</v>

3319
02:14:05.130 --> 02:14:07.020
<v Speaker 4>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is true in the middle.</v>

3320
02:14:07.021 --> 02:14:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And kills everybody.</v>

3321
02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:09.380
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The little ice age was,</v>

3322
02:14:09.381 --> 02:14:14.381
<v Speaker 4>was not a good thing for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The global warm period was actUally a </v>

3323
02:14:14.381 --> 02:14:15.120
<v Speaker 4>pretty good thing for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean this is,</v>

3324
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:20.270
<v Speaker 4>thIs is the other thing is that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are costs and benefits to the climate </v>

3325
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.270
<v Speaker 4>changing which had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which it has throughout time,</v>

3326
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:25.010
<v Speaker 4>what are we willing to sacrifice in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to prevent in order to make that </v>

3327
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:25.010
<v Speaker 4>seven degrees into six degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3328
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:29.631
<v Speaker 4>And just losing some coastline is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real issue is far more devastating </v>

3329
02:14:31.090 --> 02:14:32.970
<v Speaker 4>than losing coast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that if you're going to worry</v>

3330
02:14:32.971 --> 02:14:34.320
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to worry about,</v>

3331
02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:34.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3332
02:14:34.731 --> 02:14:36.370
<v Speaker 4>the emissions problem to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3333
02:14:36.371 --> 02:14:38.680
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the c absorption of emissions,</v>

3334
02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:44.120
<v Speaker 4>like detoxification of the oceans like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems to me to be a bigger problem </v>

3335
02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:44.190
<v Speaker 4>than the climate changing over time.</v>

3336
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:46.860
<v Speaker 4>We're pretty adaptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of land.</v>

3337
02:14:47.190 --> 02:14:48.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we move.</v>

3338
02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:53.190
<v Speaker 4>We have historically in venice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sea level rises in venice.</v>

3339
02:14:53.191 --> 02:14:54.590
<v Speaker 4>Every year people are going to move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like,</v>

3340
02:14:54.630 --> 02:14:55.860
<v Speaker 4>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the way It works.</v>

3341
02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:59.640
<v Speaker 4>And there's this weird idea and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>true in economics.</v>

3342
02:14:59.641 --> 02:15:02.700
<v Speaker 4>It's true with global warming that where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were born is where you must die,</v>

3343
02:15:03.150 --> 02:15:04.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that you can never move.</v>

3344
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:05.010
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3345
02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:07.290
<v Speaker 4>this is the most mobile society in human</v>
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>

3346
02:15:07.730 --> 02:15:09.750
<v Speaker 4>When you get on a plane and be on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other coast in six hours,</v>

3347
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:12.770
<v Speaker 4>it's easier to move than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>

3348
02:15:12.850 --> 02:15:17.850
<v Speaker 4>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really think that the climate is </v>

3349
02:15:17.850 --> 02:15:17.850
<v Speaker 4>that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3350
02:15:17.850 --> 02:15:17.880
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to ask barbara streisand if </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's that deeply concerned about global</v>

3351
02:15:17.881 --> 02:15:22.881
<v Speaker 4>warming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why she doesn't sell the coastline to </v>

3352
02:15:22.881 --> 02:15:22.881
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>

3353
02:15:22.881 --> 02:15:24.770
<v Speaker 4>am I going to lose a lot of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a bunch of hollywood stars lose,</v>

3354
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:27.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five feet off their coastline because we</v>

3355
02:15:27.841 --> 02:15:30.840
<v Speaker 4>dIdn't kill the industry of the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States and lose $4,000,000,000,000</v>

3356
02:15:30.841 --> 02:15:31.020
<v Speaker 4>a year.</v>

3357
02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:31.890
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3358
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:35.280
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not really sure that that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have worked that way one way or another.</v>

3359
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:41.000
<v Speaker 4>It has been absolutely proven that human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings are having an effect on the </v>

3360
02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.480
<v Speaker 4>carbon dioxide levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

3361
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:43.260
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

3362
02:15:43.261 --> 02:15:44.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a greenhouse gas effect.</v>

3363
02:15:44.731 --> 02:15:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

3364
02:15:45.991 --> 02:15:50.280
<v Speaker 4>So the modeling's been so wrong that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I want it,</v>

3365
02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:53.970
<v Speaker 4>there's no level of certitude and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no level of solution that I know</v>

3366
02:15:53.971 --> 02:15:58.971
<v Speaker 4>for sure is going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're talking about human being </v>

3367
02:15:58.971 --> 02:15:59.760
<v Speaker 4>suffering in the now for the later and </v>
<v Speaker 4>let's be real about this.</v>

3368
02:15:59.761 --> 02:16:04.761
<v Speaker 4>Like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of emissions from the </v>

3369
02:16:04.761 --> 02:16:06.321
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the leading admItter is on the </v>

3370
02:16:06.321 --> 02:16:07.701
<v Speaker 4>planet right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to nydia and they're not </v>

3371
02:16:07.701 --> 02:16:07.701
<v Speaker 4>going to stop this shit anytime soon </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3372
02:16:07.701 --> 02:16:07.710
<v Speaker 4>That's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3373
02:16:07.711 --> 02:16:11.400
<v Speaker 4>there's also this thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>where if you even discuss it,</v>

3374
02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:16.460
<v Speaker 4>you become like a hitler or nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You become a climate change denier and </v>

3375
02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:19.560
<v Speaker 4>once you get locked into one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>labels,</v>

3376
02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:21.420
<v Speaker 4>you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a piece of shit.</v>

3377
02:16:21.450 --> 02:16:22.120
<v Speaker 4>Well this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3378
02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to be locked into those </v>
<v Speaker 4>labels so that they don't really want to</v>

3379
02:16:25.651 --> 02:16:28.650
<v Speaker 4>have the discussion or the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the things that I felt</v>

3380
02:16:28.651 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 4>like bill nye was not</v>

3381
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:35.130
<v Speaker 3>prepared for because I felt like he's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>lazy with this conversation because so </v>

3382
02:16:35.130 --> 02:16:35.950
<v Speaker 3>many people just appease him and agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

3383
02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's when tucker carlson was </v>

3384
02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:42.781
<v Speaker 3>challenging him on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have any data to support this </v>

3385
02:16:42.781 --> 02:16:44.830
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just wanted to sort of like play word</v>

3386
02:16:44.831 --> 02:16:46.690
<v Speaker 3>games and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have this.</v>

3387
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:47.980
<v Speaker 3>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3388
02:16:47.981 --> 02:16:49.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys on cnn,</v>

3389
02:16:49.541 --> 02:16:54.541
<v Speaker 3>there was one time when they had some </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy on who was saying exactly what we </v>

3390
02:16:54.821 --> 02:16:59.821
<v Speaker 3>were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the models they have not been </v>

3391
02:16:59.821 --> 02:17:02.641
<v Speaker 3>proven to be accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that al gore's movie predicted that </v>

3392
02:17:02.641 --> 02:17:03.370
<v Speaker 3>we'd be underwater in 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

3393
02:17:03.371 --> 02:17:04.300
<v Speaker 3>didn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3394
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Mean his predictions and emily are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

3395
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:11.250
<v Speaker 3>They're not correct at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's made some insane amount of </v>

3396
02:17:11.250 --> 02:17:11.950
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to seek out this week.</v>

3397
02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Isn't he like the first billion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 3>green guy,</v>

3398
02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:19.840
<v Speaker 3>like he's made a shitload of money off </v>
<v Speaker 3>of giving these speeches and catholic </v>

3399
02:17:20.141 --> 02:17:20.470
<v Speaker 3>trade.</v>

3400
02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:25.540
<v Speaker 3>ANd the whole thing is very strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it becomes this untouchable </v>

3401
02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:29.851
<v Speaker 3>subject like what We're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>before with transgender people or with </v>

3402
02:17:29.851 --> 02:17:31.510
<v Speaker 3>many other subjects become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't discuss them.</v>

3403
02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:34.630
<v Speaker 3>They're not even open to debate or </v>
<v Speaker 3>scrutiny.</v>

3404
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:39.870
<v Speaker 3>They become locked down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when tucker carlson was pressing </v>

3405
02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:42.700
<v Speaker 3>bill now like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the numbers?</v>

3406
02:17:42.701 --> 02:17:47.701
<v Speaker 3>Like what is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me how much of an effect are we </v>

3407
02:17:47.701 --> 02:17:50.401
<v Speaker 3>having.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And bill nye had nothing on it and it </v>

3408
02:17:50.401 --> 02:17:50.530
<v Speaker 3>just became stammered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And started getting angry.</v>

3409
02:17:50.531 --> 02:17:51.430
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3410
02:17:51.431 --> 02:17:53.650
<v Speaker 3>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is weird to see.</v>

3411
02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:55.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is the cause of your life,</v>

3412
02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:56.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more about it than everyone</v>

3413
02:17:56.711 --> 02:17:59.510
<v Speaker 3>who disagrees is a denier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I Think the way tucker handler,</v>

3414
02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:04.520
<v Speaker 3>that was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was tucker's best moment I </v>

3415
02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:04.520
<v Speaker 3>think on a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3416
02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:04.520
<v Speaker 3>I think so too.</v>

3417
02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Because he was saying essentially he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3418
02:18:05.111 --> 02:18:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not denying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's.</v>

3419
02:18:07.290 --> 02:18:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I just want you to tell me how much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an effect tell me exactly.</v>

3420
02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:11.560
<v Speaker 3>And he had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3421
02:18:11.590 --> 02:18:14.670
<v Speaker 3>so maybe bill nye is the wrong guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tend to have there,</v>

3422
02:18:14.671 --> 02:18:18.760
<v Speaker 3>but I shouldn't be selling himself like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have me come on a fucking show</v>

3423
02:18:18.761 --> 02:18:21.940
<v Speaker 3>and talk about global warming because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know anything about it.</v>

3424
02:18:21.941 --> 02:18:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Or at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bill nye should say,</v>

3425
02:18:23.531 --> 02:18:28.531
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intergovernmental panel on climate </v>

3426
02:18:28.531 --> 02:18:28.531
<v Speaker 3>change did this study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3427
02:18:28.531 --> 02:18:29.950
<v Speaker 3>You can look up the numbers there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dOn't have them off the top of my head</v>

3428
02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:33.520
<v Speaker 3>or the numbers of the fucking numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be on one of those shows</v>

3429
02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:36.280
<v Speaker 3>seven minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everybody in the media is lazy.</v>

3430
02:18:36.710 --> 02:18:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody actually does tHeir prep for a </v>

3431
02:18:41.710 --> 02:18:44.551
<v Speaker 3>debate or for tv appearances like </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the truth is you think you're </v>

3432
02:18:44.551 --> 02:18:45.370
<v Speaker 3>going to be on for five having done a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand tv heads at this point.</v>

3433
02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Most people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3434
02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm beyond for five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get through five minutes.</v>

3435
02:18:48.611 --> 02:18:53.611
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it would be that bad if I'm on for </v>

3436
02:18:53.611 --> 02:18:53.611
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how bad can it be?</v>

3437
02:18:53.611 --> 02:18:54.910
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is you can get parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>done nationally in five minutes.</v>

3438
02:18:54.911 --> 02:18:57.520
<v Speaker 3>If the person knows what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you've done that many people.</v>

3439
02:18:57.521 --> 02:19:00.610
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I think is do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk fast always is like,</v>

3440
02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:02.810
<v Speaker 3>you're Born this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My family,</v>

3441
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:04.870
<v Speaker 3>everyone in my family talks to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

3442
02:19:04.871 --> 02:19:09.871
<v Speaker 3>Just talks about it because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering if this was a strategy to </v>

3443
02:19:09.871 --> 02:19:09.871
<v Speaker 3>develop to be really good at those </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>

3444
02:19:09.871 --> 02:19:10.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3445
02:19:10.650 --> 02:19:11.290
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3446
02:19:11.291 --> 02:19:13.450
<v Speaker 3>it's been fortunate that it fits that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3447
02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:16.220
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even even my kids talk this way.</v>

3448
02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Even of the three year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was some people that are just </v>

3449
02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:21.480
<v Speaker 3>really good at blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah and you,</v>

3450
02:19:21.481 --> 02:19:23.490
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get them in the podcast and you have</v>

3451
02:19:23.491 --> 02:19:24.290
<v Speaker 3>to like peter shifts.</v>

3452
02:19:24.310 --> 02:19:26.290
<v Speaker 3>A great example though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after like 20 minutes,</v>

3453
02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want a drink?</v>

3454
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Let's have some whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a couple of glasses of clInk </v>

3455
02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:34.810
<v Speaker 3>cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we settled down and then he settled </v>

3456
02:19:34.810 --> 02:19:36.881
<v Speaker 3>into like a normal way of talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's just so used to like force </v>

3457
02:19:36.881 --> 02:19:39.450
<v Speaker 3>feeding you facts and opinions and ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3458
02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:44.740
<v Speaker 3>it's such an ineffective way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with those three heads and </v>

3459
02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:47.920
<v Speaker 3>the one person who is the host throw the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Megan Kelly throw in a question and then</v>

3460
02:19:48.170 --> 02:19:53.170
<v Speaker 3>this person is talking over that person </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's such an ineffective way to </v>

3461
02:19:53.170 --> 02:19:57.131
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that I do like </v>

3462
02:19:57.131 --> 02:19:57.320
<v Speaker 3>about long form podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this one or like mine,</v>

3463
02:19:57.321 --> 02:19:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3464
02:19:57.831 --> 02:20:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I liked the ability to actually expand </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a point on tv.</v>

3465
02:20:00.891 --> 02:20:01.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3466
02:20:01.461 --> 02:20:03.710
<v Speaker 3>you have 30 seconds of a point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>

3467
02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 3>We can make that work for us.</v>

3468
02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:09.770
<v Speaker 3>It's the only place left that you can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this unless you're making youtube videos</v>

3469
02:20:09.771 --> 02:20:11.690
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson is obviously finding out</v>

3470
02:20:11.691 --> 02:20:12.670
<v Speaker 3>that that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3471
02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:17.800
<v Speaker 3>But unless you're doing something along </v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines where no one's there but you</v>

3472
02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:20.330
<v Speaker 3>and you get to expand and express </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

3473
02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:25.660
<v Speaker 3>There's no other form of conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>like podcast where you're not getting </v>

3474
02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:28.640
<v Speaker 3>interrupted by a commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just talking and you know as well</v>

3475
02:20:28.641 --> 02:20:32.420
<v Speaker 3>as I know that conversation sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve and move and they,</v>

3476
02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:34.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I get to know you better,</v>

3477
02:20:34.011 --> 02:20:39.011
<v Speaker 3>I see how you're thinking better and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of have more questions to ask and </v>

3478
02:20:39.011 --> 02:20:41.780
<v Speaker 3>you expand more and you get to know a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person for real and that's just those,</v>

3479
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:46.870
<v Speaker 3>those television shows are so there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so divisive and that way it's hard </v>

3480
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:48.320
<v Speaker 3>for me to watch cable television because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

3481
02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:50.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I'm getting tons of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that way.</v>

3482
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cnn had nine fucking people on the other</v>

3483
02:20:52.791 --> 02:20:54.980
<v Speaker 3>day and it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The candle on cnn.</v>

3484
02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:56.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hollywood squares now.</v>

3485
02:20:56.670 --> 02:20:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson cooper standing,</v>

3486
02:20:57.950 --> 02:21:01.250
<v Speaker 3>sitting there in the middle and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and the people that had just made</v>

3487
02:21:01.251 --> 02:21:03.890
<v Speaker 3>a diagonal cool and they're interrupting</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and said,</v>

3488
02:21:03.891 --> 02:21:05.270
<v Speaker 3>excuse me while I talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might.</v>

3489
02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:06.750
<v Speaker 3>You might not interrupting me for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

3490
02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Like their grand standing and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have this point they think is going to </v>

3491
02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:13.850
<v Speaker 3>be a zinger because they wrote it last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night and it's just like,</v>

3492
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:18.910
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best you can hope for is that you </v>

3493
02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:18.910
<v Speaker 3>have 30 seconds where you say something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes viral.</v>

3494
02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:19.630
<v Speaker 3>That's basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3495
02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:21.170
<v Speaker 3>that's the extent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3496
02:21:21.171 --> 02:21:24.360
<v Speaker 3>well you've done a lot of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't get good at it.</v>

3497
02:21:24.370 --> 02:21:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're good at it.</v>

3498
02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:31.060
<v Speaker 3>But it's like we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>before that a lot of the people that </v>

3499
02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:31.850
<v Speaker 3>have debated you that are real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really fuckIng lazy.</v>

3500
02:21:32.390 --> 02:21:37.390
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have this suppose had passion </v>

3501
02:21:37.390 --> 02:21:40.541
<v Speaker 3>for something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to preparing for this </v>

3502
02:21:40.541 --> 02:21:42.860
<v Speaker 3>sort of interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not really doing that for sure.</v>

3503
02:21:42.861 --> 02:21:47.861
<v Speaker 3>And I think that part of that is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who are experts on </v>

3504
02:21:47.861 --> 02:21:50.480
<v Speaker 3>particular topics who could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure know more about their specialty</v>

3505
02:21:50.481 --> 02:21:55.481
<v Speaker 3>than I do on a lot of topics to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate change with the person who was </v>

3506
02:21:55.481 --> 02:21:56.390
<v Speaker 3>like an expert on climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not know as much as that person.</v>

3507
02:21:56.420 --> 02:21:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3508
02:21:57.560 --> 02:22:02.560
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of people who think </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're generalists and have never read </v>

3509
02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:02.560
<v Speaker 3>a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3510
02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:05.921
<v Speaker 3>lIke I know one fact about one thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that you're a denier and if I know </v>

3511
02:22:05.921 --> 02:22:06.260
<v Speaker 3>too then I beat you.</v>

3512
02:22:06.570 --> 02:22:07.690
<v Speaker 3>So that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

3513
02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:12.860
<v Speaker 3>So the climate denier thing seems to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the laziest things about the </v>

3514
02:22:12.921 --> 02:22:17.921
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not saying that there's not </v>

3515
02:22:17.921 --> 02:22:18.650
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a real issue with human </v>
<v Speaker 3>waste because I think there is,</v>

3516
02:22:18.651 --> 02:22:23.651
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a giant issue with plastic in </v>

3517
02:22:23.651 --> 02:22:23.840
<v Speaker 3>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a giant issue with pollutants in</v>

3518
02:22:23.841 --> 02:22:28.841
<v Speaker 3>our water system and our air and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of issues with the side effects of</v>

3519
02:22:29.281 --> 02:22:32.550
<v Speaker 3>being a person in the industrialized </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

3520
02:22:32.730 --> 02:22:34.320
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we burn things,</v>

3521
02:22:34.321 --> 02:22:38.670
<v Speaker 3>we create poisons and we've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to be sustainable.</v>

3522
02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:40.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any denying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>by anybody.</v>

3523
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:43.030
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also worth noting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>market makes these things better in many</v>

3524
02:22:43.031 --> 02:22:48.031
<v Speaker 4>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the fact is that if you look at </v>

3525
02:22:48.031 --> 02:22:48.031
<v Speaker 4>the areas where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3526
02:22:48.031 --> 02:22:48.820
<v Speaker 4>everyone is down on carbon based fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3527
02:22:48.821 --> 02:22:53.821
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you go to places that don't have </v>

3528
02:22:53.821 --> 02:22:55.951
<v Speaker 4>carbon based fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're burning animal dung and would </v>

3529
02:22:55.951 --> 02:22:55.951
<v Speaker 4>there is nothing worse for particulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>than,</v>

3530
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:58.150
<v Speaker 4>than animal dung and woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So as we get,</v>

3531
02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:00.250
<v Speaker 4>and If we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we did even better than than this,</v>

3532
02:23:00.251 --> 02:23:01.990
<v Speaker 4>we would get to nuclear power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3533
02:23:01.991 --> 02:23:06.991
<v Speaker 4>Which unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people have been because of </v>

3534
02:23:06.991 --> 02:23:09.270
<v Speaker 4>unbased fears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like most of france's electricity is </v>

3535
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.270
<v Speaker 4>provided by nuclear power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's about as clean as it gets.</v>

3536
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:10.130
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3537
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think so.</v>

3538
02:23:11.050 --> 02:23:13.870
<v Speaker 4>It goes dark well till it goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>fukushima.</v>

3539
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even even in worst case scenario at </v>

3540
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:18.990
<v Speaker 4>fukushima,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3541
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:23.130
<v Speaker 4>if you're talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're talking about global warming </v>

3542
02:23:23.130 --> 02:23:25.231
<v Speaker 4>and environmental damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of environmental damage </v>

3543
02:23:25.231 --> 02:23:26.380
<v Speaker 4>supposedly done by carbon emissions is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot larger than fukushima.</v>

3544
02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:28.360
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the local damage.</v>

3545
02:23:28.390 --> 02:23:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3546
02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:33.860
<v Speaker 3>that's devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a disturbing thing that they </v>

3547
02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:36.411
<v Speaker 3>don't have a way to stop that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like they've figured out a way to </v>

3548
02:23:36.411 --> 02:23:39.750
<v Speaker 3>like put a wall of ice around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>containment area and that didn't work.</v>

3549
02:23:39.751 --> 02:23:43.980
<v Speaker 3>It seems so fucking science fictiony and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really don't know what to do.</v>

3550
02:23:43.981 --> 02:23:44.160
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3551
02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:44.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3552
02:23:44.741 --> 02:23:47.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough about nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 4>containment to take off on that one,</v>

3553
02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:52.580
<v Speaker 4>but let's just say that one disaster in </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically there've been three major </v>

3554
02:23:53.111 --> 02:23:53.560
<v Speaker 4>disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3555
02:23:53.561 --> 02:23:55.390
<v Speaker 4>Chernobyl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three mile island and fukushima,</v>

3556
02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:01.040
<v Speaker 4>the only one that's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the two of those three have happened in </v>

3557
02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:01.040
<v Speaker 4>the first world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3558
02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:04.711
<v Speaker 4>Fukushima and three mile island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three mile island basically ended up </v>

3559
02:24:04.711 --> 02:24:07.441
<v Speaker 4>having no longterm impacts of cliquish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shame is really the only major disaster </v>

3560
02:24:07.441 --> 02:24:09.070
<v Speaker 4>in 40 years of industrialized countries </v>
<v Speaker 4>using nuclear power.</v>

3561
02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently they had some weird meltdowns</v>

3562
02:24:11.191 --> 02:24:14.190
<v Speaker 3>here at rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don really weren't really discussed.</v>

3563
02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't tell aBout it.</v>

3564
02:24:15.810 --> 02:24:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>

3565
02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:20.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all during the sixties,</v>

3566
02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:23.580
<v Speaker 3>fifties or the sixties when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in the rocket program.</v>

3567
02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:25.830
<v Speaker 3>But the rocket dyne stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3568
02:24:25.831 --> 02:24:30.831
<v Speaker 3>my friend's dad is a scientist and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was explaining to me the half life of </v>

3569
02:24:30.831 --> 02:24:33.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever was released in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing to concerned,</v>

3570
02:24:33.361 --> 02:24:36.600
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of rocket town was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like right there on the street,</v>

3571
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:41.870
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of articles that were written </v>

3572
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:45.951
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like worrying about people that have </v>

3573
02:24:45.951 --> 02:24:46.200
<v Speaker 3>higher cancer rates in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3574
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:51.590
<v Speaker 3>but this also like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a website called the </v>

3575
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:52.620
<v Speaker 3>sins of rocketdyne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really see if you could find that.</v>

3576
02:24:52.740 --> 02:24:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a website dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that people.</v>

3577
02:24:55.981 --> 02:24:59.160
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of cancer just living </v>
<v Speaker 3>in cities,</v>

3578
02:24:59.161 --> 02:25:04.161
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they say that one of the worst </v>

3579
02:25:04.161 --> 02:25:04.380
<v Speaker 3>environments for a human being is living</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a place that has a lot of brake dust.</v>

3580
02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're living in manhattan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get your window open,</v>

3581
02:25:07.081 --> 02:25:10.260
<v Speaker 3>you just inhaling particulates from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people there.</v>

3582
02:25:10.261 --> 02:25:13.830
<v Speaker 3>it is the sins of rocketdyne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is like,</v>

3583
02:25:13.831 --> 02:25:16.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean how much more cancer are these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

3584
02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:17.420
<v Speaker 3>This is from</v>

3585
02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:22.890
<v Speaker 4>sometimes the statistics on cancer or </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard to to correlate because you'll have</v>

3586
02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:27.900
<v Speaker 4>groupings that are sort of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's just because random </v>

3587
02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:30.721
<v Speaker 4>statistical grouping cabins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how much of it is due to x factor or </v>

3588
02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:34.711
<v Speaker 4>why factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we knew that then presumably the </v>

3589
02:25:34.711 --> 02:25:34.930
<v Speaker 4>cancer rates will be going down a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they haven't really in most cases.</v>

3590
02:25:34.931 --> 02:25:39.931
<v Speaker 4>So it's pretty rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have like a lung cancer situation </v>

3591
02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:39.931
<v Speaker 4>where smoking obviously causes lung </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>

3592
02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:43.210
<v Speaker 4>Most cancers like breast cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have no idea why it happens.</v>

3593
02:25:43.490 --> 02:25:45.330
<v Speaker 4>It's also the value itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3594
02:25:45.331 --> 02:25:50.331
<v Speaker 4>anything that happens in the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you drive from thousand oaks </v>

3595
02:25:50.331 --> 02:25:52.390
<v Speaker 4>over the hill and you look down at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>value like jesus,</v>

3596
02:25:52.391 --> 02:25:53.570
<v Speaker 4>that can't be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3597
02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:59.300
<v Speaker 4>I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been flying into the valley my </v>

3598
02:25:59.300 --> 02:25:59.950
<v Speaker 4>entire life and every time you fly into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brown gunk that is,</v>

3599
02:25:59.951 --> 02:26:01.270
<v Speaker 4>that is the valley atmosphere.</v>

3600
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:04.240
<v Speaker 4>You think that's not great mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is one area where obviously we have</v>

3601
02:26:04.241 --> 02:26:09.241
<v Speaker 4>gotten better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the smog alerts have gone down </v>

3602
02:26:09.241 --> 02:26:09.241
<v Speaker 4>tremendously in the last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3603
02:26:09.241 --> 02:26:09.880
<v Speaker 4>it's gotten a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gotten a lot better.</v>

3604
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:15.150
<v Speaker 4>And.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's also one of the things that </v>

3605
02:26:15.150 --> 02:26:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump is a relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the,</v>

3606
02:26:15.150 --> 02:26:16.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the standards,</v>

3607
02:26:16.890 --> 02:26:19.000
<v Speaker 4>the standard wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he really didn't.</v>

3608
02:26:19.050 --> 02:26:22.300
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't an emission standards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He changed the car emission standards.</v>

3609
02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's again,</v>

3610
02:26:24.370 --> 02:26:26.320
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much of the car emission </v>
<v Speaker 4>standards,</v>

3611
02:26:26.321 --> 02:26:31.321
<v Speaker 4>like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's actually a pretty thriving </v>

3612
02:26:31.321 --> 02:26:33.181
<v Speaker 4>debate in the libertarian community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly about what the standards </v>

3613
02:26:33.181 --> 02:26:36.511
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what drove greater fuel efficiency or </v>

3614
02:26:36.511 --> 02:26:36.511
<v Speaker 4>whether it was the price of gas that </v>
<v Speaker 4>drove greater fuel efficiency.</v>

3615
02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:37.750
<v Speaker 4>It has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The price of gas has,</v>

3616
02:26:37.810 --> 02:26:42.810
<v Speaker 4>has risen and fallen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see people change their buying </v>

3617
02:26:42.810 --> 02:26:42.810
<v Speaker 4>habits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3618
02:26:42.810 --> 02:26:43.510
<v Speaker 4>In the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody but an suv and then the prices</v>

3619
02:26:43.511 --> 02:26:45.070
<v Speaker 4>went up and everybody would bought a </v>
<v Speaker 4>prius.</v>

3620
02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:50.580
<v Speaker 4>Well the prius thing is interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly like the tesla thing </v>

3621
02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:53.821
<v Speaker 4>because then you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environmental disasters of creating </v>

3622
02:26:53.821 --> 02:26:53.821
<v Speaker 4>these batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3623
02:26:53.821 --> 02:26:53.821
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

3624
02:26:53.821 --> 02:26:56.200
<v Speaker 4>this is not totally green.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3625
02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:00.070
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some weird gray area to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty complex.</v>

3626
02:27:00.071 --> 02:27:05.071
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that the one thing we know </v>

3627
02:27:05.071 --> 02:27:07.171
<v Speaker 4>is that there are millions of people all</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the world for all of human history </v>

3628
02:27:07.171 --> 02:27:10.051
<v Speaker 4>who have been living in absolute penury </v>
<v Speaker 4>and misery and we now support 7 billion </v>

3629
02:27:10.051 --> 02:27:12.400
<v Speaker 4>people on the planet and the rate of </v>
<v Speaker 4>global poverty has dropped by 50 percent</v>

3630
02:27:12.401 --> 02:27:14.620
<v Speaker 4>in the last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of that is technological change,</v>

3631
02:27:14.621 --> 02:27:17.890
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that is fossil fuel use and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>before we,</v>

3632
02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:19.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we always have to ban,</v>

3633
02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:21.610
<v Speaker 4>these are two things that are worth </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about balancing like,</v>

3634
02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:26.650
<v Speaker 4>and this is what's again a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>frustrating is that sometimes you see </v>

3635
02:27:26.650 --> 02:27:26.650
<v Speaker 4>people on the environmental left who </v>
<v Speaker 4>will say,</v>

3636
02:27:26.650 --> 02:27:29.420
<v Speaker 4>well this has to be done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or it's the end of the world.</v>

3637
02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:34.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how about those people in </v>

3638
02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:34.440
<v Speaker 4>developing countries?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of those people you're going to</v>

3639
02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:34.540
<v Speaker 4>say have to live in poverty in order for</v>
<v Speaker 4>this to happen?</v>

3640
02:27:34.850 --> 02:27:36.310
<v Speaker 4>And then on the right you'll see people </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

3641
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:38.650
<v Speaker 4>well no environmental regulations at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

3642
02:27:38.651 --> 02:27:43.651
<v Speaker 4>just let it all hang out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes the market hash it out and </v>

3643
02:27:43.651 --> 02:27:44.950
<v Speaker 4>sometimes the market doesn't hash it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

3644
02:27:44.951 --> 02:27:45.510
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3645
02:27:45.570 --> 02:27:50.570
<v Speaker 4>I think a little caution is warranted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a very reasonable point </v>

3646
02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:53.911
<v Speaker 4>of view and that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I really like about your </v>

3647
02:27:53.911 --> 02:27:54.580
<v Speaker 4>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're a right leaning guy,</v>

3648
02:27:54.581 --> 02:27:56.230
<v Speaker 4>but you were very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

3649
02:27:56.231 --> 02:27:58.930
<v Speaker 4>you make argumentS that are sound and </v>
<v Speaker 4>easy to trace.</v>

3650
02:27:59.130 --> 02:28:01.300
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I appreciate it.</v>

3651
02:28:01.450 --> 02:28:03.180
<v Speaker 4>I think we need more of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3652
02:28:03.250 --> 02:28:08.230
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's rare that you find that</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a 33 year old guy that's some strange</v>

3653
02:28:08.231 --> 02:28:11.790
<v Speaker 4>sort of conservative character that </v>
<v Speaker 4>travels around a clown sap.</v>

3654
02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:15.940
<v Speaker 4>So the berkeley thing is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

3655
02:28:15.941 --> 02:28:18.310
<v Speaker 4>when is it going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>September 14th is the date it's supposed</v>

3656
02:28:18.311 --> 02:28:21.490
<v Speaker 4>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So good luck with all that and you know,</v>

3657
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:22.640
<v Speaker 4>if they cancel it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll still go.</v>

3658
02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:24.710
<v Speaker 4>You got go on a bulletproof popemobile </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3659
02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:25.440
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3660
02:28:26.290 --> 02:28:27.500
<v Speaker 4>he wears funny hat and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3661
02:28:27.501 --> 02:28:27.790
<v Speaker 4>I said</v>

3662
02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:32.410
<v Speaker 3>yours is a little low profile though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3663
02:28:32.411 --> 02:28:33.710
<v Speaker 3>we keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we keep it on the dl around here.</v>

3664
02:28:33.730 --> 02:28:34.580
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3665
02:28:34.610 --> 02:28:39.610
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do show up at these places and </v>

3666
02:28:39.610 --> 02:28:42.761
<v Speaker 3>you see the antifa people and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming and yelling and cheering and </v>

3667
02:28:42.761 --> 02:28:45.770
<v Speaker 3>that's got to be a surreal thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just you and your thoughts and your</v>

3668
02:28:45.771 --> 02:28:46.340
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3669
02:28:46.341 --> 02:28:48.190
<v Speaker 3>you're not selling babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not there.</v>

3670
02:28:48.191 --> 02:28:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Slaughter and dogs and this weekend </v>
<v Speaker 3>festival.</v>

3671
02:28:50.650 --> 02:28:51.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3672
02:28:51.201 --> 02:28:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3673
02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:52.280
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

3674
02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:53.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3675
02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:58.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not arrogant enough to think that a </v>

3676
02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:00.821
<v Speaker 4>lot of those people know who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that what happens is that </v>

3677
02:29:00.821 --> 02:29:02.981
<v Speaker 4>there's sort of a call that goes out </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a select few saying this kkk </v>

3678
02:29:02.981 --> 02:29:03.890
<v Speaker 4>members coming to campus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go stop him.</v>

3679
02:29:04.130 --> 02:29:05.870
<v Speaker 4>That's what happened at cal state la.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I spoke there,</v>

3680
02:29:05.871 --> 02:29:10.871
<v Speaker 4>there were actually a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>professors were telling their students </v>

3681
02:29:10.871 --> 02:29:10.871
<v Speaker 4>that I was a closeted member of the kkk </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

3682
02:29:10.871 --> 02:29:12.650
<v Speaker 4>Show up wearing a yarmulke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm their favorite person.</v>

3683
02:29:13.250 --> 02:29:14.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a charter member.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3684
02:29:14.391 --> 02:29:19.391
<v Speaker 4>my thing was I was literally in 26.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was hilarious that year I was 2016 </v>

3685
02:29:20.131 --> 02:29:21.230
<v Speaker 4>was a wild year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was.</v>

3686
02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:26.150
<v Speaker 4>So David Duke accused me of being a far </v>
<v Speaker 4>leftist black lives matter accused me of</v>

3687
02:29:26.151 --> 02:29:29.860
<v Speaker 4>being a member of the kkk and I was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>number one recipient to the antisemitism</v>

3688
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:31.760
<v Speaker 4>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to the anti defamation league.</v>

3689
02:29:31.761 --> 02:29:33.680
<v Speaker 4>I was the number one recipient of </v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>

3690
02:29:33.681 --> 02:29:36.050
<v Speaker 4>antisemitism in the United States for </v>
<v Speaker 4>journalists last year.</v>

3691
02:29:36.051 --> 02:29:38.930
<v Speaker 4>So I do have a little trophy in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

3692
02:29:38.931 --> 02:29:43.931
<v Speaker 4>It's the most hated jews in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a hell of a title that green </v>

3693
02:29:43.931 --> 02:29:43.931
<v Speaker 4>frog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

3694
02:29:45.290 --> 02:29:47.450
<v Speaker 4>It's a green frog and then a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>model of a gas chamber.</v>

3695
02:29:47.451 --> 02:29:48.710
<v Speaker 4>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number one,</v>

3696
02:29:48.850 --> 02:29:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I have by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by a huge margin,</v>

3697
02:29:50.121 --> 02:29:55.121
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like 40 percent of all </v>

3698
02:29:55.121 --> 02:29:57.371
<v Speaker 4>antisemitic tweets on the internet </v>
<v Speaker 4>directly to journalists in 2016 were </v>

3699
02:29:57.371 --> 02:29:58.760
<v Speaker 4>directed at me personally party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>HOly shit.</v>

3700
02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:00.350
<v Speaker 4>It was a good year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A good year.</v>

3701
02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:05.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some years are more productive than </v>

3702
02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:05.380
<v Speaker 4>others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did that feel like?</v>

3703
02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Want me to felt like my twitter feed was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a,</v>

3704
02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:11.460
<v Speaker 4>a dumpster fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anytime I recruited anybody I get </v>

3705
02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:12.230
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get people emailing me,</v>

3706
02:30:12.231 --> 02:30:14.400
<v Speaker 4>please don't retweet me because as soon </v>
<v Speaker 4>as I recruit someone,</v>

3707
02:30:14.410 --> 02:30:19.410
<v Speaker 4>they just be hit by waves of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people died off.</v>

3708
02:30:19.870 --> 02:30:24.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And since the election it's really gone </v>

3709
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.870
<v Speaker 4>down a fair bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3710
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

3711
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:25.360
<v Speaker 4>there were some pretty serious death </v>
<v Speaker 4>threats.</v>

3712
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Like I got people calling my cell phone.</v>

3713
02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:28.660
<v Speaker 4>I had to up my security.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

3714
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:30.620
<v Speaker 4>I already had a shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

3715
02:30:30.690 --> 02:30:32.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what,</v>

3716
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:35.050
<v Speaker 4>what started it off?</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably me quitting breitbart.</v>

3717
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:35.680
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3718
02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:37.410
<v Speaker 4>so when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3719
02:30:37.570 --> 02:30:38.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was not,</v>

3720
02:30:38.361 --> 02:30:43.361
<v Speaker 4>I was not a trump supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't vote for either candidate in </v>

3721
02:30:43.361 --> 02:30:43.361
<v Speaker 4>this year's election or last year's </v>
<v Speaker 4>launch support,</v>

3722
02:30:43.361 --> 02:30:43.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

3723
02:30:43.491 --> 02:30:45.160
<v Speaker 4>in the primaries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cruz cruz.</v>

3724
02:30:45.250 --> 02:30:47.070
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I support him in his position.</v>

3725
02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:48.590
<v Speaker 4>He was the closest to me politically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3726
02:30:48.591 --> 02:30:49.940
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3727
02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:52.460
<v Speaker 4>I was not pro trump during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>primaries.</v>

3728
02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:55.280
<v Speaker 4>He didn't earn my vote during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>general election.</v>

3729
02:30:55.281 --> 02:31:00.281
<v Speaker 4>I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two ways to look at your vote </v>

3730
02:31:00.281 --> 02:31:00.281
<v Speaker 4>and this is what I always said to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3731
02:31:00.281 --> 02:31:00.281
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vote for who you want to,</v>

3732
02:31:00.281 --> 02:31:01.970
<v Speaker 4>but for me there's two ways to look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>your vote.</v>

3733
02:31:01.971 --> 02:31:03.470
<v Speaker 4>It's a coupon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>expIres November 9th,</v>

3734
02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:08.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so either use it or lose it or it's </v>

3735
02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:12.490
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it says something about what you are </v>

3736
02:31:12.490 --> 02:31:14.771
<v Speaker 4>willing to accept and it's possible that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there can be election where both </v>

3737
02:31:14.771 --> 02:31:14.771
<v Speaker 4>candidates suck and you just don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>either of them.</v>

3738
02:31:14.771 --> 02:31:16.580
<v Speaker 4>So what did you do during the election?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I voted down ticket.</v>

3739
02:31:16.850 --> 02:31:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I skipped the top of the ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First time I've ever done that.</v>

3740
02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:25.371
<v Speaker 4>so I didn't think either of these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>was qualified to be president of the </v>

3741
02:31:25.371 --> 02:31:25.371
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once tRump was elected,</v>

3742
02:31:25.371 --> 02:31:26.070
<v Speaker 4>then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3743
02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:27.330
<v Speaker 4>if he does good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll praise him.</v>

3744
02:31:27.331 --> 02:31:32.331
<v Speaker 4>And If he does bad stuff I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll hit him as I would any other </v>

3745
02:31:32.331 --> 02:31:34.521
<v Speaker 4>presidents and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I've been sort of calling balls and </v>

3746
02:31:34.521 --> 02:31:37.341
<v Speaker 4>strikes with him and some of the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like gorsuch I love and some of the </v>

3747
02:31:37.341 --> 02:31:37.341
<v Speaker 4>stuff like makeup brudzinski's bloody </v>
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

3748
02:31:37.341 --> 02:31:37.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so uh,</v>

3749
02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:39.630
<v Speaker 4>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

3750
02:31:39.631 --> 02:31:40.410
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3751
02:31:40.411 --> 02:31:41.670
<v Speaker 4>I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what led off was,</v>

3752
02:31:41.671 --> 02:31:42.950
<v Speaker 4>it was a combination of three things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

3753
02:31:42.951 --> 02:31:46.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm jewish too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and obviously so a two,</v>

3754
02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:49.140
<v Speaker 4>I was working at breitbart and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>quit in the middle of the election cycle</v>

3755
02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:54.980
<v Speaker 4>after there was that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you remember the Michelle Fields </v>

3756
02:31:54.980 --> 02:31:56.631
<v Speaker 4>incident where a cory lewandowski </v>
<v Speaker 4>grabbed the reporter from breitbart or </v>

3757
02:31:56.631 --> 02:31:56.631
<v Speaker 4>the arm hurt after bruiser.</v>

3758
02:31:56.631 --> 02:31:59.280
<v Speaker 4>And then the actually bruiser bruiser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>

3759
02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:00.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she took pictures,</v>

3760
02:32:00.361 --> 02:32:01.500
<v Speaker 4>she report it to the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

3761
02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:02.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you,</v>

3762
02:32:02.731 --> 02:32:05.760
<v Speaker 4>unless you believe she bruised herself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't look much like a.</v>

3763
02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:10.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean when I watched the videos it </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked like he just kinda grabbed her </v>

3764
02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:12.960
<v Speaker 4>arm and he looked like he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her body didn't like move,</v>

3765
02:32:12.961 --> 02:32:14.550
<v Speaker 4>like she was being injured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3766
02:32:14.551 --> 02:32:16.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lets put it this way,</v>

3767
02:32:16.470 --> 02:32:17.280
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was her account.</v>

3768
02:32:17.281 --> 02:32:22.281
<v Speaker 4>That was also the accounts have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorist at the Washington post was </v>

3769
02:32:22.281 --> 02:32:22.281
<v Speaker 4>that she was grabbed hard enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bruise and then she had bruises.</v>

3770
02:32:22.281 --> 02:32:24.180
<v Speaker 4>So you know whAt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me as a fight commentator,</v>

3771
02:32:24.181 --> 02:32:29.181
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things that I see live </v>
<v Speaker 4>that look a lot worse than when you </v>

3772
02:32:29.181 --> 02:32:29.181
<v Speaker 4>watch them on video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3773
02:32:29.181 --> 02:32:30.270
<v Speaker 4>when people get knocked out like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't much of a punch.</v>

3774
02:32:30.270 --> 02:32:30.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3775
02:32:30.781 --> 02:32:34.190
<v Speaker 4>you have to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The example that comes to mind is the,</v>

3776
02:32:34.191 --> 02:32:35.340
<v Speaker 4>the ali listen punch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3777
02:32:35.341 --> 02:32:36.320
<v Speaker 4>and find number two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3778
02:32:36.321 --> 02:32:37.800
<v Speaker 4>So that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably,</v>

3779
02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:43.210
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a bad example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But bottom line is that the,</v>

3780
02:32:43.290 --> 02:32:44.700
<v Speaker 4>that she.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were three,</v>

3781
02:32:44.701 --> 02:32:47.250
<v Speaker 4>there were a bunch of different excuses </v>
<v Speaker 4>that breitbart went through on that.</v>

3782
02:32:47.251 --> 02:32:52.251
<v Speaker 4>One.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One was that she was never grabbed it </v>

3783
02:32:52.251 --> 02:32:52.251
<v Speaker 4>all and the second was that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>secret service guy.</v>

3784
02:32:52.251 --> 02:32:56.061
<v Speaker 4>And then the third was that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that from thought she was a security </v>

3785
02:32:56.061 --> 02:32:59.421
<v Speaker 4>threat and quarterly he had to protect </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump from this 90 pounds soaking wet </v>

3786
02:32:59.421 --> 02:32:59.421
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3787
02:32:59.421 --> 02:33:02.350
<v Speaker 4>and so once breitbart did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the real question for me,</v>

3788
02:33:02.351 --> 02:33:03.060
<v Speaker 4>it was not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3789
02:33:03.450 --> 02:33:04.740
<v Speaker 4>what a horrible thing had happened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

3790
02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:07.800
<v Speaker 4>It was much more about as a journalistic</v>
<v Speaker 4>entity,</v>

3791
02:33:07.801 --> 02:33:10.920
<v Speaker 4>do you stand by your reporters or do you</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand by the candidate who you support?</v>

3792
02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:14.680
<v Speaker 4>And once breitbart made clear to me that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3793
02:33:14.690 --> 02:33:15.870
<v Speaker 4>like I already knew they supported </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump.</v>

3794
02:33:15.871 --> 02:33:20.871
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't any great shock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was kind of their token non trump </v>

3795
02:33:20.871 --> 02:33:23.601
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once it became clear that they were </v>

3796
02:33:23.601 --> 02:33:24.330
<v Speaker 4>willing to sort of sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 4>journalistic credibility on the altar of</v>

3797
02:33:24.331 --> 02:33:26.220
<v Speaker 4>getting close to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I was out.</v>

3798
02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:27.990
<v Speaker 4>And then it's no longer a journalistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>outlets.</v>

3799
02:33:27.991 --> 02:33:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I quit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3800
02:33:28.891 --> 02:33:33.891
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that sort of started the ball </v>

3801
02:33:33.891 --> 02:33:33.891
<v Speaker 4>rolling as far as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3802
02:33:33.891 --> 02:33:37.080
<v Speaker 4>I really didn't get an isometric </v>
<v Speaker 4>responses on twitter before that,</v>

3803
02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:38.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not too much.</v>

3804
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Not too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I won't say that breitbart directed </v>

3805
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.070
<v Speaker 4>at amex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they did,</v>

3806
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.070
<v Speaker 4>but I think that there are a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who,</v>

3807
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:47.610
<v Speaker 4>who follow breitbart and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>milo yiannopoulos and they're pissed at </v>

3808
02:33:47.610 --> 02:33:52.461
<v Speaker 4>me and I had seen me as like an ally and</v>
<v Speaker 4>now they saw me as an enemy and this </v>

3809
02:33:52.461 --> 02:33:52.461
<v Speaker 4>kind of thing.</v>

3810
02:33:52.461 --> 02:33:52.880
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

3811
02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:54.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the war for them,</v>

3812
02:33:54.811 --> 02:33:56.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3813
02:33:56.011 --> 02:33:57.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean people enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously.</v>

3814
02:33:57.450 --> 02:34:00.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird thing about the online </v>
<v Speaker 4>hate is how much people enjoy it.</v>

3815
02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:02.460
<v Speaker 4>It's anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never get.</v>

3816
02:34:02.461 --> 02:34:05.310
<v Speaker 4>You never get tagged for it for now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine for us for now,</v>

3817
02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:10.340
<v Speaker 4>for now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've said this to a bunch of </v>

3818
02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:10.340
<v Speaker 4>college students about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3819
02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:10.340
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the outright.</v>

3820
02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:14.960
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important to mention a lot </v>

3821
02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:17.151
<v Speaker 4>of people who say they're all right </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't actually outright just because </v>

3822
02:34:17.151 --> 02:34:17.151
<v Speaker 4>you like a meme doesn't make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>outright,</v>

3823
02:34:17.151 --> 02:34:20.540
<v Speaker 4>but like there's a group of people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually like Richard Spencer and jared </v>

3824
02:34:20.540 --> 02:34:21.910
<v Speaker 4>taylor and the race based identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics of white supremacy.</v>

3825
02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:24.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and those people are actually outright,</v>

3826
02:34:24.670 --> 02:34:26.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the outright is a,</v>

3827
02:34:26.831 --> 02:34:29.740
<v Speaker 4>is coming after you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's not a lot of fun,</v>

3828
02:34:29.741 --> 02:34:30.970
<v Speaker 4>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of,</v>

3829
02:34:31.090 --> 02:34:36.090
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of young students who </v>
<v Speaker 4>will retweet things from like things </v>

3830
02:34:36.090 --> 02:34:37.540
<v Speaker 4>that are obviously nasty and are going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to hurt them in their future career,</v>

3831
02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:38.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3832
02:34:38.270 --> 02:34:38.760
<v Speaker 4>Where the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

3833
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:43.790
<v Speaker 4>they'll be joking around on facebook and</v>
<v Speaker 4>using the n word and I'll say to them </v>

3834
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.790
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

3835
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:47.280
<v Speaker 4>you may think it's funny and 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>from now your employer is going to find </v>

3836
02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:51.061
<v Speaker 4>that and you're going to be toast in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of people who start to </v>

3837
02:34:51.061 --> 02:34:52.810
<v Speaker 4>fall into this idea that what you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>online is not a mess and it is not,</v>

3838
02:34:52.930 --> 02:34:56.020
<v Speaker 4>it is not going to remain anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a matter of time for a blows.</v>

3839
02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:58.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean crap.</v>

3840
02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:01.030
<v Speaker 4>Any anonymity in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

3841
02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:06.120
<v Speaker 4>I think that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're moving in that direction and this </v>

3842
02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:06.120
<v Speaker 4>is actually a thing that botheRs me in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

3843
02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:08.240
<v Speaker 4>Like did you follow the entry to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>donald sterling saga here?</v>

3844
02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

3845
02:35:09.250 --> 02:35:11.800
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really bothered me that everybody was</v>

3846
02:35:11.801 --> 02:35:15.100
<v Speaker 4>willing to take donald sterling's team </v>
<v Speaker 4>away from him because you said something</v>

3847
02:35:15.101 --> 02:35:20.101
<v Speaker 4>shitty to his girlfriend about magic </v>
<v Speaker 4>johnson when there is no evidence that </v>

3848
02:35:20.101 --> 02:35:21.460
<v Speaker 4>there's actual discrimination among </v>
<v Speaker 4>clients at the clippers.</v>

3849
02:35:21.461 --> 02:35:26.461
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if tHere were actual evidence of </v>

3850
02:35:26.461 --> 02:35:28.711
<v Speaker 4>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then sure boycott his team and do what </v>

3851
02:35:28.711 --> 02:35:31.921
<v Speaker 4>the mba has to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I'm pretty certain that every </v>

3852
02:35:31.921 --> 02:35:35.371
<v Speaker 4>human beings has crappy things to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>intimate loved ones about groups of </v>

3853
02:35:35.371 --> 02:35:36.370
<v Speaker 4>people and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If this now becomes the standard,</v>

3854
02:35:36.371 --> 02:35:37.750
<v Speaker 4>then I think that we're all toast.</v>

3855
02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:38.470
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

3856
02:35:38.471 --> 02:35:40.660
<v Speaker 5>In his defensive it was like very </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>

3857
02:35:40.661 --> 02:35:42.040
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to get laid.</v>

3858
02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Like I was just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just saying he thought he was </v>

3859
02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:51.151
<v Speaker 5>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He thought he was with her and no one </v>

3860
02:35:51.151 --> 02:35:54.031
<v Speaker 5>was recording.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean she was trying to say that she </v>

3861
02:35:54.031 --> 02:35:54.031
<v Speaker 5>had recorded all of their conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it was a part of her,</v>

3862
02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:55.000
<v Speaker 5>her job.</v>

3863
02:35:55.090 --> 02:36:00.090
<v Speaker 4>He's like a senile old guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously not with vista viano because </v>

3864
02:36:00.090 --> 02:36:00.090
<v Speaker 4>she's a nobel prize winning physicist.</v>

3865
02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:05.690
<v Speaker 5>Like he bought her a condo and a bentley</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a ferrari and uses his interview.</v>

3866
02:36:05.700 --> 02:36:06.000
<v Speaker 5>His interview</v>

3867
02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.040
<v Speaker 4>with anderson cooper was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>classic interviews of all time I ever </v>

3868
02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:11.040
<v Speaker 4>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my goodness.</v>

3869
02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:14.310
<v Speaker 4>the moment where he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's a moment where he turns </v>

3870
02:36:14.310 --> 02:36:14.310
<v Speaker 4>to anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cooper says,</v>

3871
02:36:14.310 --> 02:36:17.670
<v Speaker 4>henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever fallen in love with a </v>

3872
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.670
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an anderson cooper who is,</v>

3873
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:18.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super gay.</v>

3874
02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:20.370
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Single request.</v>

3875
02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:21.550
<v Speaker 4>He starts laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3876
02:36:21.551 --> 02:36:22.660
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had that experience.</v>

3877
02:36:22.661 --> 02:36:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>henderson,</v>

3878
02:36:23.291 --> 02:36:25.270
<v Speaker 4>when you do fall in love with a woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he just,</v>

3879
02:36:25.340 --> 02:36:27.190
<v Speaker 4>he's so unaware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3880
02:36:27.610 --> 02:36:29.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I can't consider this guy.</v>

3881
02:36:29.350 --> 02:36:31.620
<v Speaker 4>Like he's a kkk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>threatening figure.</v>

3882
02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:34.150
<v Speaker 4>Like the guy can't even find the toilet </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the mornings.</v>

3883
02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:35.540
<v Speaker 4>He's stumBling over his autumn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like</v>

3884
02:36:35.790 --> 02:36:37.090
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did about.</v>

3885
02:36:37.091 --> 02:36:42.091
<v Speaker 5>I'm defending him where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you look at what he actually </v>

3886
02:36:42.091 --> 02:36:42.091
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's like,</v>

3887
02:36:42.091 --> 02:36:42.091
<v Speaker 5>he's a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a terrible person.</v>

3888
02:36:42.091 --> 02:36:44.350
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do me a favor.</v>

3889
02:36:44.351 --> 02:36:46.010
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

3890
02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:48.130
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't take pictures of black eyes.</v>

3891
02:36:48.131 --> 02:36:49.120
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the next sentence,</v>

3892
02:36:49.121 --> 02:36:51.010
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care if you fuck them,</v>

3893
02:36:51.970 --> 02:36:54.280
<v Speaker 5>just don't take pictures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3894
02:36:55.450 --> 02:36:56.980
<v Speaker 5>in my world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty reasonable.</v>

3895
02:36:57.870 --> 02:37:00.340
<v Speaker 5>Like you gotta grow your buying or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>ferrari.</v>

3896
02:37:00.341 --> 02:37:05.341
<v Speaker 5>All always say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just don't take any pictures so you </v>

3897
02:37:05.341 --> 02:37:05.341
<v Speaker 5>could fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She should just leave well enough alone.</v>

3898
02:37:05.341 --> 02:37:06.610
<v Speaker 5>You're getting a ferrari out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>deal.</v>

3899
02:37:06.690 --> 02:37:07.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was.</v>

3900
02:37:08.250 --> 02:37:13.250
<v Speaker 4>That whole thing was just like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was our capacity to get ourselves </v>

3901
02:37:13.250 --> 02:37:16.401
<v Speaker 4>outrage so we could show everybody how </v>
<v Speaker 4>outraged we work while the president of </v>

3902
02:37:16.401 --> 02:37:16.401
<v Speaker 4>the nba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck</v>

3903
02:37:16.401 --> 02:37:18.000
<v Speaker 2>his name is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is adam starts now,</v>

3904
02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:23.020
<v Speaker 2>adam silver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that got on tv and was talking </v>

3905
02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:23.990
<v Speaker 2>about it like it was the most horrific </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's ever been said by being jim</v>

3906
02:37:23.991 --> 02:37:26.690
<v Speaker 2>crow at at clipper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the staples center.</v>

3907
02:37:26.691 --> 02:37:29.090
<v Speaker 2>He shoUld have gotten on tv and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3908
02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:30.830
<v Speaker 2>this is obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what this was.</v>

3909
02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:34.130
<v Speaker 2>This is a gold digger and an old man to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stories all the time.</v>

3910
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:36.170
<v Speaker 2>He said some stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old people say,</v>

3911
02:37:36.171 --> 02:37:37.790
<v Speaker 2>stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old guy.</v>

3912
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't take his advice.</v>

3913
02:37:39.441 --> 02:37:42.620
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he probably should have said,</v>

3914
02:37:42.621 --> 02:37:47.621
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the bright side he told her she </v>

3915
02:37:47.621 --> 02:37:47.621
<v Speaker 2>can go fuck black guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hey,</v>

3916
02:37:47.621 --> 02:37:49.160
<v Speaker 2>everybody's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would have been better?</v>

3917
02:37:49.330 --> 02:37:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Presser the ratings with self righteous </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bullshit and let me know a lot of </v>

3918
02:37:55.070 --> 02:38:00.070
<v Speaker 2>that again is I think that if you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the nba statistics and who watches </v>

3919
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:03.400
<v Speaker 2>the nba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outsides number of people who </v>

3920
02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:05.381
<v Speaker 2>watched the nba are black and they spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>an outsized amount of time watching it </v>

3921
02:38:05.381 --> 02:38:08.651
<v Speaker 2>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>donald sterling pissed off a lot of </v>

3922
02:38:08.651 --> 02:38:10.991
<v Speaker 2>black folks with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understandably until a lot of people </v>

3923
02:38:10.991 --> 02:38:13.091
<v Speaker 2>were like ending the nba was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to lose our fan base </v>

3924
02:38:13.091 --> 02:38:13.091
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>

3925
02:38:13.091 --> 02:38:13.091
<v Speaker 2>It was a money decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

3926
02:38:13.091 --> 02:38:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was a values decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as money.</v>

3927
02:38:14.161 --> 02:38:19.161
<v Speaker 2>While I agree with you 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they had to make that </v>

3928
02:38:19.161 --> 02:38:19.161
<v Speaker 2>decision that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it could have been in him.</v>

3929
02:38:19.161 --> 02:38:23.700
<v Speaker 2>They could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have divested him and put him </v>

3930
02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:23.700
<v Speaker 2>like put his kids or his wife in charge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the team.</v>

3931
02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Like this idea that you're gonna force </v>
<v Speaker 2>him to sell his team,</v>

3932
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:29.950
<v Speaker 2>it's going to disband the clippers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was a tape of an old man </v>

3933
02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:30.920
<v Speaker 2>saying stupid ass things to a gold </v>
<v Speaker 2>digger is.</v>

3934
02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:36.260
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much so anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wound up making more money from </v>

3935
02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:37.370
<v Speaker 2>that team that he ever would have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much more valuable.</v>

3936
02:38:37.371 --> 02:38:38.480
<v Speaker 2>jillion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3937
02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:41.780
<v Speaker 2>It became much more valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the whole thing is bizaRre.</v>

3938
02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it,</v>
