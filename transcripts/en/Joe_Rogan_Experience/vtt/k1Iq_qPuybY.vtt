3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>but in this little world where everything's like jammed in together and you have</v>

4
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>these clearly defined things like this guy has got a plaque on his desk that</v>

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>says the boss,</v>

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and you got to come in and he's got the desk.</v>

8
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:18.181
<v Speaker 1>Come on and shut the door.</v>

9
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Shut the door.</v>

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Or if you like Matt Lauer,</v>

11
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>you've got a button where you lock the door,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We've got to discuss.</v>

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>We've got to review your progress.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This click.</v>

18
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>This is the world.</v>

19
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>if mean not exonerating.</v>

21
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Matt Lauer can't believe I to say this again,</v>

22
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in that guy's world and I don't even know what he did,</v>

23
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pay attention.</v>

24
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.351
<v Speaker 1>I met him once.</v>

25
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>He was quite a gentleman,</v>

26
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>but he's in this.</v>

27
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>He's got to be working 10,</v>

28
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>12 hours a day.</v>

29
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>You're doing the today show.</v>

30
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

31
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>it's insanely competitive.</v>

32
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>That morning TV thing,</v>

33
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you have to be on the ball.</v>

34
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>You have meetings,</v>

35
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you have fucking stuff to review.</v>

36
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:52.641
<v Speaker 1>You have guests.</v>

37
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to review your performance in your conversations with people and.</v>

38
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

40
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>whenever you start talking about sex,</v>

42
00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>people drop off.</v>

43
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

44
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.931
<v Speaker 1>we've got the numbers.</v>

45
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>We have the chart in the direct relation to what you were saying earlier is what</v>

46
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I read about Matt Lauer was that,</v>

47
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

49
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't have sex with just normal people because he's famous and he's,</v>

50
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>he'd get in trouble and he's married.</v>

52
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So he had to maintain the facade of that.</v>

53
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>He and he couldn't have sex with other famous people because that would come out</v>

54
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.161
<v Speaker 1>into the press.</v>

55
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>So he had to have sex with people who weren't famous.</v>

56
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>They weren't just normal people.</v>

57
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And that left the office.</v>

58
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.973
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

59
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>So imagine if we lived in a world where we said,</v>

60
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit if Matt Lauer's fucking someone other than his wife?</v>

61
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 1>That's between them.</v>

62
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.911
<v Speaker 1>The sixties,</v>

63
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:33.744
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

64
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that was back when Dustin Hoffman was grabbing titties.</v>

65
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Shoot,</v>

66
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>if you guys ever seen,</v>

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

69
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>the last word on this for me anyway,</v>

70
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>the people who are acting shocked and outraged around Matt Lauer and Charlie</v>

71
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>rose are full of shit.</v>

72
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what I.</v>

73
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>that's what kills me.</v>

74
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>The hypocrisy of the people who have been working with them for years and going,</v>

75
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

76
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>

77
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I heard about Charlie rose being a fucking creep 15 years ago and I don't even</v>

78
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>work in media.</v>

79
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.283
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

80
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like the bill cosby thing was open.</v>

81
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>The bill cosby thing was an open cab.</v>

82
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.421
<v Speaker 1>If you see,</v>

83
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.090
<v Speaker 1>if you guys seen this is one of,</v>

84
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>one of the grossest things you can witness in a workplace is when the boss</v>

85
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>starts giving fucking neck back</v>

86
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 2>rubs.</v>

87
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.670

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.760
<v Speaker 2>So it is.</v>

90
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 2>It is so fucking creepy to watch a big fat fucking boss saddling up behind some</v>

91
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 2>married secretary.</v>

92
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.080

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.440
<v Speaker 2>The day carol rubbing her neck and we could see the look on her face frozen.</v>

96
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 2>She's got kids.</v>

97
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.921
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

98
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:42.310

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't really want you to touch me right now.</v>

102
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 2>He's going to go,</v>

103
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.381

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.131
<v Speaker 2>they just don't know.</v>

116

<v Speaker 2>If you can't feel their fucking.</v>

120
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Adam's trying to escape your sweaty God damn fucking male.</v>

121
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.523
<v Speaker 2>Dominator.</v>

122
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.150
<v Speaker 1>How many guys become friends with women?</v>

123
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Have Air tag friends just so they just creeping closer.</v>

124
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:42.891
<v Speaker 1>Almost like your stock and big game and you want to just move real close to and</v>

125
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're doing.</v>

126
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.270
<v Speaker 1>One of the classics.</v>

127
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.800
<v Speaker 1>That's how I hunt elk.</v>

128
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I walk real slow.</v>

129
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Give it a neck rub.</v>

130
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Try not to make my intentions known,</v>

131
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.450
<v Speaker 1>but Eddie is one of the greatest Jujitsu coaches on planet earth.</v>

132
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It means an amazing Jujitsu coach and Jujitsu competitor,</v>

133
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.410
<v Speaker 1>and one of Eric Dubai's biggest videos is about how Jujitsu is bullshit.</v>

134
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you.</v>

135
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

136
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

137
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.950
<v Speaker 1>About that.</v>

138
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like about wing Chung Kung Fu defeats Jujitsu,</v>

139
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.200
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way,</v>

140
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:16.830
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

141
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't try it unless you're like way bigger and the guy sucks at Jujitsu.</v>

142
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.970
<v Speaker 1>She got those guys in a room together and they can just spit it out.</v>

143
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

144
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.613
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

145
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.930
<v Speaker 1>They would just talk about conspiracies to the end of time.</v>

146
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Eddie loves conspiracies.</v>

147
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I would like to talk to Eddie.</v>

148
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 1>We can do that.</v>

149
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>He's screaming,</v>

150
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.893
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>

151
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Might have to get you some earplugs here tonight.</v>

152
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I said kick him.</v>

153
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.940
<v Speaker 1>He's interesting because he knows so much about them all.</v>

154
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

155
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting.</v>

156
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.701
<v Speaker 1>Confuses me.</v>

157
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:41.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

158
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:43.380
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you have?</v>

159
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Where do you have the time for this?</v>

160
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 1>He's spouting off this,</v>

162
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:48.870
<v Speaker 1>this advanced physics references,</v>

163
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Mickelson areas failure and things like that,</v>

164
00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:52.830
<v Speaker 1>and it is.</v>

165
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Those are the flatter things.</v>

166
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

167
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.990
<v Speaker 1>those science experiments that supposedly proved the.</v>

168
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 1>The wasn't moving.</v>

169
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>That one's hilarious to me because when I first brought it up to Eddie,</v>

170
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Jamie pulled this up and send it to me the other day that I first brought it up</v>

171
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:09.390
<v Speaker 1>to Eddie from like eight years ago on the podcast,</v>

172
00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:14.391
<v Speaker 1>one of the really early podcast when we still did it in my house on a couch and</v>

173
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

174
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>what's the most ridiculous conspiracy theory?</v>

175
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>You're hurt?</v>

176
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.960
<v Speaker 1>And I said flat earth,</v>

177
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.740
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

178
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

179
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>people don't believe the earth is flat.</v>

180
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So he went from that to not only use 100 percent convinced that it's flat,</v>

181
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but he's definitely willing to listen.</v>

182
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.473
<v Speaker 1>He's down the rabbit hole.</v>

183
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.363
<v Speaker 1>He got sucked in.</v>

184
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.130
<v Speaker 1>He loves it and it's probably like a lot of it is just from him watching endless</v>

185
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:35.551
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

186
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:36.690
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent what it is.</v>

187
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:37.524
<v Speaker 1>Here it is right here.</v>

188
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.910
<v Speaker 1>What's the worst conspiracy to like?</v>

189
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:42.600
<v Speaker 1>The worst one?</v>

190
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.433
<v Speaker 1>Flat Earth.</v>

191
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are on this flat to the young earth.</v>

192
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 1>That's another bad one.</v>

193
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

194
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.691
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

195
00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:47.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

196
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:48.541
<v Speaker 1>Like today,</v>

197
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 1>people don't believe that.</v>

198
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a big percentage of the Christian population that I went with the young</v>

199
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:57.780
<v Speaker 1>earth there for fucking stranger.</v>

200
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>We're all baked.</v>

201
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>So I'd probably,</v>

202
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.911
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

203
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>But that was,</v>

204
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>that was when he found out about flatter for me.</v>

205
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

206
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>you started him down the rabbit thousand episodes ago.</v>

207
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>What episode was that?</v>

208
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Fifty four.</v>

209
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>So that was probably 2010.</v>

210
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>First year.</v>

211
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

213
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't fly.</v>

214
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>That was a big on the,</v>

215
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.440
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet back then.</v>

216
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm ahead of the curve.</v>

217
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe responsible for this whole thing.</v>

218
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

219
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>he and I used to watch ufo things forever,</v>

220
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>but he got off a Ufo.</v>

221
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:30.471
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

222
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>he goes in waves,</v>

223
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

224
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Eddie goes in waves,</v>

225
00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>like we were both like really into Ufo and in particular Zechariah situation,</v>

226
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.163
<v Speaker 1>that was the big one.</v>

227
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I would've said the same thing about bill cosby,</v>

228
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.293
