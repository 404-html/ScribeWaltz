<v Speaker 2>Gestures because honestly,</v>

25
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not really hurting anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to pay respect to the people</v>

26
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.594
<v Speaker 2>who've lost their lives in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible weapons and I just think we </v>

<v Speaker 2>should remove it for rails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just show me the replacement Emoji.</v>

<v Speaker 2>God and heaven.</v>

63
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.840
<v Speaker 2>It's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It saves so much time.</v>

64
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 2>It gets across so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Language is so limited,</v>

65
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to like,</v>

66
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.443
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to hieroglyphs what </v>

67
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 2>do you eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

68
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what these emojis are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

69
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.674
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I think there are a modern version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hieroglyphs.</v>

71
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.480
<v Speaker 2>They articulate so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>it's like very efficient form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

74
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.213
<v Speaker 2>It just needs to get a little deeper so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the emojis are animated a little </v>

75
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.834
<v Speaker 2>bit so that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of tune in the Emoji to </v>

76
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:20.674
<v Speaker 2>this specific thing you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>convey to somebody instead of just the </v>

77
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 2>smiley face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they have in the Apple Watch.</v>

78
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>You can like kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can control it a little bit.</v>

79
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 2>The Smiley face Emoji.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need to be able to dial it in a</v>

80
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think by limiting like by keeping</v>

81
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 2>it more open ended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

82
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.223
<v Speaker 2>Like instead of having a bunch of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>descriptives nouns and verbs and things </v>

83
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 2>like that instead of that having more of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an open ended idea,</v>

84
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>like a smiley face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

85
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.690
<v Speaker 2>like a smiley face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

86
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 2>and then knuckles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

87
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Yo give me some knuckles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you later.</v>

88
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.863
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can kind of like keep it in </v>

89
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:01.654
<v Speaker 2>this weird non undefined stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we both know what it is but it's </v>

90
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not written anywhere.</v>

91
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it relieves you of having to like </v>

92
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 2>compose some sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I use an exclamation mark here?</v>

93
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Should I use a comma?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I need to say?</v>

94
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I just want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see him in like 20 minutes.</v>

95
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 2>It's way easier to do like an alien </v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

96
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>a thumbs up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a smiley face that says everything.</v>

97
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.663
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun when someone sends you like an </v>

<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

120
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>this is in no way saying that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented this because this is,</v>

121
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd be the first admit he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's piggy backing on a meme that we all</v>

122
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:41.584
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

123
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.683
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who wrote that first meme </v>

124
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she keeps looking at his face,</v>

125
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 2>look at his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

126
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>

127
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:55.174
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this meme when you nut and she keeps </v>

130
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.153
<v Speaker 3>Like just google when you not and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps sucking and then go to images and </v>

131
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I would like to know the percentage.</v>

135
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.753

<v Speaker 2>people who have created these that have </v>

136
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:27.031

<v Speaker 3>phases all throughout history,</v>

139
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>sucking.</v>

143
00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.043

<v Speaker 3>That might be like one of the most </v>

144
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.760
<v Speaker 3>persistent jokes currently on the </v>

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.590
<v Speaker 2>How'd you find him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

173
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Just from the stack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

174
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who like,</v>

175
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.170
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he died he guaranteed did not think</v>

176
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 2>you would land in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you not in chic.</v>

177
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.494
<v Speaker 2>It keeps me in the power of his death </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he would shatter into a million </v>

178
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:22.450
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is a meme.</v>

179
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about these memes.</v>

180
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.890
<v Speaker 2>There's guys who are like meme artists</v>

181
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 3>and they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really funny.</v>

182
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.040
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

183
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.550
<v Speaker 2>they kinda like Carlos man see a memes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

184
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.393
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably should stop using that guys </v>

185
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 2>name like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rude,</v>

186
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's really sad as everyone knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that means.</v>

187
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

188
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 2>there was just someone just tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

189
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

190
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a product in the UK that stole </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitch Hedberg Joke.</v>

191
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a product that has just written in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bag.</v>

192
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 2>His joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you want to eat rice ice,</v>

193
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:03.120
<v Speaker 2>when you want to eat 2000 of the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>things or whatever.</v>

194
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 2>They like just pop that right in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

195
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.444
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't credit him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They credited the name of their mascot </v>

196
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 2>for the company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

197
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem with memes because people</v>

198
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.144
<v Speaker 2>do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people that have pages </v>

199
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 2>where they're all their memes or someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else's that they don't give credit for,</v>

200
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.803
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they get caught and then they </v>

201
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:24.980
<v Speaker 2>have to start re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 2>retweeting stuff.</v>

203
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes you retweet the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

204
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.623
<v Speaker 2>know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you retweet someone who just copied it </v>

205
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:32.754
<v Speaker 2>from somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I've had that happen more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know,</v>

207
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 2>but they're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like what do you do?</v>

208
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:39.534
<v Speaker 2>Do you just retweet it because you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny and you laugh or should you </v>

209
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 2>hold onto it until you can find </v>
<v Speaker 2>ownership of the meme?</v>

210
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

211
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I took good question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

212
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I think if you can give credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give credit,</v>

213
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 2>but if we spend too much time getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught up in meme distribution,</v>

214
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to lose what is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful about the thing,</v>

215
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:00.144
<v Speaker 2>which is that I create some meme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upload it to the Internet and it either </v>

216
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:05.634
<v Speaker 2>like just molders on injure or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it just scatters and a trillion </v>

217
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:11.424
<v Speaker 2>pieces everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something really cool and </v>

218
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 2>beautiful in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think meme transmitters are,</v>

219
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 2>are thieves.</v>

220
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.253
<v Speaker 2>Mostly there's just a few scumbags who </v>
<v Speaker 2>take people shit and don't credit them </v>

221
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.223
<v Speaker 2>and then they get punished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually they get punished by the </v>

222
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well severely.</v>

223
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.833
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there have been a bunch of people </v>

224
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 2>that have done it and they're now make </v>
<v Speaker 2>money off of it.</v>

225
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

226
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.543
<v Speaker 2>that's where it gets weird because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people that are just </v>

227
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:39.204
<v Speaker 2>really funny and maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>introverts and they never were really </v>

228
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:44.900
<v Speaker 2>good at cracking jokes socially cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

229
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 2>they're nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're funny.</v>

230
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 2>They have a funny mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

231
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 2>And so this is a form of joke writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and joke telling.</v>

232
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really good one too.</v>

233
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.390
<v Speaker 2>So somebody had to be the first person </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come up with when she,</v>

234
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 2>you know when you come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she keeps sucking.</v>

235
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:02.784
<v Speaker 2>Someone has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is like this massive plagiarism </v>

236
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.810
<v Speaker 2>that we're all laughing at.</v>

237
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

238
00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

239
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean how do you like that guy deserves</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit cause he is funny.</v>

240
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who invented it burst.</v>

241
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was a good idea.</v>

242
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 2>It's funny he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He definitely deserves credit for it.</v>

243
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:22.464
<v Speaker 2>So I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then eventually you're going to </v>

244
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you can watermark your meme,</v>

245
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:29.094
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have watermark that you see </v>

246
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:31.404
<v Speaker 2>that sometimes but eventually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>watermark is going to get taken off </v>

247
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 2>cause you know your people were putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>in new picks.</v>

248
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean live.</v>

249
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 2>The second one is there's hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different images.</v>

250
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:41.754
<v Speaker 2>So like you could never watermark that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's very funny about it is </v>

251
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:49.041
<v Speaker 2>they'll take the word com for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a first human who for whatever</v>

252
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>reason decided to call his ejaculations </v>
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>

253
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 4>He just decided on who the fuck was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

254
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.493
<v Speaker 4>There is first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a huge point because it's </v>

255
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 4>universal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's universal.</v>

256
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you trace it back?</v>

257
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.513
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single word that a human being </v>

258
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:09.664
<v Speaker 4>uses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>theoretically you could follow it </v>

259
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:12.244
<v Speaker 4>backwards through time in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 4>you follow any organic life form you </v>

260
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called atomology.</v>

261
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:17.944
<v Speaker 4>You can look at the weird a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>language mutates over time and you know </v>

262
00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:25.690
<v Speaker 4>that it's somewhere way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way back in the back of the line,</v>

263
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 4>there had to be somebody who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll call it a mountain or whatever.</v>

264
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 4>The precursor term for mountain was </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody who was like,</v>

265
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 4>it's a hood that someone does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

266
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:38.910
<v Speaker 4>It has to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has to someone.</v>

267
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.083
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

268
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.750
<v Speaker 3>isn't that the idea that one point in </v>
<v Speaker 3>time we all had a universal language,</v>

269
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 3>but it became a giant issue because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were sort of conspiring and yeah,</v>

270
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:50.763
<v Speaker 3>they were talking too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the ways that God has </v>

271
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.460
<v Speaker 3>separated us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be butchering this.</v>

272
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about the Tower of Babel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

273
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to construct a coward or </v>

274
00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:04.460
<v Speaker 4>each heaven and God was I guess like </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>

275
00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:06.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like when ants get in your house or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

276
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.870
<v Speaker 4>they're getting too advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's a reverse engine</v>

277
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.743
<v Speaker 3>mirrored idea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you think that someone who may </v>

278
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:15.084
<v Speaker 3>be has experienced like brief moments of</v>
<v Speaker 3>human potential and realized like w </v>

279
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.420
<v Speaker 3>we're missing out on what people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of?</v>

280
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.640
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be a way where we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>all come together.</v>

281
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.090
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when there's people from one country</v>

282
00:13:27.091 --> 00:13:27.924
<v Speaker 3>like Japan and they're arguing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone from Germany and how much of </v>

283
00:13:30.541 --> 00:13:34.260
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck each person is saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>even getting through,</v>

284
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're having translators.</v>

285
00:13:36.301 --> 00:13:37.680
<v Speaker 3>You were supposed to be going to war </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>

286
00:13:37.681 --> 00:13:38.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't even understand what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

287
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that.</v>

288
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:40.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

289
00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:44.340
<v Speaker 3>we get all speak to each other and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>all could speak one language.</v>

290
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.360
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

291
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that like maybe what that tower of</v>

292
00:13:48.931 --> 00:13:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Babel is all about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like a reverse engineered,</v>

293
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.170
<v Speaker 3>like almost saying like the imagine the </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

294
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.423
<v Speaker 3>the God like power people could have if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get all openly and honestly </v>

295
00:13:59.611 --> 00:14:04.020
<v Speaker 3>communicate with each other freely and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ex experience this idea that we're not,</v>

296
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.123
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not my enemy because you were </v>

297
00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:07.850
<v Speaker 3>born over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

298
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:08.763
<v Speaker 3>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is some crazy old shit that we </v>

299
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:11.934
<v Speaker 3>should have abandoned.</v>

300
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm a go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are looking in the Bible.</v>

301
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 4>Those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing that I just did,</v>

302
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm so glad you brought this up just for</v>
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>

303
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my favorite in the New Testament,</v>

304
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.513
<v Speaker 4>my favorite Gospel is the book of John </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the very beginning of the book of </v>

305
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 4>John is some of the trippiest shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll ever read.</v>

306
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.930
<v Speaker 4>But I went back to that and so I did a </v>
<v Speaker 4>find and replace,</v>

307
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:37.180
<v Speaker 4>anyone can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool.</v>

308
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.470
<v Speaker 4>Find and replace the word God with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>programmer.</v>

309
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 4>And then you can start replacing words </v>
<v Speaker 4>with modern day,</v>

310
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.200
<v Speaker 4>a simulation theory ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

311
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it talks about Jesus,</v>

312
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:58.390
<v Speaker 4>it's like he was sent into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>simulation to bring an upgrade and those</v>

313
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 4>that accepted the upgrade would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>children of the programmer.</v>

314
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.310
<v Speaker 4>You start doing that and suddenly you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this like amazing.</v>

315
00:15:09.311 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 4>It gets really trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

316
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.743
<v Speaker 4>So when you talk about the Tower of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Babel and you look at it from the </v>

317
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:15.404
<v Speaker 4>perspective of this is a simulation </v>
<v Speaker 4>being run by some intelligent creator </v>

318
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:20.680
<v Speaker 4>force,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

319
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.420
<v Speaker 4>So you see again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well not again and again,</v>

320
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:24.254
<v Speaker 4>but right now I can think of two times </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the programmer looks at the </v>

321
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:28.910
<v Speaker 4>simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

322
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're about to wake up.</v>

323
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.623
<v Speaker 4>Like the same way the Ilan musk is </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried about ai becoming too powerful </v>

324
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.423
<v Speaker 4>in the Bible of the programmer gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>really fucking uncomfortable when the </v>

325
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:42.104
<v Speaker 4>simulation appears to be gaining too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much power and has to like shift the </v>

326
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 4>programming a little bit because there </v>
<v Speaker 4>appears to be some kind of,</v>

327
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.223
<v Speaker 4>in the mythology of the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there seems to be a recurring </v>

328
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.413
<v Speaker 4>nervousness that the sim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the programmer gets when it seems like </v>

329
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 4>the simulation is about to reach some </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain level of power awareness.</v>

330
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 4>This is in the book of Genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

331
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.253
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they ate of the tree of knowledge of </v>

332
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:09.734
<v Speaker 4>good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gain self awareness and there was </v>

333
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 4>another tree they weren't supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat from the tree of life.</v>

334
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.070
<v Speaker 4>And the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God says it's weird because in the Quran</v>

335
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 4>and in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God ref,</v>

336
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 4>it's referred to as the plural rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>than the singular.</v>

337
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 4>So God doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the versus something like,</v>

338
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they eat from the tree of life,</v>

339
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:33.260
<v Speaker 4>they will become like us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

340
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 4>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like us.</v>

341
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.790
<v Speaker 4>So there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't keep these.</v>

342
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:38.624
<v Speaker 4>We have to keep these beings somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 4>curtailed because we don't know what </v>

343
00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:45.890
<v Speaker 4>they're going to do if they gain too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much power.</v>

344
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.873
<v Speaker 4>That's in the mythology of the thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it kind of works from the simulation </v>

345
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:50.624
<v Speaker 4>theory perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we're a simulation that's on the </v>

346
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:53.864
<v Speaker 4>precipice of a kind of singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would be the simulation somehow </v>

347
00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:00.620
<v Speaker 4>becoming self aware,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then for whatever reason,</v>

348
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:01.454
<v Speaker 4>whoever's running the show doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>that to happen or hasn't wanted it to </v>

349
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:06.770
<v Speaker 4>happen throughout time,</v>

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.423
<v Speaker 5>Well it's also if you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>like eating from the tree of life and </v>

351
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 5>becoming like them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

352
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.493
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is about a psychedelic as </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get your literally talked about </v>

353
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.570
<v Speaker 5>eating something and becoming a god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

354
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.040
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about eating from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tree.</v>

355
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.630
<v Speaker 5>Like what is the tree of life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's like,</v>

356
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.950
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

357
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

358
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.680
<v Speaker 5>It's history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

359
00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:29.880
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

360
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.920
<v Speaker 5>there was trees back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

361
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.800
<v Speaker 5>If you're a literal believer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Bible,</v>

362
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:39.000
<v Speaker 5>you have to think that there was not </v>
<v Speaker 5>just an experience where God showed up.</v>

363
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.650
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not just this,</v>

364
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.663
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing that happened where God came </v>

365
00:17:43.621 --> 00:17:44.760
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he spoke to you an elevator,</v>

366
00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:45.594
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying people shouldn't eat from </v>

367
00:17:48.331 --> 00:17:49.430
<v Speaker 5>a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

368
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 5>Cause they could become a god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

369
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's kind of where if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>translating stuff from ancient Hebrew to</v>

370
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:57.594
<v Speaker 5>Greek to Latin into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to all these different languages to </v>

371
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 5>English,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

372
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:03.880
<v Speaker 5>that there's some weird shit being lost </v>
<v Speaker 5>along the way.</v>

373
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.610
<v Speaker 5>In one of them was probably calling it a</v>
<v Speaker 5>tree.</v>

374
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.653
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because we didn't even know there's a </v>

375
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 5>fucking amazing radio lab out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's out.</v>

376
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.770
<v Speaker 5>It's out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about,</v>

377
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.180
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about trees and the,</v>

378
00:18:16.181 --> 00:18:17.014
<v Speaker 5>the intelligence of trees and that trees</v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate and that they share </v>

379
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:23.710
<v Speaker 5>resources that they allocate resources </v>
<v Speaker 5>toward the needier ones.</v>

380
00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:27.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have this interaction with fungus,</v>

381
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 5>this symbiotic relationship with fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is fucking incredible man.</v>

382
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.383
<v Speaker 5>Where the fungus are eating these </v>
<v Speaker 5>microscopic bugs and getting their </v>

383
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:38.304
<v Speaker 5>nutrients from these microscopic bugs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's where the trees are getting </v>

384
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 5>their nutrients from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some of them get him from,</v>

385
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.840
<v Speaker 5>from salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's trees that were like,</v>

386
00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:46.674
<v Speaker 5>they got 70% of their nitrogen from </v>
<v Speaker 5>salmon because bears would eat under </v>

387
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:53.280
<v Speaker 5>these trees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would eat and they would leave like</v>

388
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:54.114
<v Speaker 5>fish heads under the trees and like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bears would continue to return to the </v>

389
00:18:57.071 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 5>same trees and these trees would eat the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking fish,</v>

390
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.520
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

391
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.353
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fungus inside their soil and the </v>

392
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 5>Miko rise will relationship that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

393
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.523
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing dude there if their old </v>

394
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:13.450
<v Speaker 5>life form that we are sleeping on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

395
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.633
<v Speaker 5>This plants like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is not a dig against anybody </v>

396
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:22.260
<v Speaker 5>who's a vegetarian or anyone on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other end of the spectrum that only eats</v>

397
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take the ideologies out.</v>

398
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.853
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause everybody knows that I meet or </v>

399
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:29.670
<v Speaker 5>everybody that listens to this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

400
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:30.504
<v Speaker 5>I've had issues with people for that or </v>
<v Speaker 5>proselytizing vegans and I understand </v>

401
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:35.334
<v Speaker 5>that you're doing it for a good reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're doing it for the right </v>

402
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 5>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm,</v>

403
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy for everybody that that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>living their life that way.</v>

404
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 5>If you're enjoying it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy,</v>

405
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 5>let's all just let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just look at this for a second.</v>

406
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.730
<v Speaker 5>Forget about what you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What plants are is some strange,</v>

407
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:57.060
<v Speaker 5>intelligent network of organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I say intelligent,</v>

408
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't say it can fucking do math.</v>

409
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying it can send emails and </v>
<v Speaker 5>create fucking moon rockets,</v>

410
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 5>but they communicate with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something going on.</v>

411
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.390
<v Speaker 5>They don't need to do all those other </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

412
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.433
<v Speaker 5>We defined intelligence far too </v>
<v Speaker 5>frequently by what we have created and </v>

413
00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:15.474
<v Speaker 5>what what we can do with our fingers and</v>
<v Speaker 5>when our mouths and with our ability to </v>

414
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:23.310
<v Speaker 5>communicate with each other audibly and </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a manner where I'm talking and you're</v>

415
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:26.580
<v Speaker 5>hearing and we don't respect other forms</v>
<v Speaker 5>of communication because this,</v>

416
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 5>we're so attached to our idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicating is.</v>

417
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.683
<v Speaker 5>We're ignoring some really basic shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>with how these plants and these fungi </v>

418
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.250
<v Speaker 5>communicate with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're there.</v>

419
00:20:38.251 --> 00:20:39.690
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not just communicating with each</v>

420
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:40.860
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're sending signals.</v>

421
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.053
<v Speaker 5>If one of them is getting eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're sending signals through the air </v>

422
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.950
<v Speaker 5>and it's forcing the other plants to </v>
<v Speaker 5>change the,</v>

423
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.883
<v Speaker 5>they taste</v>

424
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.130
<v Speaker 4>to discourage predation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're communicating when they're hurt.</v>

425
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.163
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do the allocate resources to more needy </v>

426
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:55.534
<v Speaker 4>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They find out who in the network is </v>

427
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 4>needy and the allocate resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

428
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:02.770
<v Speaker 4>this radio radiolab is fast and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>cool man.</v>

429
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 4>They share resources with these microbes</v>
<v Speaker 4>or with uh,</v>

430
00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 4>with these fungus you and also you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause you were saying,</v>

431
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 4>well they can't send emails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at,</v>

432
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:13.743
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you separated the human biome </v>

433
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 4>somehow from the plant kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you can't do,</v>

434
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.320
<v Speaker 4>we're completely connected to the plant </v>
<v Speaker 4>kingdom because we need oxygen to live.</v>

435
00:21:25.721 --> 00:21:26.554
<v Speaker 4>So we are deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply woven into that fabric of </v>

436
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:31.654
<v Speaker 4>intelligence that you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the point that we actually kind of </v>

437
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:38.911
<v Speaker 4>grow out of that fabric of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we have a symbiotic relationship</v>

438
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 4>with plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

439
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 4>just to exist on planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're talking about,</v>

440
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the what is called,</v>

441
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.560
<v Speaker 4>have you heard of the web of Indra?</v>

442
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.903
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the web of injury or it's also called </v>

443
00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:57.080
<v Speaker 4>the net of Indra or the web of Indra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does his from a,</v>

444
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.943
<v Speaker 4>this is hinduism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that a way to explain </v>

445
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:05.290
<v Speaker 4>this sort of inner connectedness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>connectedness of all things is this like</v>

446
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.513
<v Speaker 4>imagine like a web or a net where at </v>
<v Speaker 4>every single nexus point there is a </v>

447
00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:14.530
<v Speaker 4>jewel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the jewel dinette avenger.</v>

448
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:16.030
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then,</v>

449
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:21.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now imagine that every creature on earth</v>

450
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:25.120
<v Speaker 4>are in this universe that has any kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of sentence at all,</v>

451
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.680
<v Speaker 4>composes a tiny little jewel on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>net.</v>

452
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.813
<v Speaker 4>And so this net is every joule is </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected via like whatever connects us </v>

453
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 4>to plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is connected that's alive it,</v>

454
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:40.654
<v Speaker 4>which means that any slight movement in </v>
<v Speaker 4>any of these jewels creates a vibration </v>

455
00:22:46.931 --> 00:22:47.764
<v Speaker 4>that rolls through infinity through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire net of Indra affecting all o </v>

456
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 4>other sentient beings in some small way.</v>

457
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.500
<v Speaker 4>It's basically the idea is any third is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the jewel net avenger.</v>

458
00:22:58.930 --> 00:22:59.763
<v Speaker 4>So anything that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets sort of vibrated through the </v>

459
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.214
<v Speaker 4>rest of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything that happens in the micro </v>

460
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 4>happens in the macro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>macro happens in the micro.</v>

461
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.540
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

462
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:11.341
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

463
00:23:11.341 --> 00:23:16.341
<v Speaker 4>and it seems like this new discovery </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's come out about plants has a,</v>

464
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:17.794
<v Speaker 4>in some way really shined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shone a light on the complexity of that </v>

465
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 4>incredible net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

466
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:24.454
<v Speaker 4>cause it's so complex because then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets down to probably the quantum level </v>

467
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:28.811
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

468
00:23:28.811 --> 00:23:29.644
<v Speaker 4>if you think of the quantum reactions </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening inside the plants to create </v>

469
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:35.314
<v Speaker 4>these biochemical shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's startling when you imagine all the </v>

470
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:39.874
<v Speaker 4>weird chemical and atomic movement </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's happening inside of the thing </v>

471
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.124
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's overwhelmingly beautiful and hard </v>

472
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 4>to imagine that we get to be a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

473
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.560
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty cool.</v>

474
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.020
<v Speaker 4>But the plants are sending email,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

475
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 4>because we are the plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the plants are us,</v>

476
00:23:57.111 --> 00:24:00.300
<v Speaker 4>the plants are affecting rumor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mccann always talked about x.</v>

477
00:24:00.301 --> 00:24:03.470
<v Speaker 4>So pheromones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that Xcel pheromones,</v>

478
00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:04.304
<v Speaker 4>you'd say that mirror that plants have </v>
<v Speaker 4>pheromones that they put out to like </v>

479
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying to discourage </v>
<v Speaker 4>predation.</v>

480
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.800
<v Speaker 4>Bring in bees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that.</v>

481
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 4>I said per day session,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm smart,</v>

482
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 4>but it's a great word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the um,</v>

483
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

484
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.613
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would say that psychedelics </v>

485
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dmt,</v>

486
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.840
<v Speaker 4>these are Xo pheromones from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetable world.</v>

487
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:31.270
<v Speaker 4>I gained deal on mckinna impression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these are x o pheromones coming into</v>

488
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.113
<v Speaker 4>our biome and shifting our consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way to try to manipulate our </v>

489
00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:37.960
<v Speaker 4>behavior a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

490
00:24:37.961 --> 00:24:39.890
<v Speaker 4>and also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

491
00:24:39.891 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff coming out of the gut </v>
<v Speaker 4>biome to like,</v>

492
00:24:42.741 --> 00:24:43.574
<v Speaker 4>not only is there this flourishing </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetable kingdom that is like clearly </v>

493
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 4>alive and has its own alien </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>

494
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.653
<v Speaker 4>but we've got fucking gut biomes filled </v>
<v Speaker 4>with these bacteria that could </v>

495
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 4>theoretically be controlling our </v>
<v Speaker 4>cravings,</v>

496
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.753
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're being manipulated by these </v>

497
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 4>colonies of alien beings living in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>guts,</v>

498
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.180
<v Speaker 4>telling us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get another fucking candy bar,</v>

499
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't it be good?</v>

500
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.390
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that cool?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So true.</v>

501
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so true.</v>

502
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.370
<v Speaker 2>There's this darkness inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You then want that sugar.</v>

503
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little demon little demon that </v>

504
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 2>feeds off sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

505
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:25.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a modern,</v>

506
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a modern way of saying demonic </v>
<v Speaker 2>possession.</v>

507
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.160
<v Speaker 2>And the old days you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a demon motherfucker.</v>

508
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.131
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

509
00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:35.390
<v Speaker 2>your gut biome is craving carbohydrates </v>
<v Speaker 2>to survive.</v>

510
00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've got the plague,</v>

511
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:38.840
<v Speaker 2>how's that any different than you being </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked by Vampires,</v>

512
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's trying to kill you.</v>

513
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.773
<v Speaker 2>We take comfort in the idea that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some microscopic thing that we can even </v>

514
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:45.194
<v Speaker 2>see because that makes you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's looks a lot weirder than a </v>

515
00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 2>fucking vampire by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot</v>

516
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.060
<v Speaker 4>weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a,</v>

517
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.480
<v Speaker 4>it's not a well dressed man with a cape </v>
<v Speaker 4>and things.</v>

518
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.553
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at some kind of strange </v>
<v Speaker 4>globular transforming bit of plasma </v>

519
00:26:01.321 --> 00:26:04.330
<v Speaker 4>that's swimming around inside of you</v>

520
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 2>actively trying to destroy you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came,</v>

521
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.260
<v Speaker 2>he came to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even find them to like what,</v>

522
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.970
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did they invent microscopes?</v>

523
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.340
<v Speaker 2>If you had a gas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 hundreds I couldn't guess that.</v>

524
00:26:15.341 --> 00:26:17.710
<v Speaker 2>And that's a sad thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't guess that.</v>

525
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to guess.</v>

526
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I think Brian Cowen was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this in relationship to them discovering</v>

527
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.920
<v Speaker 2>bacteria with surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

528
00:26:26.921 --> 00:26:28.480
<v Speaker 2>it was Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Chris Ryan.</v>

529
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I think Chris Ryan might've been the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first one.</v>

530
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now I'm giving people credit.</v>

531
00:26:32.381 --> 00:26:33.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

532
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.713
<v Speaker 2>the idea was that they didn't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what bacteria was for like a long time </v>

533
00:26:39.101 --> 00:26:39.934
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't wash their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people die of horrible infections </v>

534
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>when they were to do</v>

535
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 4>surgery on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

536
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is,</v>

537
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.520
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the guy's name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You may be confined to Jamie.</v>

538
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:55.521
<v Speaker 4>It's the guy he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he realized so doctors would apparently,</v>

539
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:57.683
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would like do autopsies on corpses </v>

540
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.970
<v Speaker 4>to try to understand how the human body </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked.</v>

541
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.813
<v Speaker 4>It used to be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like a big deal to cut open a </v>

542
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:04.944
<v Speaker 4>corpse says doctors are studying corpses</v>
<v Speaker 4>and apparently they didn't know you </v>

543
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:11.050
<v Speaker 4>should wash your hands after you handle </v>
<v Speaker 4>a Corp.</v>

544
00:27:11.051 --> 00:27:16.051
<v Speaker 4>So you would like fuck around with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>corpse and then go deliver a baby.</v>

545
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:17.970
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

546
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.803
<v Speaker 4>and the babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a very high infant mortality </v>

547
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 4>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I can't remember his name,</v>

548
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:24.390
<v Speaker 4>but a doctor discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>

549
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.433
<v Speaker 4>Mind blowing idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should wash your hands before you </v>

550
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:30.870
<v Speaker 4>deliver a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there it is.</v>

551
00:27:30.871 --> 00:27:31.704
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ended up in a fucking mental asylum </v>

552
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 4>because they weren't listening to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

553
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 4>apparently what doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gentlemen,</v>

554
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:43.160
<v Speaker 4>do not need to wash their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

555
00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A gentleman,</v>

556
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.120
<v Speaker 4>a gentleman does not wash his hands </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're just innately clean.</v>

557
00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 4>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

558
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:50.370
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people had no idea.</v>

559
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 4>They thought that your com was filled </v>
<v Speaker 4>with tiny little men,</v>

560
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like little humans were in.</v>

561
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.600
<v Speaker 4>They're like tiny little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

562
00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did they think that until,</v>

563
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.953
<v Speaker 4>until the microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine until finally someone fucking </v>

564
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:04.140
<v Speaker 4>came on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

565
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:04.973
<v Speaker 6>Microscopy.</v>

566
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.273
<v Speaker 4>How long after the invention of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>microscope is someone shoot a load on </v>

567
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:15.410
<v Speaker 4>one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

568
00:28:16.331 --> 00:28:19.930
<v Speaker 4>However long it took to reach orgasm </v>
<v Speaker 4>after building it?</v>

569
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.793
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like we were talking about virtual </v>

570
00:28:21.371 --> 00:28:22.300
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

571
00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:27.301
<v Speaker 4>how long before they made a porn?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when the moment they came up with</v>

572
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Oculus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

573
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:29.710
<v Speaker 4>we knew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

574
00:28:29.711 --> 00:28:31.090
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

575
00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they did it and they did it.</v>

576
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.923
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is going to create some fucking </v>

577
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.123
<v Speaker 4>hilarious earthquakes and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different relationships and marriages </v>

578
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:54.430
<v Speaker 4>because people are going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>define whether or not fucking a Hologram</v>

579
00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.160
<v Speaker 4>is a form of infidelity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're going to have to make a rule</v>

580
00:29:01.161 --> 00:29:05.030
<v Speaker 4>for that and in your relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it okay to fuck a Hologram?</v>

581
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.370
<v Speaker 4>Not Alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a person,</v>

582
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.820
<v Speaker 4>but looks like it's fucking you looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>you right in the eyes,</v>

583
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:16.030
<v Speaker 4>right in the fucking eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

584
00:29:18.891 --> 00:29:19.700
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

585
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.450
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty weird because your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a Hologram is looking at you in the</v>

586
00:29:23.451 --> 00:29:27.470
<v Speaker 4>eyes in a loving way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain doesn't reject it.</v>

587
00:29:27.471 --> 00:29:28.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>

588
00:29:28.431 --> 00:29:30.170
<v Speaker 4>I think this girl really likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait,</v>

589
00:29:30.171 --> 00:29:31.004
<v Speaker 4>it's a hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in one millisecond you get this </v>

590
00:29:33.381 --> 00:29:37.550
<v Speaker 4>feeling of like strange connection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>

591
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.623
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in the most rudimentary parts of </v>

592
00:29:40.371 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only apparently only.</v>

593
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.440
<v Speaker 4>I just read this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might've been a dated article,</v>

594
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:45.663
<v Speaker 4>but only 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people or so own an htc vive if that's </v>

595
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 4>drastically off you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

596
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 4>but not a lot of people have vr goggles </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

597
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.473
<v Speaker 4>So not a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of us who are fucking </v>

598
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.780
<v Speaker 4>ear beating people at parties who had </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly just don't want to hear about it</v>

599
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 4>any more than you want to hear about </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone talking about it dream.</v>

600
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.503
<v Speaker 4>But there's a huge group of people right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that are having some of the most </v>

601
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:11.134
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic mind bending experiences </v>
<v Speaker 4>through technology and they can't even </v>

602
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:19.090
<v Speaker 4>talk about it or describe it to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>because when you describe it,</v>

603
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're talking about a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're like,</v>

604
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:22.174
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is happening to a lot of us right </v>

605
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:25.114
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going into alternate dimensions </v>

606
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.120
<v Speaker 4>via technology and hanging out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoying it,</v>

607
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 4>experiencing the freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

608
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.463
<v Speaker 4>from the confines of being constantly in</v>
<v Speaker 4>an infinitely located in whatever </v>

609
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:43.084
<v Speaker 4>physical space your body happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhabiting to suddenly remove that </v>

610
00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:51.751
<v Speaker 4>weights and how I can pop these things </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and instantly translocate to some art</v>

611
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.230
<v Speaker 4>universe that some geniuses created.</v>

612
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.600
<v Speaker 4>Fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shoot Arrows,</v>

613
00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.613
<v Speaker 4>wander through minecraft,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have sex with two girls who I always </v>

614
00:31:03.941 --> 00:31:06.790
<v Speaker 4>apparently going to throw out of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>house if they didn't fuck me.</v>

615
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.570
<v Speaker 4>That's what the point is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

616
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never do that.</v>

617
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:15.680
<v Speaker 4>But in this universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's what I go.</v>

618
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the kind of rapey what?</v>

619
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not rapey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

620
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:21.400
<v Speaker 4>please,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have money for the rent.</v>

621
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:23.260
<v Speaker 4>Can I suck your Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

622
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's her idea.</v>

623
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.190
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not saying you're not raping her.</v>

624
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:28.150
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

625
00:31:28.151 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 4>you gotta you gotta give up some posts </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other,</v>

626
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.863
<v Speaker 4>otherwise I'm kicking you in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could say it if you want into the </v>

627
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:33.701
<v Speaker 4>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

628
00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:35.420
<v Speaker 4>you could say whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>

629
00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.690
<v Speaker 4>You told me you have a microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a microphone,</v>

630
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:39.640
<v Speaker 4>but you can talk to it if you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Weirdo,</v>

631
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.070
<v Speaker 4>but okay.</v>

632
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.180
<v Speaker 4>How long before you can talk to it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hello?</v>

633
00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:45.190
<v Speaker 4>Four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It talks back to you.</v>

634
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.190
<v Speaker 4>Well that's you're going to look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at like a,</v>

635
00:31:48.191 --> 00:31:53.191
<v Speaker 4>so we got to figure out a way to either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I imagine that probably exists in</v>

636
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:58.270
<v Speaker 4>some rudimentary way for some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>CGI style porn,</v>

637
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:02.920
<v Speaker 4>but to be able to like instantaneously </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate with live video porn,</v>

638
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:06.520
<v Speaker 4>you're going to need some kind of ai </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I don't think we probably have just</v>

639
00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 4>yet or we are probably on the PR,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yes,</v>

640
00:32:08.471 --> 00:32:10.000
<v Speaker 4>that will ask come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

641
00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:10.834
<v Speaker 4>that's definitely going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've watched x Mckenna again on a plane </v>

642
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.390
<v Speaker 4>the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched it for the second time.</v>

643
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.350
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just as good the second time.</v>

644
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.630
<v Speaker 4>That movie freaks me out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

645
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:20.913
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the girl's so beautiful and </v>

646
00:32:22.721 --> 00:32:24.970
<v Speaker 4>she's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's so attractive.</v>

647
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.141
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

648
00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:30.580
<v Speaker 4>that guy you could see as much as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew that she was a robot.</v>

649
00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:33.550
<v Speaker 4>As much as he knew that he wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>robot,</v>

650
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.680
<v Speaker 4>as much as he knew that she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial,</v>

651
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 4>he was in love with her and she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing and it like she cared about</v>

652
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.230
<v Speaker 2>him and when she was talking to him for </v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

653
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:44.210
<v Speaker 2>like when the lights went out and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera was down,</v>

654
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 2>spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was like,</v>

655
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:47.270
<v Speaker 2>don't trust him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

656
00:32:47.271 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 2>this is like a real person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real person.</v>

657
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 2>She's thinking like a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a person.</v>

658
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:52.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like completely locked into </v>

659
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 2>this idea that it's a person he's hipped</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tie.</v>

660
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't,</v>

661
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.820
<v Speaker 2>this whole distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence and intelligence</v>

662
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 2>is the same as the distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality and reality.</v>

663
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just like another human attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in control of something.</v>

664
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:11.360
<v Speaker 2>You want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to say,</v>

665
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you if this is fucking reality</v>

666
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:13.754
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

667
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.000
<v Speaker 2>this is virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't reality reality.</v>

668
00:33:17.001 --> 00:33:17.960
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh really?</v>

669
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 2>So reality is compartmentalized into </v>
<v Speaker 2>places where there's,</v>

670
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 2>if something is created by a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

671
00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 2>that's not real reality.</v>

672
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Even though humans are reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reality is reality.</v>

673
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:30.853
<v Speaker 2>Intelligence is intelligence because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is inhabiting something </v>

674
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:35.864
<v Speaker 2>that isn't the human vessel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to what we were talking </v>

675
00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:39.110
<v Speaker 2>about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

676
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.490
<v Speaker 2>cause it's not in a fucking meat body </v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's artificial intelligence.</v>

677
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 2>How is why intelligence is intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

678
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:47.864
<v Speaker 2>and again I think it goes back to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about earlier that we </v>

679
00:33:50.601 --> 00:33:52.880
<v Speaker 2>try to define intelligence by our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>measures,</v>

680
00:33:52.881 --> 00:33:54.440
<v Speaker 2>like the ability to write something </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

681
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.750
<v Speaker 2>the ability to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

682
00:33:56.751 --> 00:33:57.584
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have that inexorably connected to </v>

683
00:33:59.031 --> 00:33:59.864
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to move to show me </v>

684
00:34:01.341 --> 00:34:03.040
<v Speaker 2>your thinking and communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

685
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.033
<v Speaker 2>Like despite what this woman was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientist on this radiolab podcast </v>

686
00:34:07.641 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 2>is that she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say that there.</v>

687
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:11.804
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say that if they're </v>

688
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:14.030
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>

689
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.980
<v Speaker 2>but what's going on is their net work </v>
<v Speaker 2>closely resembles a brain,</v>

690
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

691
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.840
<v Speaker 2>The way it looks and also the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>operating.</v>

692
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.650
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as neuron like responses.</v>

693
00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:27.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

694
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.900
<v Speaker 2>there's data being passed back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth,</v>

695
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we're just not,</v>

696
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:32.720
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you,</v>

697
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.613
<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

698
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.330
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing any research,</v>

699
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.150
<v Speaker 2>but these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are somewhat,</v>

700
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:37.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying we as in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just figuring this out really </v>

701
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everything has a conscience or a</v>

702
00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:46.550
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think every,</v>

703
00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:47.384
<v Speaker 2>everything that you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that obviously plants for </v>

704
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:54.950
<v Speaker 2>the most part are like way less violent </v>
<v Speaker 2>than animals.</v>

705
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:58.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you are taking in plants,</v>

706
00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:59.403
<v Speaker 2>it's just sent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to make sense that it would be </v>

707
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 2>like a more peaceful existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the way you think about it.</v>

708
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just consuming plants.</v>

709
00:35:08.631 --> 00:35:09.464
<v Speaker 2>Like glue it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the animals that only consume </v>

710
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:11.390
<v Speaker 2>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

711
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.100
<v Speaker 2>They're all like really peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

712
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.300
<v Speaker 2>But then the animals that consume </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and plants,</v>

713
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:18.650
<v Speaker 2>they've got to get dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

714
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Those animals and the ones that only </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet those are the scary ones.</v>

715
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

716
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

717
00:35:25.341 --> 00:35:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Well it kind of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when a percent you need different</v>

718
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:32.831
<v Speaker 2>tools for taking down a deer than you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>for eating a piece of Broccoli.</v>

719
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

720
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I think people are trying to like move </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from</v>

721
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.630
<v Speaker 5>the system that requires the violence </v>
<v Speaker 5>and like a part of that.</v>

722
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.493
<v Speaker 5>The idea of that is to eat plants </v>
<v Speaker 5>because like even if you're eating a </v>

723
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:49.190
<v Speaker 5>life form your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

724
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.093
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're less involved in violent </v>

725
00:35:52.831 --> 00:35:54.960
<v Speaker 5>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're eating meat,</v>

726
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.640
<v Speaker 5>you're involved in violent activity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

727
00:35:56.641 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 5>Some way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even fish,</v>

728
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 5>you're involved in some sort of violent </v>
<v Speaker 5>activity.</v>

729
00:36:00.601 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 5>Those fish have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't just instantaneously die.</v>

730
00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 5>They've got to be yanked into another </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimension,</v>

731
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.300
<v Speaker 5>beat over the head with wooden clubs </v>
<v Speaker 5>thrown into ice checks,</v>

732
00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.480
<v Speaker 5>chasse with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll flop and gasp for air until they</v>

733
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:13.314
<v Speaker 5>finally go still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what happens when you eat </v>

734
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:15.950
<v Speaker 5>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

735
00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is one thing that is very,</v>

736
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.543
<v Speaker 4>they're all this indicates is how </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much compassion inside of </v>

737
00:36:23.841 --> 00:36:24.674
<v Speaker 4>human beings because whether you eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>meat or whether you eat a vegetarian </v>

738
00:36:27.981 --> 00:36:30.710
<v Speaker 4>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're thinking about this,</v>

739
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:31.603
<v Speaker 4>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the cool things about us </v>

740
00:36:33.231 --> 00:36:35.180
<v Speaker 4>is that we have this sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

741
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.433
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this does seem to be a violent thing </v>

742
00:36:38.691 --> 00:36:39.524
<v Speaker 4>that I'm doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this thing I'm eating has </v>

743
00:36:41.841 --> 00:36:42.674
<v Speaker 4>suffered to some degree that I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>never want anyone I know to suffer or </v>

744
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.460
<v Speaker 4>myself as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I th th so w there's compassion there,</v>

745
00:36:52.461 --> 00:36:53.294
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we want to live in a world where we </v>

746
00:36:55.431 --> 00:36:56.264
<v Speaker 4>don't hurt things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you do want to live in a world </v>

747
00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:00.194
<v Speaker 4>where you hurt things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then you're probably in a lot of </v>

748
00:37:02.691 --> 00:37:03.800
<v Speaker 4>pain yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

749
00:37:03.801 --> 00:37:05.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so then,</v>

750
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:06.643
<v Speaker 4>but you get this is it man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the fucking Bhagavad Gita </v>

751
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.160
<v Speaker 4>because the Bhagavad Gita starts with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>warrior are June looking out on this,</v>

752
00:37:16.791 --> 00:37:17.624
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking massive army and sang to </v>

753
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.460
<v Speaker 4>God the charioteer.</v>

754
00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:23.443
<v Speaker 4>I see my friends here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see fathers and teachers and men that </v>

755
00:37:28.491 --> 00:37:30.260
<v Speaker 4>I respect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

756
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.000
<v Speaker 4>by killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't I destroy my own soul?</v>

757
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:35.953
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't it be better to go off into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>forest and live as it renunciate than </v>

758
00:37:39.681 --> 00:37:43.040
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to gain all the wealth in the world,</v>

759
00:37:43.041 --> 00:37:46.790
<v Speaker 4>but to have the blood of my teachers on </v>
<v Speaker 4>my hands.</v>

760
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.920
<v Speaker 4>And this is the beginning of the bug of </v>
<v Speaker 4>I get in,</v>

761
00:37:48.921 --> 00:37:49.754
<v Speaker 4>you would think because it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gandhi's favorite books that the </v>

762
00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:54.170
<v Speaker 4>response would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>

763
00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.900
<v Speaker 4>let's not kill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's not fight.</v>

764
00:37:56.901 --> 00:37:59.150
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the response,</v>

765
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.700
<v Speaker 4>God says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you speak words of wisdom,</v>

766
00:38:01.701 --> 00:38:02.534
<v Speaker 4>but you do not understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the beginning of the Bhagavad </v>

767
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.910
<v Speaker 4>Gita.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it starts is here's why you</v>

768
00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:09.950
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's why you have to kill.</v>

769
00:38:09.951 --> 00:38:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's why.</v>

770
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:16.600
<v Speaker 4>There is action in the universe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>will result in pain and suffering.</v>

771
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.310
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

772
00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:24.200
<v Speaker 4>is to me the best like answer to all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>

773
00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:29.000
<v Speaker 4>when Krishna reveals his universal form </v>
<v Speaker 4>is this cause called,</v>

774
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.610
<v Speaker 4>here comes this monstrous thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>arginine is describing what he's,</v>

775
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.460
<v Speaker 4>and this is the oppenheimer quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

776
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 4>home become death destroyer of worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Arjun is saying,</v>

777
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:47.670
<v Speaker 4>I see in your teeth the limbs of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>humans being chewed and eaten,</v>

778
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 4>your consuming everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your eating,</v>

779
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 4>everything is basically what he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

780
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.113
<v Speaker 4>And then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you please turn back into my </v>

781
00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:00.694
<v Speaker 4>friends?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's so fucking intense to see </v>

782
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that response is okay,</v>

783
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.480
<v Speaker 4>let's stop killing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But look,</v>

784
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 4>you're getting eaten by the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter what you do,</v>

785
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:19.990
<v Speaker 4>you're being grounded dust by the force </v>
<v Speaker 4>of time.</v>

786
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.063
<v Speaker 4>There is no escape from this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are in the digestive tract of a </v>

787
00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:25.984
<v Speaker 4>being that is gradually transforming you</v>
<v Speaker 4>into nothingness depending on what you </v>

788
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:32.890
<v Speaker 4>want to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you think there's some eternal,</v>

789
00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:33.724
<v Speaker 4>perpetual soul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in which case the digestive system is </v>

790
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.630
<v Speaker 4>freeing you from the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

791
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.640
<v Speaker 4>the terrible and limited in closure of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the human body.</v>

792
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 4>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

793
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.920
<v Speaker 4>we are being shifted and dramatic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful way.</v>

794
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:48.963
<v Speaker 4>And as that's happening to think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can somehow not realize what you </v>

795
00:39:53.981 --> 00:39:54.814
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is you are one of the digestive </v>

796
00:39:56.951 --> 00:39:59.540
<v Speaker 4>organs in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are deaf.</v>

797
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.480
<v Speaker 4>No matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

798
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 4>you are completely wiping beings out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the universe.</v>

799
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.210
<v Speaker 4>It every single fucking second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your immune system's working,</v>

800
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:14.320
<v Speaker 4>those sweeties of burrowed into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking skin and gotten into your mucous</v>

801
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:16.270
<v Speaker 4>membranes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're wiping them out,</v>

802
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.590
<v Speaker 4>your blood cells are heartlessly fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing them.</v>

803
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:24.040
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe you had an ant on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>counter when you drove your car.</v>

804
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.113
<v Speaker 4>I'd say there's a 60% to 90% chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You probably ran over some tiny little </v>

805
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 4>fucking bug that was walking across the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street.</v>

806
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:37.470
<v Speaker 4>You can't live in this universe without </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing things and um,</v>

807
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you two are being killed.</v>

808
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:41.260
<v Speaker 4>So you are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

809
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.950
<v Speaker 4>in the [inaudible] you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

810
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.390
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of stomach acid helping to </v>
<v Speaker 4>dissolve a steak.</v>

811
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:51.510
<v Speaker 4>You're a little bit of the digestive </v>
<v Speaker 4>process of the universe killing and uh,</v>

812
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 4>out putting energy from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>

813
00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.840
<v Speaker 4>That's just what everything is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>not to like justify a meat diet.</v>

814
00:40:58.841 --> 00:41:01.360
<v Speaker 4>If you could become a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>

815
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.000
<v Speaker 4>be a vegetarian if it drawn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're drawn to it,</v>

816
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.043
<v Speaker 4>it is a more peaceful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll for sure factory farming is a </v>

817
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:10.990
<v Speaker 4>giant issue for anybody with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscience.</v>

818
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Then when you get into other forms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>acquiring meat,</v>

819
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.240
<v Speaker 4>then things get more complicated because</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

820
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.840
<v Speaker 4>if you're talking about hunting in </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular,</v>

821
00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:20.674
<v Speaker 4>that's not easy for everybody to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's almost impossible for </v>

822
00:41:22.841 --> 00:41:24.690
<v Speaker 4>everybody to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

823
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:25.563
<v Speaker 4>so then you'd have to have ethical </v>
<v Speaker 4>farming and then you'd have to decide </v>

824
00:41:28.061 --> 00:41:29.440
<v Speaker 4>what is ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they,</v>

825
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 4>what does ethical mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Free range chicken,</v>

826
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 4>free range cows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free range chickens.</v>

827
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.181
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

828
00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:36.014
<v Speaker 5>and you didn't have to decide that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's certain cycle of life involved </v>

829
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:41.390
<v Speaker 5>here and then you're willing to take </v>
<v Speaker 5>part in it for your own health.</v>

830
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Speaker 5>You're going to decide I'd like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my body functions better on this,</v>

831
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 5>so I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to allow this to happen or,</v>

832
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.860
<v Speaker 5>or help it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Participant,</v>

833
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:50.300
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll participate in it.</v>

834
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.883
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think when you see a bear eat a </v>

835
00:41:54.691 --> 00:41:55.524
<v Speaker 5>salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that bear is not thinking for a fucking </v>

836
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 5>second about the feelings of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>salmon.</v>

837
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.610
<v Speaker 5>It's just holding it down and tearing it</v>
<v Speaker 5>apart with no hesitation whatsoever.</v>

838
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.520
<v Speaker 5>When we reap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let us from the ground.</v>

839
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:11.420
<v Speaker 5>Are we doing a more complicated version </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that?</v>

840
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:12.523
<v Speaker 5>Are we pretending that this thing is </v>
<v Speaker 5>this non feeling nonthinking thing </v>

841
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.950
<v Speaker 5>because it doesn't move and it can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>send emails.</v>

842
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 5>But is it possible that all these things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we call life,</v>

843
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 5>all these things have a consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything does.</v>

844
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.350
<v Speaker 5>Squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

845
00:42:27.351 --> 00:42:30.200
<v Speaker 5>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking Alfalfa.</v>

846
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that shit.</v>

847
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.300
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

848
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.081
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

849
00:42:33.081 --> 00:42:36.140
<v Speaker 4>this is what I was thinking as I've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing vr,</v>

850
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.880
<v Speaker 4>having so many philosophical thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 4>based on this incredible technology.</v>

851
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.790
<v Speaker 4>So this is what I started thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that human,</v>

852
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:48.820
<v Speaker 4>all living things are like organic </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality goggles,</v>

853
00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like a squirrel is a,</v>

854
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.613
<v Speaker 4>is like a kind of virtual reality goggle</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the universe is gazing through in </v>

855
00:42:59.421 --> 00:43:01.820
<v Speaker 4>the form of a squirrel's reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

856
00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 4>So this consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this intelligence,</v>

857
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.713
<v Speaker 4>it's like an omnipresent force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And every living thing is like a faucet </v>

858
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.400
<v Speaker 4>that its life is this intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming through and it's spreading itself</v>

859
00:43:16.401 --> 00:43:17.234
<v Speaker 4>based on the energetic system of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular conduit that it's coming </v>

860
00:43:21.261 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a living squirrel is a portal that is</v>

861
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 4>opened up to the intelligence of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe temporarily.</v>

862
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 4>And when that intelligence flows through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the squirrel,</v>

863
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.850
<v Speaker 4>the way electricity runs through a </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherboard,</v>

864
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's odd.</v>

865
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.910
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's animated,</v>

866
00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:40.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when the squirrel dies,</v>

867
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 4>that it's not as though the intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 4>is gone.</v>

868
00:43:43.941 --> 00:43:46.820
<v Speaker 4>It's just that that particular conduit </v>
<v Speaker 4>shots,</v>

869
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:47.833
<v Speaker 4>while there's a billion other conduits </v>
<v Speaker 4>in any biom filled with that </v>

870
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pouring through it,</v>

871
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and behaving according to the way,</v>

872
00:43:56.601 --> 00:43:59.420
<v Speaker 4>whatever the thing is that it's coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>through in the same way that if you have</v>

873
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a different ai programs with</v>

874
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:07.880
<v Speaker 4>different codes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still processing the same energy.</v>

875
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:08.893
<v Speaker 4>It's just the energy is being </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformed based on whatever the </v>

876
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:14.180
<v Speaker 4>specific system is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

877
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.193
<v Speaker 4>So when we meet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in a weird way eating the virtual </v>

878
00:44:18.561 --> 00:44:23.561
<v Speaker 4>reality goggles that some thing was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>infinity was using to experience reality</v>

879
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:30.050
<v Speaker 4>and that reality that it infinity was </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiencing through the vr goggles that</v>

880
00:44:30.051 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 4>you're eating inside your bond was not a</v>
<v Speaker 4>great fucking,</v>

881
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:36.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

882
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so composed in those,</v>

883
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 4>in that Goggle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that life form that you're eating.</v>

884
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.450
<v Speaker 4>This is what the Hari Krishna say is all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fear,</v>

885
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.610
<v Speaker 4>all the terror,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>

886
00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 4>the momentum of that being's life </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow gets encoded into the,</v>

887
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>atomic structure of the meat that you're</v>

888
00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:56.964
<v Speaker 4>consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you take a little bit of that </v>

889
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:03.291
<v Speaker 4>suffering into you and that degrades </v>
<v Speaker 4>your life in some slight way,</v>

890
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:04.810
<v Speaker 4>but totally me.</v>

891
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:05.643
<v Speaker 3>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally makes sense that there's </v>

892
00:45:09.101 --> 00:45:10.600
<v Speaker 3>something that gets through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

893
00:45:10.601 --> 00:45:13.300
<v Speaker 3>why would we assume that your diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

894
00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:16.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're eating biological particles,</v>

895
00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.520
<v Speaker 3>why would we assume that they have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence on us?</v>

896
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Like we would think that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just know.</v>

897
00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I broke it down to protein.</v>

898
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Water.</v>

899
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

900
00:45:25.571 --> 00:45:27.100
<v Speaker 3>no chicken suffering in there at all.</v>

901
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ain't checking software.</v>

902
00:45:28.261 --> 00:45:29.420
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a,</v>

903
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:30.980
<v Speaker 4>not a trace of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why not?</v>

904
00:45:30.981 --> 00:45:31.814
<v Speaker 4>All a dullness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a dull chicken suffering that you </v>

905
00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:36.230
<v Speaker 4>get in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

906
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.020
<v Speaker 4>just a kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Delicious chicken.</v>

907
00:45:39.021 --> 00:45:39.854
<v Speaker 4>But there's an undertone of existential </v>
<v Speaker 4>horror and my chicken waxy film on the </v>

908
00:45:45.021 --> 00:45:46.250
<v Speaker 4>inside of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

909
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.500
<v Speaker 4>just chicken sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

910
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can remember like when,</v>

911
00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.500
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't fucking,</v>

912
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.753
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you kind of knew the animals were </v>

913
00:45:57.021 --> 00:46:02.021
<v Speaker 4>like the people just were a lot like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading fucking listen to the audio book</v>

914
00:46:02.841 --> 00:46:04.910
<v Speaker 4>rather of Moby Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

915
00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:08.420
<v Speaker 4>the Frank Mueller narration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever read that book who's Frank?</v>

916
00:46:08.421 --> 00:46:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Mueller?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Frank Mueller,</v>

917
00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the guy,</v>

918
00:46:11.511 --> 00:46:16.130
<v Speaker 4>is the Vo actor who narrated the dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>tower series by Stephen King.</v>

919
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:17.023
<v Speaker 4>And he is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I guess there's no way I'm </v>

920
00:46:19.761 --> 00:46:23.180
<v Speaker 4>fucking reading moby Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but listening to someone who understands</v>

921
00:46:23.181 --> 00:46:26.900
<v Speaker 4>what he's reading helps you understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and uh,</v>

922
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.500
<v Speaker 4>cause he puts the inflection in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right place,</v>

923
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:30.383
<v Speaker 4>the inflections are in the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's clearly some kind of super </v>

924
00:46:32.631 --> 00:46:35.150
<v Speaker 4>genius who just gets moby Dick.</v>

925
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.983
<v Speaker 4>And he understands every single fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>passage that Melville endlessly writes </v>

926
00:46:40.761 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 4>about the varied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deepest details of whales,</v>

927
00:46:44.421 --> 00:46:45.254
<v Speaker 4>man Melville fucking love whales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the book is like a sort of portal </v>

928
00:46:50.151 --> 00:46:50.984
<v Speaker 4>into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before they knew that whales are </v>

929
00:46:52.011 --> 00:46:52.970
<v Speaker 4>mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

930
00:46:52.971 --> 00:46:54.150
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

931
00:46:54.151 --> 00:46:56.540
<v Speaker 4>we thought they were fucking fish </v>
<v Speaker 4>Leviathan,</v>

932
00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:57.374
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that funny that we make that </v>

933
00:46:58.431 --> 00:46:59.840
<v Speaker 4>distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about that.</v>

934
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:01.850
<v Speaker 4>I like sat there fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck them.</v>

935
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're mammals.</v>

936
00:47:03.341 --> 00:47:04.250
<v Speaker 4>They're ass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

937
00:47:04.251 --> 00:47:04.611
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

938
00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:06.470
<v Speaker 4>We can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got,</v>

939
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.590
<v Speaker 4>we got weird teams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other teams weren't.</v>

940
00:47:08.591 --> 00:47:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll answer to that.</v>

941
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.740
<v Speaker 4>If to use the virtual reality goggle </v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

942
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.753
<v Speaker 4>let's imagine there's like 15 different </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality goggles on the table </v>

943
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:23.950
<v Speaker 4>that represent a kind of spectrum of um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>technological advancement.</v>

944
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:28.340
<v Speaker 4>So here we've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

945
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 4>remember the old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you used to have those like,</v>

946
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those stupid view finders you could flip</v>

947
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 4>through and look at it.</v>

948
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So on one side we have a view finder and</v>

949
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 4>on the other side we've got some shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't even exist yet.</v>

950
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:45.991
<v Speaker 4>Some neural interface,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put it on a harmonic magnetic field,</v>

951
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 4>interacts with your brain and you not </v>
<v Speaker 4>only go into a location,</v>

952
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.570
<v Speaker 4>but you experienced the memories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions,</v>

953
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:53.643
<v Speaker 4>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dreams of the Avatar within the </v>

954
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:56.704
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You literally become the figure that's </v>

955
00:47:58.001 --> 00:47:59.470
<v Speaker 4>on the other side of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

956
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.030
<v Speaker 4>So here we have this sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>spectrum of potential experience.</v>

957
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.600
<v Speaker 4>I think it would be safe to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

958
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:11.230
<v Speaker 4>the experience of a Broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

959
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.060
<v Speaker 4>Just based on the TAC in there versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>the experience of like a,</v>

960
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:21.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fucking mit student genius who's like,</v>

961
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.843
<v Speaker 4>come healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd say that you could say that there's </v>

962
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:30.061
<v Speaker 4>a varying levels of experience as to </v>
<v Speaker 4>what is being experienced.</v>

963
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 4>Who's to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that I say it,</v>

964
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.260
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm totally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry for the rant.</v>

965
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:36.223
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

966
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.390
<v Speaker 2>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the very end of it,</v>

967
00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.280
<v Speaker 2>there was some part of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

968
00:48:44.281 --> 00:48:45.210
<v Speaker 2>just shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

969
00:48:45.211 --> 00:48:46.390
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not it.</v>

970
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.230
<v Speaker 2>So forgive me you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try with that one.</v>

971
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:51.380
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

972
00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.160
<v Speaker 2>it flopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my own brain.</v>

973
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.950
<v Speaker 2>They don't all land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't own the land.</v>

974
00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:57.170
<v Speaker 2>If they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be fun.</v>

975
00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:00.570
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I will admit when they don't land in</v>

976
00:49:00.571 --> 00:49:01.141
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

977
00:49:01.141 --> 00:49:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

978
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Why do we make the distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like God damn weird distinction.</v>

979
00:49:05.131 --> 00:49:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an intelligence distinction.</v>

980
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just decided to fish a stupid as </v>

981
00:49:08.311 --> 00:49:09.720
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

982
00:49:09.721 --> 00:49:10.610
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the,</v>

983
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.470
<v Speaker 2>here's where they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's one thing we eat all the time.</v>

984
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.620
<v Speaker 2>That is probably a smart as a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an octopus.</v>

985
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:17.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

986
00:49:17.701 --> 00:49:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked to us all the time.</v>

987
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:20.363
<v Speaker 2>They are crazy smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the new video that </v>

988
00:49:23.041 --> 00:49:23.874
<v Speaker 2>they put out of an octopus going through</v>
<v Speaker 2>a key or a whole rather than just the </v>

989
00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:28.500
<v Speaker 2>size of a quarter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

990
00:49:28.501 --> 00:49:29.370
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

991
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I did see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

992
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.920
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what they can do to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

993
00:49:34.921 --> 00:49:36.150
<v Speaker 2>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

994
00:49:36.151 --> 00:49:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna loved them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

995
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:42.510
<v Speaker 2>He was like in love with Octopi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the plural Octopi?</v>

996
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:43.403
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in love with it is he thought </v>

997
00:49:45.511 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 2>that they were like the ability to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple appendages and,</v>

998
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:50.963
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the crazy camouflage abilities they </v>

999
00:49:53.341 --> 00:49:56.430
<v Speaker 2>have would combine to really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1000
00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:00.480
<v Speaker 2>open up new levels of communication that</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans don't have.</v>

1001
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.573
<v Speaker 2>Cause it seems like he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a little frustrated by the </v>

1002
00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:05.993
<v Speaker 2>limitation of the human vocabulary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we emote things to articulate </v>

1003
00:50:10.801 --> 00:50:11.634
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be nice to have a bunch of </v>

1004
00:50:13.231 --> 00:50:14.064
<v Speaker 2>different limbs that had no bones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can turn any which way while </v>

1005
00:50:18.061 --> 00:50:22.430
<v Speaker 2>shifting colors that beats fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>emoticons by shot man.</v>

1006
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can change color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shoot ink into the air and he,</v>

1007
00:50:27.911 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 2>he</v>

1008
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.440
<v Speaker 5>was one that I first heard speculate </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the ink,</v>

1009
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:33.530
<v Speaker 5>when they shoot ink into the air,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it might be like a racer fluid.</v>

1010
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:37.370
<v Speaker 5>Like look how small that hole is and </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at this big ass octopus.</v>

1011
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:38.503
<v Speaker 5>Get through this tiny hall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you would look at that hole and </v>

1012
00:50:40.911 --> 00:50:43.010
<v Speaker 5>you would have like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no way,</v>

1013
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 5>but these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only can they get out of a hole like</v>

1014
00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:46.094
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they can walk on land for long </v>

1015
00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:50.330
<v Speaker 5>periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>climb back up into their fish tanks,</v>

1016
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.000
<v Speaker 5>lift the lid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get inside.</v>

1017
00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're aliens man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1018
00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:58.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean that might as well be on another </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>

1019
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 5>We're just used to it because it's on </v>
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>

1020
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.790
<v Speaker 5>The thing is a giant bulbous head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long moveable arms.</v>

1021
00:51:04.791 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 5>He knows how to unscrew jars and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>got like a kind of like cool,</v>

1022
00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:10.910
<v Speaker 5>relaxed look on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he's,</v>

1023
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're emotionless.</v>

1024
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 5>They're very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very strange being.</v>

1025
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.980
<v Speaker 5>It's very different than a fish and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it lives with fish,</v>

1026
00:51:21.981 --> 00:51:24.770
<v Speaker 5>so fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1027
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.490
<v Speaker 5>they're probably a smart as whales,</v>

1028
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:31.580
<v Speaker 4>everything is alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the ultimate thing though.</v>

1029
00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.733
<v Speaker 4>That's the final place you got to get to</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you are a part of a super </v>

1030
00:51:38.051 --> 00:51:43.051
<v Speaker 4>organism that is stretching through time</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the form of every generation of thing</v>

1031
00:51:44.981 --> 00:51:46.130
<v Speaker 4>that ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1032
00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.013
<v Speaker 4>And it's currently like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like this being that has an </v>

1033
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:51.933
<v Speaker 4>infinite number of appendages that </v>
<v Speaker 4>represent all living forms of life on </v>

1034
00:51:56.171 --> 00:51:59.800
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just like the same way that like you</v>

1035
00:51:59.801 --> 00:52:03.940
<v Speaker 4>investigate a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these impinj appendages have wrapped</v>

1036
00:52:03.941 --> 00:52:06.520
<v Speaker 4>around the planet and they're probing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probing,</v>

1037
00:52:06.521 --> 00:52:07.420
<v Speaker 4>probing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probing,</v>

1038
00:52:07.421 --> 00:52:08.254
<v Speaker 4>probing the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like every living thing is the </v>

1039
00:52:10.811 --> 00:52:15.430
<v Speaker 4>very end of an interdimensional </v>
<v Speaker 4>superintelligent appendage.</v>

1040
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of like the,</v>

1041
00:52:16.931 --> 00:52:18.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1042
00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:19.143
<v Speaker 4>hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy where </v>
<v Speaker 4>he said that mice are just the ends of </v>

1043
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:25.203
<v Speaker 4>the tentacles of his inner dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 4>creatures studying scientists that </v>

1044
00:52:28.391 --> 00:52:33.391
<v Speaker 4>laboratory mice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a fucking genius.</v>

1045
00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.773
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1046
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:35.883
<v Speaker 4>in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at like every single </v>

1047
00:52:38.141 --> 00:52:42.100
<v Speaker 4>living being on earth is actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>protruding from,</v>

1048
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1049
00:52:43.391 --> 00:52:44.224
<v Speaker 4>generation after generation of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>that stretches back to the beginning of </v>

1050
00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:51.850
<v Speaker 4>organic life on planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like earth suddenly gets wife.</v>

1051
00:52:51.851 --> 00:52:55.240
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck knows my theory aliens?</v>

1052
00:52:55.241 --> 00:52:57.730
<v Speaker 4>But who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it just randomly happen.</v>

1053
00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so suddenly springing from the earth</v>

1054
00:53:00.701 --> 00:53:01.534
<v Speaker 4>or these very rudimentary organisms that</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the course of millennia gradually </v>

1055
00:53:07.091 --> 00:53:11.800
<v Speaker 4>stretched out and changed to become </v>
<v Speaker 4>various types of devices,</v>

1056
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.740
<v Speaker 4>to study the crevices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crannies,</v>

1057
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:15.743
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and an air of this planet until </v>

1058
00:53:17.261 --> 00:53:20.680
<v Speaker 4>eventually it became monkeys and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>monkeys became people.</v>

1059
00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.693
<v Speaker 4>And now we're like a very advanced scope</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is peering into the atomic and </v>

1060
00:53:26.281 --> 00:53:31.281
<v Speaker 4>subatomic level of the fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you look at a squirrel's life,</v>

1061
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 4>eagles life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1062
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1063
00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.373
<v Speaker 4>salmon being eaten by a bear's life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting to consider that what </v>

1064
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:39.384
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing is an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>scopes through which something that </v>

1065
00:53:43.951 --> 00:53:44.784
<v Speaker 4>appears to be either investigating this </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension or just enjoying being in it </v>

1066
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.840
<v Speaker 4>is coming through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1067
00:53:51.841 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 4>that seems to be what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is an idea that gets echoed in,</v>

1068
00:53:56.641 --> 00:53:57.474
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1069
00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like some eastern philosophies and,</v>

1070
00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:02.321
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1071
00:54:02.321 --> 00:54:03.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1072
00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.460
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting take on it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would,</v>

1073
00:54:05.461 --> 00:54:08.300
<v Speaker 3>what's definitely happening is there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>some consumption going on.</v>

1074
00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Everything's consuming something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:11.443
<v Speaker 3>That's what this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things about this radio lab </v>

1076
00:54:12.561 --> 00:54:13.394
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so fascinating where was talking </v>

1077
00:54:14.511 --> 00:54:19.511
<v Speaker 3>about these fun guide devouring </v>
<v Speaker 3>microscopic insects and um,</v>

1078
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.900
<v Speaker 3>also like literally tapping into rocks </v>
<v Speaker 3>for minerals.</v>

1079
00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.240
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really intense stuff.</v>

1080
00:54:26.241 --> 00:54:27.074
<v Speaker 3>And having this intense relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>with these plants where they're feeding </v>

1081
00:54:31.491 --> 00:54:35.030
<v Speaker 3>off the root system and the root systems</v>
<v Speaker 3>are feeding them and they're feeding the</v>

1082
00:54:35.031 --> 00:54:37.670
<v Speaker 3>root systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're exchanging sugar and uh,</v>

1083
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.080
<v Speaker 3>and minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:54:39.081 --> 00:54:40.430
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1085
00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:42.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

1086
00:54:42.081 --> 00:54:42.914
<v Speaker 3>really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about miles and miles </v>

1087
00:54:44.901 --> 00:54:45.734
<v Speaker 3>of these microscopic fung fungi in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>soil in a tiny piece of soil and miles </v>

1088
00:54:50.721 --> 00:54:51.470
<v Speaker 3>and miles.</v>

1089
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:52.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1090
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:52.561
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1091
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:53.750
<v Speaker 4>The mycelium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1092
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

1093
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 4>so when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1094
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.173
<v Speaker 4>so everything's eating itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you imagine that what you're </v>

1095
00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 4>looking at is actually only one half of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing,</v>

1096
00:55:04.951 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 4>because we can't see into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothingness that happens after death,</v>

1097
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:12.030
<v Speaker 4>then it could be that you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at one,</v>

1098
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:14.910
<v Speaker 4>just one part of a process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1099
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:15.744
<v Speaker 4>You're seeing just what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing a limited part of an </v>

1100
00:55:19.021 --> 00:55:23.700
<v Speaker 4>infinite process that's happening where </v>
<v Speaker 4>death is just one piece of it.</v>

1101
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that dies doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1102
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.100
<v Speaker 4>isn't annihilated it.</v>

1103
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:31.710
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1104
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:32.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>

1105
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.240
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't go.</v>

1106
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:34.740
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1107
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:39.120
<v Speaker 4>what you are is a thing growing out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1108
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:41.640
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're growing from that,</v>

1109
00:55:41.641 --> 00:55:46.530
<v Speaker 4>which is not into that which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or that which is not known to that.</v>

1110
00:55:46.531 --> 00:55:49.560
<v Speaker 4>Which is is nice because where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where were you before you died?</v>

1111
00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.370
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you,</v>

1112
00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.890
<v Speaker 4>you're born before you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1113
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.390
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>

1114
00:55:54.391 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 4>According to some religions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1115
00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Speaker 4>so when you look at that as part of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuum,</v>

1116
00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:00.024
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of just like you are born and </v>

1117
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:03.324
<v Speaker 4>then you die and then nothingness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it as part of energetic </v>

1118
00:56:06.121 --> 00:56:10.830
<v Speaker 4>continuum of which we can only witness </v>
<v Speaker 4>this particular part of the continuum,</v>

1119
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:15.480
<v Speaker 4>we don't have the technology yet to peer</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the other part of the continuum.</v>

1120
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:16.463
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at it as an actual cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the brutality of the universe </v>

1121
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 4>becomes a little less significant </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you realize like,</v>

1122
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.293
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like things diving out of the </v>

1123
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.910
<v Speaker 4>nothingness into somethingness are </v>
<v Speaker 4>returning to the nothingness.</v>

1124
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 4>Then the same way a dolphin jumps up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes back down into the sea.</v>

1125
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:38.740
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only when we dive into time,</v>

1126
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 4>we take on a form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we dive out of time,</v>

1127
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:45.460
<v Speaker 4>we become the formless and then we come </v>
<v Speaker 4>back out of time again.</v>

1128
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:48.550
<v Speaker 4>That's reincarnation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's reincarnation is,</v>

1129
00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:50.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry if I've said on this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

1130
00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:55.480
<v Speaker 4>but reincarnation is like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>dolphin trick only in this case,</v>

1131
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.613
<v Speaker 4>the trick that you're doing is called </v>
<v Speaker 4>your incarnation and the particular way </v>

1132
00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:03.790
<v Speaker 4>that you live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's as it is for most people,</v>

1133
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:04.624
<v Speaker 4>a kind of failure cause how the fuck are</v>
<v Speaker 4>you going to figure out what to do when </v>

1134
00:57:07.331 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 4>you dive into time for such a temporary </v>
<v Speaker 4>fleeting lifetime,</v>

1135
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 4>like to suddenly to be able to do back </v>
<v Speaker 4>flips and shit.</v>

1136
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:16.450
<v Speaker 4>It's maybe you're not gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that right away,</v>

1137
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:19.540
<v Speaker 4>but you dive out of time or out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothingness,</v>

1138
00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 4>come into somethingness incarnate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incarnate,</v>

1139
00:57:21.851 --> 00:57:22.684
<v Speaker 4>incarnate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here we are as a being have a life and </v>

1140
00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 4>then you go back into the nothingness </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1141
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:27.813
<v Speaker 4>And so the people that we are most </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazed by in history or just people who </v>

1142
00:57:32.141 --> 00:57:32.974
<v Speaker 4>did really awesome tricks where they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>temporary human current incarnation is </v>

1143
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:38.320
<v Speaker 4>they came jumping out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothingness.</v>

1144
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.090
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're in right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1145
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.133
<v Speaker 4>Just a temporary transitory state of </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmonized Adams that have become aware </v>

1146
00:57:46.931 --> 00:57:47.764
<v Speaker 4>of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are about to go through of </v>

1147
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.153
<v Speaker 4>incredible energetic shift where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>become nothing and then maybe become </v>

1148
00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:00.510
<v Speaker 4>something again for infinity.</v>

1149
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:01.953
<v Speaker 5>We have a real hard time having the </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective of your body turning into </v>

1150
00:58:06.431 --> 00:58:07.264
<v Speaker 5>bacteria or you couldn't back to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're consuming your body when you die </v>

1151
00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.753
<v Speaker 5>of that not being a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's a part of life and that you </v>

1152
00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:19.150
<v Speaker 5>will be conscious inside that bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then maybe your consciousness leaves</v>

1153
00:58:19.151 --> 00:58:19.984
<v Speaker 5>this and travels with you with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>cells and your DNA as you're being </v>

1154
00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:25.580
<v Speaker 5>consumed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1155
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:26.643
<v Speaker 5>And then it becomes a part of some </v>
<v Speaker 5>gigantic matrix and that's what maybe </v>

1156
00:58:28.871 --> 00:58:31.360
<v Speaker 5>that's what you're tapping into when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing things like dmt.</v>

1157
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:34.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you hit that well of consciousness,</v>

1158
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.510
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck that is that you hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>

1159
00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:40.110
<v Speaker 5>you run into that sea of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:45.210
<v Speaker 5>When I say reality like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just intense God,</v>

1161
00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:48.130
<v Speaker 5>like no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>

1162
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.320
<v Speaker 5>it knows everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no bullshit.</v>

1163
00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:51.590
<v Speaker 5>It's like you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1164
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.040
<v Speaker 5>you have to abandon all your worldly </v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts.</v>

1165
00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Abandon all your ideas of life and death</v>

1166
00:58:57.011 --> 00:59:00.970
<v Speaker 5>and ego and just give in and be one with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing.</v>

1167
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:04.390
<v Speaker 5>And maybe that's what we do all the time</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we're sleeping,</v>

1168
00:59:04.391 --> 00:59:05.224
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's entirely possible that what </v>

1169
00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:07.564
<v Speaker 5>we don't remember is existing in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>realm and that that realm is something </v>

1170
00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:11.614
<v Speaker 5>that were just shut off from because for</v>
<v Speaker 5>us to get done what we have to get done </v>

1171
00:59:14.591 --> 00:59:15.424
<v Speaker 5>with this monkey body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't be fucking contemplating that </v>

1172
00:59:17.021 --> 00:59:18.730
<v Speaker 5>all the time cause you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get shit done.</v>

1173
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.401
<v Speaker 5>You're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get,</v>

1174
00:59:19.401 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be philosophical,</v>

1175
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.263
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be too confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be so blown away by the </v>

1176
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:29.750
<v Speaker 3>images of that other world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't handle it.</v>

1177
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:30.584
<v Speaker 3>So you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality of life just completely </v>

1178
00:59:33.951 --> 00:59:34.784
<v Speaker 3>takes over.</v>

1179
00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:36.010
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't,</v>

1180
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:39.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you meant to do it,</v>

1181
00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.233
<v Speaker 4>but you are take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you waited when you said that the </v>

1182
00:59:42.401 --> 00:59:46.210
<v Speaker 4>essence of so many different religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems,</v>

1183
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.073
<v Speaker 4>which is that here is this Omni present,</v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite ever replenishing creative </v>

1184
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:58.470
<v Speaker 4>matrix of intelligence that is so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger than I am.</v>

1185
00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:03.310
<v Speaker 4>It's incomprehensible and an end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

1186
01:00:03.311 --> 01:00:05.530
<v Speaker 4>you have to let go of all your worldly </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>

1187
01:00:05.531 --> 01:00:07.060
<v Speaker 4>your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ego.</v>

1188
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:11.290
<v Speaker 4>You have to let your ego die because </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you going to do in the</v>

1189
01:00:11.291 --> 01:00:12.124
<v Speaker 4>face of that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to hold on to the stuff </v>

1190
01:00:15.131 --> 01:00:17.290
<v Speaker 4>you're proud of?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to hold onto the,</v>

1191
01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.410
<v Speaker 4>the victories that you've achieved in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind,</v>

1192
01:00:20.411 --> 01:00:21.244
<v Speaker 4>newt flickering human incarnation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're in the presence of the </v>

1193
01:00:24.671 --> 01:00:28.780
<v Speaker 4>source of victory in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do there?</v>

1194
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:33.130
<v Speaker 4>What's the correct reaction to have if a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing like that?</v>

1195
01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.173
<v Speaker 4>We're real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so depending on what religious </v>

1196
01:00:36.791 --> 01:00:37.624
<v Speaker 4>system you subscribe to those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of those are answers to that </v>

1197
01:00:40.931 --> 01:00:42.220
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Infinity.</v>

<v Speaker 3>my 47 years on planet earth as a tire </v>

<v Speaker 3>salesman who finally does dmt for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time.</v>

1214
01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's start with roses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the color of them,</v>

1215
01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:31.420
<v Speaker 3>but maybe we make it a brighter red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

1216
01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:33.940
<v Speaker 3>How about make it so dear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't want to eat them.</v>

1217
01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:36.400
<v Speaker 3>My mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has a fucking garden.</v>

1218
01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:39.580
<v Speaker 3>She's always mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The deer is eating them roses.</v>

1219
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1220
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.260
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1221
01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.913
<v Speaker 3>so this is,</v>

1222
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why I really love this.</v>

1223
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.093
<v Speaker 4>Bhakti Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a cause it like takes that </v>

1224
01:01:50.381 --> 01:01:51.214
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a super intelligent creative </v>

1225
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.133
<v Speaker 4>force in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the word for it is Bhagavan and it </v>

1226
01:01:59.231 --> 01:02:03.130
<v Speaker 4>basically means maximum everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So ultimate beauty,</v>

1227
01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.430
<v Speaker 4>ultimate intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate attractiveness.</v>

1228
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.140
<v Speaker 4>Ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate love.</v>

1229
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.910
<v Speaker 4>It's the ultimate of ultimate's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1230
01:02:12.911 --> 01:02:16.240
<v Speaker 4>So this thing has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1231
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:18.090
<v Speaker 4>inadvertently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1232
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 4>it depends on what version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not inadvertently,</v>

1233
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 4>but this thing has a kr,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1234
01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.133
<v Speaker 4>it's so potent that the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>interacting with time is that it's </v>

1235
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.173
<v Speaker 4>breaking into an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pieces that have all become semi or </v>

1236
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:35.874
<v Speaker 4>super aware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's consciousness is dispersed </v>

1237
01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 4>itself through its creation and every </v>
<v Speaker 4>single minute element,</v>

1238
01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:44.094
<v Speaker 4>like some fractal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single little piece of it is a </v>

1239
01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 4>possessor of this infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

1240
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:55.221
<v Speaker 4>And so that infinite consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the source of love.</v>

1241
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's basically,</v>

1242
01:02:58.860 --> 01:02:59.693
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's you fall in love with it if you </v>

1243
01:03:01.351 --> 01:03:04.440
<v Speaker 4>want to and it loves you too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the,</v>

1244
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:06.000
<v Speaker 4>what's really trippy to imagine.</v>

1245
01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.830
<v Speaker 4>This is a thought experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1246
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:12.570
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that thing you just described,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that infinite fucking thing,</v>

1247
01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:17.571
<v Speaker 4>the no bullshit thing that demands that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you drop your history like a fucking old</v>

1248
01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:18.894
<v Speaker 4>nasty bag of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if that thing also was aware of </v>

1249
01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:29.421
<v Speaker 4>you completely and also loved you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that shit man.</v>

1250
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:35.990
<v Speaker 4>That's the craziest idea ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy fucking idea.</v>

1251
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.253
<v Speaker 4>That's better than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you like kind of like a girl </v>

1252
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.613
<v Speaker 4>and you start thinking like maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do this because you're a fucking </v>

1253
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:46.470
<v Speaker 4>muscular super billionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the host the UFC.</v>

1254
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.520
<v Speaker 4>But somebody like me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

1255
01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 4>if a girl starts liking you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start thinking like,</v>

1256
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:56.630
<v Speaker 4>holy shit does this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this girl likes me.</v>

1257
01:03:57.030 --> 01:04:00.150
<v Speaker 4>I think this beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly beautiful girl likes me.</v>

1258
01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 4>Could this be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the beginning of all love songs,</v>

1259
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the beginning of,</v>

1260
01:04:04.321 --> 01:04:07.410
<v Speaker 4>of like all human happiness is holy </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1261
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.400
<v Speaker 4>The girl I like likes me back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she likes me.</v>

1262
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she's falling in love with me.</v>

1263
01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:14.694
<v Speaker 4>This incredibly beautiful girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Bhakti Yoga is that exact concept </v>

1264
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:22.320
<v Speaker 4>transferred to the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you're like,</v>

1265
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This entire,</v>

1266
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.153
<v Speaker 4>the source of all things in the universe</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a personality and it seems to love </v>

1267
01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:35.220
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not No fucking tame way.</v>

1268
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:36.263
<v Speaker 4>Not In like the way that you might hear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Jesus loves you and then you </v>

1269
01:04:40.231 --> 01:04:41.064
<v Speaker 4>imagine it being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means you could go over to his </v>

1270
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:45.780
<v Speaker 4>house and sit down and have like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>boring cup of tea and leave,</v>

1271
01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

1272
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.390
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of love.</v>

1273
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.060
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a fucking wild,</v>

1274
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.570
<v Speaker 4>savage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unpredictable.</v>

1275
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:55.643
<v Speaker 4>Love the way your best friend loves you </v>
<v Speaker 4>or the way that like a comedian loves </v>

1276
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:00.661
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

1277
01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:02.250
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what the fuck's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

1278
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:05.160
<v Speaker 4>It's not the way the comedian loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1279
01:05:05.161 --> 01:05:05.994
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like comedians are going to do weird </v>

1280
01:05:06.871 --> 01:05:08.430
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're friends with Comedians,</v>

1281
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.600
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get a lot of like weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking pictures sent to you.</v>

1282
01:05:12.601 --> 01:05:14.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a regular basis.</v>

1283
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.713
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get people calling you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and playing tricks on you from time to </v>

1284
01:05:18.311 --> 01:05:21.100
<v Speaker 4>time for no other reason than just to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1285
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.750
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they love you.</v>

1286
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 4>They fucking love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's behind it.</v>

1287
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.910
<v Speaker 4>So in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the concept,</v>

1288
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 4>it's not a team kind of love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll kill you,</v>

1289
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:34.990
<v Speaker 4>like it'll eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still loves you.</v>

1290
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:36.003
<v Speaker 4>And it'll eat you because it knows that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just a fucking pair of virtual </v>

1291
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:41.530
<v Speaker 4>reality goggles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just a temporary flickering thing</v>

1292
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 4>that's going to keep going on forever.</v>

1293
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:44.783
<v Speaker 5>This ego in the survival mechanism is </v>
<v Speaker 5>what makes us think that it's more </v>

1294
01:05:50.151 --> 01:05:53.240
<v Speaker 5>important to root for our team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we have teams,</v>

1295
01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:55.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So first of all were teen prime mate.</v>

1296
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:56.640
<v Speaker 5>Don't eat any primates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

1297
01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.910
<v Speaker 5>Once you get past team primary were teen</v>
<v Speaker 5>mammal.</v>

1298
01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:00.043
<v Speaker 5>So if you have a choice between killing </v>
<v Speaker 5>a gigantic fish or killing a gigantic </v>

1299
01:06:02.871 --> 01:06:06.860
<v Speaker 5>mammal that you thought was a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to kill the fish so you can kill</v>

1300
01:06:06.861 --> 01:06:09.620
<v Speaker 5>fucking blue Marlin's all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bring those bitches in,</v>

1301
01:06:09.621 --> 01:06:13.520
<v Speaker 5>chop up and the stakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But don't make oil for lamps.</v>

1302
01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.700
<v Speaker 5>I love Moby Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucked up.</v>

1303
01:06:15.701 --> 01:06:18.230
<v Speaker 5>Fucking oil out of the suite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bad guy.</v>

1304
01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.700
<v Speaker 5>You're the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I agree.</v>

1305
01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason,</v>

1306
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.630
<v Speaker 5>especially with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with whales,</v>

1307
01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:24.863
<v Speaker 5>I have a thing for whales,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a thing for whales and orcas and </v>

1308
01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:30.020
<v Speaker 5>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated by them,</v>

1309
01:06:30.021 --> 01:06:32.720
<v Speaker 5>like legitimately perplexed.</v>

1310
01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.720
<v Speaker 5>I think that it's entirely possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but both by,</v>

1311
01:06:35.721 --> 01:06:39.830
<v Speaker 5>both with both dolphins and orchids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're just as smart as us.</v>

1312
01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.110
<v Speaker 5>They just don't express it the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a,</v>

1313
01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.330
<v Speaker 5>they have a different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different kinds of existence.</v>

1314
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:45.343
<v Speaker 5>They don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to dominate other than </v>

1315
01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.210
<v Speaker 5>controlling food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just want to have food.</v>

1316
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 5>And once they have food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1317
01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>

1318
01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.013
<v Speaker 5>I just think when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you listen to a scientist talk </v>

1319
01:06:55.921 --> 01:07:00.921
<v Speaker 5>about their dialects and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the pod stays together for life and that</v>

1320
01:07:00.951 --> 01:07:01.311
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1321
01:07:01.311 --> 01:07:02.144
<v Speaker 5>they form these tight bonds and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate over great distances with </v>

1322
01:07:04.881 --> 01:07:05.714
<v Speaker 5>sound frequencies and these complex </v>
<v Speaker 5>languages that they recognize are </v>

1323
01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:09.224
<v Speaker 5>different in different areas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they recognize they're similar </v>

1324
01:07:11.121 --> 01:07:12.800
<v Speaker 5>sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a dialect to it.</v>

1325
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:14.960
<v Speaker 5>They still don't know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're saying.</v>

1326
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:17.750
<v Speaker 5>And part of the reason why we don't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>know what they're saying,</v>

1327
01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:21.320
<v Speaker 5>it's just like how we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 5>emojis being like a form of hieroglyphs.</v>

1328
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:25.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we can understand the </v>
<v Speaker 5>context of communication.</v>

1329
01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:29.090
<v Speaker 5>When you live in the fucking ocean and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you kill fish with your face all day.</v>

1330
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:32.780
<v Speaker 5>I think what we would think of is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where is your house?</v>

1331
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:36.260
<v Speaker 5>Do you guys have cable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you guys find out about,</v>

1332
01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the movies are playing,</v>

1333
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:41.150
<v Speaker 5>know that this idea of communication to </v>
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>

1334
01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.700
<v Speaker 5>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they're trying to do is locate each</v>

1335
01:07:43.701 --> 01:07:45.500
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let each other know their moods,</v>

1336
01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:47.780
<v Speaker 5>let each other know their whole right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let each other know.</v>

1337
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 5>But we think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1338
01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.413
<v Speaker 5>that's rudimentary in comparison to our </v>
<v Speaker 5>complex system of sounds and very </v>

1339
01:07:55.311 --> 01:07:58.820
<v Speaker 5>repeatable sounds that we can all </v>
<v Speaker 5>express back and forth to each other.</v>

1340
01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:02.570
<v Speaker 5>But we just like emojis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what they're doing,</v>

1341
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:06.230
<v Speaker 5>dressing themselves in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>

1342
01:08:06.231 --> 01:08:07.940
<v Speaker 5>in a way that they all understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1343
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:09.263
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And don't forget they have an awareness </v>

1344
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:14.580
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of part of the larger part of the earth.</v>

1345
01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what the fuck is down </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1346
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the,</v>

1347
01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.780
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1348
01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:19.973
<v Speaker 4>moby Dick right after the spoiler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kill the fucking whale moby Dick </v>

1349
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 4>back right after the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the description,</v>

1350
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.940
<v Speaker 4>the description of the way they kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking thing.</v>

1351
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:30.890
<v Speaker 4>The way they did it back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is you know,</v>

1352
01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 4>you getting a ship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you roll up to the thing,</v>

1353
01:08:32.931 --> 01:08:35.630
<v Speaker 4>there's a harpoon year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a fucking Harpoon,</v>

1354
01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:39.740
<v Speaker 4>he's got to sing it at the thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you've got a tire it out.</v>

1355
01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 4>Real it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is a fucking whale,</v>

1356
01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a Leviathan,</v>

1357
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:44.834
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just a little fucking human in a </v>

1358
01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:49.610
<v Speaker 4>fucking boat and you're like nailing </v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing with a harpoon.</v>

1359
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.890
<v Speaker 4>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it gets tired enough,</v>

1360
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:54.140
<v Speaker 4>you have to find its heart.</v>

1361
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh my jam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Harpoon into its heart.</v>

1362
01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 4>And then basically like fuck the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a Harpoon,</v>

1363
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:04.100
<v Speaker 4>just jab it in and out of that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>hole until finally,</v>

1364
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.960
<v Speaker 4>this is description makes you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cry.</v>

1365
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:06.794
<v Speaker 4>It's so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finally like the whale out of its blow </v>

1366
01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 4>hole at like shrieks like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like car breaks or something.</v>

1367
01:09:13.611 --> 01:09:14.444
<v Speaker 4>Like it's screaming in pain and then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>just blows chunks of guts and lung and </v>

1368
01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:23.150
<v Speaker 4>heart out of its own glow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it fucking dies.</v>

1369
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.750
<v Speaker 4>Then you got to get it back to the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tie it to this side of the ship.</v>

1370
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:30.050
<v Speaker 4>Sharks start feasting on the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1371
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:33.230
<v Speaker 4>So you have like sharks and your God </v>
<v Speaker 4>damn whale.</v>

1372
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.333
<v Speaker 4>It's somebody's job to get lower down </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a Harpoon and kill the fucking </v>

1373
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:40.610
<v Speaker 4>sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Melville Describes Melville,</v>

1374
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:43.250
<v Speaker 4>describes killing sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1375
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.233
<v Speaker 4>you will stat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you watched the hard paneer stab the </v>

1376
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:46.670
<v Speaker 4>shark.</v>

1377
01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:50.030
<v Speaker 4>The shark will start eating its own inch</v>
<v Speaker 4>rails cause it'll,</v>

1378
01:09:50.031 --> 01:09:50.864
<v Speaker 4>it'll just start eating itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then just like tying itself up into </v>

1379
01:09:54.081 --> 01:09:56.540
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as it eats itself in a frenzy.</v>

1380
01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.560
<v Speaker 4>That's our Melville describes it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those poor fucking whales man.</v>

1381
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.180
<v Speaker 4>But after the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1382
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:03.600
<v Speaker 4>they kill a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ahab,</v>

1383
01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Captain Ahab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poor sad,</v>

1384
01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:05.774
<v Speaker 4>Captain Ahab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He comes out and he like does a funeral </v>

1385
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:12.500
<v Speaker 4>for the whales head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he like says like,</v>

1386
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:13.603
<v Speaker 4>what have you seen down there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What have you seen the graves of </v>

1387
01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.273
<v Speaker 4>millions of sailors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wrecked ships that no one will ever </v>

1388
01:10:23.661 --> 01:10:26.240
<v Speaker 4>know or there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what a whale see.</v>

1389
01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:29.210
<v Speaker 4>So they just have this awareness that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like.</v>

1390
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.220
<v Speaker 4>We'll never know what the fuck's down </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1391
01:10:31.221 --> 01:10:33.290
<v Speaker 4>We hardly can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:34.124
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the earth is three quarters </v>

1393
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:37.640
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1394
01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

1395
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.680
<v Speaker 4>what's the low?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1396
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.060
<v Speaker 4>What's below the water is a two thirds </v>
<v Speaker 4>or three guide on.</v>

1397
01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five and measured lately.</v>

1398
01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:47.330
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot,</v>

1399
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:48.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a giant chunk of the earth.</v>

1400
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.821
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All water.</v>

1401
01:10:49.821 --> 01:10:54.740
<v Speaker 4>That's why it blew the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the underneath stuff we so rarely see.</v>

1402
01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:55.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do we see it?</v>

1403
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Is that we do we see at 1% of what we </v>
<v Speaker 4>see above ground?</v>

1404
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.870
<v Speaker 4>The um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

1405
01:11:00.871 --> 01:11:03.170
<v Speaker 4>I hate to always talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a brief history,</v>

1406
01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:05.060
<v Speaker 4>nearly everything he describes it as </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1407
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:06.650
<v Speaker 4>and this could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1408
01:11:06.651 --> 01:11:07.484
<v Speaker 4>but what we know about the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine if someone took like six </v>

1409
01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:15.041
<v Speaker 4>tractors and drop them in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Middle America and they drove around for</v>

1410
01:11:15.991 --> 01:11:19.460
<v Speaker 4>a few nights with their lights on at </v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

1411
01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.710
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some description like that.</v>

1412
01:11:23.711 --> 01:11:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's like it's,</v>

1413
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:26.003
<v Speaker 4>it's that limited because getting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing underneath all that </v>

1414
01:11:28.211 --> 01:11:30.520
<v Speaker 4>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to break down.</v>

1415
01:11:30.521 --> 01:11:33.100
<v Speaker 4>Getting out there in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1416
01:11:33.101 --> 01:11:35.710
<v Speaker 4>to get the thing down that can survive </v>
<v Speaker 4>that pressure.</v>

1417
01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.940
<v Speaker 4>Forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pasta takes a</v>

1418
01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:41.630
<v Speaker 5>special kind of crazy person that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to get in a submarine.</v>

1419
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1420
01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:45.523
<v Speaker 5>I think I'd rather go to space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'd rather go to space and be </v>

1421
01:11:47.961 --> 01:11:52.700
<v Speaker 5>stuck at the bottom of the fucking Osha </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then see a drop of water on the side</v>

1422
01:11:52.701 --> 01:11:54.020
<v Speaker 5>of the wall going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that?</v>

1423
01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.300
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>

1424
01:11:56.301 --> 01:11:56.870
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1425
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:58.450
<v Speaker 5>What is that noise?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear that noise here?</v>

1426
01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twinkie.</v>

1427
01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.850
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like a fucking beer.</v>

1428
01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Can I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those?</v>

1429
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.130
<v Speaker 5>You ever see a stripper crush a beer can</v>
<v Speaker 5>with their tin.</v>

1430
01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.570
<v Speaker 5>They hold a beer can up and they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of them whopper tits,</v>

1431
01:12:08.571 --> 01:12:09.404
<v Speaker 5>like those double f jammies and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>hold it by the base because those tits </v>

1432
01:12:12.591 --> 01:12:13.820
<v Speaker 5>are always like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1433
01:12:13.821 --> 01:12:14.930
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're sort of like a,</v>

1434
01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.540
<v Speaker 5>like a ball on the end of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an old rope.</v>

1435
01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.051
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1436
01:12:18.051 --> 01:12:22.700
<v Speaker 5>cause you have the big round ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 5>sized implants and they hold the beer.</v>

1437
01:12:22.701 --> 01:12:25.730
<v Speaker 5>Can they just molly whopped up beer can </v>
<v Speaker 5>and crush it.</v>

1438
01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.553
<v Speaker 5>That's how I would feel if I heard a </v>
<v Speaker 5>clink clink clink that I knew that </v>

1439
01:12:30.951 --> 01:12:35.090
<v Speaker 5>eventually the thousands of pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure was just going to smush that,</v>

1440
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:37.940
<v Speaker 5>that tank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

1441
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.340
<v Speaker 5>that's a fucked up way to diamond here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>

1442
01:12:40.341 --> 01:12:40.821
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1443
01:12:40.821 --> 01:12:41.654
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look behind you.</v>

1444
01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.240
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

1445
01:12:44.241 --> 01:12:47.330
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do this boom boom,</v>

1446
01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.970
<v Speaker 5>which is crushing them with her tits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That has to hurt.</v>

1447
01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:54.720
<v Speaker 5>We'll get Steve Harvey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

1448
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.360
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1449
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:58.670
<v Speaker 5>Now you know it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I know.</v>

1450
01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:01.430
<v Speaker 5>So that's what I think of when I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about submarines.</v>

1451
01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:02.450
<v Speaker 5>You think when she did that?</v>

1452
01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1453
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:11.940
<v Speaker 4>You think she did that the first time </v>
<v Speaker 4>she did that?</v>

1454
01:13:11.941 --> 01:13:12.774
<v Speaker 4>She was angry?</v>

1455
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.760
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was on meth the first time for sure.</v>

1456
01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.930
<v Speaker 5>Is that what she said?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1457
01:13:17.931 --> 01:13:20.120
<v Speaker 5>that's what I would guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of girls have done that.</v>

1458
01:13:20.121 --> 01:13:22.580
<v Speaker 5>That's a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like the when you not,</v>

1459
01:13:22.581 --> 01:13:25.760
<v Speaker 5>but she keeps sucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's that mixed boobs.</v>

1460
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:26.803
<v Speaker 5>Crushing beards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First girl to crush a beer can with her </v>

1461
01:13:30.711 --> 01:13:32.150
<v Speaker 5>boob was on match.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1462
01:13:32.151 --> 01:13:33.980
<v Speaker 5>she's probably a real girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1463
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.210
<v Speaker 5>like she had real boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1464
01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:36.950
<v Speaker 5>not just a real girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.650
<v Speaker 5>You're all real girls by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everybody's a real girl.</v>

1466
01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:40.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to be a real girl,</v>

1467
01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.020
<v Speaker 5>you're a real girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1468
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:43.183
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like how many guys are broken beer </v>

1469
01:13:45.081 --> 01:13:46.790
<v Speaker 5>cans with their dick?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about zero?</v>

1470
01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.970
<v Speaker 5>Tits are way more powerful and Dick in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that regard,</v>

1471
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:55.310
<v Speaker 5>and what guys ever like held a beer can </v>
<v Speaker 5>down and smashed it with his hog oak has</v>

1472
01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:59.960
<v Speaker 5>a greater man than anybody in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus,</v>

1473
01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:04.340
<v Speaker 5>especially if he does it right side up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he gets the lip of the,</v>

1474
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:05.383
<v Speaker 5>the beer can the thin park slams against</v>
<v Speaker 5>his dick with the kind of force that's </v>

1475
01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 5>required to bend a beer can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to</v>

1476
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.330
<v Speaker 2>crush your deck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to hurt your Dick.</v>

1477
01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I gotta disagree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1478
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.183
<v Speaker 2>I think he becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he becomes the hero if he's </v>

1479
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:20.404
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's tied up and he's got to use his </v>

1480
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.470
<v Speaker 2>dick and the beer can as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>escape device,</v>

1481
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 2>like at that point it becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroic than just,</v>

1482
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:31.961
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1483
01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:35.530
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you smash a beer can with your cock,</v>

1484
01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:40.030
<v Speaker 2>then you join some invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more elite than the Illuminati.</v>

1485
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's smaller than the seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>families that control everything.</v>

1486
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.823
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's like a 14 inch club</v>
<v Speaker 2>was all dudes were 14 to talks just </v>

1487
01:14:48.881 --> 01:14:49.714
<v Speaker 2>hanging out.</v>

1488
01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:52.413
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be more than one dude on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet that has more than a foot </v>

1489
01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:56.200
<v Speaker 2>long duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1490
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.000
<v Speaker 2>If there's girls that have kids like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1491
01:14:58.001 --> 01:15:00.250
<v Speaker 2>and obviously those are fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are weird,</v>

1492
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:01.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are built strange.</v>

1493
01:15:01.361 --> 01:15:04.210
<v Speaker 2>There's guys that are seven feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are five foot one.</v>

1494
01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.473
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole bunch of people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between and someone out there as a 14 </v>

1495
01:15:08.411 --> 01:15:11.050

<v Speaker 2>Three and they're all assholes.</v>

1497
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:24.510
<v Speaker 2>But well there was that one guy who kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting caught at the TSA because he has</v>

<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

1500
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I keep saying hog cause it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1501
01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Why is you calling her a log?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you 12?</v>

1502
01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1503
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:36.850
<v Speaker 2>he's got a like a fucking sock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a rolled up sock.</v>

1504
01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:37.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what is his hog is we know the </v>

1505
01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:40.680
<v Speaker 2>story or we've probably talked about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the park,</v>

1506
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:42.400
<v Speaker 2>you know the story of John Malcovich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1507
01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Being John Malkovich comp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Malcovich the actor.</v>

1508
01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.353
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1509
01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:47.283
<v Speaker 2>So that supposedly they had to get him a</v>
<v Speaker 2>body double and a nude scene in a movie </v>

1510
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:51.783
<v Speaker 2>because his cock is so gigantic that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought nobody would believe that </v>

1511
01:15:55.091 --> 01:15:55.924
<v Speaker 2>was a human's Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had to get a body devil with a </v>

1512
01:15:58.391 --> 01:16:00.840
<v Speaker 2>smaller cock to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1513
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.713
<v Speaker 2>have him stand in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because his penis is so large that it </v>

1514
01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:06.124
<v Speaker 2>would disrupt the flow of the narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the guy who's telling you this suck </v>

1515
01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:10.564
<v Speaker 2>your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd said it while he was sucking my </v>

1516
01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:17.311
<v Speaker 2>Dick and the WHO I believe our biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangers,</v>

1517
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:21.640
<v Speaker 2>his dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a survey they're looking at.</v>

1518
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels lucky enough phonies.</v>

1519
01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.040
<v Speaker 2>They look up as if that's confirmed </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

1520
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.903
<v Speaker 2>I think it's confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling that's what's called a </v>

1521
01:16:30.521 --> 01:16:31.354
<v Speaker 2>rumor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling John Malcovich has a </v>

1522
01:16:32.501 --> 01:16:34.110
<v Speaker 2>great publicist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.270
<v Speaker 2>He's like this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>

1524
01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:38.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

1525
01:16:38.131 --> 01:16:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I could imagine he would have a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>hug.</v>

1526
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:40.983
<v Speaker 2>James Woods supposedly has a giant hug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the word he's telling him about </v>

1527
01:16:44.381 --> 01:16:45.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talked about it pretty openly.</v>

1528
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Trump trump has a giant one did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1529
01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.173
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says it's fine in comparison to his </v>

1530
01:16:51.131 --> 01:16:52.960
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the fact that the guy's running</v>

1531
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:56.170
<v Speaker 2>for president and he was joking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>about his dick not being tiny.</v>

1532
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:58.840
<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1533
01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's going to make the </v>

1534
01:17:00.761 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 2>best leader of the free world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1536

<v Speaker 2>a dick joke while they're running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1562
01:17:58.551 --> 01:18:00.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what Ray Kerr,</v>

1563
01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 4>this is a quote from Ray Kurzweil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is things aren't getting worse.</v>

1564
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:06.350
<v Speaker 4>Our information's getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1565
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:11.620
<v Speaker 4>And so with Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is a career politician,</v>

1566
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:14.623
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1567
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.080
<v Speaker 4>And we've all known since we were young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people,</v>

1568
01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:20.120
<v Speaker 4>I think when they think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians,</v>

1569
01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 4>they don't think those are some honest </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1570
01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:24.590
<v Speaker 4>Those politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they usually,</v>

1571
01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:28.310
<v Speaker 4>you're telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think most of his think politicians,</v>

1572
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:30.440
<v Speaker 4>they lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they warp things,</v>

1573
01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:31.274
<v Speaker 4>they fabricate things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use a form of deception to gain </v>

1574
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 4>control of various power structures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the animal does.</v>

1575
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:39.763
<v Speaker 4>So that's not new information when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>find out that Hillary Clinton and the </v>

1576
01:18:44.061 --> 01:18:44.894
<v Speaker 4>DNC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know if they completely </v>

1577
01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 4>connected those two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you find out that they,</v>

1578
01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:51.050
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were not,</v>

1579
01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.253
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't do what they're supposed to </v>

1580
01:18:52.671 --> 01:18:53.504
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They helped Hillary Clinton become the </v>

1581
01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Democratic nominee and they actively </v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to fuck up Bernie Sanders.</v>

1582
01:18:59.961 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's creepy.</v>

1583
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.630

<v Speaker 2>It's not a new thing.</v>

1585
01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is creepy.</v>

1586
01:19:04.711 --> 01:19:07.260
<v Speaker 2>It's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's even more creepy that the woman</v>

1587
01:19:07.261 --> 01:19:08.094
<v Speaker 2>who was in charge resigns and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately gets hired a great shot and </v>

1588
01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.440
<v Speaker 2>got a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hire you and it won't do </v>

1590

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:23.060
<v Speaker 2>She's so fucking unafraid of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen that she hires the woman</v>

1592

<v Speaker 2>It's gangster too though.</v>

1597
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.823

<v Speaker 2>I mean she's looking at like what trump </v>

1598

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a gangster move to hire a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1600
01:19:51.331 --> 01:19:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Like right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>accomplished the DNC.</v>

1602
01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.550

<v Speaker 2>What did they do?</v>

1606

<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1607
01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:11.670
<v Speaker 4>they apparently came up with a way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>disseminate information to the press,</v>

1608
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:15.900
<v Speaker 4>highlighting certain aspects of Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sanders that would be unappealing to the</v>

1609
01:20:15.901 --> 01:20:16.734
<v Speaker 4>voter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they did</v>

1610
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:18.420
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this has all been confirmed.</v>

1611
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.321
<v Speaker 5>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you,</v>

1612
01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Google that?</v>

1613
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:21.203
<v Speaker 5>Find out what they actually said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's find out what the actually </v>

1614
01:20:22.741 --> 01:20:23.574
<v Speaker 5>summarize the Wiki leave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We think they're being a bunch of whiny </v>

1615
01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:27.960
<v Speaker 5>bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for sure they wanted him look,</v>

1616
01:20:27.961 --> 01:20:28.794
<v Speaker 5>she's got way deeper arms in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's way more connected than he is for </v>

1617
01:20:32.551 --> 01:20:33.210
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1618
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.043
<v Speaker 5>and this is what we're seeing too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's like a big part of being a </v>

1619
01:20:35.671 --> 01:20:38.190
<v Speaker 5>political candidate is how many favors </v>
<v Speaker 5>do you have?</v>

1620
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.140
<v Speaker 5>How many people you are you connected </v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1621
01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.120
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how deep does your influence go?</v>

1622
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.433
<v Speaker 5>And obviously her influence didn't just </v>
<v Speaker 5>sit within her are her own little group </v>

1623
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:50.640
<v Speaker 5>of people that were working for it had </v>
<v Speaker 5>gotten to the DNC itself.</v>

1624
01:20:50.641 --> 01:20:51.474
<v Speaker 5>So she's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's deeply embedded in this whole </v>

1625
01:20:53.161 --> 01:20:53.994
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's because of friendships or </v>

1626
01:20:55.021 --> 01:20:58.590
<v Speaker 5>ideologies or people just wanted her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's the chosen one.</v>

1627
01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever deals were made or whoever,</v>

1628
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.123
<v Speaker 5>who knows who knows what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you find out that an </v>

1629
01:21:03.931 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 5>organization that's supposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>

1630
01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:07.260
<v Speaker 5>it's supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we,</v>

1631
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:08.183
<v Speaker 5>if everything was on the up and up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's supposed to be objective and </v>

1632
01:21:11.011 --> 01:21:13.410
<v Speaker 5>looking for what the people want or as </v>
<v Speaker 5>the best party.</v>

1633
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.390
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're actually actively steering,</v>

1634
01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.673
<v Speaker 5>which is massively corrupt and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>scary because if these people are </v>

1635
01:21:19.771 --> 01:21:20.604
<v Speaker 5>deciding to steer an entire party yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is 50% of a political process </v>

1636
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.190
<v Speaker 5>because there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1637
01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:27.203
<v Speaker 5>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got libertarian party for the </v>

1638
01:21:27.961 --> 01:21:29.460
<v Speaker 5>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are taking Gary Johnson.</v>

1639
01:21:29.461 --> 01:21:30.510
<v Speaker 5>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to do that.</v>

1640
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:31.403
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1641
01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:34.470
<v Speaker 5>a town hall debate on Wednesday or town </v>
<v Speaker 5>hall,</v>

1642
01:21:34.471 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 5>one of those town hall things on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Wednesday on CNN,</v>

1643
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:40.710
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part it's Democrats or </v>
<v Speaker 5>Republicans in most people's eyes.</v>

1644
01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.970
<v Speaker 5>So what they're essentially doing is </v>
<v Speaker 5>rigging half of that process.</v>

1645
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.160
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's carrie that we just,</v>

1646
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:48.870
<v Speaker 5>we don't think anything's wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1647
01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:49.704
<v Speaker 5>but we put Martha Stewart in jail for </v>
<v Speaker 5>not telling exactly the truth about </v>

1648
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:55.480
<v Speaker 5>where she bought and sold stocks or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck</v>

1649
01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:58.650
<v Speaker 4>we eat about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do think something's wrong about it,</v>

1650
01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.550
<v Speaker 4>but we can't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do think something's wrong,</v>

1651
01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:04.290
<v Speaker 4>but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1652
01:22:04.291 --> 01:22:05.124
<v Speaker 4>so if like that institution is corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if the Republican institution is in </v>

1653
01:22:09.631 --> 01:22:13.500
<v Speaker 4>some ways corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it might be safe to say,</v>

1654
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:14.963
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think too many people would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be outraged at the idea that there is a </v>

1655
01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:19.793
<v Speaker 4>institutionalized corruption in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire American political system and </v>

1656
01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:27.870
<v Speaker 4>it's very similar to the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens in bike racing.</v>

1657
01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:28.973
<v Speaker 4>If one mother fucker regs their bike or </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets on fucking doping stuff that can't </v>

1658
01:22:33.571 --> 01:22:36.540
<v Speaker 4>be detected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to have a fair advantage,</v>

1659
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.660
<v Speaker 4>you've got a regular bike and start </v>
<v Speaker 4>doping to,</v>

1660
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.390
<v Speaker 4>or the person who rides their bike will </v>
<v Speaker 4>always win.</v>

1661
01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:46.860
<v Speaker 4>So if politics is a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which it clearly is,</v>

1662
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:47.873
<v Speaker 4>and if members of the competition are </v>
<v Speaker 4>using nefarious means to achieve their </v>

1663
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:53.970
<v Speaker 4>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they clearly are,</v>

1664
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.360
<v Speaker 4>which they clearly are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that would imply that if you wanted</v>

1665
01:22:57.361 --> 01:22:58.194
<v Speaker 4>to survive in that system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would also have to use nefarious </v>

1666
01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:03.430
<v Speaker 4>means dom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dom,</v>

1667
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.460
<v Speaker 4>and this is not new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is old,</v>

1668
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.020
<v Speaker 4>old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old shit.</v>

1669
01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:11.854
<v Speaker 4>What's new is technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's new is now people like Julian </v>

1670
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 4>assange are shining a light on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>corruption and his whole ideas.</v>

1671
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:22.833
<v Speaker 4>If I reveal this information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will force reform via the outrage of </v>

1672
01:23:28.151 --> 01:23:28.984
<v Speaker 4>the people who are supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>represented by a person who's breaking </v>

1673
01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:34.150
<v Speaker 4>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his idea.</v>

1674
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.133
<v Speaker 4>We need reform.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And right now we're at the point where </v>

1675
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:38.554
<v Speaker 4>it's very similar to when you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>family and this is one of the worst </v>

1676
01:23:41.171 --> 01:23:42.610
<v Speaker 4>things can fucking happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1677
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:43.803
<v Speaker 4>In a family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there is somebody who's molesting </v>

1678
01:23:46.361 --> 01:23:48.320
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happens all the time where,</v>

1679
01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a father or a brother,</v>

1680
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:53.980
<v Speaker 4>we'll start fucking molesting somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1681
01:23:54.190 --> 01:23:59.190
<v Speaker 4>But in people in the family know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't do anything about it.</v>

1682
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:00.243
<v Speaker 4>Because to talk about what GRANDPA does </v>
<v Speaker 4>every couple of years means that </v>

1683
01:24:04.711 --> 01:24:09.711
<v Speaker 4>complete disintegration of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>family and apocalypse for the family and</v>

1684
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:14.590
<v Speaker 4>the same way is more of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>revelations become clear,</v>

1685
01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:15.700
<v Speaker 4>which we always knew.</v>

1686
01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.280
<v Speaker 4>But you could always float into a happy </v>
<v Speaker 4>place and be like,</v>

1687
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just being a conspiracy dude.</v>

1688
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:25.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure the stuff they're doing up on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Capitol Hill is all fair and square.</v>

1689
01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.291
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1690
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:28.720
<v Speaker 4>you can just believe it guiding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just pretend to believe.</v>

1691
01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.360
<v Speaker 4>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well now you're wrong.</v>

1692
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:32.080
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1693
01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.200
<v Speaker 4>here's the fucking proof and here's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be more proof and there's going</v>

1694
01:24:35.201 --> 01:24:36.034
<v Speaker 4>to be more proof and there's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>more proof until finally the American </v>

1695
01:24:39.461 --> 01:24:41.950
<v Speaker 4>people are going to have to either just </v>
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

1696
01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:43.653
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to believe that fours </v>

1697
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:46.383
<v Speaker 4>three and three is four because I have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>nice comfortable life and I don't want </v>

1698
01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:52.720
<v Speaker 4>to fucking deal with this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1699
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to trust the banks </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the banks light,</v>

1700
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:59.680
<v Speaker 4>they like money and at my job and as </v>
<v Speaker 4>long as I keep my job,</v>

1701
01:24:59.681 --> 01:25:00.760
<v Speaker 4>I'll keep my benefits.</v>

1702
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:02.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

1703
01:25:02.201 --> 01:25:03.400
<v Speaker 4>ps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1704
01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:04.443
<v Speaker 4>when you consider that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's something pragmatic </v>

1705
01:25:07.151 --> 01:25:09.010
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As sad as it is.</v>

1706
01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 4>There's as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

1707
01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:11.800
<v Speaker 4>as depressing it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it is,</v>

1708
01:25:11.801 --> 01:25:12.634
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real awful problem is that this </v>

1709
01:25:17.591 --> 01:25:18.424
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is that they get metaphysical </v>

1710
01:25:20.171 --> 01:25:21.004
<v Speaker 4>machine that was built by some very </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent people who understood the </v>

1711
01:25:25.031 --> 01:25:29.740
<v Speaker 4>energy flow that comes through a society</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the elections were supposed to be an</v>

1712
01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:30.603
<v Speaker 4>outlet valve for the pressure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>builds up when people feel that they're </v>

1713
01:25:33.551 --> 01:25:34.930
<v Speaker 4>being repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1714
01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.093
<v Speaker 4>And if you start fucking with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>output valve by putting up fake </v>

1715
01:25:39.431 --> 01:25:44.200
<v Speaker 4>politicians that don't truly represent </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people and hope that the people will</v>

1716
01:25:44.201 --> 01:25:46.390
<v Speaker 4>believe that they have elected these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1717
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:50.590
<v Speaker 4>if you put two shitty choices in front </v>
<v Speaker 4>of us and we're supposed to look at that</v>

1718
01:25:50.591 --> 01:25:51.610
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1719
01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:54.500
<v Speaker 4>everything's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're,</v>

1720
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:55.623
<v Speaker 4>you're missing the point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that there is an energetic </v>

1721
01:25:57.971 --> 01:26:00.220
<v Speaker 4>system that needs to get released.</v>

1722
01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:03.440
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at some point the energy's got to out.</v>

1723
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.840
<v Speaker 4>If it doesn't go out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get revolution.</v>

1724
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.050
<v Speaker 4>That's the way the energy goes out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong way.</v>

1725
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 4>The idea is let's fucking the American </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolution,</v>

1726
01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.090
<v Speaker 4>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bloody,</v>

1727
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 4>awful fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These geniuses,</v>

1728
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.670
<v Speaker 4>many of them freemasons got together and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

1729
01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:20.504
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there a way that we can program </v>

1730
01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:23.444
<v Speaker 4>history so that a society doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroy itself intermittently with a </v>

1731
01:26:27.291 --> 01:26:29.750
<v Speaker 4>fucking revolution?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if we could do that,</v>

1732
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.793
<v Speaker 4>we'll build one of the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>never ending societies on earth because </v>

1733
01:26:34.881 --> 01:26:38.930
<v Speaker 4>we figured out a way to outflow the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure that builds up.</v>

1734
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:39.973
<v Speaker 4>So when you start fucking with a goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 4>political system and pretend that </v>

1735
01:26:42.621 --> 01:26:45.560
<v Speaker 4>everything's gonna be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are missing,</v>

1736
01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I think the the point which is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are very smart,</v>

1737
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:51.103
<v Speaker 4>maybe a lot smarter than then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians we have today recognize </v>

1738
01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:57.200
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>built a thing and said,</v>

1739
01:26:57.201 --> 01:27:01.280
<v Speaker 4>let's just trust the fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's trust the people release the steam</v>

1740
01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:04.910
<v Speaker 4>and while ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything runs according to plan.</v>

1741
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:08.360
<v Speaker 4>Now the gears are a little fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>gummed up man.</v>

1742
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:09.740
<v Speaker 4>A little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1743
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:14.510
<v Speaker 4>a little how gummed up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How gummed up the gears.</v>

1744
01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.673
<v Speaker 5>Really crazy gummed up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is the first time we're </v>

1745
01:27:17.721 --> 01:27:20.990
<v Speaker 5>realizing how much money people make by </v>
<v Speaker 5>running for president.</v>

1746
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:22.130
<v Speaker 5>How much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1747
01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:25.970
<v Speaker 5>money it costs to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how much money top political figures</v>

1748
01:27:25.971 --> 01:27:28.700
<v Speaker 5>make and donations and in speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1749
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:30.230
<v Speaker 5>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you paid attention to how much they</v>

1750
01:27:30.231 --> 01:27:33.650
<v Speaker 5>make and speeches like Rudy Giuliani and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton,</v>

1751
01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:35.060
<v Speaker 5>you may,</v>
<v Speaker 5>may bribes.</v>

1752
01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:36.410
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what it is.</v>

1753
01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.440
<v Speaker 5>These corporations can fund various,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1754
01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:42.314
<v Speaker 5>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can donate money to all sorts of </v>

1755
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.124
<v Speaker 5>different programs where they would have</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone speak and they can decide who </v>

1756
01:27:49.881 --> 01:27:51.530
<v Speaker 5>gets to speak and who doesn't get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>speak.</v>

1757
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:53.930
<v Speaker 5>And they also have like the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 5>Foundation,</v>

1758
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:58.370
<v Speaker 5>people donate money into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't donate fuck loads of money.</v>

1759
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:59.570
<v Speaker 5>Now it's her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these things,</v>

1760
01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:01.310
<v Speaker 5>but hold on a second says all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

1761
01:28:01.630 --> 01:28:02.990
<v Speaker 5>what they are essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you're,</v>

1762
01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:07.370
<v Speaker 5>you're paying someone to speak for an </v>
<v Speaker 5>hour and you're gonna give him $750,000.</v>

1763
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 5>And you want me to pretend that that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>normal.</v>

1764
01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.810
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what does this person do?</v>

1765
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:13.880
<v Speaker 5>They are a public servant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1766
01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:15.410
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there are public servant,</v>

1767
01:28:15.411 --> 01:28:20.150
<v Speaker 5>and while they're publicly serving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're also making $750,000</v>

1768
01:28:20.151 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 5>to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

1769
01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.510
<v Speaker 5>That seems a little crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>

1770
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:24.583
<v Speaker 5>Like why do they make so much money to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do that and who was paying them and </v>

1771
01:28:26.751 --> 01:28:27.380
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1772
01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:31.880
<v Speaker 5>what do you have to benefit by having </v>
<v Speaker 5>them come and read some nonsense,</v>

1773
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:34.190
<v Speaker 5>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boring speech.</v>

1774
01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.233
<v Speaker 5>A friend mine went to see Rudy Giuliani </v>
<v Speaker 5>after post nine one one when he was on </v>

1775
01:28:37.371 --> 01:28:38.204
<v Speaker 5>his victory tour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was on like a lap of the country </v>

1776
01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:41.024
<v Speaker 5>doing these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these speeches because everybody loved </v>

1777
01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:44.590
<v Speaker 5>him because he saved the world during,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1778
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:46.940
<v Speaker 5>September 11th he was the guy who stood </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong,</v>

1779
01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:48.540
<v Speaker 5>everybody like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rudy Giuliani,</v>

1780
01:28:48.541 --> 01:28:49.374

<v Speaker 5>So he rode that and he started doing </v>

1781
01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:51.014
<v Speaker 5>these speeches and would come to </v>
<v Speaker 5>colleges and a friend of mine went to </v>

1782
01:28:52.881 --> 01:28:56.300
<v Speaker 5>see him and said it was dog shit that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

1783
01:28:56.301 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 5>it was a boring ass like reading with no</v>
<v Speaker 5>passion.</v>

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:01.693
<v Speaker 5>It a chick chain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go in there and say some nonsense about </v>

<v Speaker 5>freedom and the American way and </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrorism or whatever the fuck and first</v>

<v Speaker 5>responders and just there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything real.</v>

1787
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a performance.</v>

1788
01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:14.453
<v Speaker 5>It was like he was doing a one man show </v>
<v Speaker 5>all across the country for exorbitant </v>

1789
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:19.350
<v Speaker 5>sums of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1790
01:29:19.351 --> 01:29:22.290
<v Speaker 5>that'd be fucking great if he was </v>

<v Speaker 5>hundred and $53 million in bill and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton speaking fees </v>

1792
01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.010
<v Speaker 5>documented.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just,</v>

1793
01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:33.690
<v Speaker 5>Jamie just pulled this up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That dad is stunning.</v>

<v Speaker 5>million a year.</v>

<v Speaker 5>gulfstream four 50 or larger.</v>

1801
01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:03.450
<v Speaker 5>The memo outlines had Clinton requires </v>
<v Speaker 5>travel by private jet.</v>

1802
01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:04.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>billionaire?</v>

1805
01:30:08.691 --> 01:30:09.524
<v Speaker 4>Could you just get Hillary Clinton to </v>
<v Speaker 4>come to your house and like just speak </v>

1809
01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:24.160
<v Speaker 5>She made 21 point $6 million in speeches</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just under two years.</v>

1810

<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

1812
01:30:32.801 --> 01:30:36.070
<v Speaker 4>that you can like lure with money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can actually,</v>

1813
01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:40.180
<v Speaker 4>if you have enough money you can learn </v>
<v Speaker 4>to Hillary Clinton into your house.</v>

1814
01:30:40.181 --> 01:30:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Like you just have to lay it out.</v>

1815
01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:45.220
<v Speaker 4>Like if I put carrots in my backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll probably get a rabbit or two.</v>

1816
01:30:45.490 --> 01:30:49.150
<v Speaker 4>If you have enough money you can get </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians to come and start feeding it</v>

1817
01:30:49.151 --> 01:30:50.510
<v Speaker 4>your mansion.</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1822
01:30:58.810 --> 01:30:59.643
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't be someone who is in public</v>
<v Speaker 5>office and go and also have like a a </v>

1823
01:31:04.301 --> 01:31:09.160

<v Speaker 5>your novel about crime or something like</v>

1824
01:31:09.161 --> 01:31:09.994

<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

1827
01:31:16.670 --> 01:31:18.040
<v Speaker 5>That's part of what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

1828
01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody's going to re ask Hillary Clinton</v>

1829
01:31:20.861 --> 01:31:23.470
<v Speaker 5>to come and speak about the history of </v>
<v Speaker 5>jazz in the United States.</v>

1830
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:24.643
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's not going to give speeches on </v>

1831
01:31:25.121 --> 01:31:27.100
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to give speeches on politics.</v>

<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why is that okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and that's going to continue to happen </v>

1952
01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:18.610
<v Speaker 5>and that's pretty fucking bad ass man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get,</v>

1953
01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.150
<v Speaker 5>no matter how powerful or gangster </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton is,</v>

1954
01:36:21.330 --> 01:36:22.163
<v Speaker 5>she has apparently zero security on our </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer systems are very little </v>

1955
01:36:26.311 --> 01:36:28.740
<v Speaker 5>security.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe if she had great security,</v>

1956
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
<v Speaker 5>she still couldn't stop the infiltration</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a hackers.</v>

1957
01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:35.243
<v Speaker 5>And this is going to keep happening and </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening and happening until either we </v>

1958
01:36:38.041 --> 01:36:43.041
<v Speaker 5>just accept that our politicians are </v>
<v Speaker 5>innately corrupt or we come up with some</v>

1959
01:36:44.011 --> 01:36:48.720
<v Speaker 5>fucking way to starve them out to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>it so that they are.</v>

1960
01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:50.040
<v Speaker 5>But how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we'll,</v>

1961
01:36:50.041 --> 01:36:51.990
<v Speaker 5>do you think Bernie was like the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>step in that?</v>

1962
01:36:52.190 --> 01:36:54.240
<v Speaker 5>Like Bernie's no perfect person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1963
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:55.103
<v Speaker 5>I'm not the most gigantic Bernie Sanders</v>
<v Speaker 5>supporter because of talk to economists </v>

1964
01:37:00.061 --> 01:37:03.780
<v Speaker 5>that tell me that what he was proposing </v>
<v Speaker 5>is not fiscally possible.</v>

1965
01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:06.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know if they're right or he's</v>

1966
01:37:06.031 --> 01:37:06.420
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1967
01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:10.320
<v Speaker 5>And it's all real tricky to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the idea of democratic socialism.</v>

1968
01:37:10.321 --> 01:37:10.681
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

1969
01:37:10.681 --> 01:37:12.210
<v Speaker 5>it sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds good.</v>

1970
01:37:12.211 --> 01:37:13.041
<v Speaker 5>If people got more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1971
01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:15.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm warming up to the idea of universal </v>
<v Speaker 5>basic income.</v>

1972
01:37:15.811 --> 01:37:16.644
<v Speaker 5>I kind of liked that idea because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think if you think about how much </v>

1973
01:37:18.511 --> 01:37:19.344
<v Speaker 5>resources we spend on things like cops </v>
<v Speaker 5>and firemen and d damaged on and police </v>

1974
01:37:24.331 --> 01:37:25.340
<v Speaker 5>and fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1975
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:26.263
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rather prisons and how much time maybe </v>

1976
01:37:27.871 --> 01:37:30.420
<v Speaker 5>we could avoid some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe a big chunk of it.</v>

1977
01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:33.450
<v Speaker 5>I think universal basic income has like </v>
<v Speaker 5>some real,</v>

1978
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:36.450
<v Speaker 5>there's got some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's something that we should explore as</v>

1979
01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:37.470
<v Speaker 5>a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we,</v>

1980
01:37:37.471 --> 01:37:38.304
<v Speaker 5>I think also requiring people to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain things like in the community </v>

1981
01:37:41.791 --> 01:37:44.160
<v Speaker 5>requiring some sort of community </v>
<v Speaker 5>service.</v>

1982
01:37:44.370 --> 01:37:46.800
<v Speaker 5>Like how nice would it be if a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1983
01:37:46.801 --> 01:37:49.170
<v Speaker 5>it's nice to be able to pay someone to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take out the garbage,</v>

1984
01:37:49.171 --> 01:37:52.770
<v Speaker 5>but maybe we'd appreciate each other </v>
<v Speaker 5>more if we all took out the garbage once</v>

1985
01:37:52.771 --> 01:37:53.461
<v Speaker 5>a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No Way,</v>

1986
01:37:53.461 --> 01:37:54.690
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with that.</v>

1987
01:37:54.691 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're in Venezuela</v>

1988
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.080
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing,</v>

1989
01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.113
<v Speaker 4>they're forcing people to be civil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be farmers for like 60 days out of </v>

1990
01:38:03.571 --> 01:38:04.830
<v Speaker 4>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

1991
01:38:04.831 --> 01:38:07.160
<v Speaker 4>But I make them feel good about farmers </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1992
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:10.980
<v Speaker 4>cause like Venezuela's fucking imploding</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they need like Dan but,</v>

1993
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:12.810
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you man,</v>

1994
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:14.303
<v Speaker 4>any time the government or federal </v>
<v Speaker 4>workers get more power in whatever way </v>

1995
01:38:20.671 --> 01:38:24.240
<v Speaker 4>it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a bad thing for all of us.</v>

1996
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:26.130
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1997
01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.053
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more we can push their fucking </v>

1998
01:38:29.851 --> 01:38:33.780
<v Speaker 4>tendrils out of our consciousness the </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

1999
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:38.670
<v Speaker 4>And so anytime anyone is suggesting some</v>
<v Speaker 4>new,</v>

2000
01:38:38.671 --> 01:38:41.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't care how fucking utopian it </v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds.</v>

2001
01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:43.050
<v Speaker 4>Anytime anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing.</v>

2002
01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:46.680
<v Speaker 4>Do you think the government is corrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the answer is yes,</v>

2003
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.620
<v Speaker 4>why would you want to give them more </v>
<v Speaker 4>power?</v>

2004
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.000
<v Speaker 4>What would you want to give them more </v>
<v Speaker 4>tax planning.</v>

2005
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2006
01:38:51.931 --> 01:38:52.350
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2007
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:53.183
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now when you're talking about taxing </v>

2008
01:38:54.931 --> 01:38:55.764
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not talking about giving them </v>

2009
01:38:56.371 --> 01:38:58.470
<v Speaker 4>money directly to the poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2010
01:38:58.500 --> 01:38:59.550
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2011
01:38:59.551 --> 01:39:00.384
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking about going to the government </v>

2012
01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 4>and the government distributes it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>no receipt.</v>

2013
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:04.290
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

2014
01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:05.420
<v Speaker 4>that's what they do right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2015
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:07.110
<v Speaker 4>We don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up.</v>

2016
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.780
<v Speaker 4>If these people up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they were like,</v>

2017
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:13.890
<v Speaker 4>somehow we actually just imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a crazy fantasy.</v>

2018
01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:14.873
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you'd implement it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's imagine we had a system where </v>

2019
01:39:17.610 --> 01:39:20.430
<v Speaker 4>every four years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the coolest,</v>

2020
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:24.030
<v Speaker 4>smartest people in the country became </v>
<v Speaker 4>our leaders.</v>

2021
01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be fucking insane.</v>

2022
01:39:27.490 --> 01:39:29.280
<v Speaker 4>Coolest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smartest people don't want that job just</v>

2023
01:39:29.281 --> 01:39:31.350
<v Speaker 4>by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a strange job.</v>

2024
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 4>The idea of wanting to be the person </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in control of everything,</v>

2025
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:37.740
<v Speaker 4>and I think until it goes horribly </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>

2026
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.340
<v Speaker 4>we're going to stay on the outside and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go hug somebody.</v>

2027
01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 4>Come on somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on somebody.</v>

2028
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:43.801
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2029
01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I think some of the coolest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smartest people because they're so cool.</v>

2030
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:49.470
<v Speaker 4>If I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a mystery,</v>

2031
01:39:49.471 --> 01:39:51.750
<v Speaker 4>how to get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's just say you could.</v>

2032
01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.310
<v Speaker 4>That's a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How you get to them,</v>

2033
01:39:53.311 --> 01:39:55.920
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and let's imagine there was what?</v>

2034
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:56.783
<v Speaker 4>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even know the name of a </v>

2035
01:39:58.960 --> 01:39:59.793
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but gave me the attributes you would </v>

2036
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:03.870
<v Speaker 4>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would take somebody like Elon Musk.</v>

2037
01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I would take somebody like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would take somebody.</v>

2038
01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.420
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would take somebody like,</v>

2039
01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want the job.</v>

2040
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.360
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to judge you on.</v>

2041
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:13.171
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

2042
01:40:13.171 --> 01:40:14.004
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we all sit together in a room and </v>

2043
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:17.160
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2044
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:21.360
<v Speaker 4>let's imagine like five more fat acids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2045
01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.910
<v Speaker 4>We all sit together in a room and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2046
01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:24.803
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know none of you guys wanted this </v>

2047
01:40:26.461 --> 01:40:27.294
<v Speaker 4>fucking job.</v>

2048
01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.313
<v Speaker 4>You're successful because you're super </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart and you're super cool and you're </v>

2049
01:40:32.341 --> 01:40:33.174
<v Speaker 4>having great lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but would you consider for a couple of </v>

2050
01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:38.243
<v Speaker 4>years helping us work this shit out so </v>
<v Speaker 4>the planet gets a little better and I </v>

2051
01:40:42.571 --> 01:40:43.710
<v Speaker 4>guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now again,</v>

2052
01:40:43.711 --> 01:40:44.544
<v Speaker 4>this is a fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guarantee that there'll be very </v>

2053
01:40:46.921 --> 01:40:48.240
<v Speaker 4>few people in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>

2054
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:50.250
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to live my life.</v>

2055
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:51.060
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2056
01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:52.500
<v Speaker 4>I'll do it for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>

2057
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 4>How do for four years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2058
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.413
<v Speaker 4>I would love to help and still for four </v>
<v Speaker 4>years you go into this job truly </v>

2059
01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:00.940
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2060
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:01.803
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to see if I can reduce the </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of people who are fucking </v>

2061
01:41:05.170 --> 01:41:06.003
<v Speaker 4>uneducated and hungry and the bombs </v>
<v Speaker 4>going off and I'm going to try to do it </v>

2062
01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.313
<v Speaker 4>by using all of my smartest friends and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing it because I'm going to </v>

2063
01:41:14.531 --> 01:41:16.420
<v Speaker 4>get money from this group or that group.</v>

2064
01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:19.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing it because it feels like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right thing to do.</v>

2065
01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what that's called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

2066
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:25.450
<v Speaker 4>That's called the American fucking dream</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the founding fathers came up with.</v>

2067
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:26.463
<v Speaker 4>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have a group of </v>

2068
01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:29.493
<v Speaker 4>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderful people who want this </v>

2069
01:41:32.561 --> 01:41:36.790
<v Speaker 4>particular swath of human beings to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>peaceful.</v>

2070
01:41:36.850 --> 01:41:37.683
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A peaceful place where you can </v>

2071
01:41:38.951 --> 01:41:42.160
<v Speaker 4>experience life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberty,</v>

2072
01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:45.340
<v Speaker 4>and the pursuit of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2073
01:41:45.490 --> 01:41:46.930
<v Speaker 4>Freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>autonomy,</v>

2074
01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:49.480
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these beautiful things.</v>

2075
01:41:49.481 --> 01:41:51.490
<v Speaker 4>That was the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful idea.</v>

2076
01:41:51.570 --> 01:41:55.630
<v Speaker 4>It will almost make you cry when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about how beautiful a fucking idea</v>

2077
01:41:55.631 --> 01:41:56.464
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then to imagine that that idea over </v>

2078
01:41:59.501 --> 01:42:03.190
<v Speaker 4>the course of time was gradually </v>
<v Speaker 4>deteriorated,</v>

2079
01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.330
<v Speaker 4>gradually infiltrated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gradually broken down.</v>

2080
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:11.950
<v Speaker 4>And of course it was because when there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a powerful empire,</v>

2081
01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:16.780
<v Speaker 4>the empire is inevitably attacked by </v>
<v Speaker 4>entities that want to take it over.</v>

2082
01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:19.060
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the nature of things.</v>

2083
01:42:19.150 --> 01:42:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Something powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some asshole wants that power.</v>

2084
01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:23.493
<v Speaker 4>And so an analysis of the system over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the course of time or in an intentional </v>

2085
01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:33.810
<v Speaker 4>infiltration by people who have all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>money or just some systemic degradation,</v>

2086
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.573
<v Speaker 4>a slow sort of collapse of a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>different systems inside the thing has </v>

2087
01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:42.154
<v Speaker 4>happened that has happened and yet the </v>
<v Speaker 4>concept remains one of the most </v>

2088
01:42:46.421 --> 01:42:47.254
<v Speaker 4>beautiful ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most incredible fucking </v>

2089
01:42:49.271 --> 01:42:51.520
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They cannot erode the concept.</v>

2090
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:53.860
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe it can still be saved with </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology.</v>

2091
01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.173
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the transparency that's being </v>
<v Speaker 5>afforded by technology is going to </v>

2092
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:58.143
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another step in and put a </v>
<v Speaker 5>halt to what we see as just a standard </v>

2093
01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.750
<v Speaker 5>operational behavior of corruption and </v>
<v Speaker 5>influence,</v>

2094
01:43:07.810 --> 01:43:08.643
<v Speaker 5>corruption and influences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just so standard that it's right in </v>

2095
01:43:10.991 --> 01:43:11.824
<v Speaker 5>front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When CNN is printing Hillary Clinton's </v>

2096
01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.390
<v Speaker 5>annual earnings for the past two years </v>
<v Speaker 5>is $21 million and no one's baton and I,</v>

2097
01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.230
<v Speaker 5>she's sitting there with a bite suit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She has that bite suit on,</v>

2098
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:25.720
<v Speaker 5>looks like a fucking German shepherds </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to jump out of the bushes and grab</v>

2099
01:43:25.721 --> 01:43:26.554
<v Speaker 5>her suit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She walks around these boxy bite suit </v>

2100
01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:30.213
<v Speaker 5>and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's making ungodly sums of money from </v>

2101
01:43:33.761 --> 01:43:35.260
<v Speaker 5>just talking and she's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it,</v>

2102
01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.160
<v Speaker 5>doing it right in front of our face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2103
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:38.103
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's one of the beautiful </v>

2104
01:43:38.981 --> 01:43:39.814
<v Speaker 5>things about Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the most beautiful things he </v>

2105
01:43:41.621 --> 01:43:43.690
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't take a dime from those people.</v>

2106
01:43:43.690 --> 01:43:46.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't speak to the banks because what </v>
<v Speaker 5>did you,</v>

2107
01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:47.283
<v Speaker 5>what did you say when you got paid?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Half a million plus or whatever she got </v>

2108
01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:51.424
<v Speaker 5>paid to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much did she get paid to speak to </v>

2109
01:43:52.581 --> 01:43:53.414
<v Speaker 5>the banks?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there was something fucking </v>

2110
01:43:54.801 --> 01:43:55.634
<v Speaker 5>bananas about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was one of the ones that she got </v>

2111
01:43:57.591 --> 01:43:58.251
<v Speaker 5>paid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made,</v>

2112
01:43:58.251 --> 01:44:00.590
<v Speaker 5>it might've been the 250 million now </v>

2114
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:04.160
<v Speaker 5>She won't release the ones who she talks</v>
<v Speaker 5>to banks,</v>

2115
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.900
<v Speaker 5>they'll get released,</v>

2123
01:44:23.601 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 5>might consider to be a little abnormal </v>
<v Speaker 5>when they get together.</v>

<v Speaker 5>multimillionaire guys meeting in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bohemian Grove and burning these fit.</v>

2141
01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:15.980
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton was paid $225,000</v>

2142
01:45:15.981 --> 01:45:18.860
<v Speaker 5>to speak at Goldman Sachs builders and </v>

<v Speaker 5>That is a Golfer's paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those rich dudes out there golfing </v>

2146
01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:30.883
<v Speaker 5>drive in those convertible Mercedes is </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the metal tops close and open and </v>

2147
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:35.930
<v Speaker 5>like 13 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2148
01:45:35.931 --> 01:45:36.970
<v Speaker 5>These,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these guys are,</v>

2149
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:38.360
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all fucking monsters.</v>

2150
01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:39.373
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2151
01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:41.150
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you,</v>

2152
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.700
<v Speaker 5>this is something that I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

2153
01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.133
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a fucking seemingly patriotic </v>

2154
01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:48.820
<v Speaker 5>spiel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that was inside of it.</v>

2155
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.850
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2156
01:45:49.851 --> 01:45:51.020
<v Speaker 5>it is patriotic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2157
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:52.970
<v Speaker 5>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are right.</v>

2158
01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:56.840
<v Speaker 5>These people were massively repressed by</v>
<v Speaker 5>Europe.</v>

2159
01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:58.093
<v Speaker 5>They took this incredible chance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting in boats and coming across an </v>

2160
01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:02.113
<v Speaker 5>ocean in the time where we're navigating</v>
<v Speaker 5>things with something that looks like a </v>

2161
01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.650
<v Speaker 5>protractor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

2162
01:46:07.690 --> 01:46:10.310
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had sextants and other staring at the</v>

2163
01:46:10.311 --> 01:46:12.770
<v Speaker 5>fucking constellations trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>out which way to go.</v>

2164
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:14.780
<v Speaker 5>They're manipulating the air and get </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2165
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:17.810
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of them are doing that because</v>

2166
01:46:17.811 --> 01:46:18.644
<v Speaker 5>they want to worship God in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>way that they're not able to show you </v>

2167
01:46:21.051 --> 01:46:21.884
<v Speaker 5>where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But even even whatever their rationale </v>

2168
01:46:24.381 --> 01:46:25.214
<v Speaker 5>for leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they still had the balls to get on a </v>

2169
01:46:26.181 --> 01:46:27.014
<v Speaker 5>fucking boat and make cross the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that puts them in a better place in </v>

2170
01:46:29.841 --> 01:46:30.674
<v Speaker 5>my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then those pussies that stayed back and </v>

2171
01:46:32.541 --> 01:46:35.180
<v Speaker 5>believed in logic but lived under the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rule of the queen.</v>

2172
01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those dummies are the king.</v>

2173
01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:39.770
<v Speaker 5>Was it came back then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably probably a kings.</v>

2174
01:46:40.190 --> 01:46:42.890
<v Speaker 5>But my point is I don't have a point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I had a point,</v>

2175
01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:43.873
<v Speaker 5>what would it would be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the reason why America is so </v>

2176
01:46:46.221 --> 01:46:49.010
<v Speaker 5>fucking bad ass that at least at least </v>
<v Speaker 5>the</v>

2177
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:53.310
<v Speaker 4>of the initial instincts to start it </v>
<v Speaker 4>still exist.</v>

2178
01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea can't go away.</v>

2179
01:46:54.901 --> 01:46:56.350
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a geometric form.</v>

2180
01:46:56.351 --> 01:46:57.540
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the problem man.</v>

2181
01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why it's thinking.</v>

2182
01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:03.270
<v Speaker 4>So let's imagine that you and I are </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow,</v>

2183
01:47:03.271 --> 01:47:04.104
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why we end up on a cruise </v>
<v Speaker 4>ship filled with idiots like literal </v>

2184
01:47:08.851 --> 01:47:11.640
<v Speaker 4>fucking idiots fricking happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somehow they just like,</v>

2185
01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 4>they went through like maybe like some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the opposite of a reality show</v>

2186
01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.650
<v Speaker 4>where you find a great person like over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the course of like months,</v>

2187
01:47:19.651 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 4>they find like the world's worst people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2188
01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:23.873
<v Speaker 4>And so are the world's like maybe like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world's most unwise people are the </v>

2189
01:47:27.391 --> 01:47:28.224
<v Speaker 4>world's dumbest people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you end up in with like a population </v>

2190
01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:35.220
<v Speaker 4>of like 60 idiots on the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying we're not idiots.</v>

2191
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:38.430
<v Speaker 4>I certainly don't consider myself to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a MENSA member,</v>

2192
01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:39.413
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's imagine we're a little like </v>

2193
01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.990
<v Speaker 4>more on the ball and these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2194
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:46.110
<v Speaker 4>the boat fucking racks.</v>

2195
01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.810
<v Speaker 4>We're on an island now we have to build </v>
<v Speaker 4>a civilization.</v>

2196
01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.273
<v Speaker 4>How does democracy become a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>if the majority of people are kind of </v>

2197
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:58.860
<v Speaker 4>not that fucking on point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2198
01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.060
<v Speaker 4>What happens if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2199
01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:00.953
<v Speaker 4>what if it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's imagine it's a boat filled with </v>

2200
01:48:02.401 --> 01:48:03.234
<v Speaker 4>psychotics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's imagine it's a boat filled with </v>

2201
01:48:04.831 --> 01:48:07.650
<v Speaker 4>people who are paranoid schizophrenia </v>
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

2202
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:11.250
<v Speaker 4>How do you have a democracy of paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia,</v>

2203
01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:12.093
<v Speaker 4>six running things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you have the news spraying </v>

2204
01:48:15.451 --> 01:48:16.284
<v Speaker 4>out a paradigm that is also weirdly </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupt in the sense that the news is </v>

2205
01:48:21.301 --> 01:48:22.134
<v Speaker 4>being run by a groups of people who want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to sell advertising and need to be </v>

2206
01:48:26.101 --> 01:48:27.420
<v Speaker 4>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2207
01:48:27.421 --> 01:48:30.900
<v Speaker 4>they have to at least present this </v>
<v Speaker 4>information and it kind of entertaining,</v>

2208
01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:31.973
<v Speaker 4>possibly warped way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are cases including in the recent </v>

2209
01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:36.503
<v Speaker 4>wikileaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2210
01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:38.460
<v Speaker 4>dump that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the,</v>

2211
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:39.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they were the,</v>

2212
01:48:39.710 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's it called,</v>

2213
01:48:40.891 --> 01:48:43.920
<v Speaker 4>the ndd that in the nondisclosure </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreement with the national,</v>

2214
01:48:43.921 --> 01:48:46.470
<v Speaker 4>the Democratic Group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the DNC,</v>

2215
01:48:46.471 --> 01:48:50.520
<v Speaker 4>the DNC was telling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giving like talking points to the press,</v>

2216
01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:51.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2217
01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:52.013
<v Speaker 4>So if the media is painting a picture of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the universe that is not accurate or is </v>

2218
01:48:58.881 --> 01:48:59.714
<v Speaker 4>warped a little bit based on consumerism</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the corporations that are running </v>

2219
01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:06.690
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the people who have tuned into that</v>

2220
01:49:06.691 --> 01:49:07.524
<v Speaker 4>reality and believe it to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could safely say they are mildly </v>

2221
01:49:11.101 --> 01:49:16.101
<v Speaker 4>psychotic because they have bought into </v>
<v Speaker 4>a reality tunnel that might not actually</v>

2222
01:49:16.291 --> 01:49:17.124
<v Speaker 4>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In which case is a democracy at that </v>

2223
01:49:19.441 --> 01:49:20.460
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A good thing.</v>

2224
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.030
<v Speaker 4>If the people living in the democracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>have for a lifetime,</v>

2225
01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.380
<v Speaker 4>been getting bad information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot into their fucking brains,</v>

2226
01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:31.980
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you brain damage wars.</v>

2227
01:49:31.981 --> 01:49:32.814
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you just need to fucking kill </v>

2228
01:49:33.991 --> 01:49:34.824
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have got to get into fucking Iraq </v>

2229
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.823
<v Speaker 4>because Saddam Hussein has weapons of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mass destruction that he is going to UN </v>

2230
01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:46.050
<v Speaker 4>leash on the fucking West.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wrong information.</v>

2231
01:49:46.170 --> 01:49:48.820
<v Speaker 4>But if you believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you believe wrong information,</v>

2232
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.863
<v Speaker 4>and if you believe wrong information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that means that you are no longer </v>

2233
01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:58.680
<v Speaker 4>walking along the path that is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a path created by other people.</v>

2234
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:59.703
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's when democracy gets really </v>

2235
01:50:01.811 --> 01:50:06.811
<v Speaker 4>interesting because now what we have is </v>
<v Speaker 4>very powerful hypnotic cobbles of con,</v>

2236
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:08.471
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2237
01:50:08.471 --> 01:50:09.304
<v Speaker 4>of billionaires sending bad information </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the population and attempt to shift </v>

2238
01:50:14.051 --> 01:50:14.884
<v Speaker 4>their perceptual mechanisms in such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way that they will elect leaders that </v>

2239
01:50:19.991 --> 01:50:20.824
<v Speaker 4>don't represent them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that have been created by these </v>

2240
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:28.270
<v Speaker 4>machines to take over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in that case,</v>

2241
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 4>the democracy becomes a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 4>problematic.</v>

2242
01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.460
<v Speaker 4>So that's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2243
01:50:33.461 --> 01:50:34.031
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

2244
01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Now let's imagine we suddenly have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>functioning democracy.</v>

2245
01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:41.230
<v Speaker 4>What if a lot of people in that function</v>
<v Speaker 4>functioning democracy have subscribed to</v>

2246
01:50:41.231 --> 01:50:43.210
<v Speaker 4>ideas that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that aren't real,</v>

2247
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:45.970
<v Speaker 4>and that they're not willing to let go </v>
<v Speaker 4>of?</v>

2248
01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 4>Are you writing down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never put,</v>

2249
01:50:47.741 --> 01:50:49.870
<v Speaker 4>Duncan is showing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll know how to remember something.</v>

2250
01:50:49.871 --> 01:50:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I keep forgetting and I have to remember</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2251
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:53.290
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to stop your rant.</v>

2252
01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.153
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

2253
01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.033
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when you're high as fuck like </v>

2254
01:50:57.641 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 4>we are right now so great and we start </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about stuff.</v>

2255
01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.110
<v Speaker 5>When you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have an idea but it just,</v>

2256
01:51:03.111 --> 01:51:05.420
<v Speaker 5>I have to follow your idea and my idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>slips away.</v>

2257
01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:06.433
<v Speaker 5>I had to write it down.</v>

2258
01:51:06.730 --> 01:51:07.563
<v Speaker 4>It's just that the idea is what if this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if not many of us like the shit we </v>

2259
01:51:10.901 --> 01:51:11.734
<v Speaker 4>believe ain't real and what if that shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we think is real has been </v>

2260
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:15.754
<v Speaker 4>intentionally placed into our heads by </v>
<v Speaker 4>corporations with the intention of </v>

2261
01:51:18.641 --> 01:51:19.474
<v Speaker 4>making us behave in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At that point a democracy becomes </v>

2262
01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:24.243
<v Speaker 4>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you going to do if you </v>

2263
01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:26.913
<v Speaker 4>mean there's so many people right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>who believe the like trump is putting </v>

2264
01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:30.544
<v Speaker 4>out a reality tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton's putting out a reality </v>

2265
01:51:32.831 --> 01:51:33.664
<v Speaker 4>tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are two different reality tunnels </v>

2266
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:40.830
<v Speaker 4>where many of the pieces of it might not</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually reflect what's happening in the</v>

2267
01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:42.370
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

2268
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:43.383
<v Speaker 4>which of these made up stories are you </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to tune into or are you going to </v>

2269
01:51:46.481 --> 01:51:51.481
<v Speaker 4>reject both of them and go wandering off</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the woods alone and try to,</v>

2270
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:52.623
<v Speaker 4>in your own way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what's happening minus the </v>

2271
01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.430
<v Speaker 4>influence of the corporate media.</v>

2272
01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:03.180
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking when we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>people coming over in boats that we were</v>

2273
01:52:03.181 --> 01:52:06.160
<v Speaker 5>talking earlier about the human biome </v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

2274
01:52:06.161 --> 01:52:07.830
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your gut biome in particular,</v>

2275
01:52:07.831 --> 01:52:10.470
<v Speaker 5>it affects your mood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your intelligence level,</v>

2276
01:52:10.471 --> 01:52:13.110
<v Speaker 5>your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it affects your immune system.</v>

2277
01:52:13.530 --> 01:52:14.363
<v Speaker 5>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one thing that I've been really </v>

2278
01:52:16.351 --> 01:52:17.184
<v Speaker 5>getting into over the last few years is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really concentrating on probiotics </v>

2279
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:21.180
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kombucha,</v>

2280
01:52:21.181 --> 01:52:22.890
<v Speaker 5>that was the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked that.</v>

2281
01:52:22.891 --> 01:52:25.290
<v Speaker 5>A gts Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that original flavor.</v>

2282
01:52:25.291 --> 01:52:26.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like,</v>

2283
01:52:26.701 --> 01:52:28.200
<v Speaker 5>it feels like someone blew their nose in</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2284
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:31.770
<v Speaker 5>Those slimy slugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

2285
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:32.670
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2286
01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:34.350
<v Speaker 5>Combu just slugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta throw it down,</v>

2287
01:52:34.351 --> 01:52:35.730
<v Speaker 5>but it's really good for your immune </v>
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

2288
01:52:35.731 --> 01:52:37.770
<v Speaker 5>And it made a big difference with all my</v>
<v Speaker 5>travel on the road.</v>

2289
01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:39.930
<v Speaker 5>But then I started really getting into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kiefer,</v>

2290
01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:43.800
<v Speaker 5>started really getting into a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I drink goat's milk keifer several times</v>

2291
01:52:43.801 --> 01:52:46.700
<v Speaker 5>a week and I drink whole glass of it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2292
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.630
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2293
01:52:47.631 --> 01:52:50.060
<v Speaker 5>the more I have been constantly on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kimchi.</v>

2294
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:51.800
<v Speaker 5>That's another one that I've really </v>
<v Speaker 5>gotten into lately.</v>

2295
01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fermented cabbage.</v>

2296
01:52:53.850 --> 01:52:54.890
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2297
01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 5>it's really good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very probiotic as well.</v>

2298
01:52:57.090 --> 01:53:00.110
<v Speaker 5>The more I'm doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I feel happier,</v>

2299
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:03.050
<v Speaker 5>if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It actually makes me feel better.</v>

2300
01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:03.943
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't just feel like healthier in </v>

2301
01:53:05.751 --> 01:53:08.840
<v Speaker 5>terms of my immune system's really good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel better.</v>

2302
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:10.303
<v Speaker 5>So what I was thinking is these poor </v>
<v Speaker 5>folks that got on that boat and came </v>

2303
01:53:13.491 --> 01:53:14.324
<v Speaker 5>across the seas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you think about the horrible </v>

2304
01:53:16.251 --> 01:53:20.080
<v Speaker 5>atrocities committed by the pilgrims or </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Columbus,</v>

2305
01:53:20.081 --> 01:53:20.980
<v Speaker 5>his soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

2306
01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.370
<v Speaker 5>When they came over here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2307
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:27.430
<v Speaker 5>they buy one account of a missionary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were dashing babies' heads on rocks</v>

2308
01:53:27.611 --> 01:53:28.444
<v Speaker 5>and were cutting people's arms off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't bring back their weight in </v>

2309
01:53:30.231 --> 01:53:31.064
<v Speaker 5>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2310
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:33.710
<v Speaker 5>There was some really dark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dark,</v>

2311
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:34.723
<v Speaker 5>dark shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if it was a combination of </v>

2312
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:44.750
<v Speaker 5>obviously barbaric human beings in </v>
<v Speaker 5>barbaric times when things were just way</v>

2313
01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 5>fucking different and it was very little</v>
<v Speaker 5>accountability for psychopathic behavior</v>

2314
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:50.570
<v Speaker 5>and in fact you hired these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychopaths,</v>

2315
01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:52.760
<v Speaker 5>these abused people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>murders.</v>

2316
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:53.743
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's are your soldiers cause your </v>

2317
01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.273
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're hiring,</v>

2318
01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:56.293
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are the people that you put on </v>

2319
01:53:56.691 --> 01:53:57.524
<v Speaker 5>that fucking boat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the only people that are </v>

2320
01:53:58.071 --> 01:54:01.340
<v Speaker 5>willing so they get across his ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes months.</v>

2321
01:54:01.341 --> 01:54:02.210
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long did it take?</v>

2323
01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:05.990

<v Speaker 5>Do you think it took three months?</v>

2324
01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say it took like 90 days.</v>

2325
01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:09.700
<v Speaker 5>I would think longer than that.</v>

<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 11>believe it because it's true.</v>

2451
01:59:35.170 --> 01:59:36.670
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well let's just describe what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was ready to cry.</v>

2455
01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:43.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm ready to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's horrible.</v>

2456
01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:47.350
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy and he's talking to his </v>
<v Speaker 5>daughter and she's reciting a prayer and</v>

2457
01:59:47.351 --> 01:59:52.030
<v Speaker 5>apparently she's reciting some prayer of</v>
<v Speaker 5>safety and while they're doing it,</v>

2458
01:59:52.031 --> 01:59:57.031
<v Speaker 5>you here and they both get shot like </v>
<v Speaker 5>rocketed back and forth.</v>

2459
02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:04.030
<v Speaker 5>Like something hit near their building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see like the reverberations,</v>

2460
02:00:04.031 --> 02:00:06.560
<v Speaker 5>the impact move them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

2461
02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:08.590
<v Speaker 5>they jut out of the frame and then the </v>
<v Speaker 5>video stops.</v>

2462
02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:10.210
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2463
02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:13.300
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might not even be real.</v>

2464
02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:14.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm assuming it's real.</v>

2465
02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:17.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm assuming it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might not even be real,</v>

2466
02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:18.970
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I don't know,</v>

2467
02:00:18.971 --> 02:00:19.804
<v Speaker 5>I can't verify it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that happens exactly the way you're </v>

2468
02:00:22.901 --> 02:00:23.734
<v Speaker 5>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not that is an actual </v>

2469
02:00:24.881 --> 02:00:25.714
<v Speaker 5>representation or whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody wants you to imagine what it </v>

2470
02:00:28.001 --> 02:00:29.350
<v Speaker 5>would be like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2471
02:00:29.351 --> 02:00:30.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the veracity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't,</v>

2472
02:00:30.610 --> 02:00:33.250
<v Speaker 5>I haven't studied the video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2473
02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:34.173
<v Speaker 5>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know whether or not anybody's </v>

2474
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:36.640
<v Speaker 5>calling bullshit on that video?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2475
02:00:36.641 --> 02:00:37.460
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

2476
02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:38.620
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do bond.</v>

2477
02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:39.513
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not sure if you're seeing that </v>

2478
02:00:41.290 --> 02:00:42.130
<v Speaker 5>or if it's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2479
02:00:42.131 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a company that was a,</v>

2480
02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:44.533
<v Speaker 5>I think it's an Australia that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they create fake viral videos to get </v>

2481
02:00:48.881 --> 02:00:52.360
<v Speaker 5>hits and they're a special effects </v>
<v Speaker 5>company and they've,</v>

2482
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:55.840
<v Speaker 5>they're responsible for like a gang of </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing videos that have been online.</v>

2483
02:00:55.841 --> 02:01:00.440
<v Speaker 5>One of them was this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple that shot a lion and then you,</v>

2484
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:01.910
<v Speaker 5>you see the lion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2485
02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:04.540
<v Speaker 5>another line there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're standing over taking pictures.</v>

2486
02:01:04.541 --> 02:01:07.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This one special effects group made that</v>

2487
02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:08.163
<v Speaker 5>and a bunch of other fake ones too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that a lot of people sent me and they </v>

2488
02:01:10.781 --> 02:01:12.490
<v Speaker 5>said they were real and I retweeted them</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2489
02:01:12.491 --> 02:01:13.410
<v Speaker 5>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

2490
02:01:14.050 --> 02:01:14.883
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile these people are just </v>

2491
02:01:15.341 --> 02:01:16.420
<v Speaker 5>special effects artists.</v>

2492
02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The line one didn't get me,</v>

2493
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.830
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is too perfectly framed.</v>

2494
02:01:21.070 --> 02:01:22.660
<v Speaker 5>It's too good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It got me,</v>

2495
02:01:23.110 --> 02:01:24.340
<v Speaker 5>didn't get me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus,</v>

2496
02:01:24.341 --> 02:01:27.040
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like the way that the line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way it was looking though.</v>

2497
02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:29.290
<v Speaker 5>It was sitting there on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looked fake.</v>

2498
02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:31.240
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing looked like it looked </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a fake lie.</v>

2499
02:01:31.690 --> 02:01:36.070
<v Speaker 5>But then there's one that came out today</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm a reasonably sure is real.</v>

2500
02:01:36.250 --> 02:01:38.020
<v Speaker 5>And this one I was telling you about </v>
<v Speaker 5>before the show,</v>

2501
02:01:38.021 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 5>but there's a bear in this guy's house </v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

2502
02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:44.630
<v Speaker 5>he looks downstairs in my friend Shane </v>
<v Speaker 5>Carwyn actually tweeted a picture.</v>

2503
02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:45.493
<v Speaker 5>I've got a retweet it when I find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tweeted me a picture today of a </v>

2504
02:01:48.201 --> 02:01:51.680
<v Speaker 5>fucking bear that broke into his </v>
<v Speaker 5>friend's cabin and tore it apart.</v>

2505
02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:52.761
<v Speaker 5>Tore the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2506
02:01:52.761 --> 02:01:55.910
<v Speaker 5>the frigerator open,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ripped out everything on the floor,</v>

2507
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.460
<v Speaker 5>ripped out cabinets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just tore his fucking place bar.</v>

2508
02:01:58.610 --> 02:02:00.710
<v Speaker 5>And apparently his friend called Shane </v>
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>

2509
02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:01.760
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey dude,</v>

2510
02:02:01.761 --> 02:02:04.130
<v Speaker 5>did you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>use my cabin or something?</v>

2511
02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:07.880
<v Speaker 5>Cause I know Shane Collins is giant </v>
<v Speaker 5>heavyweight UFC fighter.</v>

2512
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:09.220
<v Speaker 5>He's a former,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2513
02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:11.600
<v Speaker 5>UFC interim heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a gorilla.</v>

2514
02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:13.850
<v Speaker 5>And so his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's the first person he called.</v>

2515
02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:16.100
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if someone tears through your </v>
<v Speaker 5>house,</v>

2516
02:02:16.101 --> 02:02:18.380
<v Speaker 5>Richard Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>refrigerated door off the wall,</v>

2517
02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:19.453
<v Speaker 5>this foot plate waste like they eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone just fucking hulked out in your </v>

2518
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:26.120
<v Speaker 5>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they call Shane up for is hey dude,</v>

2519
02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:29.840
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my cabin rip my refrigerator door off.</v>

2520
02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:32.120
<v Speaker 5>And then there was another one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true as well.</v>

2521
02:02:32.121 --> 02:02:35.240
<v Speaker 5>It's real where a bear got trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's car,</v>

2522
02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:37.700
<v Speaker 5>somehow know that the bear opened the </v>
<v Speaker 5>car door,</v>

2523
02:02:37.701 --> 02:02:39.890
<v Speaker 5>which they've been known to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you leave it open,</v>

2524
02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:40.953
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a bear trap in the back of that </v>

2525
02:02:42.411 --> 02:02:44.020
<v Speaker 5>fucking Subaru poor guy.</v>

2526
02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.310
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how long and he's in there for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a good question.</v>

2527
02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:48.050
<v Speaker 5>I think they were walking by and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>found them.</v>

2528
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:53.330
<v Speaker 5>So what a bear does is they know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured out over time that they can</v>

2529
02:02:53.331 --> 02:02:55.520
<v Speaker 5>open car doors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they open up a car door,</v>

2530
02:02:55.521 --> 02:02:57.710
<v Speaker 5>they watch someone open up a car door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll get another bear.</v>

2531
02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:01.280
<v Speaker 5>And then there's food in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it from then on there opening car</v>

2532
02:03:01.281 --> 02:03:04.190
<v Speaker 5>doors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So while when I was in boulder,</v>

2533
02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:07.520
<v Speaker 5>one of the people that lived in the town</v>
<v Speaker 5>over from where I lived,</v>

2534
02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:11.810
<v Speaker 5>got their car broken into and the bear </v>
<v Speaker 5>ate the inside of their car.</v>

2535
02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:14.420
<v Speaker 5>The bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean literally ate their seats.</v>

2536
02:03:14.450 --> 02:03:15.560
<v Speaker 5>Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their dashboard,</v>

2537
02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:18.670
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crazy sucks.</v>

2538
02:03:18.671 --> 02:03:21.320
<v Speaker 5>So this bear is trapped in this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>

2539
02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.273
<v Speaker 5>This is 100% legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you opens up the car door with his </v>

2540
02:03:24.141 --> 02:03:25.760
<v Speaker 5>paws,</v>
<v Speaker 5>climbs inside.</v>

2541
02:03:25.761 --> 02:03:26.594
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if a car is like at a kind of an </v>

2542
02:03:27.381 --> 02:03:28.690
<v Speaker 5>angle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the door will close itself.</v>

2543
02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:30.390
<v Speaker 5>Door closes itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2544
02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:35.600
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just stuck in his car.</v>

2545
02:03:38.571 --> 02:03:39.830
<v Speaker 5>Just mangling it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at it,</v>

2546
02:03:39.831 --> 02:03:41.630
<v Speaker 5>look at the chair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>torn apart.</v>

2547
02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:44.030
<v Speaker 5>Probably shitting all over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dashboard.</v>

2548
02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:45.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right here.</v>

2549
02:03:46.170 --> 02:03:47.003
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if their insurance coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if anybody's got a bow and </v>

2550
02:03:49.471 --> 02:03:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Arrow coming to make some bare sausage </v>
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>

2551
02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:55.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta let him out.</v>

2552
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:59.220
<v Speaker 3>I means that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoot an animal inside a car.</v>

2553
02:03:59.310 --> 02:04:00.360
<v Speaker 3>That's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chase.</v>

2554
02:04:00.450 --> 02:04:01.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2555
02:04:01.970 --> 02:04:02.803
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely let them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd be fucking pissed because this </v>

2556
02:04:04.291 --> 02:04:07.020
<v Speaker 3>car is just shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mangled.</v>

2557
02:04:07.410 --> 02:04:09.390
<v Speaker 3>You can open up your trunk with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2558
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:11.820
<v Speaker 3>a key and with some people does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they did,</v>

2559
02:04:11.850 --> 02:04:13.290
<v Speaker 3>did they open up the bag and let him </v>
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>

2560
02:04:14.670 --> 02:04:15.503
<v Speaker 3>What's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can the hatches open areas just ran </v>

2561
02:04:18.481 --> 02:04:22.920
<v Speaker 3>off and he's running off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a pretty decent sized bear yet.</v>

2562
02:04:23.130 --> 02:04:25.660
<v Speaker 3>What kind of damage did it do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty peaceful man.</v>

2563
02:04:25.661 --> 02:04:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Bears always seem like they run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to run for sure.</v>

2564
02:04:28.830 --> 02:04:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until they kill you.</v>

2565
02:04:30.210 --> 02:04:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

2566
02:04:31.261 --> 02:04:32.130
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's peaceful.</v>

2567
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:33.763
<v Speaker 3>It's peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know more people get killed by </v>

2568
02:04:35.191 --> 02:04:36.990
<v Speaker 3>black bears then by grizzlies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2569
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Did Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

2570
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:38.873
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grizzlies a lot of times the key by </v>

2571
02:04:40.051 --> 02:04:43.170

2572
02:04:43.171 --> 02:04:44.004

<v Speaker 5>Black bears apparently will actively </v>

2573
02:04:45.991 --> 02:04:48.270
<v Speaker 5>seek people sometimes when they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>really desperate.</v>

2574
02:04:48.330 --> 02:04:49.470
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So this guy's going down and then right </v>

2611
02:06:25.621 --> 02:06:27.750
<v Speaker 5>before he hits the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he flips.</v>

<v Speaker 5>on television.</v>

<v Speaker 2>therapist to get that out of your head.</v>

2647
02:08:07.661 --> 02:08:12.370
<v Speaker 2>You're going to wake up with the memory </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that guy's body just exploding like a</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking watermelon in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if the pressure of the situation,</v>

2649
02:08:16.961 --> 02:08:18.300
<v Speaker 2>the gravity of the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2650
02:08:18.301 --> 02:08:19.134
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline rush and the g force all </v>
<v Speaker 2>combined made him stroke out like that </v>

2651
02:08:24.251 --> 02:08:25.084
<v Speaker 2>Indian dude and he just never even </v>
<v Speaker 2>bothered steering and went right into </v>

2652

<v Speaker 2>the crowd.</v>

2653
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:30.743

<v Speaker 2>the ground and his skull went flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the air and hit you in the face </v>

<v Speaker 2>You got your head crushed from his </v>

2658
02:08:53.051 --> 02:08:54.130
<v Speaker 2>forehead.</v>

2659
02:08:54.131 --> 02:08:57.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get like amputated.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like you like,</v>

2662
02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:02.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone is in a car accident and </v>

2663
02:09:04.050 --> 02:09:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you go into a temporary when he come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2664
02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:09.280
<v Speaker 2>you shit yourself for the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and people ask why?</v>

2665
02:09:09.281 --> 02:09:12.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like a skydiver skull smashed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2666
02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Terrible man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dude.</v>

2667
02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:18.640
<v Speaker 2>High impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Avoid that.</v>

2668
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:21.130
<v Speaker 2>What high impact?</v>
<v Speaker 2>High impact.</v>

2669
02:09:21.131 --> 02:09:21.964
<v Speaker 2>Avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't jump out of those planes into </v>

2670
02:09:24.101 --> 02:09:24.610
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>

2671
02:09:24.610 --> 02:09:25.443
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to get fucking cte from </v>

2672
02:09:28.031 --> 02:09:30.550
<v Speaker 2>net falling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that becomes a new thing.</v>

2673
02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:33.400
<v Speaker 2>What's what kind of cte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chronic traumatic,</v>

2674
02:09:33.401 --> 02:09:35.510
<v Speaker 2>chronic traumatic encephalopathy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2675
02:09:36.190 --> 02:09:38.560
<v Speaker 2>So brain damaged the football players </v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

2676
02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:39.603
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine the jolt of going from </v>
<v Speaker 2>space into a fucking net is </v>

2677
02:09:42.551 --> 02:09:43.750
<v Speaker 2>considerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2678
02:09:43.751 --> 02:09:44.321
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2679
02:09:44.321 --> 02:09:45.154
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that that has an impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your fucking don't easy on your </v>

2680
02:09:47.501 --> 02:09:50.140
<v Speaker 2>fucking body to fall out of a plane in </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2681
02:09:50.141 --> 02:09:52.840
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2682
02:09:52.841 --> 02:09:53.674
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of like fucked up like sports </v>

2683
02:09:56.441 --> 02:09:59.350
<v Speaker 2>accidents and I know you get sick of </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the UFC,</v>

2684
02:09:59.351 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 2>but dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking clip of,</v>

2685
02:10:03.071 --> 02:10:04.270
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyborg.</v>

2686
02:10:04.271 --> 02:10:05.104
<v Speaker 2>What's the guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy that when I bought Santos is a </v>

2687
02:10:10.181 --> 02:10:11.014
<v Speaker 2>bunch of cyborgs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a two male cyborgs and one </v>

2688
02:10:13.421 --> 02:10:14.560
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it makes sense.</v>

2689
02:10:14.561 --> 02:10:18.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a cool word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking man,</v>

2690
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:22.520
<v Speaker 2>that thing he did the knee kick flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>knee kick smashed.</v>

2691
02:10:22.530 --> 02:10:24.010
<v Speaker 2>The guys handled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever say knee kick.</v>

2692
02:10:24.011 --> 02:10:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd he say?</v>

2693
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a knee flying knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see a knee kick.</v>

2694
02:10:27.311 --> 02:10:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to my voice.</v>

2695
02:10:29.561 --> 02:10:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Do I sound like I know a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>USC,</v>

2696
02:10:31.810 --> 02:10:33.760
<v Speaker 2>a little Moitai back in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2697
02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:34.030
<v Speaker 2>my</v>

2698
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:36.490
<v Speaker 4>trainer taught me some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

2699
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:40.180
<v Speaker 4>the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it possible,</v>

2700
02:10:40.210 --> 02:10:41.043
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>k basketball people are getting better </v>

2701
02:10:42.071 --> 02:10:43.140
<v Speaker 4>at basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2702
02:10:43.690 --> 02:10:45.880
<v Speaker 4>Skateboarding people are getting better </v>
<v Speaker 4>at skateboarding.</v>

2703
02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:47.253
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible that in the UFC people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to become so proficient at </v>

2704
02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:56.850
<v Speaker 4>beating each other up that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there will be more of this type of awful</v>

2705
02:10:58.661 --> 02:11:03.661
<v Speaker 4>accident happening where people just </v>
<v Speaker 4>learn how to be powerful enough to crush</v>

2706
02:11:03.941 --> 02:11:07.090
<v Speaker 4>a person's skull where you just get </v>
<v Speaker 4>better at it,</v>

2707
02:11:07.091 --> 02:11:09.010
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you look at like,</v>

2708
02:11:09.370 --> 02:11:11.900
<v Speaker 4>and it's not a fair comparison because </v>
<v Speaker 4>this Pa skateboard you,</v>

2709
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:12.783
<v Speaker 4>it requires a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you look at like early </v>

2710
02:11:14.681 --> 02:11:19.300
<v Speaker 4>skateboarding videos to now and see how </v>
<v Speaker 4>much it's evolved and you know,</v>

2711
02:11:19.301 --> 02:11:20.134
<v Speaker 4>the UFC has the market pressure for </v>
<v Speaker 4>these fighters to be the best ever </v>

2712
02:11:23.771 --> 02:11:27.550
<v Speaker 4>because they become like world renowned </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters and they make a lot of money.</v>

2713
02:11:27.670 --> 02:11:32.670
<v Speaker 4>So the pressure is there to evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at UFC 100 years from now,</v>

2714
02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:34.413
<v Speaker 4>isn't it possible that fighters are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get so good that it is no </v>

2715
02:11:38.081 --> 02:11:38.914
<v Speaker 4>longer safe to do the UFC because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to be strong enough </v>

2716
02:11:43.481 --> 02:11:47.680
<v Speaker 4>to break someone's skull open with their</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking fists or with their knees?</v>

2717
02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:48.881
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me answer that.</v>

2718
02:11:48.881 --> 02:11:49.714
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a very unusual scenario where a </v>

2719
02:11:52.571 --> 02:11:53.404
<v Speaker 5>guy was diving forward and the other guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>was jumping forward with the name and </v>

2720
02:11:56.861 --> 02:11:59.630
<v Speaker 5>they combined in a perfect collision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2721
02:11:59.670 --> 02:12:03.250
<v Speaker 5>It's very unusual to happen that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's happened before though.</v>

2722
02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:04.600
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2723
02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:07.450
<v Speaker 5>it does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can happen.</v>

2724
02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:11.110
<v Speaker 5>But that was the most extreme version of</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever seen in my life.</v>

2725
02:12:11.530 --> 02:12:13.600
<v Speaker 5>And all my years of watching martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts,</v>

2726
02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:16.690
<v Speaker 5>watching martial arts training and </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts,</v>

2727
02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:17.733
<v Speaker 5>seeing fights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many fights I've seen </v>

2728
02:12:19.450 --> 02:12:22.540
<v Speaker 5>live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's gotta be more than a thousand.</v>

2729
02:12:22.630 --> 02:12:23.490
<v Speaker 5>It's probably what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2730
02:12:23.590 --> 02:12:25.930
<v Speaker 5>It's probably like 1500 or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that live.</v>

2731
02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:28.240
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen it once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only watched it once on TV.</v>

2732
02:12:28.630 --> 02:12:29.463
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2733
02:12:29.470 --> 02:12:31.270
<v Speaker 5>guys have definitely gotten their nose </v>
<v Speaker 5>broken though.</v>

2734
02:12:31.271 --> 02:12:33.040
<v Speaker 5>And they've definitely gotten their </v>
<v Speaker 5>orbits broken.</v>

2735
02:12:33.130 --> 02:12:34.750
<v Speaker 5>The orbit broken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>orbital,</v>

2736
02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.150
<v Speaker 5>orbital a bone is super common.</v>

2737
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:39.130
<v Speaker 5>That's real common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That happens all the time.</v>

2738
02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 5>That happens like once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean in the,</v>

2739
02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:44.020
<v Speaker 5>in that sense of calm and more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe even more than that.</v>

2740
02:12:44.021 --> 02:12:46.000
<v Speaker 5>We don't hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're small fractures,</v>

2741
02:12:46.001 --> 02:12:46.834
<v Speaker 5>but like Misha tate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the former women's bantamweight </v>

2742
02:12:48.731 --> 02:12:49.564
<v Speaker 5>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she got her orbital bone broken in a </v>

2743
02:12:50.411 --> 02:12:51.760
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2744
02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:53.133
<v Speaker 5>Bob psats ha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had Bob Sapp had his orbital bone </v>

2745
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:56.210
<v Speaker 5>broken in by cro cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2746
02:12:56.211 --> 02:12:58.660
<v Speaker 5>I can name a bunch of them were guys who</v>
<v Speaker 5>have gotten their orbital broken.</v>

2747
02:12:58.661 --> 02:13:00.640
<v Speaker 5>It's really common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2748
02:13:00.641 --> 02:13:01.840
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's your face.</v>

2749
02:13:01.841 --> 02:13:02.780
<v Speaker 5>You're getting your face broke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

2750
02:13:02.781 --> 02:13:05.980
<v Speaker 5>this is just a different version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was such an extreme impact.</v>

2751
02:13:06.010 --> 02:13:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Michael Venom page,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy who did it is a,</v>

2752
02:13:09.011 --> 02:13:12.670
<v Speaker 5>a sport karate champion and a really </v>
<v Speaker 5>dynamic guy.</v>

2753
02:13:12.850 --> 02:13:16.750
<v Speaker 5>He's so fucking fast and his technique </v>
<v Speaker 5>is so good.</v>

2754
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:18.550
<v Speaker 5>His timing is so good.</v>

2755
02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:23.700
<v Speaker 5>He's a lifelong martial artists who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>competing as a point karate guy.</v>

2756
02:13:23.831 --> 02:13:24.664
<v Speaker 5>And then he went from being a point </v>
<v Speaker 5>karate guy to fighting and mma and he </v>

2757
02:13:27.431 --> 02:13:28.264
<v Speaker 5>can hit guys in this crazy way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dives in and hits them and they can't </v>

2758
02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:32.580
<v Speaker 5>him back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when they were running at him,</v>

2759
02:13:32.581 --> 02:13:35.160
<v Speaker 5>he counters them brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what he did in this fight.</v>

2760
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:38.850
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg who's talented guy who has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>around a long time,</v>

2761
02:13:38.851 --> 02:13:41.310
<v Speaker 5>he's really experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's fought in strikeforce.</v>

2762
02:13:41.311 --> 02:13:44.640
<v Speaker 5>He fought in the UFC and the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like he did.</v>

2763
02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:47.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm almost positive he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2764
02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.380
<v Speaker 5>Google that though please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause I know he fought in strikeforce.</v>

2765
02:13:49.381 --> 02:13:50.214
<v Speaker 5>He had an epic fight with Nick Diaz and </v>
<v Speaker 5>strike force and Jordan Meehan and </v>

2766
02:13:53.450 --> 02:13:56.790
<v Speaker 5>strike force epic epic fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's a real veteran.</v>

2767
02:13:57.210 --> 02:13:58.043
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have this happen to him is even more </v>

2768
02:14:00.181 --> 02:14:02.100
<v Speaker 5>impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just shows you how good this page kid</v>

2769
02:14:02.101 --> 02:14:02.790
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

2770
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:05.280
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so unusual the way it happened.</v>

2771
02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:06.203
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen it like that before </v>
<v Speaker 5>where a guy just charged in and the </v>

2772
02:14:08.611 --> 02:14:12.150
<v Speaker 5>other guy didn't hit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just hit him with the need put jumped at</v>

2773
02:14:12.151 --> 02:14:12.984
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you'd have to have Michael Venom </v>

2774
02:14:13.981 --> 02:14:15.680
<v Speaker 5>pages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>athleticism,</v>

2775
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:17.940
<v Speaker 5>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience,</v>

2776
02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:20.790
<v Speaker 5>lifelong martial artist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect timing.</v>

2777
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:21.743
<v Speaker 5>And then also fight intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he had the intelligence to choose </v>

2778
02:14:25.111 --> 02:14:27.360
<v Speaker 5>that weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has a full arsenal of techniques.</v>

2779
02:14:27.361 --> 02:14:30.270
<v Speaker 5>He knew that that would be the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>effective blow to land in that moment.</v>

2780
02:14:30.330 --> 02:14:31.163
<v Speaker 5>So all his lifelong experience of </v>
<v Speaker 5>competing as a martial artist led to </v>

2781
02:14:34.351 --> 02:14:35.184
<v Speaker 5>that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was a perfect storm for cyborgs </v>

2782
02:14:36.810 --> 02:14:37.643
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The wrong the wrong thing at the wrong </v>

2783
02:14:40.051 --> 02:14:40.884
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it can always happen just like Dale </v>

2784
02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:45.870
<v Speaker 5>earnhardt junior or senior died in a car</v>
<v Speaker 5>accident.</v>

2785
02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:48.310
<v Speaker 5>It can happen like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2786
02:14:48.330 --> 02:14:51.540
<v Speaker 5>even the great ones can get really badly</v>
<v Speaker 5>hurt.</v>

2787
02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:54.240
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you could see it like,</v>

2788
02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:55.733
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you've seen it over those 1500 </v>

2789
02:14:57.091 --> 02:14:57.924
<v Speaker 5>fights you've seen having,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you seen an evolution in the fighting </v>

2790
02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:03.150
<v Speaker 5>styles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on both sides.</v>

2791
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:05.950
<v Speaker 5>The other thing is I've seen an </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution in people's defense too,</v>

2792
02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:08.670
<v Speaker 5>but there's guys like mighty mouse who </v>
<v Speaker 5>like barely get hit,</v>

2793
02:15:09.170 --> 02:15:09.541
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2794
02:15:09.541 --> 02:15:11.190
<v Speaker 5>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's beating guys up,</v>

2795
02:15:11.191 --> 02:15:12.024
<v Speaker 5>but occasionally you'll get a guy who is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like an elite guy and another guy is an </v>

2796
02:15:15.121 --> 02:15:16.670
<v Speaker 5>elite guy and always cancel each other </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2797
02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:17.513
<v Speaker 5>People get mad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people get mad because it's not an of </v>

2798
02:15:18.781 --> 02:15:22.620
<v Speaker 5>action cause they're both two smart and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they kind of like canceling each other.</v>

2799
02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:24.600
<v Speaker 5>That does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That happens in fights.</v>

2800
02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:27.780
<v Speaker 5>So I just think that everybody is </v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely getting better,</v>

2801
02:15:27.781 --> 02:15:29.490
<v Speaker 5>but their defense is getting better as </v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

2802
02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:30.593
<v Speaker 5>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a sport where it's so chaotic and </v>

2803
02:15:33.421 --> 02:15:34.254
<v Speaker 5>anyone can win by knockout if they </v>
<v Speaker 5>connect and everyone is so fast and </v>

2804
02:15:37.501 --> 02:15:42.501
<v Speaker 5>everyone has so much technique that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best guys can knock out the best guys.</v>

2805
02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:44.490
<v Speaker 5>We saw it this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt Brown,</v>

2806
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:47.550
<v Speaker 5>who is like one of the top UFC </v>
<v Speaker 5>welterweight in the world,</v>

2807
02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:48.473
<v Speaker 5>he's a fucking animal savage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of my favorite fighters ever fought </v>

2808
02:15:50.701 --> 02:15:52.440
<v Speaker 5>this kid named Jake ellenberger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2809
02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:55.320
<v Speaker 5>Jake ellenberger is a very talented </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

2810
02:15:55.321 --> 02:15:58.650
<v Speaker 5>had ups and downs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's lost a bunch of fights recently</v>

2811
02:15:58.651 --> 02:16:01.860
<v Speaker 5>to top level guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this was his last chance in the UFC.</v>

2812
02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:04.110
<v Speaker 5>They gave him a last chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>

2813
02:16:04.130 --> 02:16:05.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were gonna cut him and he said,</v>

2814
02:16:05.401 --> 02:16:06.690
<v Speaker 5>just give me one more fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they said,</v>

2815
02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:08.300
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to give you matt Brown who's</v>

2816
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:09.780
<v Speaker 5>a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

2817
02:16:09.781 --> 02:16:12.450
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he went in and knocked out Matt Brown</v>

2818
02:16:12.451 --> 02:16:14.820
<v Speaker 5>the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was crazy.</v>

2819
02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:16.073
<v Speaker 5>It was a crazy chaos filled fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He blasted him with a right hand and </v>

2820
02:16:19.891 --> 02:16:22.080
<v Speaker 5>kicked him the body with a liver kick </v>
<v Speaker 5>and put them away.</v>

2821
02:16:22.410 --> 02:16:25.770
<v Speaker 5>It was an madness fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even Matt Brown was even coming back</v>

2822
02:16:25.771 --> 02:16:27.210
<v Speaker 5>after getting hit with the first big </v>
<v Speaker 5>punch.</v>

2823
02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:30.490
<v Speaker 5>But my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on any given night,</v>

2824
02:16:30.730 --> 02:16:34.380
<v Speaker 5>one of these guys connect and they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>knock out the other guy.</v>

2825
02:16:34.450 --> 02:16:35.283
<v Speaker 5>They can both do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt Brown easily could've knocked out </v>

2826
02:16:37.031 --> 02:16:41.170
<v Speaker 5>ellenberger right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Easily could have connected sales.</v>

2827
02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:42.113
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's possible for all these guys to </v>

2828
02:16:45.071 --> 02:16:49.090
<v Speaker 5>knock each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a nutty sport man.</v>

2829
02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:51.580
<v Speaker 5>So they're definitely getting better at </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2830
02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:52.803
<v Speaker 5>but they're all getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's harder to hit him clean and </v>

2831
02:16:55.241 --> 02:16:57.010
<v Speaker 5>they're better at delivering shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2832
02:16:57.011 --> 02:16:57.844
<v Speaker 5>if one person gets better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then everyone's going to adapt to come </v>

2833
02:17:01.121 --> 02:17:03.340
<v Speaker 5>up with some defense for whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is.</v>

2834
02:17:03.341 --> 02:17:05.050
<v Speaker 5>That person's gotten better at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

2835
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:06.063
<v Speaker 5>But he did learn the techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they learn the techniques and they </v>

2836
02:17:07.511 --> 02:17:08.860
<v Speaker 5>understand when the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they're coming.</v>

2837
02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:10.780
<v Speaker 5>But if you had to predict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if someone's,</v>

2838
02:17:10.781 --> 02:17:11.614
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you had to predict five years from </v>

2839
02:17:13.571 --> 02:17:15.850
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of,</v>

2840
02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:19.060
<v Speaker 5>if you've seen a kind of evolution in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that fighting styles,</v>

2841
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:20.103
<v Speaker 5>then you've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've seen an something that maybe you </v>

2842
02:17:22.451 --> 02:17:25.330
<v Speaker 5>can prognosticate in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you,</v>

2843
02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:26.800
<v Speaker 5>what do you think it's going to look </v>
<v Speaker 5>like?</v>

2844
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:27.783
<v Speaker 5>How will it be different?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How will the UFC change over time if </v>

2845
02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:35.110
<v Speaker 5>mixed martial arts is an evolving sport?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2846
02:17:35.111 --> 02:17:40.111
<v Speaker 5>we already know pretty much I would say </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always room for new stuff.</v>

2847
02:17:41.141 --> 02:17:42.970
<v Speaker 5>It's always possible the new stuff comes</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2848
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:44.103
<v Speaker 5>But I would comfortably say we know at </v>
<v Speaker 5>least 95% of all the striking options </v>

2849
02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:49.353
<v Speaker 5>were pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty well versed in what a person can </v>

2850
02:17:51.431 --> 02:17:53.740
<v Speaker 5>do with their bones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm being real conservative.</v>

2851
02:17:53.741 --> 02:17:54.574
<v Speaker 5>When I say 95% is probably closer to 99%</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every now and then someone will do </v>

2852
02:17:57.941 --> 02:17:59.170
<v Speaker 5>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this guy,</v>

2853
02:17:59.171 --> 02:18:00.004
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the name of the </v>

2854
02:18:00.011 --> 02:18:00.844
<v Speaker 5>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just knock some guy out with an ax </v>

2855
02:18:02.081 --> 02:18:02.914
<v Speaker 5>kick the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And somebody sent it to me and I was </v>

2856
02:18:04.451 --> 02:18:05.140
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

2857
02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:07.150
<v Speaker 5>see if he could find that ax kick Kayo </v>
<v Speaker 5>and mma.</v>

2858
02:18:07.151 --> 02:18:10.060
<v Speaker 5>It's real recent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the first time I've seen that in</v>

2859
02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:11.620
<v Speaker 5>a televised MMA bow.</v>

2860
02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:13.780
<v Speaker 5>But I saw it a gang and times and </v>
<v Speaker 5>taekwondo tournament.</v>

2861
02:18:13.781 --> 02:18:14.614
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2862
02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:17.530
<v Speaker 5>I've witnessed it firsthand with a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>good friend of mine.</v>

2863
02:18:17.531 --> 02:18:19.510
<v Speaker 5>He got knocked out horribly by an ax </v>
<v Speaker 5>kick.</v>

2864
02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.300
<v Speaker 5>So I know that accidents are real </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous for guys good at them,</v>

2865
02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:23.193
<v Speaker 5>but you have to have elite flexibility </v>
<v Speaker 5>and speed and you have to know how to </v>

2866
02:18:25.481 --> 02:18:26.680
<v Speaker 5>land it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2867
02:18:26.681 --> 02:18:29.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that was a new one that up until this</v>

2868
02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:30.783
<v Speaker 5>year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody knocked anybody </v>

2869
02:18:32.231 --> 02:18:35.470
<v Speaker 5>out with one before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a guy named Adlon Ama golf who</v>

2870
02:18:35.471 --> 02:18:38.650
<v Speaker 5>was fighting in strikeforce and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>fought in the UFC for a little bit,</v>

2871
02:18:38.651 --> 02:18:40.570
<v Speaker 5>but he got real religious and he decided</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2872
02:18:40.740 --> 02:18:43.510
<v Speaker 5>to quit fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think he might've fuck somebody up</v>

2873
02:18:43.511 --> 02:18:45.730
<v Speaker 5>with an ax kick wants he had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had nasty,</v>

2874
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.863
<v Speaker 5>nasty kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the point is that might've been the </v>

2875
02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:50.254
<v Speaker 5>last of the Mohicans as far as like new </v>
<v Speaker 5>techniques that you're going to see </v>

2876
02:18:52.841 --> 02:18:53.674
<v Speaker 5>people do.</v>

2877
02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:55.960
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Round kicks,</v>

2878
02:18:55.961 --> 02:18:57.040
<v Speaker 5>sidekicks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>front kicks,</v>

2879
02:18:57.060 --> 02:18:59.410
<v Speaker 5>we already seen all those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We already know they exist.</v>

2880
02:18:59.890 --> 02:19:02.500
<v Speaker 5>So that's pretty much covered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's really getting,</v>

2881
02:19:02.710 --> 02:19:03.543
<v Speaker 5>what people are getting better at is </v>
<v Speaker 5>their ability to deliver those </v>

2882
02:19:06.911 --> 02:19:07.744
<v Speaker 5>techniques in a fluid form that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>imperceptive both for the person's </v>

2883
02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:15.190
<v Speaker 5>trying to anticipate the movements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like when someone is attacking you,</v>

2884
02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:19.120
<v Speaker 5>what it's like is say if you were a </v>
<v Speaker 5>really dumb guy and you were in a debate</v>

2885
02:19:19.121 --> 02:19:19.954
<v Speaker 5>about Chris with Christopher hitchens </v>
<v Speaker 5>about something that you really </v>

2886
02:19:22.210 --> 02:19:23.043
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't have been debating for about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you don't really don't know the </v>

2887
02:19:25.031 --> 02:19:27.070
<v Speaker 5>subject very well when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2888
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 5>And he just starts with</v>

2889
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.903
<v Speaker 3>is he's clinking his whiskey glass </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and touching it with his fingers </v>

2890
02:19:32.061 --> 02:19:35.300
<v Speaker 3>and just demolish his you on on real </v>
<v Speaker 3>time with Bill Maher.</v>

2891
02:19:35.350 --> 02:19:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2892
02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:36.531
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mean,</v>

2893
02:19:36.531 --> 02:19:38.360
<v Speaker 3>like Christopher hitchens could do to </v>
<v Speaker 3>any of it.</v>

2894
02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:40.740
<v Speaker 4>So fun to watch him do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too.</v>

2895
02:19:40.970 --> 02:19:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Terrifying because you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2896
02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:43.923
<v Speaker 3>what if it was me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if I got up there and talk about </v>

2897
02:19:45.111 --> 02:19:45.861
<v Speaker 3>the Iraq war?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2898
02:19:45.861 --> 02:19:47.350
<v Speaker 3>you know what the fuck I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2899
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:48.523
<v Speaker 3>He is buried me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see when he buried most </v>

2900
02:19:50.331 --> 02:19:51.800
<v Speaker 3>def?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2901
02:19:51.801 --> 02:19:52.634
<v Speaker 3>he hurried them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most def was asking questions about al </v>

2902
02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Qaeda and the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know the different in al Qaeda</v>

2903
02:19:58.101 --> 02:19:59.570
<v Speaker 3>and the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't either.</v>

2904
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:01.690
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most def,</v>

2905
02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:02.593
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking about it and Christopher </v>

2906
02:20:04.430 --> 02:20:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Hitchens to society was annoying and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just does distressed him.</v>

2907
02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Just undressed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely trust him downs at the word.</v>

2908
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:12.330
<v Speaker 3>How's like depression.</v>

2909
02:20:12.330 --> 02:20:17.330
<v Speaker 4>I would almost rather get dragged off by</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tiger and have hitchins destroy me.</v>

2910
02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:19.350
<v Speaker 4>Fuck him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill.</v>

2911
02:20:20.390 --> 02:20:23.640
<v Speaker 4>You're so ruthless about become a monk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that happened,</v>

2912
02:20:23.641 --> 02:20:24.474
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2913
02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:27.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find a little monastery and</v>

2914
02:20:27.451 --> 02:20:30.600
<v Speaker 4>just shave my head and say goodbye to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the universe.</v>

2915
02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can destroy you,</v>

2916
02:20:32.930 --> 02:20:36.980
<v Speaker 3>but you almost feel like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're letting you off the hook.</v>

2917
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.963
<v Speaker 3>Like Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris destroys people in a very </v>

2918
02:20:40.041 --> 02:20:42.290
<v Speaker 3>calm way and he doesn't insult them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2919
02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:46.520
<v Speaker 3>But he does it very logically be lets </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that he thinks you're retarded.</v>

2920
02:20:46.930 --> 02:20:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't use those words,</v>

2921
02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:49.040
<v Speaker 3>but I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2922
02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:53.540
<v Speaker 3>but hitchins shows utter disdain for you</v>
<v Speaker 3>while he's scoring on it.</v>

2923
02:20:53.770 --> 02:20:55.810
<v Speaker 4>Harris seems like there's that hope </v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2924
02:20:55.811 --> 02:20:56.321
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2925
02:20:56.321 --> 02:20:58.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitchens is pissed.</v>

2926
02:20:58.480 --> 02:20:59.980
<v Speaker 4>Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels more like,</v>

2927
02:21:00.100 --> 02:21:03.580
<v Speaker 4>at least there's the hope that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to bring you to his side.</v>

2928
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:06.760
<v Speaker 4>There's something compassionate in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

2929
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:08.440
<v Speaker 4>Hitchins is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2930
02:21:08.441 --> 02:21:09.470
<v Speaker 4>hitchens is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2931
02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:11.650
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might as well,</v>

2932
02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:12.753
<v Speaker 4>you can be part of the genocide that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to have happen to idiots of the </v>

2933
02:21:16.331 --> 02:21:19.720
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a really a really intense thing</v>

2934
02:21:19.721 --> 02:21:20.554
<v Speaker 4>to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2935
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:23.770
<v Speaker 4>He must,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he must've just constantly read.</v>

2936
02:21:23.771 --> 02:21:28.771
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy must've just woken up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the morning and just started reading for</v>

2937
02:21:29.770 --> 02:21:30.581
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was definitely,</v>

2938
02:21:30.581 --> 02:21:30.730
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2939
02:21:30.730 --> 02:21:33.670
<v Speaker 3>definitely not just smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also well-read.</v>

2940
02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:34.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all,</v>

2941
02:21:34.271 --> 02:21:37.120
<v Speaker 3>we all know people that are very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't read that much.</v>

2942
02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was all the above smart,</v>

2943
02:21:39.401 --> 02:21:40.234
<v Speaker 3>well read and did a lot of debating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a lot of conversations with really </v>

2944
02:21:43.271 --> 02:21:45.460
<v Speaker 3>smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a big part of it as well.</v>

2945
02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:46.653
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're very lucky that we get to </v>

2946
02:21:48.581 --> 02:21:51.910
<v Speaker 3>listen to those because that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like having those conversations,</v>

2947
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:53.620
<v Speaker 3>not in the sense that you're saying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

2948
02:21:53.890 --> 02:21:56.730
<v Speaker 3>but being privy to a conversation with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like Hitchens,</v>

2949
02:21:56.731 --> 02:21:57.564
<v Speaker 3>like you see sitting there and talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Sam Harris or some a religious </v>

2950
02:22:00.401 --> 02:22:03.280
<v Speaker 3>leader or something like that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the logical points that he makes,</v>

2951
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:04.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2952
02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:05.273
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very enriching in a way that a </v>

2953
02:22:06.731 --> 02:22:08.290
<v Speaker 3>lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like school isn't even,</v>

2954
02:22:08.730 --> 02:22:09.563
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times your professor is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking incompetent cunt that got that </v>

2955
02:22:12.611 --> 02:22:14.880
<v Speaker 3>job because he sucked the right decks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now he's got tenure.</v>

2956
02:22:15.070 --> 02:22:16.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those shitty repressors</v>

2957
02:22:16.821 --> 02:22:17.654
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2958
02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did a lot of those,</v>

2959
02:22:18.921 --> 02:22:21.320
<v Speaker 4>there's a hitchens video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the one where he talks about</v>

2960
02:22:21.321 --> 02:22:25.300
<v Speaker 4>what a monster Saddam Hussein wise and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you see now and oh yeah,</v>

2961
02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:27.270
<v Speaker 4>his genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2962
02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:28.820
<v Speaker 5>and he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2963
02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:30.360
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was all my arm monster though.</v>

2964
02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Saddam Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was our monster.</v>

2965
02:22:32.371 --> 02:22:33.500
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2966
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:34.530
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we helped that guy,</v>

2967
02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:35.933
<v Speaker 5>but his sons are even scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They ever read some of the things that </v>

2968
02:22:38.161 --> 02:22:40.080
<v Speaker 5>his sons did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember.</v>

2969
02:22:40.081 --> 02:22:40.914
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his sons were like Ramsay Bolton from </v>

2970
02:22:41.971 --> 02:22:43.560
<v Speaker 5>the game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for real,</v>

2971
02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:47.520
<v Speaker 5>they fed women to dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would take a woman,</v>

2972
02:22:47.550 --> 02:22:49.950
<v Speaker 5>they would take her from her bridal </v>
<v Speaker 5>party,</v>

2973
02:22:50.250 --> 02:22:51.083
<v Speaker 5>raper killer husband or throw her </v>
<v Speaker 5>husband in jail raper and then feed her </v>

2974
02:22:55.351 --> 02:22:59.160
<v Speaker 5>to their dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they did this more than once.</v>

2975
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:02.460
<v Speaker 5>God Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2976
02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:04.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well this is what we're talking about.</v>

2977
02:23:04.441 --> 02:23:06.300
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about like North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>

2978
02:23:06.330 --> 02:23:08.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't there.</v>

2979
02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:13.200
<v Speaker 5>This is what I heard and this is what he</v>
<v Speaker 5>could read it online.</v>

2980
02:23:13.201 --> 02:23:16.530
<v Speaker 5>That's what everybody has said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty much agreed that he did it.</v>

2981
02:23:16.531 --> 02:23:18.660
<v Speaker 5>But I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I was criticizing you earlier,</v>

2982
02:23:18.661 --> 02:23:21.660
<v Speaker 5>I totally could be completely wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this guy,</v>

2983
02:23:21.661 --> 02:23:22.494
<v Speaker 5>if they did do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure they did or something </v>

2984
02:23:23.911 --> 02:23:25.440
<v Speaker 5>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't do awesome stuff.</v>

2985
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:27.270
<v Speaker 5>That was not that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2986
02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:30.740
<v Speaker 4>We did some awesome stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2987
02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:33.120
<v Speaker 4>like I bet it wasn't all feed and girls.</v>

2988
02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:34.013
<v Speaker 5>The dog was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet they were complete total </v>

2989
02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:39.030
<v Speaker 5>sociopaths and psychopaths from the womb</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2990
02:23:39.031 --> 02:23:39.864
<v Speaker 5>Dad was a murderer is dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He raised them and I bet he raised them </v>

2991
02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:44.580
<v Speaker 5>to be fucking monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2992
02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:46.590
<v Speaker 5>you're ready to romance book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who did,</v>

2993
02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:48.360
<v Speaker 5>how many sane jerk off to it?</v>

2994
02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:50.750
<v Speaker 4>I haven't read it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're releasing it soon.</v>

2995
02:23:50.751 --> 02:23:53.050
<v Speaker 4>Look at it and shit like there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote like a real,</v>

2996
02:23:53.051 --> 02:23:55.970
<v Speaker 4>a romantic piece of fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2997
02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:57.013
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that Hussein or bolt or </v>

2998
02:23:59.331 --> 02:24:02.440
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck is weird day Coosa </v>
<v Speaker 4>Uday and Qusay work.</v>

2999
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:07.870
<v Speaker 4>But it is so fucking terrible when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that even the worst people still</v>

3000
02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:13.603
<v Speaker 4>have something good about them did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're isn't a complete monster out </v>

3001
02:24:17.991 --> 02:24:18.501
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3002
02:24:18.501 --> 02:24:20.750
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely complete monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So happened for sure.</v>

3003
02:24:20.810 --> 02:24:23.720
<v Speaker 4>I think that inside you don't think Ed </v>
<v Speaker 4>gain,</v>

3004
02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:28.790
<v Speaker 4>the guy used to make lampshades at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>women's skin do serial killer.</v>

3005
02:24:28.791 --> 02:24:29.624
<v Speaker 4>I think the monster is part of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>human being is that no matter how </v>

3006
02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:39.560
<v Speaker 4>fucking awful you are and no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible,</v>

3007
02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:43.310
<v Speaker 4>now this could be completely naive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's exceptions,</v>

3008
02:24:43.311 --> 02:24:46.490
<v Speaker 4>but mostly no matter how fucking off who</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

3009
02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:51.860
<v Speaker 4>some little piece of you inside of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>glimmering way down there underneath all</v>

3010
02:24:51.861 --> 02:24:52.694
<v Speaker 4>the fucking violence and murder knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have the potential to be kind </v>

3011
02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:02.150
<v Speaker 4>and it tortures you and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside every single person.</v>

3012
02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:05.990
<v Speaker 4>You can feel it in you all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter how good or how bad you are.</v>

3013
02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:08.990
<v Speaker 4>There's always that like you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>help.</v>

3014
02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:12.980
<v Speaker 4>There's always something in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even fucking Dahmer,</v>

3015
02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:16.250
<v Speaker 4>even the worst of the worst man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in there.</v>

3016
02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:18.260
<v Speaker 4>There it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in every single person.</v>

3017
02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:23.380
<v Speaker 4>It's what I think it's what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the more separate you get from it,</v>

3018
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.320
<v Speaker 2>the more you start doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3019
02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:27.483
<v Speaker 2>he would get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts with like not putting your </v>

3020
02:25:29.441 --> 02:25:31.440
<v Speaker 2>fucking shopping cart away at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store.</v>

3021
02:25:31.470 --> 02:25:33.640
<v Speaker 2>The problem was we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't broken.</v>

3022
02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:34.873
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that through whatever </v>

3023
02:25:36.311 --> 02:25:37.900
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through nature or nurture,</v>

3024
02:25:38.170 --> 02:25:39.003
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have fuses broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like there's people that are born </v>

3025
02:25:40.661 --> 02:25:42.490
<v Speaker 2>with leukemia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like some people have cancer,</v>

3026
02:25:42.491 --> 02:25:43.324
<v Speaker 2>just like some people have epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like some people are born with </v>

3027
02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:46.633
<v Speaker 2>disfigured arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people's brains are fucking wired </v>

3028
02:25:49.691 --> 02:25:50.524
<v Speaker 2>wrong from the jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong biologically </v>

3029
02:25:52.991 --> 02:25:53.950
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3030
02:25:53.951 --> 02:25:54.610
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3031
02:25:54.610 --> 02:25:55.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

3032
02:25:55.031 --> 02:25:56.080
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't we assume?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3033
02:25:56.081 --> 02:25:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree that there are people,</v>

3034
02:25:58.451 --> 02:25:59.950
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brains aren't working,</v>

3035
02:26:00.130 --> 02:26:02.140
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think we're just our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3036
02:26:02.141 --> 02:26:03.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so either,</v>

3037
02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:04.660
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's what I'm saying.</v>

3038
02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not an either or.</v>

3039
02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:07.113
<v Speaker 2>It's not a nature or nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably all kinds of stuff going </v>

3040
02:26:09.611 --> 02:26:10.780
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3041
02:26:10.781 --> 02:26:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some people are most likely born</v>

3042
02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:15.130
<v Speaker 2>with defective minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3043
02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:15.993
<v Speaker 2>We all agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was definitely people that have </v>

3044
02:26:17.430 --> 02:26:18.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged,</v>

3045
02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:20.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning disabilities,</v>

3046
02:26:20.111 --> 02:26:20.944
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of issues and a dyslexia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all sort of things that were </v>

3047
02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:24.333
<v Speaker 2>absolutely aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's got to be for sure some </v>

3048
02:26:28.181 --> 02:26:29.014
<v Speaker 2>shit that would lead a person to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand when they're causing other </v>

3049
02:26:31.001 --> 02:26:33.580
<v Speaker 2>people harm or not care or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like it,</v>

3050
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:36.040
<v Speaker 2>this is what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it sociopath?</v>

3051
02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

3052
02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I like to believe that because okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

3053
02:26:41.021 --> 02:26:43.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an infinite never ending argument.</v>

3054
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Some people believe humans are meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots.</v>

3055
02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Self awareness comes from the sum total </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all these different processes running</v>

3056
02:26:53.111 --> 02:26:53.944
<v Speaker 2>at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now we have this awareness of this </v>

3057
02:26:56.271 --> 02:26:57.850
<v Speaker 2>south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that may be.</v>

3058
02:26:58.210 --> 02:27:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Some people think that there is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite never ending undying pixel that</v>

3059
02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:11.220
<v Speaker 2>is grow that a human has grown around </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and I think goes on forever.</v>

3060
02:27:11.771 --> 02:27:16.660
<v Speaker 2>And that thing is I'm made of love or </v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word,</v>

3061
02:27:16.690 --> 02:27:18.720
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3062
02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:21.610
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is,</v>

3063
02:27:21.850 --> 02:27:23.680
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to believe this idea,</v>

3064
02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:27.970
<v Speaker 2>as crazy as it may sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone can be redeemed.</v>

3065
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Redemption is possible for all humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>living today.</v>

3066
02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:33.243
<v Speaker 2>There is a way to stop your forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum and the direction of </v>

3067
02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:37.333
<v Speaker 2>selfishness and start moving in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction of being a little bit less of </v>

3068
02:27:41.081 --> 02:27:41.914
<v Speaker 2>a fucking prick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe maybe people that have the </v>

3069
02:27:44.381 --> 02:27:45.214
<v Speaker 2>inclination or they have the potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a psychopath if they were raised </v>

3070
02:27:49.391 --> 02:27:54.220
<v Speaker 2>by kind and loving people would develop </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of behavior that are consistent</v>

3071
02:27:54.221 --> 02:27:56.410
<v Speaker 2>with civilization and with harmony and </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

3072
02:27:56.650 --> 02:27:57.483
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe what you get when you get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopath is the combination of really </v>

3073
02:28:01.271 --> 02:28:03.160
<v Speaker 2>shitty upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child abuse,</v>

3074
02:28:03.370 --> 02:28:06.720
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of awful verbal and emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that happens.</v>

3075
02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:10.150
<v Speaker 2>People in physical shit that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the young and these traits.</v>

3076
02:28:10.210 --> 02:28:11.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also maybe maybe some of those </v>

3077
02:28:12.821 --> 02:28:16.930
<v Speaker 2>traits are triggered by genes expressing</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and time of great duress.</v>

3078
02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:17.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the things that I was </v>

3079
02:28:18.121 --> 02:28:20.260
<v Speaker 2>talking about that I forgot earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started on it,</v>

3080
02:28:20.261 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 2>but I never finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was talking about the</v>

3081
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:25.280
<v Speaker 5>people that came over on these boats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're their gut biome.</v>

3082
02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:26.353
<v Speaker 5>If we're talking about someone who is on</v>
<v Speaker 5>a boat for 60 days eating fucking beef </v>

3083
02:28:31.101 --> 02:28:33.530
<v Speaker 5>jerky and they come over here with </v>
<v Speaker 5>scurvy,</v>

3084
02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:36.680
<v Speaker 5>they're desperate.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

3101
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:17.930
<v Speaker 5>this is all what we know happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3102
02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:19.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're starving,</v>

3103
02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:22.580
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if you really are a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

3104
02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:24.200
<v Speaker 5>Like when you hear about people like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3105
02:29:24.201 --> 02:29:25.600
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that came over on the,</v>

3106
02:29:25.601 --> 02:29:26.434
<v Speaker 5>the pass in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Donner party won a beat and each </v>

3107
02:29:29.421 --> 02:29:30.254
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause they fucking froze to death out </v>

3108
02:29:31.881 --> 02:29:32.714
<v Speaker 5>there and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't know what to do and there </v>

3109
02:29:33.891 --> 02:29:35.660
<v Speaker 5>was no foods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just started hating each other.</v>

3110
02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:37.033
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the switch that goes off like w </v>

3111
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:41.810
<v Speaker 5>who are you when that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you even the same person,</v>

3112
02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:43.520
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you really are,</v>

3113
02:29:43.521 --> 02:29:48.050
<v Speaker 5>if your personality consists of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>ecosystem that we call your body,</v>

3114
02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:51.830
<v Speaker 5>which we know for a fact has all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 5>of different stuff that's going on.</v>

3115
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:55.340
<v Speaker 5>There's different stuff on your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's different stuff in your body,</v>

3116
02:29:55.640 --> 02:30:00.640
<v Speaker 5>there's all sorts of different bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it coexists with you and even exist</v>

3117
02:30:00.801 --> 02:30:02.270
<v Speaker 5>in a symbiotic way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3118
02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:05.510
<v Speaker 5>Like you need all these things inside </v>
<v Speaker 5>your body to consume the food.</v>

3119
02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:07.460
<v Speaker 5>Like it's part of your digestive system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3120
02:30:07.461 --> 02:30:10.550
<v Speaker 5>He Kolai is a natural part of the human </v>
<v Speaker 5>digestive tract,</v>

3121
02:30:10.551 --> 02:30:11.384
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all in there.</v>

3122
02:30:12.430 --> 02:30:13.370
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

3123
02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.620
<v Speaker 5>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're starving,</v>

3124
02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:18.890
<v Speaker 5>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will you like some crazy wolf person?</v>

3125
02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:20.300
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does a person like?</v>

3126
02:30:20.301 --> 02:30:21.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are they,</v>

3127
02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:21.853
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how scary is someone when they're a day </v>

3128
02:30:24.141 --> 02:30:26.420
<v Speaker 5>from starving to death and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>knife?</v>

3129
02:30:27.570 --> 02:30:28.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3130
02:30:28.140 --> 02:30:32.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is the question of freewill </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus no free.</v>

3131
02:30:32.401 --> 02:30:33.234
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying if you get in a stressful </v>

3132
02:30:34.831 --> 02:30:35.664
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does some kind of mechanism of the </v>

3133
02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:44.100
<v Speaker 4>swarms of organisms that make up </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself kick in where you no longer are</v>

3134
02:30:44.101 --> 02:30:46.350
<v Speaker 4>capable of making decisions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3135
02:30:46.351 --> 02:30:48.750
<v Speaker 4>do you even you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you absolutely.</v>

3136
02:30:48.751 --> 02:30:51.900
<v Speaker 4>I it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it ever goes away.</v>

3137
02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:57.140
<v Speaker 4>And I think that you always have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird autonomy that the universal try to</v>

3138
02:30:59.431 --> 02:31:04.170
<v Speaker 4>trick you into thinking isn't there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then suddenly you become a,</v>

3139
02:31:04.171 --> 02:31:06.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now of course though,</v>

3140
02:31:06.270 --> 02:31:08.010
<v Speaker 4>I think if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3141
02:31:08.370 --> 02:31:09.203
<v Speaker 4>judicial system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a form of murder where you </v>

3142
02:31:12.241 --> 02:31:13.074
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a temporary insanity is what they call </v>

3143
02:31:15.271 --> 02:31:15.601
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3144
02:31:15.601 --> 02:31:16.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3145
02:31:16.830 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like people who have lost</v>

3146
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:22.050
<v Speaker 10>their fucking mind and stabbed someone </v>
<v Speaker 10>to death,</v>

3147
02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:24.750
<v Speaker 10>they prove that in court.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And then in that case,</v>

3148
02:31:24.751 --> 02:31:25.584
<v Speaker 10>you don't even go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You've killed someone because you a </v>

3149
02:31:27.370 --> 02:31:31.080
<v Speaker 10>temporarily fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But I don't know man.</v>

3150
02:31:31.081 --> 02:31:36.030
<v Speaker 10>I think that mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 10>mostly if you really watch yourself,</v>

3151
02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:39.390
<v Speaker 10>you realize that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're pretty much in control man.</v>

3152
02:31:39.391 --> 02:31:44.130
<v Speaker 10>Like your,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when I watch myself when I'm about to be</v>

3153
02:31:44.131 --> 02:31:44.964
<v Speaker 10>an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like if I'm about to do something cause </v>

3154
02:31:46.531 --> 02:31:47.364
<v Speaker 10>I'm hangry as they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're talking about the ultimate </v>

3155
02:31:49.561 --> 02:31:50.394
<v Speaker 10>version of hangry,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is where your result to </v>

3156
02:31:51.751 --> 02:31:53.340
<v Speaker 10>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 10>hungry and tired,</v>

3157
02:31:53.650 --> 02:31:54.570
<v Speaker 10>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 10>hangry,</v>

3158
02:31:54.600 --> 02:31:56.430
<v Speaker 10>hungry and angry.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Hungry and angry.</v>

3159
02:31:56.580 --> 02:31:57.750
<v Speaker 10>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3160
02:31:57.780 --> 02:32:02.720
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's a good tired that's hired but,</v>

3161
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:07.950
<v Speaker 10>but that's higher than a shitty job but,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but uh,</v>

3162
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.903
<v Speaker 10>so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but if you look at yourself even in </v>

3163
02:32:10.231 --> 02:32:11.064
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you're having like by a chemical </v>

3164

<v Speaker 10>something nasty to somebody usual or do </v>

<v Speaker 3>Do I just shit all just open my ass hole</v>

3173
02:32:29.481 --> 02:32:30.690
<v Speaker 10>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And then you do it,</v>

3174
02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:32.100
<v Speaker 10>then you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You say,</v>

3175
02:32:32.101 --> 02:32:33.830
<v Speaker 10>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to fucking spray.</v>

3176
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:37.540
<v Speaker 10>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's just like coming to,</v>

3177
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:39.950
<v Speaker 10>it was just like coming,</v>
<v Speaker 10>cause it's like when you're about to see</v>

3178
02:32:39.980 --> 02:32:43.070
<v Speaker 10>if you want this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you watch yourself about to have an</v>

3179
02:32:43.071 --> 02:32:43.940
<v Speaker 10>orgasm,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

3180
02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:46.850
<v Speaker 10>And you watch it build and build and </v>
<v Speaker 10>build and build,</v>

3181
02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:47.833
<v Speaker 10>and eventually it gets to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 10>you're going to decide to come or you </v>

3182
02:32:50.481 --> 02:32:52.910
<v Speaker 10>can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It may be and you're gonna fucking come,</v>

3183
02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:55.460
<v Speaker 10>but you can watch it build and build and</v>
<v Speaker 10>build.</v>

3184
02:32:55.461 --> 02:32:56.294
<v Speaker 10>But then when you come,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the orgasm is like a mild seizure of </v>

3185
02:32:58.851 --> 02:33:01.130
<v Speaker 10>joy.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Your body goes through these like,</v>

3186
02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:02.753
<v Speaker 10>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's a coal by though your entire </v>

3187
02:33:05.601 --> 02:33:06.950
<v Speaker 10>body as a reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

3188
02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:09.620
<v Speaker 10>So in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you start getting angry,</v>

3189
02:33:10.430 --> 02:33:12.560
<v Speaker 10>it's just like when you're fucking about</v>
<v Speaker 10>to come,</v>

3190
02:33:12.561 --> 02:33:14.420
<v Speaker 10>it's building and building and building.</v>

3191
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:15.650
<v Speaker 10>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know what?</v>

3192
02:33:16.850 --> 02:33:20.240
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to fucking tell this person </v>
<v Speaker 10>how I really fucking feel to day.</v>

3193
02:33:20.420 --> 02:33:25.420
<v Speaker 10>But you're angry and then woof,</v>
<v Speaker 10>all this weird seizure shit happens.</v>

3194
02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:28.550
<v Speaker 10>Stuff comes out of your mouth that you </v>
<v Speaker 10>don't even mean.</v>

3195
02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:30.890
<v Speaker 10>It's like half real half.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Not Real.</v>

3196
02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:32.780
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but you decide,</v>

3197
02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:33.853
<v Speaker 10>you decide when to squeeze the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's not something that you don't have </v>

3198
02:33:38.271 --> 02:33:40.790
<v Speaker 10>control of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>at least mostly.</v>

3199
02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:46.360
<v Speaker 10>And people who fool themselves into </v>
<v Speaker 10>thinking that they don't have control,</v>

3200
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:47.623
<v Speaker 10>those are the ones who I think relegate </v>
<v Speaker 10>themselves into the world of being some </v>

3201
02:33:52.041 --> 02:33:55.930
<v Speaker 10>kind of machine,</v>
<v Speaker 10>some kind of like victimy machine.</v>

3202
02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:56.930
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right.</v>

3203
02:33:56.930 --> 02:33:57.763
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not really the free will </v>

3204
02:33:58.881 --> 02:33:59.481
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3205
02:33:59.481 --> 02:34:01.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the full free provable argument,</v>

3206
02:34:01.251 --> 02:34:03.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know some freewill arguments.</v>

3207
02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I get the most compelling one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That determinism one w what's compelling</v>

3208
02:34:06.921 --> 02:34:10.850
<v Speaker 3>about it is that it doesn't exonerate </v>
<v Speaker 3>you from your decisions,</v>

3209
02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:11.923
<v Speaker 3>but what it does say is essentially to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that you are somehow another </v>

3210
02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 3>separate from the influence of</v>

3211
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:18.813
<v Speaker 5>your life and that the influence of your</v>
<v Speaker 5>life hasn't in some way influenced the </v>

3212
02:34:23.411 --> 02:34:28.411
<v Speaker 5>way you decide to act and behave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that a lot of those factors that led</v>

3213
02:34:28.631 --> 02:34:31.540
<v Speaker 5>you influencing the way you act and </v>
<v Speaker 5>behave,</v>

3214
02:34:31.541 --> 02:34:32.480
<v Speaker 5>what led to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3215
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:33.423
<v Speaker 5>changing the way you act to behave are </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely out of your control and I'm </v>

3216
02:34:36.491 --> 02:34:37.324
<v Speaker 5>almost unavoidable in their impact and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that these things shape you in some in </v>

3217
02:34:43.141 --> 02:34:46.900
<v Speaker 5>measurable way that you'll never be </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely autonomous from.</v>

3218
02:34:47.140 --> 02:34:47.973
<v Speaker 5>You'll never be able to completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>separate yourself from the influence of </v>

3219
02:34:50.021 --> 02:34:50.854
<v Speaker 5>your genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of your life experiences of your </v>

3220
02:34:52.541 --> 02:34:53.374
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of your mom or your dad or your </v>

3221
02:34:54.041 --> 02:34:54.874
<v Speaker 5>upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Dell velop mental period where you </v>

3222
02:34:57.041 --> 02:34:57.874
<v Speaker 5>may or may not have been ignored or </v>
<v Speaker 5>abused or all those factors play a part </v>

3223
02:35:01.301 --> 02:35:02.134
<v Speaker 5>in how you decide to behave and even how</v>
<v Speaker 5>you decide to deal with how you decide </v>

3224
02:35:06.441 --> 02:35:10.150
<v Speaker 5>to behave your own therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you decided,</v>

3225
02:35:10.151 --> 02:35:10.984
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm tired of jizzing all over people </v>

3226
02:35:12.101 --> 02:35:14.980
<v Speaker 5>with my asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time I buy temperature boils up,</v>

3227
02:35:14.981 --> 02:35:15.814
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to not come home from a </v>

3228
02:35:18.221 --> 02:35:20.650
<v Speaker 5>hard day's work at the factory and beat </v>
<v Speaker 5>my wife.</v>

3229
02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:21.933
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even that is potentially determined by </v>

3230
02:35:24.881 --> 02:35:25.714
<v Speaker 5>your past and not really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you having free will decide not to be a </v>

3231
02:35:28.421 --> 02:35:28.950
<v Speaker 5>piece of shit.</v>

3232
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:29.783
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3233
02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:31.150
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

3234
02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:32.273
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

3235
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:34.790
<v Speaker 5>not my theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a,</v>

3236
02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:35.633
<v Speaker 5>this is more of a shitty explanation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what some people have argued and Harris </v>

3237
02:35:40.521 --> 02:35:44.480
<v Speaker 5>argued it on the podcast or I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>say he's argued it.</v>

3238
02:35:44.481 --> 02:35:45.260
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3239
02:35:45.260 --> 02:35:48.730
<v Speaker 5>I would say that he explained it in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very interesting way.</v>

3240
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:49.623
<v Speaker 5>It's compelling and you have to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it and take it into consideration </v>

3241
02:35:51.681 --> 02:35:53.240
<v Speaker 5>when you use terms like free will.</v>

3242
02:35:53.290 --> 02:35:54.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

3243
02:35:54.490 --> 02:35:55.323
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it gets down to this point of </v>

3244
02:35:57.760 --> 02:35:59.020
<v Speaker 4>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3245
02:35:59.021 --> 02:36:02.800
<v Speaker 4>So when I look at like a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions that I make,</v>

3246
02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:05.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're spontaneous and they're not,</v>

3247
02:36:05.890 --> 02:36:10.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sitting around thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how am I gonna turn my steering wheel at</v>

3248
02:36:10.661 --> 02:36:11.494
<v Speaker 4>this moment as I'm on the interstate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What mild adjustments am I going to </v>

3249
02:36:14.291 --> 02:36:15.124
<v Speaker 4>make?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all just to kind of spontaneous </v>

3250
02:36:17.291 --> 02:36:20.350
<v Speaker 4>thing that seems to be part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>autopilot.</v>

3251
02:36:20.351 --> 02:36:25.090
<v Speaker 4>And I know a lot of people are running </v>
<v Speaker 4>on autopilot in most of what they do,</v>

3252
02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:28.360
<v Speaker 4>but I still don't think that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3253
02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:31.600
<v Speaker 4>it negates free will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>

3254
02:36:31.930 --> 02:36:36.930
<v Speaker 4>you could think of your life as a boat </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone's in a different shape boat</v>

3255
02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:40.450
<v Speaker 4>and the boat's been shaped by </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

3256
02:36:40.451 --> 02:36:42.580
<v Speaker 4>Genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender.</v>

3257
02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:45.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's from my envision.</v>

3258
02:36:45.310 --> 02:36:47.650
<v Speaker 4>What kind of boat them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of vote of Mayan?</v>

3259
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:48.663
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of boat?</v>

3260
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:54.220
<v Speaker 4>My boat has to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a fucking graying beard and one ball</v>

3261
02:36:54.221 --> 02:36:55.054
<v Speaker 4>brother.</v>

3262
02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:02.050
<v Speaker 4>He's tried to picture a fishing boat or </v>
<v Speaker 4>we in a cruise liner,</v>

3263
02:37:02.051 --> 02:37:05.320
<v Speaker 4>like let's just say it's a fucking for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people at ain't and cruise liner,</v>

3264
02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:06.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For a lot of people.</v>

3265
02:37:06.731 --> 02:37:07.564
<v Speaker 4>It's a raft that's built of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that they've decided to grab out </v>

3266
02:37:11.441 --> 02:37:12.274
<v Speaker 4>of the infinite world of phenomena and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammered together to some kind of </v>

3267
02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:17.143
<v Speaker 4>vessel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is their reality tunnel that </v>

3268
02:37:19.281 --> 02:37:22.430
<v Speaker 4>they're living in and they're navigating</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking raft.</v>

3269
02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:24.440
<v Speaker 4>And so sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people,</v>

3270
02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:25.393
<v Speaker 4>they might have a boat that is a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>more cumbersome and a little more </v>

3271
02:37:28.131 --> 02:37:33.131
<v Speaker 4>difficult to navigate through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>neverending string of decisions that you</v>

3272
02:37:33.171 --> 02:37:36.230
<v Speaker 4>have to make if you exist inside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3273
02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:40.430
<v Speaker 4>But still you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's parts of that boat,</v>

3274
02:37:40.431 --> 02:37:41.630
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3275
02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:44.510
<v Speaker 4>There's parts of your boat that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>revise.</v>

3276
02:37:44.511 --> 02:37:45.950
<v Speaker 4>You might not be able to change at all.</v>

3277
02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:49.100
<v Speaker 4>You're probably not gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>change your skin color.</v>

3278
02:37:49.101 --> 02:37:50.930
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be able to change </v>
<v Speaker 4>your yet.</v>

3279
02:37:51.170 --> 02:37:54.500
<v Speaker 4>People are certainly changing the gender</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their fucking boats.</v>

3280
02:37:54.501 --> 02:37:56.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are doing that right now.</v>

3281
02:37:56.331 --> 02:37:59.270
<v Speaker 4>And I think is technology continues to </v>
<v Speaker 4>advance.</v>

3282
02:37:59.750 --> 02:38:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to find that we're more like</v>

3283
02:38:01.581 --> 02:38:02.414
<v Speaker 4>crispr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to find we're more </v>

3284
02:38:03.471 --> 02:38:04.304
<v Speaker 4>and more able to like actually change </v>
<v Speaker 4>the structure of our boats according to </v>

3285
02:38:08.331 --> 02:38:09.164
<v Speaker 4>our desire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you really analyze what's going </v>

3286
02:38:12.171 --> 02:38:13.004
<v Speaker 4>on in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will see that you are actively </v>

3287
02:38:15.711 --> 02:38:16.544
<v Speaker 4>making decisions from moment to moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are [inaudible] and who's making </v>

3288
02:38:20.661 --> 02:38:21.740
<v Speaker 4>the decision?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3289
02:38:21.741 --> 02:38:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's where it gets weird,</v>

3290
02:38:23.391 --> 02:38:25.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to say it's your gut biome,</v>

3291
02:38:25.610 --> 02:38:29.810
<v Speaker 4>if you want to say it's the ind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>never ending series of decisions made by</v>

3292
02:38:29.811 --> 02:38:31.560
<v Speaker 4>never an extreme of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

3293
02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:35.170
<v Speaker 5>why does it have to be either or?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it all these things?</v>

3294
02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:36.093
<v Speaker 5>I mean that I think that's where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument gets really weird because I </v>

3295
02:38:37.841 --> 02:38:39.520
<v Speaker 5>think it's all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3296
02:38:39.730 --> 02:38:40.563
<v Speaker 5>it's life experiences and it's genetics </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's choices and it's consciousness </v>

3297
02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:45.633
<v Speaker 5>and it's the willful expression of </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive ideas and forcing them on your </v>

3298
02:38:50.471 --> 02:38:52.390
<v Speaker 5>life and what is the motivation behind </v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

3299
02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Is that your past?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it what you've learned?</v>

3300
02:38:54.761 --> 02:38:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Is it a fucking inspirational youtube </v>
<v Speaker 5>video you watched this afternoon?</v>

3301
02:38:57.810 --> 02:38:58.643
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who Cares?</v>

3302
02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:00.430
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a bunch of shit.</v>

3303
02:39:00.490 --> 02:39:02.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a bunch of shit going on all over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the place.</v>

3304
02:39:02.591 --> 02:39:03.424
<v Speaker 5>And I think the idea of separating that </v>
<v Speaker 5>is akin to the idea of separating us </v>

3305
02:39:08.111 --> 02:39:10.540
<v Speaker 5>from all of the life that's on this </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>

3306
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:14.500
<v Speaker 5>I think we've done a weird thing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>houses and clothes and cars.</v>

3307
02:39:14.770 --> 02:39:17.830
<v Speaker 5>We've done a weird thing where we're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>touching the world anymore.</v>

3308
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:21.460
<v Speaker 5>We're not touching it with our feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not touching it with our skin.</v>

3309
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:25.030
<v Speaker 5>We're allergic to a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't get anything on us.</v>

3310
02:39:25.090 --> 02:39:26.920
<v Speaker 5>We can't go anywhere near a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

3311
02:39:26.921 --> 02:39:29.410
<v Speaker 5>If they touch your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get hives there.</v>

3312
02:39:29.411 --> 02:39:33.580
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of stuff that we've done</v>
<v Speaker 5>in separating ourselves from the natural</v>

3313
02:39:33.581 --> 02:39:36.220
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's left us really fucking confused,</v>

3314
02:39:36.430 --> 02:39:37.263
<v Speaker 5>and I think one of those confusions lies</v>
<v Speaker 5>in when we've created civilizations and </v>

3315
02:39:40.781 --> 02:39:43.780
<v Speaker 5>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've lost our contact,</v>

3316
02:39:43.781 --> 02:39:47.050
<v Speaker 5>our physical contact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have a physical contact.</v>

3317
02:39:47.051 --> 02:39:47.884
<v Speaker 5>The physical contact in nature is all </v>
<v Speaker 5>playing through the bottom of your </v>

3318
02:39:50.201 --> 02:39:51.310
<v Speaker 5>boots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3319
02:39:51.311 --> 02:39:54.220
<v Speaker 5>you're breathing it in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still do occasionally touch it.</v>

3320
02:39:54.221 --> 02:39:55.054
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You occasionally brush up against a </v>

3321
02:39:55.841 --> 02:39:58.930
<v Speaker 5>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but whatever influence these things have</v>

3322
02:39:58.931 --> 02:39:59.764
<v Speaker 5>through each other and this insane </v>
<v Speaker 5>network interwoven root systems and </v>

3323
02:40:05.651 --> 02:40:06.484
<v Speaker 5>mycelium and fungus and rotting leaves </v>
<v Speaker 5>and animals all around you and all that </v>

3324
02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:16.200
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get through a filter now,</v>

3325
02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:18.300
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff you get through your car </v>
<v Speaker 5>window,</v>

3326
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:20.850
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff you get through your </v>
<v Speaker 5>clothes has share.</v>

3327
02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:21.913
<v Speaker 5>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not in contact with that stuff </v>

3328
02:40:22.921 --> 02:40:25.860
<v Speaker 5>anymore and by not being in contact with</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3329
02:40:25.861 --> 02:40:29.400
<v Speaker 5>you forget that it has a message.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you,</v>

3330
02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:31.560
<v Speaker 5>when you lay in the grass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just lay in the grudge,</v>

3331
02:40:31.561 --> 02:40:34.110
<v Speaker 5>just go somewhere and lay in the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels good.</v>

3332
02:40:34.650 --> 02:40:37.830
<v Speaker 5>It actually feels like the planet is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3333
02:40:37.950 --> 02:40:39.480
<v Speaker 5>like hug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're hugging someone.</v>

3334
02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:41.700
<v Speaker 5>When you hug someone it feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3335
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:44.220
<v Speaker 5>It feels good to lay in a nice long as </v>
<v Speaker 5>no bugs.</v>

3336
02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:45.653
<v Speaker 5>Conti fucking hands went crawl up your </v>
<v Speaker 5>ass holes good to temporary lane if you </v>

3337
02:40:48.901 --> 02:40:49.734
<v Speaker 5>don't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't lay down in a fire ant hive </v>

3338
02:40:51.450 --> 02:40:55.230
<v Speaker 5>and get fucked up by a bunch of bees or </v>
<v Speaker 5>bees by a bunch of bugs.</v>

3339
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:58.800
<v Speaker 5>But I think that if you go into nature </v>
<v Speaker 5>on a daily basis,</v>

3340
02:40:58.801 --> 02:40:59.634
<v Speaker 5>like there was something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I I read the other day that I tweeted </v>

3341
02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.560
<v Speaker 5>about them the some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget who the,</v>

3342
02:41:04.590 --> 02:41:05.423
<v Speaker 5>what the university was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were literally saying that </v>

3343
02:41:07.351 --> 02:41:12.210
<v Speaker 5>there is an argument that a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of nature is like a,</v>

3344
02:41:12.211 --> 02:41:14.010
<v Speaker 5>like a vitamin antidepressant.</v>

3345
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.863
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well like you get vitamin D from the </v>

3346
02:41:15.811 --> 02:41:16.500
<v Speaker 5>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3347
02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:17.333
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain amount of vitality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain amount of positive </v>

3348
02:41:22.410 --> 02:41:26.070
<v Speaker 5>like life force that you get from being </v>
<v Speaker 5>in nature.</v>

3349
02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:27.360
<v Speaker 5>Makes sense man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3350
02:41:27.361 --> 02:41:29.400
<v Speaker 5>I know that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever I go out,</v>

3351
02:41:29.430 --> 02:41:30.263
<v Speaker 5>I mean just like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like I got plants now that I have </v>

3352
02:41:32.581 --> 02:41:34.470
<v Speaker 5>to water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was another thing I was going to talk</v>

3353
02:41:34.471 --> 02:41:35.790
<v Speaker 5>to you about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I was going to ask you.</v>

3354
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:39.060
<v Speaker 5>Do you think if these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if these scientists are correct,</v>

3355
02:41:39.090 --> 02:41:43.260
<v Speaker 5>obviously they are about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>interconnection between plants and about</v>

3356
02:41:43.261 --> 02:41:47.220
<v Speaker 5>how they communicate with each other and</v>
<v Speaker 5>about how the even allocate resources to</v>

3357
02:41:47.221 --> 02:41:49.920
<v Speaker 5>those that are in need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it fucked up to keep plants?</v>

3358
02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:53.100
<v Speaker 5>Is it fucked up to keep something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you decide?</v>

3359
02:41:53.101 --> 02:41:54.360
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to leave in this box,</v>

3360
02:41:54.361 --> 02:41:55.194
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to live in this box right </v>

3361
02:41:56.311 --> 02:41:56.880
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

3362
02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:57.713
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's round.</v>

3363
02:41:57.750 --> 02:42:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Just keep looking for the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keeps spinning around.</v>

3364
02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:03.393
<v Speaker 5>You know you're not going to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 5>with anybody else because there isn't </v>

3365
02:42:04.831 --> 02:42:06.750
<v Speaker 5>anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just you.</v>

3366
02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:10.200
<v Speaker 5>It's just you lonely and fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting in this pot.</v>

3367
02:42:10.470 --> 02:42:11.303
<v Speaker 5>Or can they communicate through the air?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they communicating through the air </v>

3368
02:42:13.411 --> 02:42:15.090
<v Speaker 5>and if it does it get through your </v>
<v Speaker 5>windows?</v>

3369
02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:16.830
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got 7,000</v>

3370
02:42:16.831 --> 02:42:18.210
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to feel bad about it.</v>

3371
02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:20.940
<v Speaker 5>The form of fucking house plants land </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3372
02:42:21.930 --> 02:42:24.390
<v Speaker 5>But should you have plants in your house</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a pot?</v>

3373
02:42:24.690 --> 02:42:26.100
<v Speaker 5>Should they all be outside?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3374
02:42:26.101 --> 02:42:28.620
<v Speaker 5>if they're outside with their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no problem.</v>

3375
02:42:28.621 --> 02:42:29.930
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're outside you,</v>

3376
02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:30.773
<v Speaker 5>you got a yard and you dig a hole and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you put your plants in there and you </v>

3377
02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.480
<v Speaker 5>water it and it's gross and it's a part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the whole system.</v>

3378
02:42:36.570 --> 02:42:37.950
<v Speaker 5>That's like a dog with a yard.</v>

3379
02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:38.993
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got a German shepherd and you keep </v>

3380
02:42:40.111 --> 02:42:42.180
<v Speaker 5>him in a fucking little con tiny </v>
<v Speaker 5>kitchen.</v>

3381
02:42:42.300 --> 02:42:45.060
<v Speaker 5>Do you haven't got him pinned in there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever do the thing where you start</v>

3382
02:42:45.061 --> 02:42:48.930
<v Speaker 5>thinking about how funny the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside and outside is?</v>

3383
02:42:49.290 --> 02:42:51.780
<v Speaker 5>You ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still funny cause it's like,</v>

3384
02:42:51.810 --> 02:42:55.860
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my house I'm now inside.</v>

3385
02:42:56.220 --> 02:42:59.640
<v Speaker 5>Even though there's just like a layer of</v>
<v Speaker 5>wood around me,</v>

3386
02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:02.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm in some other place that's different</v>
<v Speaker 5>than the outside.</v>

3387
02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.500
<v Speaker 5>Even though you know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're really,</v>

3388
02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:07.920
<v Speaker 5>there is no such thing as 10 side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do you one better.</v>

3389
02:43:08.340 --> 02:43:09.480
<v Speaker 5>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how about this?</v>

3390
02:43:09.540 --> 02:43:12.400
<v Speaker 5>How about the phrase the great outdoors?</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

3391
02:43:12.460 --> 02:43:16.150
<v Speaker 5>What you mean reality?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mean the earth itself?</v>

3392
02:43:16.151 --> 02:43:20.920
<v Speaker 5>Like it is odd to be an enthusiast of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world itself.</v>

3393
02:43:21.490 --> 02:43:22.323
<v Speaker 5>We spend so much time in these </v>
<v Speaker 5>artificially created environments with </v>

3394
02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:29.860
<v Speaker 5>air conditioning and neon light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it neon?</v>

3395
02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:33.190
<v Speaker 5>Depends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lcd Lights these days.</v>

3396
02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:35.890
<v Speaker 5>I think this is not lcd though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fluorescent,</v>

3397
02:43:35.891 --> 02:43:36.790
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm looking for.</v>

3398
02:43:36.850 --> 02:43:40.360
<v Speaker 5>Neon neons like cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3399
02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:42.293
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but these artificial environments that </v>

3400
02:43:43.801 --> 02:43:44.634
<v Speaker 5>we create,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're in them way more than we are the </v>

3401
02:43:46.871 --> 02:43:49.390
<v Speaker 5>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when we're actually in the outdoors,</v>

3402
02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:51.310
<v Speaker 5>we can call ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm an outdoorsman.</v>

3403
02:43:51.950 --> 02:43:54.250
<v Speaker 5>What do you like to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to the great outdoors.</v>

3404
02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:55.510
<v Speaker 5>That's what I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

3405
02:43:55.530 --> 02:43:57.340
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to be in the great outdoors.</v>

3406
02:43:57.370 --> 02:43:59.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great outdoors is,</v>

3407
02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:04.500
<v Speaker 5>instead of saying the world nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a nature enthusia.</v>

3408
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:07.480
<v Speaker 10>I love nature in all its forms,</v>
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>

3409
02:44:07.481 --> 02:44:10.330
<v Speaker 10>including houses,</v>
<v Speaker 10>virtual reality,</v>

3410
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:12.940
<v Speaker 10>not,</v>
<v Speaker 10>not just being in a fucking house,</v>

3411
02:44:12.941 --> 02:44:16.570
<v Speaker 10>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but being inside another universe inside</v>

3412
02:44:16.571 --> 02:44:20.560
<v Speaker 10>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That is what I like and it's,</v>

3413
02:44:20.561 --> 02:44:23.560
<v Speaker 10>and also guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Because a lot of anti vr people,</v>

3414
02:44:23.561 --> 02:44:24.660
<v Speaker 10>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>whenever I got out,</v>

3415
02:44:25.030 --> 02:44:26.950
<v Speaker 10>y'all forget about outside.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

3416
02:44:27.130 --> 02:44:29.800
<v Speaker 10>I go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 10>enjoy the sun,</v>

3417
02:44:29.980 --> 02:44:34.980
<v Speaker 10>enjoy my shitty little garden with a </v>
<v Speaker 10>speaking of fucking cruelty to plants,</v>

3418
02:44:35.470 --> 02:44:40.210
<v Speaker 10>God forbid you become one of my plans.</v>
<v Speaker 10>God forbid,</v>

3419
02:44:40.510 --> 02:44:41.343
<v Speaker 10>may you never be one of my plants,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I still go out there and I try to </v>

3420
02:44:44.201 --> 02:44:45.490
<v Speaker 10>keep them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But man,</v>

3421
02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:50.880
<v Speaker 10>Vr is such a beautiful thing because it </v>
<v Speaker 10>creates that same,</v>

3422
02:44:53.290 --> 02:44:56.980
<v Speaker 10>almost the same sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know like when you go in a big space</v>

3423
02:44:57.070 --> 02:44:59.110
<v Speaker 10>and it feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know why,</v>

3424
02:44:59.230 --> 02:45:01.270
<v Speaker 10>but you aware it can be a shitty </v>
<v Speaker 10>warehouse,</v>

3425
02:45:01.271 --> 02:45:05.050
<v Speaker 10>but if it's big,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if you go into like an expansive plane,</v>

3426
02:45:05.210 --> 02:45:07.600
<v Speaker 10>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's why it was good.</v>

3427
02:45:07.850 --> 02:45:08.683
<v Speaker 5>I put a is up from the Vatican,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was in the Vatican last week or </v>

3428
02:45:11.091 --> 02:45:11.924
<v Speaker 5>two weeks ago and I went to St Peter's </v>
<v Speaker 5>basilica and I put a bunch of photos of </v>

3429
02:45:14.361 --> 02:45:16.340
<v Speaker 5>it on my instagram feed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you ever been to the Vatican,</v>

3430
02:45:16.580 --> 02:45:17.750
<v Speaker 5>not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to go.</v>

3431
02:45:17.900 --> 02:45:20.210
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is trippy psychedelic.</v>

3432
02:45:20.211 --> 02:45:22.520
<v Speaker 5>There's a giant pine cone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3433
02:45:22.521 --> 02:45:25.370
<v Speaker 5>They have this huge courtyard with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>huge pine cone,</v>

3434
02:45:25.371 --> 02:45:26.204
<v Speaker 5>which represents the pineal gland and </v>
<v Speaker 5>these two peacocks that represent </v>

3435
02:45:29.540 --> 02:45:31.130
<v Speaker 5>eternal life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He cocks.</v>

3436
02:45:31.131 --> 02:45:32.930
<v Speaker 5>Apparently that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took that photo.</v>

3437
02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:34.700
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3438
02:45:34.701 --> 02:45:35.534
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guide was super psyched when I knew </v>

3439
02:45:37.181 --> 02:45:40.610
<v Speaker 5>at the pine cone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>met his eyes lit up and I say represents</v>

3440
02:45:40.611 --> 02:45:41.690
<v Speaker 5>the pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3441
02:45:41.691 --> 02:45:42.860
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you know that?</v>

3442
02:45:43.130 --> 02:45:47.480
<v Speaker 5>And then we started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity and its potential routes in</v>

3443
02:45:47.481 --> 02:45:52.130
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic drugs and ancient Roman </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture and how,</v>

3444
02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:54.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the John Marco Allegro book,</v>

3445
02:45:54.351 --> 02:45:55.184
<v Speaker 5>the sacred mushroom and the scroll where</v>
<v Speaker 5>he thought that what Christianity was </v>

3446
02:45:58.371 --> 02:45:59.204
<v Speaker 5>initially was a bunch of stories where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they hid the psychedelic rituals in </v>

3447
02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:03.313
<v Speaker 5>parables and stories to hit it from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Romans because when they were being </v>

3448
02:46:06.741 --> 02:46:10.790
<v Speaker 5>conquered by the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't them to know how magical the</v>

3449
02:46:10.791 --> 02:46:11.624
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms were and they were a </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection to God and that the pineal </v>

3450
02:46:14.181 --> 02:46:15.014
<v Speaker 5>gland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I forget the actual chemical </v>

3451
02:46:17.391 --> 02:46:20.210
<v Speaker 5>composition of DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but or not the,</v>

3452
02:46:20.450 --> 02:46:21.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not dmt rather,</v>

3453
02:46:21.561 --> 02:46:22.394
<v Speaker 5>but mushrooms.</v>

3454
02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:26.330
<v Speaker 5>But what DMT is diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tryptamine is in some form.</v>

3455
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:30.650
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens to psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms when you taken psilocybin.</v>

3456
02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:33.440
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like for Fox,</v>

3457
02:46:33.441 --> 02:46:35.830
<v Speaker 5>for a [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I know I'm butchering it and,</v>

3458
02:46:35.831 --> 02:46:36.664
<v Speaker 5>and dimethyl trip to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's some version of </v>

3459
02:46:38.841 --> 02:46:43.841
<v Speaker 5>dimethyltryptamine is produced when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>consume psilocybin mushrooms.</v>

3460
02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:47.300
<v Speaker 5>So these guys knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they knew that.</v>

3461
02:46:47.301 --> 02:46:48.134
<v Speaker 5>And then it was a part of their art and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it represented that pineal gland is </v>

3462
02:46:51.681 --> 02:46:52.514
<v Speaker 5>giant fucking 15 foot tall pine cone </v>
<v Speaker 5>represented what they thought was the </v>

3463
02:46:58.131 --> 02:46:58.964
<v Speaker 5>seat of the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's sitting there and this </v>

3464
02:47:00.411 --> 02:47:01.244
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this gigantic tray being held up by </v>

3465
02:47:03.411 --> 02:47:07.010
<v Speaker 5>angels and Shit and whoever those saints</v>
<v Speaker 5>see to this sill.</v>

3466
02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:10.550
<v Speaker 5>See that's the fucking vr goggles for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the soul.</v>

3467
02:47:10.700 --> 02:47:11.533
<v Speaker 5>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the way we peer into this </v>

3468
02:47:13.281 --> 02:47:15.350
<v Speaker 5>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the St Peter's Basilica.</v>

3469
02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:18.920
<v Speaker 5>These photos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is from [inaudible] that they built</v>

3470
02:47:18.921 --> 02:47:22.730
<v Speaker 5>in the 16 hundreds with no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had no computers.</v>

3471
02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:26.240
<v Speaker 5>They had no power tools.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had no,</v>

3472
02:47:26.250 --> 02:47:28.040
<v Speaker 5>and there's photos on my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>

3473
02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:28.893
<v Speaker 5>So cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're seeing it right now in a picture </v>

3474
02:47:32.211 --> 02:47:34.100
<v Speaker 5>and I'm telling you it doesn't do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>justice.</v>

3475
02:47:34.101 --> 02:47:34.934
<v Speaker 5>This thing's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took hundreds of years to fully </v>

3476
02:47:37.341 --> 02:47:41.150
<v Speaker 5>complete and the size of it and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scale of it,</v>

3477
02:47:41.330 --> 02:47:43.430
<v Speaker 5>it's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's one photo that I put,</v>

3478
02:47:43.431 --> 02:47:44.264
<v Speaker 5>we can see the actual people in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>background look at the size of that </v>

3479
02:47:47.811 --> 02:47:48.644
<v Speaker 5>fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that is a small sliver of how big </v>

3480
02:47:51.081 --> 02:47:52.520
<v Speaker 5>the places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

3481
02:47:52.521 --> 02:47:56.000
<v Speaker 5>it's not doing it any justice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's perfect.</v>

3482
02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:59.090
<v Speaker 5>The artwork is staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3483
02:47:59.091 --> 02:47:59.924
<v Speaker 5>staff,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3486
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:06.740
<v Speaker 5>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a modern,</v>

3487
02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:07.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a modern,</v>

3488
02:48:07.641 --> 02:48:09.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an amazing work of art.</v>

3489
02:48:09.350 --> 02:48:12.590
<v Speaker 5>But it ain't shit compared to St Peter's</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basilica.</v>

3490
02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:15.620
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the all seeing eye to this is,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's the sunroof.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you now look at that,</v>

3494
02:48:21.381 --> 02:48:22.214
<v Speaker 5>that's definitely an eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of people in the eyeball and </v>

3495
02:48:23.741 --> 02:48:24.574
<v Speaker 5>there are angels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's angels got stuck in God's </v>

3496
02:48:27.231 --> 02:48:28.650
<v Speaker 5>eyeball.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Hercules that they buried in the second </v>
<v Speaker 5>century.</v>

3505
02:48:45.501 --> 02:48:48.770
<v Speaker 5>They build it in the second century d </v>
<v Speaker 5>but it got hit by lightning twice.</v>

<v Speaker 5>year</v>

3513
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:09.330
<v Speaker 3>old mosaic floor.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Pretty cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where they say they've got all </v>

3515
02:49:12.321 --> 02:49:16.280
<v Speaker 4>these like hidden manuscripts and shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that no one's ever going to see.</v>

3516
02:49:16.490 --> 02:49:18.950
<v Speaker 4>That's what you would initially </v>
<v Speaker 4>gravitate to.</v>

3517
02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Secrets the secrets.</v>

3518
02:49:21.290 --> 02:49:23.570
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Vatican's filled with secrets,</v>

3519
02:49:23.571 --> 02:49:24.670
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little boy's secrets.</v>

3520
02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:27.020
<v Speaker 4>David notches that lots of other shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

3521
02:49:27.021 --> 02:49:28.940
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been gathering information.</v>

3522
02:49:29.300 --> 02:49:30.111
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>

3523
02:49:30.111 --> 02:49:34.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've controlled so many world leaders</v>

3524
02:49:34.430 --> 02:49:35.263
<v Speaker 4>who have done confessions and you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the Vatican doesn't like when a </v>

3525
02:49:38.361 --> 02:49:41.870
<v Speaker 4>world leader gives a confession,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't write that shit down,</v>

3526
02:49:41.871 --> 02:49:42.704
<v Speaker 4>put it in the fucking lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably have confessions of some </v>

3527
02:49:44.961 --> 02:49:48.860
<v Speaker 4>of the greatest kings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew everything.</v>

3528
02:49:48.861 --> 02:49:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the priest class freaking me out.</v>

3529
02:49:52.030 --> 02:49:53.390
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're freaking me out.</v>

3530
02:49:53.391 --> 02:49:55.250
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope I am.</v>

3531
02:49:56.670 --> 02:50:00.590
<v Speaker 4>I man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fucking Vatican.</v>

3532
02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:02.210
<v Speaker 4>Think about what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That there are a country.</v>

3533
02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:04.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a country.</v>

3534
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:06.980
<v Speaker 4>It's a small country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a hundred acre country.</v>

3535
02:50:07.220 --> 02:50:10.700

02:52:02.170 --> 02:52:03.003
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said the seventh and I said the </v>

02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:07.353
<v Speaker 4>That reminds me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've already talked about </v>

3575
02:52:08.831 --> 02:52:12.220
<v Speaker 4>this in the podcast and it's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So go ahead and call me stupid if,</v>

3576
02:52:12.280 --> 02:52:13.113
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sorry if you already told </v>
<v Speaker 4>pre-claim things you know about the </v>

<v Speaker 4>baron,</v>

3578
02:52:17.050 --> 02:52:17.890
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3579
02:52:18.490 --> 02:52:19.323
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've probably got a million vice had a </v>

3580
02:52:22.301 --> 02:52:22.820
<v Speaker 4>whole lot</v>

3581
02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:23.990
<v Speaker 3>article about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

3582
02:52:24.650 --> 02:52:25.483
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't that much of a revelation </v>

3583
02:52:27.051 --> 02:52:27.884
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I read that when I was a </v>

3584
02:52:28.521 --> 02:52:31.070
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was more of a Dr Seuss turned kid.</v>

3585
02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understand that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody thought it was steam,</v>

3586
02:52:34.100 --> 02:52:35.690
<v Speaker 4>but it was what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

3587
02:52:35.810 --> 02:52:37.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely thought that.</v>

3588
02:52:37.330 --> 02:52:38.163
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that some people remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Nelson Mandela died in prison and </v>

3589
02:52:41.811 --> 02:52:45.370
<v Speaker 4>some people think he got out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the trippiest idea.</v>

3590
02:52:45.371 --> 02:52:46.204
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3591
02:52:46.580 --> 02:52:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Queen Song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are the champions.</v>

3592
02:52:48.560 --> 02:52:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Everybody think it ends with of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

3593
02:52:52.460 --> 02:52:55.910
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just ends and everybody tries to sing</v>

3594
02:52:55.940 --> 02:52:58.250
<v Speaker 3>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't end that way.</v>

3595
02:52:58.820 --> 02:52:59.653
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a funny thing that this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>does on youtube where he gets in a car </v>

3596
02:53:03.140 --> 02:53:04.970
<v Speaker 3>and he drives people around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they lip sync,</v>

3597
02:53:05.240 --> 02:53:06.073
<v Speaker 3>they sing along like Karaoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rather they sing along to songs and </v>

3598
02:53:08.721 --> 02:53:09.554
<v Speaker 3>they're singing along to the queen song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are the champions and it gets to the </v>

3599
02:53:11.871 --> 02:53:13.930
<v Speaker 3>end and it's George.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3600
02:53:13.970 --> 02:53:15.230
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The actor,</v>

3601
02:53:15.231 --> 02:53:19.370
<v Speaker 3>George Clooney and Julia Roberts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else.</v>

3602
02:53:19.610 --> 02:53:23.570
<v Speaker 3>I forget who the other person is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're singing along and it gets to the</v>

3603
02:53:23.571 --> 02:53:27.140
<v Speaker 3>end and they all want to say of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and it doesn't say that.</v>

3604
02:53:27.141 --> 02:53:28.190
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

3605
02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:31.010
<v Speaker 3>And they're all confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought it did too.</v>

3606
02:53:31.220 --> 02:53:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's a,</v>

3607
02:53:34.300 --> 02:53:38.000
<v Speaker 3>a line that we all collectively decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>was missing from that song.</v>

3608
02:53:38.690 --> 02:53:41.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a collective fuck up of memory </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

3609
02:53:41.541 --> 02:53:43.220
<v Speaker 3>traveler proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish we could play it,</v>

3610
02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:45.410
<v Speaker 3>but we can't play it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll yank is off youtube,</v>

3611
02:53:45.620 --> 02:53:46.453
<v Speaker 3>but find the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See just to see if you can find the </v>

3612
02:53:48.051 --> 02:53:51.830
<v Speaker 3>video so we could tell people what video</v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch because it's hilarious watching</v>

3613
02:53:51.831 --> 02:53:55.250
<v Speaker 3>George Clooney get to the end and want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>

3614
02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:56.233
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a bad motherfucker Freddie Mercury </v>

3615
02:54:04.161 --> 02:54:06.170
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever listened to queen every now and</v>

3616
02:54:06.171 --> 02:54:07.640
<v Speaker 3>again throwing some queen.</v>

3617
02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:09.610
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

3618
02:54:09.611 --> 02:54:13.000
<v Speaker 4>He was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was so Bohemian.</v>

3619
02:54:13.001 --> 02:54:15.400
<v Speaker 4>Rhapsody would play that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

3620
02:54:15.401 --> 02:54:16.370
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3621
02:54:16.410 --> 02:54:17.243
<v Speaker 4>what an amazing piece of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He seems like he was one of the most </v>

3622
02:54:22.541 --> 02:54:26.680
<v Speaker 4>disciplined people when it came to his </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

3623
02:54:26.681 --> 02:54:29.470
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he seems like somebody who is constantly</v>

3624
02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:33.100
<v Speaker 4>working on his voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a workaholic maybe.</v>

3625
02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:34.233
<v Speaker 4>Maybe for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievably talented and [inaudible] </v>

3626
02:54:36.380 --> 02:54:39.190
<v Speaker 4>and had an incredible knack for </v>
<v Speaker 4>expressing himself.</v>

3627
02:54:39.300 --> 02:54:41.400
<v Speaker 4>How she wasn't even at some NPR </v>
<v Speaker 4>interview with,</v>

3628
02:54:41.401 --> 02:54:42.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember.</v>

3629
02:54:42.351 --> 02:54:43.184
<v Speaker 4>She's a famous broadway singer and she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about what she does every day </v>

3630
02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:48.460
<v Speaker 4>and it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh to sing on Broadway.</v>

3631
02:54:48.490 --> 02:54:49.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

3632
02:54:49.841 --> 02:54:50.674
<v Speaker 4>it's like three hours of physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise a day mixed in with an hour of </v>

3633
02:54:56.051 --> 02:54:59.500
<v Speaker 4>meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Makes them with vocal exercises.</v>

3634
02:54:59.501 --> 02:55:00.334
<v Speaker 4>So it's like every single day she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing like an eight hour prep for this </v>

3635
02:55:04.881 --> 02:55:07.220
<v Speaker 4>shit that she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing when you</v>

3636
02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:09.440
<v Speaker 3>hear about people who are at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline.</v>

3637
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good for us.</v>

3638
02:55:10.970 --> 02:55:12.050
<v Speaker 3>We can't do that shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3642
02:55:21.471 --> 02:55:23.150
<v Speaker 3>We can't play it because it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

3643
02:55:23.151 --> 02:55:23.984
<v Speaker 3>It's just dumb singing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we can't do it because it's their </v>

3644
02:55:26.301 --> 02:55:28.970
<v Speaker 3>video yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's James Corden show.</v>

<v Speaker 3>late show he took over for Craig </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ferguson this past year,</v>

3647

<v Speaker 3>Here they go.</v>

3648
02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:42.290
<v Speaker 3>They get to the part at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3649
02:55:42.291 --> 02:55:44.210
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared.</v>

3650
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get yanked off youtube.</v>

3651
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:47.463
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a big thing that I tweeted </v>

3652
02:55:48.321 --> 02:55:51.380
<v Speaker 3>today where some guy was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>his audio book being on Youtube.</v>

3653
02:55:51.540 --> 02:55:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>

3654
02:55:52.310 --> 02:55:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people are,</v>

3655
02:55:53.430 --> 02:55:56.390
<v Speaker 3>this guy said that he sold 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>audio books,</v>

3656
02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:00.350
<v Speaker 3>but there was like 19,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>views or something like that on Youtube.</v>

3657
02:56:00.350 --> 02:56:01.730
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck?</v>

3658
02:56:01.731 --> 02:56:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a giant chunk of the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have listened to my book,</v>

3659
02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:07.430
<v Speaker 3>pirated it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3660
02:56:07.490 --> 02:56:08.301
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3661
02:56:08.301 --> 02:56:09.134
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how I make a living when I get </v>

3662
02:56:09.921 --> 02:56:12.320
<v Speaker 3>paid from this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because you know,</v>

3663
02:56:12.410 --> 02:56:15.560
<v Speaker 3>obviously youtube has them up and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3664
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:18.260
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone puts it up there and they didn't</v>

3665
02:56:18.261 --> 02:56:20.670
<v Speaker 3>get it down without a request.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Yep,</v>

3666
02:56:20.730 --> 02:56:22.940
<v Speaker 3>there's an algorithm that finds it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to find it.</v>

3667
02:56:23.090 --> 02:56:23.923
<v Speaker 3>So like it's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a lot of your bits or up there </v>

3668
02:56:25.881 --> 02:56:28.400
<v Speaker 3>somewhere where someone's put them up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they put them up on the channel.</v>

3669
02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:29.930
<v Speaker 3>You just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know.</v>

3670
02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:32.240
<v Speaker 3>You mean from the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from podcasts,</v>

3671
02:56:32.270 --> 02:56:33.550
<v Speaker 3>from staff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

3672
02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:36.650
<v Speaker 3>but imagine if you had a book and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>made all your money.</v>

3673
02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:37.633
<v Speaker 3>If you're an author or you make all your</v>
<v Speaker 3>money off the audio book or a big </v>

3674
02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:43.460
<v Speaker 3>percentage at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't they just claim 100 right?</v>

3675
02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Claim wonders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it off.</v>

3676
02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:49.250
<v Speaker 3>But those 19,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>views he doesn't get,</v>

3677
02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:51.320
<v Speaker 3>those are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3678
02:56:51.730 --> 02:56:55.840
<v Speaker 4>like how many of those 19,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>views would have translated into selling</v>

3679
02:56:55.841 --> 02:56:57.100
<v Speaker 4>an audio book?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that real</v>

3680
02:56:57.220 --> 02:56:58.880
<v Speaker 3>question is the real question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if any.</v>

3681
02:56:59.210 --> 02:57:00.880
<v Speaker 3>And here's the real question for </v>
<v Speaker 3>standups,</v>

3682
02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:01.773
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The always the question is when you are </v>

3683
02:57:03.471 --> 02:57:05.150
<v Speaker 3>bits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it on youtube,</v>

3684
02:57:05.151 --> 02:57:07.190
<v Speaker 3>like say if you do a comedy central </v>
<v Speaker 3>special in particular,</v>

3685
02:57:07.191 --> 02:57:09.230
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then your bits make it on youtube,</v>

3686
02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:13.070
<v Speaker 3>the more people pirate your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you'd call it pirating,</v>

3687
02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:14.780
<v Speaker 3>but more they take it and they put it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Youtube,</v>

3688
02:57:14.781 --> 02:57:16.820
<v Speaker 3>the more people are going to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more people are going to come to see</v>

3689
02:57:16.821 --> 02:57:17.654
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more it's going to be worth it to </v>

3690
02:57:19.551 --> 02:57:21.550
<v Speaker 3>you to do another comedy central spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3691
02:57:21.551 --> 02:57:22.384
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it becomes different for us because </v>

3692
02:57:24.231 --> 02:57:26.990
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of exist for the live shows,</v>

3693
02:57:26.991 --> 02:57:28.280
<v Speaker 3>like the live shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big,</v>

3694
02:57:28.490 --> 02:57:29.870
<v Speaker 3>big part of what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3695
02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:30.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And anything that'll get more people to </v>

3696
02:57:32.031 --> 02:57:33.830
<v Speaker 3>go to the live shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a better thing,</v>

3697
02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:35.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3698
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How it thinks how now for an author,</v>

3699
02:57:39.170 --> 02:57:40.490
<v Speaker 3>for that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3700
02:57:40.491 --> 02:57:42.260
<v Speaker 3>he feels like he got fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3701
02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:45.300
<v Speaker 4>well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't he saying that like Youtube,</v>

3702
02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:46.193
<v Speaker 4>like culpable here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like youtube is making money off of the </v>

3703
02:57:47.911 --> 02:57:48.744
<v Speaker 4>thing in some indirect way that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>acting like they're not like it is like </v>

3704
02:57:53.461 --> 02:57:57.060
<v Speaker 4>who's the person who is because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who uploaded it,</v>

3705
02:57:57.470 --> 02:57:59.970
<v Speaker 4>are they generating money from the thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>or are they,</v>

3706
02:57:59.971 --> 02:58:02.070
<v Speaker 4>did they just upload it because love it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good</v>

3707
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:03.330
<v Speaker 10>question.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>

3708
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.991
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

3709
02:58:03.991 --> 02:58:05.390
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's where it gets weird is it?</v>

3710
02:58:05.420 --> 02:58:07.560
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and I think in the article he was saying</v>

3711
02:58:07.561 --> 02:58:08.790
<v Speaker 10>how,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3712
02:58:08.791 --> 02:58:09.624
<v Speaker 10>with a lot of music now,</v>
<v Speaker 10>thank God when you upload it on your </v>

3713
02:58:11.821 --> 02:58:14.310
<v Speaker 10>Youtube Stream,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they just get a,</v>

3714
02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:17.020
<v Speaker 10>they just get the profits from whatever </v>
<v Speaker 10>you're advertising.</v>

3715
02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:20.250
<v Speaker 10>And that's way better than what it used </v>
<v Speaker 10>to be.</v>

3716
02:58:20.251 --> 02:58:22.050
<v Speaker 10>They just need,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they need to upgrade the system.</v>

3717
02:58:22.051 --> 02:58:27.051
<v Speaker 10>So this guy gets the same deal he has </v>
<v Speaker 10>with audible anytime somebody listens to</v>

3718
02:58:27.121 --> 02:58:27.960
<v Speaker 10>the book.</v>

3719
02:58:28.050 --> 02:58:28.531
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3720
02:58:28.531 --> 02:58:30.660
<v Speaker 5>I definitely think that he deserves that</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

3721
02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:33.690
<v Speaker 5>But here's my weirdness about all this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3722
02:58:33.691 --> 02:58:34.524
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about language and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>limitations of language and the </v>

3723
02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:38.693
<v Speaker 5>eventuality of a virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I wonder how we're going to digest </v>

3724
02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:45.113
<v Speaker 5>data and information in a virtual world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if people decide like what if you </v>

3725
02:58:50.011 --> 02:58:54.120
<v Speaker 5>decide that you want to read books in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>virtual world,</v>

3726
02:58:54.750 --> 02:58:55.583
<v Speaker 5>this is how you want to read books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way you want to read books is what </v>

3727
02:58:57.271 --> 02:59:01.080
<v Speaker 5>your feet up on the couch in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>mansion and your virtual world.</v>

3728
02:59:01.290 --> 02:59:02.123
<v Speaker 5>All these girls around you like finger </v>
<v Speaker 5>banging themselves with a high heels on </v>

3729
02:59:05.441 --> 02:59:07.050
<v Speaker 5>and Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fat bottom girls.</v>

3730
02:59:07.051 --> 02:59:08.550
<v Speaker 5>You make a rock in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go round,</v>

3731
02:59:08.551 --> 02:59:09.384
<v Speaker 5>plays in the background share,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you get to sit down and read books </v>

3732
02:59:11.041 --> 02:59:13.140
<v Speaker 5>in a virtual world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens then?</v>

3733
02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:16.290
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens when you're watching movies</v>

3734
02:59:16.291 --> 02:59:18.510
<v Speaker 5>in a virtual world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably,</v>

3735
02:59:18.990 --> 02:59:20.340
<v Speaker 5>that'd be stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Famous streaming.</v>

3736
02:59:20.370 --> 02:59:22.470
<v Speaker 5>I think the movies would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would exist.</v>

3737
02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:25.590
<v Speaker 5>I think movies in a virtual world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're definitely coming,</v>

3738
02:59:25.591 --> 02:59:26.281
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're going to,</v>

3739
02:59:26.281 --> 02:59:27.114
<v Speaker 5>you're going to exist in the world like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not gonna sit down and watch a </v>

3740
02:59:28.801 --> 02:59:29.030
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>

3741
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.863
<v Speaker 10>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They have a great theory theaters in Vr </v>

3742
02:59:31.971 --> 02:59:35.550
<v Speaker 10>now you can sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 10>put on a movie and watch it on.</v>

3743
02:59:35.600 --> 02:59:38.990
<v Speaker 10>Unlike a massive screen in vr there.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I went to,</v>

3744
02:59:38.991 --> 02:59:39.824
<v Speaker 10>don't you think,</v>

3745
02:59:40.080 --> 02:59:43.170
<v Speaker 5>why do they do that as their limitations</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the medium where they can't have it?</v>

3746
02:59:43.260 --> 02:59:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the movie play out in front of you.</v>

3747
02:59:45.900 --> 02:59:47.100
<v Speaker 5>Like if you went to see jaws,</v>

3748
02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:48.630
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's dope.</v>

3749
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:52.110
<v Speaker 10>It's kind of Nice to watch a movie </v>
<v Speaker 10>floating in space.</v>

3750
02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:53.393
<v Speaker 10>I don't mind that the virtue of you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's an app called virtual desktop </v>

3751
02:59:56.280 --> 02:59:57.113
<v Speaker 10>where you like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you put on your vr goggles and suddenly </v>

3752
03:00:00.331 --> 03:00:05.040
<v Speaker 10>your desktop is wrapped around you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a giant screen,</v>

3753
03:00:05.070 --> 03:00:05.903
<v Speaker 10>giant screen wrapped around you that you</v>
<v Speaker 10>then can like pull up any kind of movie </v>

3754
03:00:11.341 --> 03:00:12.174
<v Speaker 10>you might want to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so you just like can sit in there </v>

3755
03:00:14.701 --> 03:00:16.260
<v Speaker 10>and why.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And if you look down,</v>

3756
03:00:17.880 --> 03:00:19.830
<v Speaker 10>you see space.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3757
03:00:20.100 --> 03:00:21.210
<v Speaker 10>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Virtual desktop that.</v>

3758
03:00:21.211 --> 03:00:23.670
<v Speaker 10>Now the problem with Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you look at that,</v>

3759
03:00:23.730 --> 03:00:24.563
<v Speaker 10>the problem with Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like people looking at it on the </v>

3760
03:00:26.251 --> 03:00:31.251
<v Speaker 10>Internet is it you cannot convey how </v>
<v Speaker 10>fucking cool it looks from looking at it</v>

3761
03:00:33.061 --> 03:00:37.110
<v Speaker 10>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like it is suddenly there's this massive</v>

3762
03:00:37.111 --> 03:00:39.180
<v Speaker 10>thing in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The space look real,</v>

3763
03:00:39.210 --> 03:00:41.220
<v Speaker 10>what the space looked real.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

3764
03:00:41.250 --> 03:00:44.640
<v Speaker 10>it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it looks real enough pretty.</v>

3765
03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:46.910
<v Speaker 10>I wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean I wouldn't say realistic.</v>

3766
03:00:47.220 --> 03:00:48.053
<v Speaker 10>I think there are probably some,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's got to be by now some three 60 </v>

3767
03:00:50.731 --> 03:00:55.290
<v Speaker 10>videos that are actually from the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>from Hubble,</v>

3768
03:00:55.530 --> 03:00:57.480
<v Speaker 10>but it looks good enough where you're </v>
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>

3769
03:00:57.630 --> 03:01:00.040
<v Speaker 10>this is fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well what's the benefit</v>

3770
03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:02.170
<v Speaker 3>of like they're just watching you play a</v>
<v Speaker 3>video game.</v>

3771
03:01:02.171 --> 03:01:03.004
<v Speaker 3>What's the benefit and playing a video </v>
<v Speaker 3>game on a screen in a virtual world </v>

3772
03:01:05.621 --> 03:01:08.260
<v Speaker 3>instead of playing the video game in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtual world?</v>

3773
03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but honestly in that case,</v>

3774
03:01:11.261 --> 03:01:12.094
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've,</v>

3775
03:01:12.130 --> 03:01:13.690
<v Speaker 3>I started a game up in there and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3776
03:01:13.691 --> 03:01:15.460
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see what I'm saying here?</v>

3777
03:01:15.461 --> 03:01:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Because like he's clicking and menus and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

3778
03:01:17.291 --> 03:01:18.550
<v Speaker 3>He's using it like a computer.</v>

3779
03:01:19.500 --> 03:01:20.670
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think it's a,</v>

3780
03:01:20.671 --> 03:01:24.480
<v Speaker 10>I don't know if the benefit is the right</v>
<v Speaker 10>thing to look for there.</v>

3781
03:01:24.481 --> 03:01:25.314
<v Speaker 10>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's just bad ass to like suddenly be </v>

3782
03:01:27.991 --> 03:01:32.991
<v Speaker 10>completely immersed in a new environment</v>
<v Speaker 10>doing like whatever the work is that you</v>

3783
03:01:33.931 --> 03:01:38.850
<v Speaker 10>want to do that with virtual desktop.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I just use it to watch documentaries</v>

3784
03:01:40.290 --> 03:01:43.030
<v Speaker 3>about bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm thinking is like,</v>

3785
03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:44.610
<v Speaker 3>would you rather like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3786
03:01:44.670 --> 03:01:46.650
<v Speaker 3>like they're perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at a screen,</v>

3787
03:01:46.651 --> 03:01:47.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly a floating screen,</v>

3788
03:01:47.911 --> 03:01:49.770
<v Speaker 3>if you watch jaws and that floating </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen,</v>

3789
03:01:49.950 --> 03:01:50.783
<v Speaker 3>that would not be as good as if you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in your living room when you're </v>

3790
03:01:52.631 --> 03:01:54.960
<v Speaker 3>looking down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were on the boat with Roy Scheider.</v>

3791
03:01:55.070 --> 03:01:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Well he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna need a bigger boat.</v>

3792
03:01:56.500 --> 03:01:57.333
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean like if there was like a vr </v>

3793
03:01:58.171 --> 03:01:59.380
<v Speaker 3>jaws?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3794
03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be fucking cool.</v>

3795
03:02:00.511 --> 03:02:02.000
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't exist yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3796
03:02:02.010 --> 03:02:04.710
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's going to happen.</v>

3797
03:02:04.711 --> 03:02:05.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

3798
03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll definitely happen for sure.</v>

3799
03:02:08.161 --> 03:02:11.010
<v Speaker 3>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when they do things like that,</v>

3800
03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:15.090
<v Speaker 3>like will you be able to enjoy other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in that world?</v>

3801
03:02:15.091 --> 03:02:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Like will you be able to go into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>world?</v>

3802
03:02:16.621 --> 03:02:19.500

<v Speaker 10>Weirdo or not.</v>

<v Speaker 10>It's a game changer,</v>

3930
03:07:53.491 --> 03:07:54.324
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a game changer and it's one of the </v>

3931
03:07:55.081 --> 03:07:58.590
<v Speaker 10>many freedoms the virtual reality's </v>
<v Speaker 10>offering people.</v>

3932
03:07:58.710 --> 03:07:59.543
<v Speaker 10>It's like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 10>who wants to like even just watching a </v>

3933
03:08:02.581 --> 03:08:06.060
<v Speaker 10>movie in two D in your virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 10>room,</v>

3934
03:08:06.360 --> 03:08:07.193
<v Speaker 10>it's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Maybe you don't have the greatest </v>

3935
03:08:09.171 --> 03:08:10.110
<v Speaker 10>apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

3936
03:08:10.380 --> 03:08:15.380
<v Speaker 10>But you put on vr goggles and suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 10>your apartment has transformed into a,</v>

3937
03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:21.440
<v Speaker 10>into a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 10>beautiful space in the htc vive.</v>

3938
03:08:21.931 --> 03:08:25.710
<v Speaker 10>It comes with like Vr home and there's </v>
<v Speaker 10>two different versions.</v>

3939
03:08:25.711 --> 03:08:26.544
<v Speaker 10>But when you go into this space,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you feel that same sense of </v>

3940
03:08:29.971 --> 03:08:34.410
<v Speaker 10>expansiveness that you get from being in</v>
<v Speaker 10>a big space,</v>

3941
03:08:34.430 --> 03:08:34.650
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

03:08:34.650 --> 03:08:36.240
<v Speaker 10>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>your body's still like,</v>

<v Speaker 10>feels like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3944
03:08:38.250 --> 03:08:39.083
<v Speaker 10>you're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you still feel that weird sense of </v>

3945
03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:45.480
<v Speaker 10>freedom that you feel when you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 10>big space and you're not there.</v>

3946
03:08:45.780 --> 03:08:47.040
<v Speaker 10>It's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

3947
03:08:47.041 --> 03:08:51.660

<v Speaker 10>incredible technologies.</v>

3948
03:08:52.050 --> 03:08:52.883
<v Speaker 10>I think that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 10>some people are giving it a little bit </v>

3949
03:08:54.991 --> 03:08:59.760
<v Speaker 10>of a hard time right now because they </v>
<v Speaker 10>see the game from Youtube and they think</v>

3985
03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:45.670
<v Speaker 10>Now you're holding these controllers </v>
<v Speaker 10>that feel exactly like a fucking,</v>

3986
03:10:45.671 --> 03:10:48.970
<v Speaker 10>they feel very close to a gun and it's </v>
<v Speaker 10>got haptic technology.</v>

3987
03:10:49.210 --> 03:10:50.043
<v Speaker 10>So when you're shooting it's vibrating.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I wonder if this would actually teach </v>

3988
03:10:53.081 --> 03:10:54.460
<v Speaker 10>you how to shoot better.</v>

<v Speaker 10>Is,</v>

3990
03:10:57.130 --> 03:10:59.620
<v Speaker 10>is it making your art tree better?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

3991
03:10:59.621 --> 03:11:02.170
<v Speaker 10>it's making me not do archery cause I </v>
<v Speaker 10>just do it.</v>

3992
03:11:03.540 --> 03:11:05.650
<v Speaker 10>It's way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Are you good at it?</v>

3993
03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:07.090
<v Speaker 10>Are you good at this archery?</v>

3998
03:11:16.210 --> 03:11:17.043

<v Speaker 10>This is one of my favorite archery </v>

3999
03:11:19.691 --> 03:11:22.510
<v Speaker 10>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They also have a vr boxing,</v>

4000
03:11:22.511 --> 03:11:26.830
<v Speaker 10>which I haven't tried yet,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but which I'm excited about because that</v>

4001
03:11:26.950 --> 03:11:29.770
<v Speaker 10>seems like you could really train people</v>
<v Speaker 10>to learn how to box.</v>

4002
03:11:32.310 --> 03:11:34.560
<v Speaker 10>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm s I don't know if this is,</v>

4004
03:11:38.071 --> 03:11:42.430
<v Speaker 10>that's a different archery program than </v>
<v Speaker 10>the one that look up the lab.</v>

4005
03:11:43.800 --> 03:11:44.440
<v Speaker 13>Okay.</v>

4006
03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:45.071
<v Speaker 10>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>fuck.</v>

4007
03:11:45.071 --> 03:11:47.290
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's valve look up valve archery.</v>

4008
03:11:47.291 --> 03:11:50.110
<v Speaker 10>Vr.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Now there is,</v>

4009
03:11:50.111 --> 03:11:52.090
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This one's a really fucking fun man.</v>

4010
03:11:52.620 --> 03:11:53.040
<v Speaker 13>Okay.</v>

4011
03:11:53.040 --> 03:11:55.290
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This one is fucking cool.</v>

4012
03:11:55.770 --> 03:11:56.603
<v Speaker 10>You just shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>These little guys who are trying to </v>

4013
03:11:57.691 --> 03:11:59.730
<v Speaker 10>infiltrate your,</v>
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

4014
03:11:59.790 --> 03:12:02.070
<v Speaker 10>so you're shooting at things.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4015
03:12:02.130 --> 03:12:03.660
<v Speaker 10>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so it's a game.</v>

4016
03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:04.770
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My God.</v>

4017
03:12:04.771 --> 03:12:07.410
<v Speaker 10>And you are you pulling a bow back?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like what are you doing in your hand?</v>

4018
03:12:07.411 --> 03:12:09.930
<v Speaker 10>So you have two controllers,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're pulling them back.</v>

4019
03:12:09.931 --> 03:12:12.630
<v Speaker 10>There's haptics.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So it vibrates according to this,</v>

4020
03:12:12.810 --> 03:12:15.930
<v Speaker 10>the tension of the bow string.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And then when you want an Arrow,</v>

4021
03:12:15.931 --> 03:12:18.660
<v Speaker 10>you're reaching behind your back and </v>
<v Speaker 10>pulling it from behind your back.</v>

4022
03:12:18.690 --> 03:12:19.960
<v Speaker 10>Dot is nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

4023
03:12:19.961 --> 03:12:21.180
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's so fun.</v>

4024
03:12:21.190 --> 03:12:24.660
<v Speaker 10>I wonder if it actually could help your </v>
<v Speaker 10>archery skill for sure.</v>

4025
03:12:24.930 --> 03:12:27.930
<v Speaker 10>The only problem is it's really weird </v>
<v Speaker 10>because you get used to like,</v>

4026
03:12:28.260 --> 03:12:29.093
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's different because you use a </v>

4027
03:12:30.031 --> 03:12:30.960
<v Speaker 10>compound bow,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but you know,</v>

4028
03:12:30.961 --> 03:12:31.441
<v Speaker 10>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4029
03:12:31.441 --> 03:12:32.191
<v Speaker 10>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's kind of same.</v>

4030
03:12:32.191 --> 03:12:36.350
<v Speaker 10>You get used to like I have a place on </v>
<v Speaker 10>my cheek where I put my point,</v>

4031
03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:39.570
<v Speaker 10>the anchor point changes cause the </v>
<v Speaker 10>goggles right up here.</v>

4032
03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:43.860
<v Speaker 10>So you have to get a new anchor point.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But it's still pretty fucking fun.</v>

4033
03:12:44.250 --> 03:12:48.600
<v Speaker 10>I mean how often you get to shoot at </v>
<v Speaker 10>things in and like an archery range like</v>

4034
03:12:48.601 --> 03:12:49.350
<v Speaker 10>this?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

4035
03:12:49.350 --> 03:12:51.120
<v Speaker 10>this is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I wonder,</v>

4036
03:12:51.180 --> 03:12:52.010
<v Speaker 10>that means it should</v>

4037
03:12:52.010 --> 03:12:55.730
<v Speaker 2>definitely be able to do something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for a compound bows.</v>

4038
03:12:56.180 --> 03:12:59.660
<v Speaker 2>That's say go deer hunting with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another archery program that you</v>

4039
03:12:59.661 --> 03:13:02.030
<v Speaker 2>can get on steam that it looks pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

4040
03:13:02.410 --> 03:13:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the name of it though,</v>

4041
03:13:03.951 --> 03:13:06.770
<v Speaker 2>but it looks a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

4042
03:13:06.771 --> 03:13:07.850
<v Speaker 2>realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4043
03:13:07.851 --> 03:13:08.684
<v Speaker 2>they have an archery program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you could find this archery </v>

4044
03:13:10.101 --> 03:13:13.010
<v Speaker 2>program where you shoot at a virtual </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>

4045
03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:15.590
<v Speaker 2>you actually shoot a real bow at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4046
03:13:15.591 --> 03:13:17.900
<v Speaker 2>these images on a screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

4047
03:13:17.901 --> 03:13:19.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

4048
03:13:19.140 --> 03:13:19.973
<v Speaker 2>you go to like in front of like a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie theater type thing and you stand </v>

4049
03:13:22.941 --> 03:13:24.950
<v Speaker 2>in front of this thing and these animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked by.</v>

4050
03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:25.551
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

4051
03:13:25.551 --> 03:13:26.384
<v Speaker 2>And they run from you and they hide and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to sneak up on them and shoot </v>

4052
03:13:29.121 --> 03:13:29.954
<v Speaker 2>arrows at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm sure this will be translated </v>

4053
03:13:31.731 --> 03:13:34.250
<v Speaker 2>into vr and I'll tell you joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was,</v>

4054
03:13:34.251 --> 03:13:37.130
<v Speaker 2>if I were you man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be developing shit for Vr.</v>

4055
03:13:37.130 --> 03:13:37.963
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Developing.</v>

4056
03:13:38.170 --> 03:13:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

4057
03:13:39.441 --> 03:13:41.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not a developer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

4058
03:13:41.410 --> 03:13:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many ideas that you will have</v>

4059
03:13:44.001 --> 03:13:46.490
<v Speaker 2>when you try these goggles on where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be like this,</v>

4060
03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:50.360
<v Speaker 2>this needs to exist in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get this shit developed man.</v>

4061
03:13:50.361 --> 03:13:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Because it's gonna like there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that once you experience it where</v>

4062
03:13:55.080 --> 03:13:55.913
<v Speaker 2>like Oh someone needs to build this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone like for example a fucking </v>

4063
03:13:59.181 --> 03:14:01.540
<v Speaker 2>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's nodding in the,</v>

4064
03:14:01.560 --> 03:14:04.040
<v Speaker 2>in the one hour I think I got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstration of it.</v>

4065
03:14:04.041 --> 03:14:04.874
<v Speaker 2>I was just sitting there asking the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what about when someone gets a hold </v>

4066
03:14:07.581 --> 03:14:08.414
<v Speaker 2>of this and they start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this thing and what about when </v>

4067
03:14:10.340 --> 03:14:11.173
<v Speaker 2>rock star gets it and then they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about making grand theft auto </v>

4068
03:14:13.281 --> 03:14:13.761
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4069
03:14:13.761 --> 03:14:15.890
<v Speaker 2>yes Zach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain just steak.</v>

4070
03:14:16.180 --> 03:14:17.013
<v Speaker 2>Well fallout is coming for the vive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is going to be pretty fucking </v>

4071
03:14:19.851 --> 03:14:20.360
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

4072
03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:21.193
<v Speaker 2>But dude from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have like a a boxing program </v>

4073
03:14:24.410 --> 03:14:25.243
<v Speaker 2>that looks like it's still in </v>
<v Speaker 2>development but a fucking real boxing </v>

4074
03:14:29.061 --> 03:14:33.230
<v Speaker 2>program because it tracks the </v>
<v Speaker 2>controllers perfectly in real time.</v>

4075
03:14:33.260 --> 03:14:35.450
<v Speaker 2>So you could actually learn how to box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4076
03:14:35.960 --> 03:14:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Someone needs to build a real fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only learn how to box,</v>

4077
03:14:40.310 --> 03:14:43.790
<v Speaker 2>but you could train with the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxers like you could throw kicks to,</v>

4078
03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:45.740
<v Speaker 2>well you'd have to have something on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your foot.</v>

4079
03:14:45.770 --> 03:14:46.603
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to have another edition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like that could be done boots </v>

4080
03:14:48.951 --> 03:14:50.570

<v Speaker 2>great fucking workout too.</v>

4082
03:14:54.140 --> 03:14:54.973
<v Speaker 2>Oh I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when people were doing dance </v>

4083
03:14:56.151 --> 03:14:57.770
<v Speaker 2>dance revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lost tons of weight.</v>

4084
03:14:57.790 --> 03:14:58.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a huge thing a lot of guys </v>

03:15:00.111 --> 03:15:00.944
<v Speaker 2>lost and gals lost a ton of weight off </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dance dance revolution again cause </v>

4086
03:15:05.031 --> 03:15:06.020
<v Speaker 2>it was so fun to do.</v>

4087
03:15:06.440 --> 03:15:07.273
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's funny about Vr is that </v>

4088
03:15:08.991 --> 03:15:11.000
<v Speaker 2>right now when people think of a video </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gamer,</v>

4089
03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:13.310
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to hear someone say,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They have such dexterity.</v>

4092
03:15:17.420 --> 03:15:21.380
<v Speaker 2>But now when you think of someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great at Vr,</v>

4097
03:15:31.190 --> 03:15:32.570
<v Speaker 2>They have vr pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How good.</v>

4098
03:15:32.840 --> 03:15:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that pools for real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

4099
03:15:36.081 --> 03:15:36.914
<v Speaker 2>the thing about this is this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you could do on your own </v>

4100
03:15:39.231 --> 03:15:40.470
<v Speaker 2>and get a workout in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>

4101
03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:41.383
<v Speaker 2>what I find interesting about this too </v>
<v Speaker 2>is you could tune a dude up and you </v>

4102
03:15:44.271 --> 03:15:45.104
<v Speaker 2>don't feel bad about it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you need to do eventually is </v>

4103
03:15:49.630 --> 03:15:50.010
<v Speaker 2>they're going to</v>

4104
03:15:50.010 --> 03:15:52.680
<v Speaker 5>have something that looks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a robot.</v>

4105
03:15:52.681 --> 03:15:53.514
<v Speaker 5>Like both things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you have a thing that you can </v>

4106
03:15:55.891 --> 03:15:56.630
<v Speaker 5>actually hit.</v>

4107
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:58.400
<v Speaker 10>Well now you could just,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you could already,</v>

4108
03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:02.840
<v Speaker 10>I'm sure there's a way that you could </v>
<v Speaker 10>hang a bag and um,</v>

4109
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:03.471
<v Speaker 10>cause like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>okay,</v>

4110
03:16:03.471 --> 03:16:04.940
<v Speaker 10>so when I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

4111
03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:07.370
<v Speaker 10>what I'm talking about southern the hits</v>
<v Speaker 10>back,</v>

4112
03:16:07.940 --> 03:16:09.290
<v Speaker 10>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's that,</v>

4113
03:16:09.350 --> 03:16:11.410
<v Speaker 10>that's going to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 10>phrase,</v>

4114
03:16:11.440 --> 03:16:12.273
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have to have a lot of power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could have like a really mushy arm </v>

4115
03:16:16.030 --> 03:16:20.020
<v Speaker 5>and it knows how to move the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way you move,</v>

4116
03:16:20.100 --> 03:16:20.360
<v Speaker 5>like</v>

4117
03:16:20.360 --> 03:16:23.090
<v Speaker 10>Zach's a throwing punches at you.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So if it hits you,</v>

4118
03:16:23.091 --> 03:16:24.950
<v Speaker 10>it's not hurting you.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know what that could be,</v>

4119
03:16:24.951 --> 03:16:25.784
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It can be like a haptic face mask that </v>

4120
03:16:28.071 --> 03:16:32.420
<v Speaker 10>registers the punch and vibrates so that</v>
<v Speaker 10>you could feel it,</v>

4121
03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:34.340
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and wherever it hits you,</v>

4122
03:16:34.480 --> 03:16:34.880
<v Speaker 10>it could</v>

4123
03:16:34.880 --> 03:16:37.730
<v Speaker 5>be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also could be like some sort of a</v>

4124
03:16:37.731 --> 03:16:42.731
<v Speaker 5>robot that has inflatable arms and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>inflatable arms move with the program.</v>

4125
03:16:43.940 --> 03:16:46.610
<v Speaker 5>So as you're looking at Apollo creed in </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of you,</v>

4126
03:16:46.700 --> 03:16:49.300
<v Speaker 5>when he snaps his jab out at you pop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

4127
03:16:49.330 --> 03:16:50.163
<v Speaker 5>he's throwing this like spongy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost like a inflatable raft balloon </v>

4128
03:16:56.511 --> 03:16:57.111
<v Speaker 5>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4129
03:16:57.111 --> 03:17:00.230
<v Speaker 5>like when you're little kids inflatable </v>
<v Speaker 5>balloon toys.</v>

4130
03:17:00.370 --> 03:17:01.270
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I like that.</v>

4131
03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:02.290
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he's not going to hurt you at all.</v>

4132
03:17:02.291 --> 03:17:04.720
<v Speaker 10>It's just going to touch your face.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Be fucking incredible.</v>

4133
03:17:04.850 --> 03:17:06.940
<v Speaker 10>And what's in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what you're going to see,</v>

4134
03:17:06.941 --> 03:17:07.774
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is people are going to get really good </v>

4135
03:17:08.681 --> 03:17:09.514
<v Speaker 10>at this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like if you're good at shooting and vr </v>

4136
03:17:11.830 --> 03:17:12.663
<v Speaker 10>minus like the heft of the gun and the </v>
<v Speaker 10>real kick of whatever gun in the real </v>

4137
03:17:14.951 --> 03:17:16.250
<v Speaker 10>world.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Are you using your,</v>

4138
03:17:16.251 --> 03:17:17.950
<v Speaker 10>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's going to translate.</v>

4139
03:17:18.100 --> 03:17:21.610
<v Speaker 10>We are tomorrow and just float in </v>
<v Speaker 10>Pasadena.</v>

4140
03:17:22.140 --> 03:17:23.360
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Zach,</v>

4141
03:17:23.380 --> 03:17:28.240
<v Speaker 10>Larry and I are testing out,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think for the first time Vr in a float</v>

4142
03:17:28.241 --> 03:17:31.890
<v Speaker 10>tank and Zach leary,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Timothy leary's son Timothy leary.</v>

4143
03:17:31.980 --> 03:17:36.070
<v Speaker 10>Are you up to Duncan trussell Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you dropping out and tuning in and we're</v>

4144
03:17:36.071 --> 03:17:39.370
<v Speaker 10>trying to induce the observer effect.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We've got this awesome guy,</v>

4145
03:17:39.371 --> 03:17:40.510
<v Speaker 10>Dustin,</v>
<v Speaker 10>who's,</v>

4146
03:17:40.511 --> 03:17:41.560
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>helped us,</v>

4147
03:17:41.561 --> 03:17:44.710
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>help helped us build a floating in space</v>

4148
03:17:44.711 --> 03:17:47.170
<v Speaker 10>program.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So the idea is,</v>

4149
03:17:47.500 --> 03:17:48.333
<v Speaker 10>can you like induced the effect </v>
<v Speaker 10>astronauts report when they're floating </v>

4150
03:17:52.331 --> 03:17:54.460
<v Speaker 10>in space looking down on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 10>If you,</v>

4151
03:17:54.530 --> 03:17:55.363
<v Speaker 10>if you put someone in the zero g or the </v>
<v Speaker 10>Semis Erg of a float tank and give them </v>

4152
03:18:00.401 --> 03:18:01.234
<v Speaker 10>the impression that they're staring down</v>
<v Speaker 10>on planet earth and we've got this </v>

4153
03:18:04.270 --> 03:18:06.880
<v Speaker 10>genius designer is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I haven't looked at it yet.</v>

4154
03:18:07.180 --> 03:18:10.150
<v Speaker 5>You are freaking me the fuck out right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

4155
03:18:10.180 --> 03:18:11.013
<v Speaker 5>Well let's hope it works man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is something that makes </v>

4156
03:18:12.671 --> 03:18:15.850
<v Speaker 5>sense to me in my world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The world of the float.</v>

4157
03:18:15.970 --> 03:18:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll know like something like that,</v>

4158
03:18:18.131 --> 03:18:19.750
<v Speaker 5>like adding floating to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4159
03:18:19.751 --> 03:18:22.660
<v Speaker 5>crash was trying to do something similar</v>
<v Speaker 5>a long time ago.</v>

4160
03:18:22.900 --> 03:18:23.733
<v Speaker 5>He was developing programs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He developed a screen crash from the </v>

4161
03:18:26.891 --> 03:18:27.820
<v Speaker 5>float lab,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should say.</v>

4162
03:18:27.821 --> 03:18:31.510
<v Speaker 5>He's the one of the big innovators have </v>
<v Speaker 5>a floating tanks in this country.</v>

4163
03:18:31.511 --> 03:18:32.344
<v Speaker 5>He developed a screen that had one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the lowest emissions of light possible </v>

4164
03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:38.650
<v Speaker 5>so that when you be lying down in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>tank,</v>

4165
03:18:38.890 --> 03:18:39.723
<v Speaker 5>complete darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would look up at the screen and the </v>

4166
03:18:41.921 --> 03:18:42.754
<v Speaker 5>amount of light came out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so minuscule that allowed you to </v>

4167
03:18:44.531 --> 03:18:48.010
<v Speaker 5>see clearly the images but didn't show a</v>
<v Speaker 5>the line of</v>

4168
03:18:48.010 --> 03:18:50.860
<v Speaker 3>a screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were never removed from this idea</v>

4169
03:18:50.861 --> 03:18:52.180
<v Speaker 3>that you're floating through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>

4170
03:18:52.181 --> 03:18:53.014
<v Speaker 3>but in front of you while these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>are playing out and he had this idea </v>

4171
03:18:55.510 --> 03:18:57.250
<v Speaker 3>that you would learn things easier that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

4172
03:18:57.400 --> 03:19:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Like you could watch like a golf </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary or a golf,</v>

4173
03:19:00.151 --> 03:19:00.984
<v Speaker 3>a instructional rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could learn like how to swing a </v>

4174
03:19:02.951 --> 03:19:03.784
<v Speaker 3>golf club properly because you would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing it through a first person </v>

4175
03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:07.834
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

4176
03:19:07.920 --> 03:19:08.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4177
03:19:08.910 --> 03:19:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Zach's dad had this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called the Timothy leary.</v>

4178
03:19:13.290 --> 03:19:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Tim leary probably say who his dad was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tim Timothy.</v>

4179
03:19:16.620 --> 03:19:19.480
<v Speaker 4>Timothy leary had this idea of the eight</v>
<v Speaker 4>circuits of clothes.</v>

4180
03:19:19.760 --> 03:19:21.070
<v Speaker 4>Zach's dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4181
03:19:21.071 --> 03:19:22.800
<v Speaker 4>maybe sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4182
03:19:22.830 --> 03:19:25.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean any w and he was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>sweetie.</v>

4183
03:19:25.231 --> 03:19:28.350
<v Speaker 4>Tim leary was like Tim Timothy leary </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

4184
03:19:29.430 --> 03:19:31.680
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put them on the same level as Galileo.</v>

4185
03:19:31.681 --> 03:19:32.514
<v Speaker 4>He was an incredibly brilliant human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being and a lot of his ideas got lost </v>

4186
03:19:35.971 --> 03:19:39.570
<v Speaker 4>and is like he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets called an lsd propagandist,</v>

4187
03:19:39.720 --> 03:19:42.060
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of other shit he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up with.</v>

4188
03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:43.133
<v Speaker 4>And I'm one of those was this model,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the eight circuits of </v>

4189
03:19:46.111 --> 03:19:46.944
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that humans are meant to </v>

4190
03:19:51.301 --> 03:19:52.134
<v Speaker 4>migrate into space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that in the same way like different </v>

4191
03:19:54.841 --> 03:19:58.320
<v Speaker 4>creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they enter into new habitats,</v>

4192
03:19:58.410 --> 03:20:00.120
<v Speaker 4>they actually change a little bit.</v>

4193
03:20:00.180 --> 03:20:01.260
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or in other words,</v>

4194
03:20:01.261 --> 03:20:06.261
<v Speaker 4>like you take a a sea turtle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's laid eggs in the sand and the first</v>

4195
03:20:06.901 --> 03:20:07.734
<v Speaker 4>time a little baby sea turtle climbs out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the egg and burroughs out of the </v>

4196
03:20:11.251 --> 03:20:12.084
<v Speaker 4>sand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a land creature until it hits </v>

4197
03:20:14.521 --> 03:20:15.354
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden all of this </v>

4198
03:20:16.501 --> 03:20:19.800
<v Speaker 4>other instinctual shit kicks in and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>learns how to be a sea turtle.</v>

4199
03:20:19.980 --> 03:20:22.380
<v Speaker 4>More than likely it gets eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a lot of them make it,</v>

4200
03:20:22.620 --> 03:20:25.200
<v Speaker 4>but the ones that survive become sea </v>
<v Speaker 4>turtles.</v>

4201
03:20:25.201 --> 03:20:26.034
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4202
03:20:26.040 --> 03:20:29.880
<v Speaker 4>so the idea is that humans are meant for</v>
<v Speaker 4>interstellar,</v>

4203
03:20:29.970 --> 03:20:30.740
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for tr,</v>

4204
03:20:30.740 --> 03:20:31.573
<v Speaker 4>for travel in space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that if we go into zero g then over </v>

4205
03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:39.660
<v Speaker 4>what could potentially happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4206
03:20:39.930 --> 03:20:44.930
<v Speaker 4>our changes in our psyche and maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our genetic makeup,</v>

4207
03:20:45.691 --> 03:20:48.120
<v Speaker 4>like maybe if we go into space long </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

4208
03:20:48.330 --> 03:20:53.010
<v Speaker 4>we'll start transforming into some new </v>
<v Speaker 4>creature that we were meant to be.</v>

4209
03:20:53.011 --> 03:20:53.440
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

4210
03:20:53.440 --> 03:20:54.273
<v Speaker 3>was it ed Mitchell that was talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the experience of being in space </v>

4211
03:20:58.151 --> 03:20:58.984
<v Speaker 3>that he would like to take everybody up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and that you would realize how </v>

4212
03:21:01.931 --> 03:21:05.560
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous boundaries are and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous wars are.</v>

4213
03:21:05.830 --> 03:21:08.050
<v Speaker 3>If you could see the earth as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he saw it</v>

4214
03:21:08.130 --> 03:21:10.290
<v Speaker 4>at Mitchell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is he still alive?</v>

4215
03:21:11.240 --> 03:21:12.073
<v Speaker 3>I believe he is Mitchell or trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it for your brother and mental is not </v>

4216
03:21:14.871 --> 03:21:15.471
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4217
03:21:15.471 --> 03:21:16.230
<v Speaker 3>he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

4218
03:21:16.230 --> 03:21:18.920
<v Speaker 3>well what was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was an interesting guy.</v>

4219
03:21:18.980 --> 03:21:21.500
<v Speaker 3>He was an interesting one because he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>really into Ufos,</v>

4220
03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:22.873
<v Speaker 3>especially before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the more compelling cases </v>

4221
03:21:25.970 --> 03:21:30.970
<v Speaker 3>of someone who went into space and came </v>
<v Speaker 3>back with a profound belief in Ufos.</v>

4222
03:21:32.180 --> 03:21:34.970
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always hard.</v>

4223
03:21:34.971 --> 03:21:36.620
<v Speaker 3>You don't know the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the guy.</v>

4224
03:21:36.621 --> 03:21:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what his motivation was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he was being honest.</v>

4225
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:40.423
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of money and you lfos </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a fucking astronaut and you </v>

4226
03:21:43.101 --> 03:21:45.140
<v Speaker 3>want to cash in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best way.</v>

4227
03:21:45.230 --> 03:21:46.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying</v>

4228
03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:47.600
<v Speaker 5>that he would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that,</v>

4229
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:50.570
<v Speaker 5>but the cynic in me has to always go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4230
03:21:50.571 --> 03:21:52.340
<v Speaker 5>how well do they take care of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>astronauts?</v>

4231
03:21:52.370 --> 03:21:53.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how well did they get?</v>

4232
03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:54.833
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4233
03:21:54.920 --> 03:21:57.440
<v Speaker 5>if you can tap into some of that sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweet ufo money,</v>

4234
03:21:59.240 --> 03:22:00.980
<v Speaker 5>it's a lot of money in them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>UFO books,</v>

4235
03:22:01.190 --> 03:22:03.950
<v Speaker 5>little green men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want little green bits of paper,</v>

4236
03:22:03.951 --> 03:22:05.030
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4237
03:22:05.031 --> 03:22:07.010
<v Speaker 5>it's not like Hillary Clinton speaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>fees.</v>

4238
03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:07.993
<v Speaker 5>But if you can get a former us </v>
<v Speaker 5>astronauts who went to the moon to sit </v>

4239
03:22:12.141 --> 03:22:16.730
<v Speaker 5>down and talk to you about the little </v>
<v Speaker 5>green men that he might have seen or the</v>

4240
03:22:16.731 --> 03:22:18.170
<v Speaker 5>idea that they might exist.</v>

4241
03:22:19.340 --> 03:22:19.941
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know what,</v>

4242
03:22:19.941 --> 03:22:20.550
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>

4243
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:23.690
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there are nefarious people in this world</v>

4244
03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:27.670
<v Speaker 10>and I don't know if fucking had Mitchell</v>
<v Speaker 10>I saw Ufo is or not.</v>

4245
03:22:27.671 --> 03:22:30.580
<v Speaker 10>It wouldn't surprise me that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

4246
03:22:30.600 --> 03:22:33.590
<v Speaker 10>other creatures that you run into up </v>
<v Speaker 10>there that for whatever reason,</v>

4247
03:22:33.591 --> 03:22:36.400
<v Speaker 10>you're not supposed to announce,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know man.</v>

4248
03:22:36.740 --> 03:22:37.850
<v Speaker 5>Totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

4249
03:22:37.851 --> 03:22:38.684
<v Speaker 5>if we could send a robot to Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's totally possible that </v>

4250
03:22:40.671 --> 03:22:41.504
<v Speaker 5>something's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's totally possible that something is </v>

4251
03:22:43.341 --> 03:22:44.660
<v Speaker 5>around the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the time.</v>

4252
03:22:44.661 --> 03:22:45.890
<v Speaker 5>We just don't get a chance to see it.</v>

4253
03:22:46.470 --> 03:22:47.303
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this is what Terence Mckenna always </v>

4254
03:22:47.940 --> 03:22:48.773
<v Speaker 10>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like we spent all this money on </v>

4255
03:22:49.651 --> 03:22:53.030
<v Speaker 10>these telescopes when for however you </v>
<v Speaker 10>don't even,</v>

4256
03:22:53.130 --> 03:22:56.610
<v Speaker 10>most people won't even sell you DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They give it to you.</v>

4257
03:22:56.790 --> 03:22:57.623
<v Speaker 10>But like when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>just like however much it costs for </v>

4258
03:23:00.361 --> 03:23:01.194
<v Speaker 10>whatever the device you use to inhale </v>
<v Speaker 10>the DMT or however much the it cost you </v>

4259
03:23:05.161 --> 03:23:08.370
<v Speaker 10>to get down to wherever the IOWASCA </v>
<v Speaker 10>Sharman was or whatever it is,</v>

4260
03:23:08.640 --> 03:23:09.473
<v Speaker 10>you're going to encounter things that </v>
<v Speaker 10>seem to have a personality that is not </v>

4261
03:23:13.980 --> 03:23:18.180
<v Speaker 10>your personality and that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 10>have a normal human body.</v>

4262
03:23:18.450 --> 03:23:21.360
<v Speaker 10>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I was just reading Alistair Crawley last</v>

4263
03:23:21.360 --> 03:23:26.340
<v Speaker 10>night and he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we use the term angel,</v>

4264
03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:30.870
<v Speaker 10>not because we're saying there's some </v>
<v Speaker 10>angel out there,</v>

4265
03:23:31.320 --> 03:23:32.153
<v Speaker 10>but it's more convenient than saying </v>
<v Speaker 10>here is a representation of the higher </v>

4266
03:23:35.701 --> 03:23:40.701
<v Speaker 10>form of human intelligence that is come </v>
<v Speaker 10>and in the form of an archetype that our</v>

4267
03:23:41.011 --> 03:23:44.730
<v Speaker 10>brains translate as an angel.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's just easier to call it an angel for</v>

4268
03:23:44.731 --> 03:23:49.020
<v Speaker 10>the sake of just pragmatism because you </v>
<v Speaker 10>want to achieve some goal.</v>

4269
03:23:49.170 --> 03:23:53.790
<v Speaker 10>Just call it a fucking angel.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We used to call aliens angels.</v>

4270
03:23:53.791 --> 03:23:54.870
<v Speaker 10>That's what we used to call him.</v>

4271
03:23:55.420 --> 03:24:00.420
<v Speaker 5>The idea of a person with no possible </v>
<v Speaker 5>way of measuring what something is,</v>

4272
03:24:01.050 --> 03:24:02.850
<v Speaker 5>even if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you have an experience or not,</v>

4273
03:24:02.851 --> 03:24:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I have to take your word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm assuming you had an experience,</v>

4274
03:24:05.281 --> 03:24:08.880
<v Speaker 5>you said it was an angel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea of putting a label on that,</v>

4275
03:24:08.940 --> 03:24:10.500
<v Speaker 5>a definitive label like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4276
03:24:10.501 --> 03:24:12.060
<v Speaker 5>I definitely met an angel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4277
03:24:12.061 --> 03:24:13.860
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck do you know what an angel </v>
<v Speaker 5>is?</v>

4278
03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:15.270
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you know it was an alien?</v>

4279
03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:18.210
<v Speaker 5>It was definitely an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You sure it wasn't an angel?</v>

4280
03:24:18.330 --> 03:24:19.920
<v Speaker 5>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know.</v>

4281
03:24:19.980 --> 03:24:20.920
<v Speaker 5>You're guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4282
03:24:20.930 --> 03:24:22.560
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what an angel is or an </v>
<v Speaker 5>alien isn't.</v>

4283
03:24:22.620 --> 03:24:25.200
<v Speaker 5>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be able to say those words</v>

4284
03:24:25.350 --> 03:24:26.183
<v Speaker 5>because you don't even know what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck they mean either one of those </v>

4285
03:24:27.601 --> 03:24:28.950
<v Speaker 5>words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just saying nonsense.</v>

4286
03:24:28.951 --> 03:24:31.080
<v Speaker 5>And for you to be like super definitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

4287
03:24:31.290 --> 03:24:31.861
<v Speaker 5>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

4288
03:24:31.861 --> 03:24:32.694
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're definitely sure that it was an </v>

4289
03:24:34.021 --> 03:24:36.090
<v Speaker 5>angel or you're definitely sure that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was an alien.</v>

4290
03:24:36.300 --> 03:24:38.190
<v Speaker 5>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know what you saw.</v>

4291
03:24:38.220 --> 03:24:39.053
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have anything that you can </v>

4292
03:24:39.421 --> 03:24:40.254
<v Speaker 5>bring back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no physical matter where you </v>

4293
03:24:41.851 --> 03:24:42.684
<v Speaker 5>brought to a scientist and bunch of peer</v>
<v Speaker 5>reviewed scientists from all over the </v>

4294
03:24:44.911 --> 03:24:48.240
<v Speaker 5>world studied it and determined that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this was actually alien tissue.</v>

4295
03:24:48.420 --> 03:24:51.450
<v Speaker 5>Now there's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So no matter what it is,</v>

4296
03:24:51.750 --> 03:24:53.130
<v Speaker 5>the labels ridiculous,</v>

4297
03:24:53.230 --> 03:24:55.600
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>And they get caught up in the label is,</v>

4298
03:24:55.601 --> 03:24:59.140
<v Speaker 10>is of to waste your time unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 10>using the label is a,</v>

4299
03:24:59.141 --> 03:24:59.974
<v Speaker 10>is something to expedite your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 10>recontact that thing in which case </v>

4300
03:25:04.571 --> 03:25:07.810
<v Speaker 10>labels are fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But if you're using the label to say,</v>

4301
03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:09.370
<v Speaker 10>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this is definitely an angel,</v>

4302
03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:13.300
<v Speaker 10>and then you're like getting in the most</v>
<v Speaker 10>insanely stupid arguments over that,</v>

4303
03:25:13.570 --> 03:25:17.240
<v Speaker 10>then it's a bit of a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But if you have an experience,</v>

4304
03:25:17.241 --> 03:25:18.580
<v Speaker 10>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know,</v>

4305
03:25:18.730 --> 03:25:19.563
<v Speaker 10>you smoked dmt and you come into contact</v>
<v Speaker 10>with it's self transforming machine </v>

4306
03:25:24.071 --> 03:25:27.330
<v Speaker 10>elves that as Terence Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 10>hyperspace and hyperspace,</v>

4307
03:25:27.370 --> 03:25:30.280
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>So is that really what those things call</v>

4308
03:25:30.281 --> 03:25:32.020
<v Speaker 10>themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 10>If they could?</v>

4309
03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:33.190
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>
<v Speaker 10>of course not.</v>

4310
03:25:33.191 --> 03:25:38.191
<v Speaker 10>But as a tool or a means of trying to in</v>
<v Speaker 10>some way bring the uh,</v>

4311
03:25:39.700 --> 03:25:43.840
<v Speaker 10>transcendent into this dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 10>then language is a,</v>

4312
03:25:43.850 --> 03:25:45.640
<v Speaker 10>is a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You have no choice.</v>

4313
03:25:45.730 --> 03:25:48.010
<v Speaker 5>Well not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in Mckenna's case it was part of the</v>

4314
03:25:48.011 --> 03:25:53.011
<v Speaker 5>grand theater of being someone who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a dmt evangelist.</v>

4315
03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:53.953
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4316
03:25:54.050 --> 03:25:58.180
<v Speaker 5>part of his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his art of what he is is a performer.</v>

4317
03:25:58.270 --> 03:26:02.050
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm a big fan of his lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I enjoyed watching him talk,</v>

4318
03:26:02.051 --> 03:26:02.884
<v Speaker 5>I enjoyed listening to him talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but part of what he was doing was very </v>

4319
03:26:05.351 --> 03:26:08.410
<v Speaker 5>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had this oddly soothing voice,</v>

4320
03:26:08.620 --> 03:26:09.453
<v Speaker 5>this brilliant vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things he did in one of </v>

4321
03:26:11.651 --> 03:26:13.520
<v Speaker 5>these interviews that he did a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a,</v>

4322
03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:14.393
<v Speaker 5>not interviews rather a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's do q and a's with the audience </v>

4323
03:26:16.110 --> 03:26:18.460
<v Speaker 5>would ask them questions about </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic drugs and things along those</v>

4324
03:26:18.461 --> 03:26:19.720
<v Speaker 5>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4325
03:26:19.990 --> 03:26:21.970
<v Speaker 5>someone was asking him something and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

4326
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.841
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

4327
03:26:22.841 --> 03:26:23.674
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what can you do and how do you </v>

4328
03:26:24.431 --> 03:26:27.310
<v Speaker 5>differentiate and how do you keep from </v>
<v Speaker 5>being arrested?</v>

4329
03:26:27.310 --> 03:26:28.143
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4330
03:26:29.050 --> 03:26:31.900
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use big words,</v>

4331
03:26:33.010 --> 03:26:33.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's a,</v>

4332
03:26:33.730 --> 03:26:36.250
<v Speaker 5>he's a legitimate scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

4333
03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:40.270
<v Speaker 5>if you come up with slogans like dropout</v>
<v Speaker 5>tune in,</v>

4334
03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:42.370
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4335
03:26:42.400 --> 03:26:45.430
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when they come and he goes,</v>

4336
03:26:45.431 --> 03:26:48.400
<v Speaker 5>I keep it low key.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have these small meetings,</v>

4337
03:26:48.401 --> 03:26:52.300
<v Speaker 5>they rarely get over a thousand people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4338
03:26:52.330 --> 03:26:56.060
<v Speaker 5>I use a lot of really big words and a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use the,</v>

4339
03:26:56.140 --> 03:26:59.710
<v Speaker 5>the richest vocabulary for description </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I can muster up.</v>

4340
03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:00.573
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was interesting because like you </v>

4341
03:27:01.391 --> 03:27:02.224
<v Speaker 5>listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's obviously like incredibly well </v>

4342
03:27:03.881 --> 03:27:04.810
<v Speaker 5>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4343
03:27:04.990 --> 03:27:05.823
<v Speaker 5>And incredibly knowledgeable about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>actual physical compounds of all these </v>

4344
03:27:08.741 --> 03:27:09.574
<v Speaker 5>different psychedelics and their </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanisms for interaction and the </v>

4345
03:27:12.820 --> 03:27:15.700
<v Speaker 5>monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all these different things that he's</v>

4346
03:27:15.701 --> 03:27:16.534
<v Speaker 5>saying that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it causes like people who are not that </v>

4347
03:27:18.641 --> 03:27:19.461
<v Speaker 5>smart to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4348
03:27:19.461 --> 03:27:21.630
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We let them</v>

4349
03:27:21.700 --> 03:27:24.390
<v Speaker 10>go.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Let him keep talking to her.</v>

4350
03:27:24.620 --> 03:27:29.250
<v Speaker 10>I hope to God they don't care that much </v>
<v Speaker 10>about people talking about that stuff,</v>

4351
03:27:29.251 --> 03:27:30.011
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It and I,</v>

4352
03:27:30.011 --> 03:27:30.844
<v Speaker 10>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>

4353
03:27:30.910 --> 03:27:31.460
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't</v>

4354
03:27:31.460 --> 03:27:32.930
<v Speaker 5>believe there's a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't,</v>

4355
03:27:33.080 --> 03:27:35.990
<v Speaker 5>there's a few people that are they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but those few people that are,</v>

4356
03:27:35.991 --> 03:27:38.390
<v Speaker 5>they the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're bankers and their industrialists</v>

4357
03:27:38.391 --> 03:27:39.224
<v Speaker 5>and there the military industrial that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are earning money off of </v>

4358
03:27:42.971 --> 03:27:43.804
<v Speaker 5>wars and controlling resources,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you really think that they are </v>

4359
03:27:46.361 --> 03:27:49.150
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another actively trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4360
03:27:49.320 --> 03:27:53.470
<v Speaker 5>and capture or capture people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking openly about psychedelics,</v>

4361
03:27:53.910 --> 03:27:54.910
<v Speaker 5>they don't have time for that shit</v>

4362
03:27:55.050 --> 03:27:56.520
<v Speaker 10>either way,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if I really don't think they do.</v>

4363
03:27:56.550 --> 03:28:00.570
<v Speaker 10>Have you seen that video of Tim leary in</v>
<v Speaker 10>front of the Senate and a hearing</v>

4364
03:28:00.850 --> 03:28:04.300
<v Speaker 5>that was like 1960?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was it?</v>

4365
03:28:04.540 --> 03:28:05.230
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it was like,</v>

4366
03:28:05.230 --> 03:28:05.981
<v Speaker 10>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the year.</v>

4367
03:28:05.981 --> 03:28:07.600
<v Speaker 10>It's one of the funniest fucking things </v>
<v Speaker 10>ever.</v>

4368
03:28:07.601 --> 03:28:08.434
<v Speaker 10>This is our cause he's a madman and he's</v>
<v Speaker 10>in front of these like just hardcore </v>

4369
03:28:12.881 --> 03:28:16.660
<v Speaker 10>politicians talking about the LSD </v>
<v Speaker 10>experience.</v>

4370
03:28:16.730 --> 03:28:18.620
<v Speaker 5>Do you think will get pulled off youtube</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we play that?</v>

4371
03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:22.480
<v Speaker 10>I think that's public fucking don't we </v>
<v Speaker 10>own that?</v>

4372
03:28:22.481 --> 03:28:23.310
<v Speaker 10>Cause it's a s</v>

4373
03:28:23.310 --> 03:28:25.110
<v Speaker 5>it should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it should be the,</v>

4374
03:28:25.111 --> 03:28:27.630
<v Speaker 5>it'd be a historical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there's a,</v>

4375
03:28:27.960 --> 03:28:31.430
<v Speaker 5>there's a amount of time things have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4376
03:28:31.930 --> 03:28:33.220
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Public domain,</v>

4377
03:28:33.240 --> 03:28:35.500
<v Speaker 10>if it's like video,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I guess it depends on who filmed that.</v>

4378
03:28:35.501 --> 03:28:38.420
<v Speaker 10>Like if it's as a TV station filmed it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's there.</v>

4379
03:28:38.421 --> 03:28:39.254
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but if it's like the government filming </v>

4380
03:28:40.631 --> 03:28:43.540
<v Speaker 10>it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know for sure.</v>

4381
03:28:43.541 --> 03:28:45.490
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>

4382
03:28:46.090 --> 03:28:47.710
<v Speaker 10>You've seen video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

4383
03:28:47.711 --> 03:28:49.780
<v Speaker 10>there's definitely video footage and </v>
<v Speaker 10>it's on it.</v>

4384
03:28:49.990 --> 03:28:53.800
<v Speaker 10>There's a documentary right now called </v>
<v Speaker 10>dying to know,</v>

4385
03:28:54.130 --> 03:28:56.890
<v Speaker 10>which is an amazing movie about,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

4386
03:28:57.410 --> 03:28:58.243
<v Speaker 10>Ron doss and Timothy leary's friendship </v>
<v Speaker 10>and it sort of follows the scope of </v>

4387
03:29:02.240 --> 03:29:03.850
<v Speaker 10>their lives together.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's amazing.</v>

4388
03:29:03.851 --> 03:29:05.120
<v Speaker 10>It's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

4389
03:29:05.410 --> 03:29:07.190
<v Speaker 10>well shot,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but it's real,</v>

4390
03:29:07.210 --> 03:29:08.230
<v Speaker 10>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's on there.</v>

4391
03:29:08.231 --> 03:29:10.450
<v Speaker 10>I'm surprised it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

4392
03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:12.033
<v Speaker 10>not anyways,</v>

4393
03:29:13.150 --> 03:29:13.983
<v Speaker 5>before I forget this again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is another thing they want to talk </v>

4394
03:29:15.551 --> 03:29:18.010
<v Speaker 5>about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you know the Fermi paradox,</v>

4395
03:29:18.740 --> 03:29:21.290
<v Speaker 5>what were all the aliens if </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization.</v>

4396
03:29:21.291 --> 03:29:25.000
<v Speaker 5>So likely yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think looking at all this virtual</v>

4397
03:29:25.001 --> 03:29:26.380
<v Speaker 5>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is something I explored,</v>

4398
03:29:26.410 --> 03:29:27.243
<v Speaker 5>I did a single podcast the other day </v>
<v Speaker 5>with just me answering questions and </v>

4399
03:29:30.190 --> 03:29:31.023
<v Speaker 5>somebody asks about the Fermi paradox </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it really made me think about it </v>

4400
03:29:32.830 --> 03:29:34.630
<v Speaker 5>even more and I've been thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it since then.</v>

4401
03:29:35.350 --> 03:29:36.183
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilizations never get to travel </v>

4402
03:29:38.741 --> 03:29:40.540
<v Speaker 5>through space because they get to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

4403
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:43.180
<v Speaker 5>they realize that the real juice is in </v>
<v Speaker 5>virtual?</v>

4404
03:29:43.181 --> 03:29:44.014
<v Speaker 5>Like why do you have to like physically </v>
<v Speaker 5>Trev traverse between one galaxy to </v>

4405
03:29:47.081 --> 03:29:47.914
<v Speaker 5>another when you could figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 5>through technology and ultimately </v>

4406
03:29:51.041 --> 03:29:51.874
<v Speaker 5>through artificial intelligence creating</v>
<v Speaker 5>infinitely more complex artificial </v>

4407
03:29:56.291 --> 03:29:59.290
<v Speaker 5>reality that we're going to never </v>
<v Speaker 5>travel,</v>

4408
03:29:59.620 --> 03:30:02.200
<v Speaker 5>all of our travel is going to be done </v>
<v Speaker 5>internally.</v>

4409
03:30:02.600 --> 03:30:03.061
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

4410
03:30:03.061 --> 03:30:03.894
<v Speaker 10>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think that that that is a great </v>

4411
03:30:05.671 --> 03:30:09.090
<v Speaker 10>response to the Fermi paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I think that um,</v>

4412
03:30:09.150 --> 03:30:09.983
<v Speaker 10>w w our addiction to the idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 10>are our body is going to be something </v>

4413
03:30:15.511 --> 03:30:16.344
<v Speaker 10>that fades away over time and that we </v>
<v Speaker 10>stop having this concept that I'm </v>

4414
03:30:20.401 --> 03:30:23.330
<v Speaker 10>localized in my,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that my visit there.</v>

4415
03:30:23.340 --> 03:30:24.173
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we live in a world where people believe </v>

4416
03:30:26.281 --> 03:30:29.460
<v Speaker 10>that all they are is their body.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They think I am my physical body.</v>

4417
03:30:29.461 --> 03:30:30.660
<v Speaker 10>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's what I am.</v>

4418
03:30:30.661 --> 03:30:33.330
<v Speaker 10>That's the sum total of meat inside,</v>
<v Speaker 10>outside,</v>

4419
03:30:33.630 --> 03:30:35.370
<v Speaker 10>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 10>body,</v>

4420
03:30:35.640 --> 03:30:37.350
<v Speaker 10>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 10>everything else.</v>

4421
03:30:37.590 --> 03:30:39.240
<v Speaker 10>Even though what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 10>earlier,</v>

4422
03:30:39.680 --> 03:30:44.680
<v Speaker 10>we know that we're inextricably woven in</v>
<v Speaker 10>to the fabric of every single thing.</v>

4423
03:30:45.411 --> 03:30:50.411
<v Speaker 10>So really your body is one part of the </v>
<v Speaker 10>infinite universe and right now you have</v>

4424
03:30:50.961 --> 03:30:54.440
<v Speaker 10>become completely fixated on it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You think it's you.</v>

4425
03:30:54.620 --> 03:30:58.340
<v Speaker 10>So vr,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you put vr on first thing that happens,</v>

4426
03:30:58.341 --> 03:31:01.130
<v Speaker 10>which is one of my favorite things is </v>
<v Speaker 10>you'll hold your,</v>

4427
03:31:01.820 --> 03:31:03.320
<v Speaker 10>you'll hold your hand up in front of </v>
<v Speaker 10>your face,</v>

4428
03:31:03.321 --> 03:31:05.760
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>And if you have the htc vive,</v>

4429
03:31:05.761 --> 03:31:08.450
<v Speaker 10>you'll see their amazing controllers is </v>
<v Speaker 10>floating in the air.</v>

4430
03:31:08.690 --> 03:31:12.800
<v Speaker 10>But then you'll look down.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There's no fucking body there,</v>

4431
03:31:12.801 --> 03:31:13.634
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You're looking down and it's just a </v>

4432
03:31:14.601 --> 03:31:17.480
<v Speaker 10>blank space.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You don't have a body anymore.</v>

4433
03:31:17.690 --> 03:31:18.523
<v Speaker 10>Now when someone touches you in Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's really fucking cool because you </v>

4434
03:31:22.101 --> 03:31:25.160
<v Speaker 10>don't see him.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like a ghost is touching you,</v>

4435
03:31:25.490 --> 03:31:28.970
<v Speaker 10>and I'm not saying I've done this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but if you were to have sex in Vr,</v>

4436
03:31:29.900 --> 03:31:32.030
<v Speaker 10>you've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Never Joe,</v>

4437
03:31:32.060 --> 03:31:34.340
<v Speaker 10>have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 10>We'll never have sex out of wedlock.</v>

4438
03:31:34.640 --> 03:31:35.473
<v Speaker 10>But if you were to have sex in Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 10>then suddenly you don't have a body </v>

4439
03:31:40.521 --> 03:31:41.690
<v Speaker 10>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>

4440
03:31:41.691 --> 03:31:43.660
<v Speaker 10>but you're having sex in vr with another</v>
<v Speaker 10>person.</v>

4441
03:31:43.661 --> 03:31:45.170
<v Speaker 10>Who's your vr with another person?</v>

4442
03:31:45.540 --> 03:31:48.600
<v Speaker 5>Physical sex with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what do you see on the other side?</v>

4443
03:31:48.670 --> 03:31:50.770
<v Speaker 10>It depends on what you decided to be </v>
<v Speaker 10>having sex.</v>

4444
03:31:50.920 --> 03:31:51.753
<v Speaker 5>And so you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get up sex with your girlfriend and </v>

4445
03:31:53.981 --> 03:31:55.780
<v Speaker 5>pretend it's like the cookie monster.</v>

4446
03:31:56.500 --> 03:31:57.333
<v Speaker 10>You could have sex with your girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 10>and just be laying a on in some field </v>

4447
03:32:00.581 --> 03:32:01.690
<v Speaker 10>looking up at the stars.</v>

4448
03:32:02.010 --> 03:32:02.843
<v Speaker 5>Cookie Monster's feet up in the air like</v>
<v Speaker 5>bugs bunny and you're banging in the </v>

4449
03:32:06.031 --> 03:32:06.410
<v Speaker 5>ass.</v>

4450
03:32:06.410 --> 03:32:07.460
<v Speaker 10>Here's what's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

4451
03:32:07.490 --> 03:32:10.160
<v Speaker 10>This is what's really weird and no one </v>
<v Speaker 10>understands it.</v>

4452
03:32:10.370 --> 03:32:13.400
<v Speaker 10>But with Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 10>apparently people have tried it for some</v>

4453
03:32:13.401 --> 03:32:14.234
<v Speaker 10>reason they can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There's no way to bring the cookie </v>

4454
03:32:17.181 --> 03:32:20.960
<v Speaker 10>monster to fuck the cookie monster.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Put a man on the moon.</v>

4455
03:32:20.961 --> 03:32:23.150
<v Speaker 10>We could fuck the cookie monster.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Absolutely man,</v>

4456
03:32:23.330 --> 03:32:24.710
<v Speaker 10>you could.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You could do that.</v>

4457
03:32:25.820 --> 03:32:27.680
<v Speaker 10>You could definitely do that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But,</v>

4458
03:32:28.160 --> 03:32:28.993
<v Speaker 10>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's kind of like something about the </v>

4459
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:36.440
<v Speaker 10>philosophical implications of not having</v>
<v Speaker 10>a body.</v>

4460
03:32:36.530 --> 03:32:38.810
<v Speaker 10>Even if it's being induced by </v>
<v Speaker 10>technology.</v>

4461
03:32:39.140 --> 03:32:39.973
<v Speaker 10>I'm sure you've taken a high enough dose</v>
<v Speaker 10>of something where you merge into the </v>

4462
03:32:43.281 --> 03:32:46.100
<v Speaker 10>universe and you feel like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 10>have a self anymore.</v>

4463
03:32:46.101 --> 03:32:46.980
<v Speaker 10>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It become,</v>

4464
03:32:47.210 --> 03:32:48.043
<v Speaker 10>so to imagine being able to induce that </v>
<v Speaker 10>with Vr so that now you've removed the </v>

4465
03:32:53.181 --> 03:32:55.610
<v Speaker 10>thing that you've been identifying with </v>
<v Speaker 10>your entire life.</v>

4466
03:32:55.611 --> 03:32:58.760
<v Speaker 10>Your body is yourself and there's just a</v>
<v Speaker 10>blank space.</v>

4467
03:32:58.970 --> 03:32:59.803
<v Speaker 10>Yet consciousness remains.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Even though you know you have a body </v>

4468
03:33:02.500 --> 03:33:03.830
<v Speaker 10>under,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you take the goggles off,</v>

4469
03:33:03.831 --> 03:33:06.560
<v Speaker 10>you know it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 10>As time passes,</v>

4470
03:33:06.561 --> 03:33:09.500
<v Speaker 10>when you're wearing this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you begin to forget about there.</v>

4471
03:33:09.820 --> 03:33:11.900
<v Speaker 10>You're going to forget about the </v>
<v Speaker 10>external world.</v>

4472
03:33:12.200 --> 03:33:14.300
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and when you finally do take the goggles</v>

4473
03:33:14.301 --> 03:33:14.780
<v Speaker 10>off,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's like,</v>

4474
03:33:14.780 --> 03:33:16.610
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>oh fuck,</v>

4475
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:18.620
<v Speaker 10>oh right,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this is my office.</v>

4476
03:33:18.650 --> 03:33:19.710
<v Speaker 10>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's the same</v>

4477
03:33:19.710 --> 03:33:22.320
<v Speaker 5>thing that happens in some ways when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get in a tank,</v>

4478
03:33:23.040 --> 03:33:26.130
<v Speaker 5>when you're in the tank with no vr </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology,</v>

4479
03:33:26.131 --> 03:33:30.720
<v Speaker 5>you sometimes have experiences where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>go into like a dream state and you think</v>

4480
03:33:30.721 --> 03:33:31.554
<v Speaker 5>things are happening that aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening and then you wake up out of </v>

4481
03:33:33.571 --> 03:33:34.810
<v Speaker 5>them and you're in the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4482
03:33:35.040 --> 03:33:36.900
<v Speaker 5>And they happen in a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vivid way.</v>

4483
03:33:37.170 --> 03:33:39.960
<v Speaker 5>You don't have any sensory input.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not,</v>

4484
03:33:40.230 --> 03:33:42.900
<v Speaker 5>you're not feeling that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have a dream,</v>

4485
03:33:43.120 --> 03:33:45.630
<v Speaker 5>you're still feeling the bed most of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

4486
03:33:45.631 --> 03:33:49.470
<v Speaker 5>Like you're out of that stage and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this dream dimension.</v>

4487
03:33:49.680 --> 03:33:50.513
<v Speaker 5>But if for some reason you moved a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit and you hit your pillow or </v>

4488
03:33:52.711 --> 03:33:53.544
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your foot touch the nightstand or </v>

4489
03:33:54.421 --> 03:33:56.220
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to snap out of it.</v>

4490
03:33:56.400 --> 03:33:58.860
<v Speaker 5>We ain't that God damn tank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't feel anything.</v>

4491
03:33:58.890 --> 03:34:01.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're flying through space already.</v>

4492
03:34:01.230 --> 03:34:02.063
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can almost like use that as a </v>

4493
03:34:05.210 --> 03:34:08.370
<v Speaker 5>homemade virtual reality thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

4494
03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:12.850
<v Speaker 5>But the ability to program is where </v>
<v Speaker 5>things get squirrely.</v>

4495
03:34:12.860 --> 03:34:13.693
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ability to create any sort of </v>

4496
03:34:15.721 --> 03:34:17.160
<v Speaker 5>scenario you would like.</v>

4497
03:34:17.240 --> 03:34:18.380
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's the best.</v>

4498
03:34:18.500 --> 03:34:21.620
<v Speaker 10>It's going to have so many therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 10>uses.</v>

4499
03:34:22.040 --> 03:34:23.840
<v Speaker 10>What haptic feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

4500
03:34:23.841 --> 03:34:24.674
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's big.</v>

4501
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:25.900
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's like haptic.</v>

4502
03:34:25.901 --> 03:34:26.860
<v Speaker 10>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4503
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:27.703
<v Speaker 10>one impossible end result could be full </v>
<v Speaker 10>bodied haptic suits in float tanks in </v>

4504
03:34:32.511 --> 03:34:36.680
<v Speaker 10>the float tank can go just came.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well yeah,</v>

4505
03:34:36.681 --> 03:34:37.760
<v Speaker 10>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's one,</v>

4506
03:34:37.761 --> 03:34:39.860
<v Speaker 10>it's one of the potential uses of the </v>
<v Speaker 10>thing.</v>

4507
03:34:39.861 --> 03:34:41.420
<v Speaker 10>I mean fuck yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 10>it's going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

4510
03:34:45.860 --> 03:34:48.950
<v Speaker 10>one thing I really hope people do is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

<v Speaker 10>things like this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I never do it.</v>

<v Speaker 10>be a great service for people.</v>

<v Speaker 10>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4545
03:36:15.711 --> 03:36:16.544
<v Speaker 10>Just what it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what it's going to be able to do just </v>

4546
03:36:17.871 --> 03:36:18.621
<v Speaker 10>for like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4547
03:36:18.621 --> 03:36:20.630
<v Speaker 10>you hear about,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there was a great,</v>

4548
03:36:21.170 --> 03:36:22.003
<v Speaker 10>I think it was a vice article,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I can't remember which article about a </v>

4549
03:36:24.381 --> 03:36:29.240
<v Speaker 10>guy who has to program the music that </v>
<v Speaker 10>people listen to during the mushroom,</v>

4550
03:36:29.690 --> 03:36:31.670
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>studies that they're doing.</v>

4551
03:36:31.671 --> 03:36:32.504
<v Speaker 10>Like what playlist do you play for </v>
<v Speaker 10>someone who's undergoing psychedelic </v>

4552
03:36:35.381 --> 03:36:36.220
<v Speaker 10>therapy?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>

4553
03:36:36.670 --> 03:36:39.490
<v Speaker 10>But for this tool,</v>
<v Speaker 10>for psychedelic therapy,</v>

4554
03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:41.980
<v Speaker 10>like the ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's a program,</v>

4555
03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:44.140
<v Speaker 10>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you come over,</v>

4556
03:36:44.141 --> 03:36:48.280
<v Speaker 10>I can't wait to show you this.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's called sound self sound self.</v>

4557
03:36:48.490 --> 03:36:53.490
<v Speaker 10>And what it is is you put these goggles </v>
<v Speaker 10>on and headphones that have a microphone</v>

4558
03:36:54.191 --> 03:36:57.580
<v Speaker 10>on and you chant into the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

4559
03:36:57.610 --> 03:36:59.860
<v Speaker 10>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

4560
03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:02.080
<v Speaker 10>and it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It takes,</v>

4561
03:37:02.740 --> 03:37:03.551
<v Speaker 10>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

4562
03:37:03.551 --> 03:37:04.450
<v Speaker 10>again,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this stuff is,</v>

4563
03:37:04.900 --> 03:37:05.733
<v Speaker 10>it takes that responds to your sounds </v>
<v Speaker 10>are making and then plays it back </v>

4564
03:37:09.911 --> 03:37:10.744
<v Speaker 10>through your headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So you're hear your voice being </v>

4565
03:37:13.121 --> 03:37:16.360
<v Speaker 10>transformed and replaced is like deeper </v>
<v Speaker 10>or lower.</v>

4566
03:37:16.630 --> 03:37:18.250
<v Speaker 10>It's just very psychedelic</v>

4567
03:37:18.300 --> 03:37:19.133
<v Speaker 5>and you're watching the images while </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're hearing your voice that's being </v>

4568
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:23.880
<v Speaker 5>altered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're doing rounds.</v>

4569
03:37:30.930 --> 03:37:32.190
<v Speaker 5>How many people are going to be saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

4570
03:37:32.191 --> 03:37:34.140
<v Speaker 5>What's this guy's video?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we could get them some views.</v>

4571
03:37:34.800 --> 03:37:36.680
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>OCULUS rift games.</v>

4572
03:37:36.681 --> 03:37:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Sound self virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guinea pigs.</v>

4573
03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:41.190
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's so cool.</v>

4574
03:37:41.220 --> 03:37:43.620
<v Speaker 10>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And that's something if you,</v>

4575
03:37:43.621 --> 03:37:44.560
<v Speaker 10>if you guys out there,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I haven't,</v>

4576
03:37:44.580 --> 03:37:45.660
<v Speaker 10>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 10>look at that.</v>

4577
03:37:47.500 --> 03:37:48.333
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just,</v>

4578
03:37:48.340 --> 03:37:49.173
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's explain where we were watching </v>

4579
03:37:50.020 --> 03:37:50.853
<v Speaker 5>were watching as these crazy three </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimensional computer animations that </v>

4580
03:37:57.251 --> 03:37:59.520
<v Speaker 5>look like they look like psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>trips.</v>

4581
03:37:59.530 --> 03:38:01.640
<v Speaker 5>It looks like almost like a gate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatnot,</v>

4582
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:04.180
<v Speaker 5>dmt itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like a gateway to dmt.</v>

4583
03:38:04.390 --> 03:38:07.540
<v Speaker 5>Like right before you blow through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a moment,</v>

4584
03:38:07.690 --> 03:38:08.523
<v Speaker 5>there's a moment where you see like what</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what they described as the </v>

4585
03:38:10.721 --> 03:38:13.990
<v Speaker 5>flower of life before you blast on </v>
<v Speaker 5>through to the other side.</v>

4586
03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:15.890
<v Speaker 10>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

4587
03:38:16.020 --> 03:38:19.230
<v Speaker 10>for those of you have an htc vive,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if you want to use this game,</v>

4588
03:38:19.780 --> 03:38:20.613
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you can,</v>

4589
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:21.543
<v Speaker 10>you can pay for the alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's 30 bucks cause goggles with the </v>

4590
03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:26.333
<v Speaker 10>eyeballs and then you've got to use </v>
<v Speaker 10>something called the revive injector to </v>

4591
03:38:30.121 --> 03:38:31.980
<v Speaker 10>get it to run.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Anyone who has a five out there,</v>

4592
03:38:31.981 --> 03:38:33.810
<v Speaker 10>I'll know what I'm talking about cause </v>
<v Speaker 10>like</v>

4593
03:38:33.910 --> 03:38:34.743
<v Speaker 5>what is the difference between a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry to interrupt you but what does it </v>

4594
03:38:36.131 --> 03:38:37.630
<v Speaker 5>different sheen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oculus rift and the vive.</v>

4595
03:38:37.960 --> 03:38:38.793
<v Speaker 10>So unfortunately oculus has created,</v>
<v Speaker 10>has made a bunch of deals with the </v>

4596
03:38:44.230 --> 03:38:47.260
<v Speaker 10>developers to make exclusive content for</v>
<v Speaker 10>the Oculus.</v>

4597
03:38:47.261 --> 03:38:49.060
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And oculus is great,</v>

4598
03:38:49.180 --> 03:38:51.850
<v Speaker 10>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But that was Oculus Oculus,</v>

4599
03:38:51.970 --> 03:38:54.940
<v Speaker 10>but it's not as good as the vibe for a </v>
<v Speaker 10>few different reasons.</v>

4600
03:38:55.270 --> 03:38:56.103
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>one of the reasons is the vive is </v>

4601
03:38:57.791 --> 03:38:58.624
<v Speaker 10>designed for being able to walk around.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The vibe comes with these and maybe the </v>

4602
03:39:02.651 --> 03:39:05.080
<v Speaker 10>rift you can do it but it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 10>it's more localized.</v>

4603
03:39:05.200 --> 03:39:08.140
<v Speaker 10>But the Mo and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>forgive me by the way,</v>

4604
03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:10.360
<v Speaker 10>Oculus rift people,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I love you,</v>

4605
03:39:10.361 --> 03:39:11.430
<v Speaker 10>carmax.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Coming on soon.</v>

4606
03:39:11.500 --> 03:39:13.570
<v Speaker 10>I had the dk one,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I had the dk two,</v>

4607
03:39:13.710 --> 03:39:15.640
<v Speaker 10>you know John Carmack from again </v>
<v Speaker 10>software.</v>

4608
03:39:15.700 --> 03:39:17.380
<v Speaker 10>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he's an oculus rift now.</v>

4609
03:39:17.410 --> 03:39:18.243
<v Speaker 10>Oculus is great and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and God bless you guys for making vr </v>

4610
03:39:21.191 --> 03:39:22.024
<v Speaker 10>possible because they were the ones of </v>
<v Speaker 10>Palmer luckey ran with this fucking </v>

4611
03:39:25.451 --> 03:39:26.140
<v Speaker 10>torch.</v>

4612
03:39:26.140 --> 03:39:26.973
<v Speaker 10>He like made this fucking happen.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The only problem is the oculus released </v>

4613
03:39:30.490 --> 03:39:33.230
<v Speaker 10>without controllers like vive has.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

4614
03:39:33.800 --> 03:39:36.380
<v Speaker 10>And that was a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So the boxing thing that we saw,</v>

4615
03:39:36.381 --> 03:39:37.910
<v Speaker 10>that was vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that was five,</v>

4616
03:39:38.090 --> 03:39:40.850
<v Speaker 10>but oculus is releasing controllers now.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And honestly,</v>

4617
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.863
<v Speaker 10>now that I'm getting so sucked into Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've actually considered buying an </v>

4618
03:39:45.081 --> 03:39:48.170
<v Speaker 10>oculus rift just so I have both.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But you don't Christ,</v>

4619
03:39:48.171 --> 03:39:48.950
<v Speaker 10>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're deep.</v>

4620
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:50.720
<v Speaker 10>You don't really need it because you </v>
<v Speaker 10>can,</v>

4621
03:39:50.721 --> 03:39:53.780
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>use a something called revive,</v>

4622
03:39:53.781 --> 03:39:56.990
<v Speaker 10>which allows you to play Oculus Games on</v>
<v Speaker 10>the HTC vive.</v>

4623
03:39:57.050 --> 03:39:59.450
<v Speaker 10>You're so deep in this man.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's weird to see.</v>

4624
03:39:59.510 --> 03:40:02.050
<v Speaker 10>It's the coolest fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Just says this is the same.</v>

4625
03:40:02.051 --> 03:40:02.110
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4626
03:40:02.110 --> 03:40:02.943
<v Speaker 5>Dock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was terrified of everquest and </v>

4627
03:40:05.231 --> 03:40:07.810
<v Speaker 5>world of warcraft and all that other </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit that you got sucked into.</v>

4628
03:40:07.811 --> 03:40:09.310
<v Speaker 5>You're not terrified of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a,</v>

4629
03:40:09.320 --> 03:40:12.240
<v Speaker 5>you're just a whole hog diving right in </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

4630
03:40:12.250 --> 03:40:13.083
<v Speaker 5>It feels right.</v>

4631
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:20.360
<v Speaker 6>I love that expression.</v>

4632
03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:22.780
<v Speaker 10>It feels like the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It feels like,</v>

4633
03:40:23.060 --> 03:40:24.130
<v Speaker 10>and it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'll tell you,</v>

<v Speaker 10>who have vr gear and there's just some </v>

4636
03:40:29.771 --> 03:40:34.771
<v Speaker 10>kind of like exciting thing about same </v>
<v Speaker 10>floor ground floor and being like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Pasadena on Friday night.</v>

4641

4646
03:41:00.001 --> 03:41:00.834
<v Speaker 5>before the show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was worried if I was going to be able </v>

4647
03:41:02.011 --> 03:41:02.440
<v Speaker 5>to pull it.</v>

4648

<v Speaker 10>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that breath spray paint,</v>

4649
03:41:04.040 --> 03:41:08.180
<v Speaker 6>playing around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was worried.</v>

4650
03:41:08.650 --> 03:41:10.030
<v Speaker 5>I was worried.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went,</v>

4652

<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I can handle this one </v>

4653
03:41:14.380 --> 03:41:15.213
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a podcast with Sam Harris and I </v>

4654
03:41:16.211 --> 03:41:18.880
<v Speaker 5>took 12 shots of the breast spray for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the podcast.</v>

4655
03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:22.480
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to see what would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I kept going.</v>

4656
03:41:22.660 --> 03:41:26.020
<v Speaker 5>And halfway to the podcast I was like,</v>
