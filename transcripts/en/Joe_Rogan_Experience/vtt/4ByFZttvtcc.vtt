<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>what happened to us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they find out what happened to him?</v>

9
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this stuff is coming out is in</v>

10
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Dutch and Dutch newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm asking all of the Dutch</v>

11
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>community kind of what's happening and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really know.</v>

12
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>You hear different things and rumors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to listen to rumors.</v>

13
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear it from like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete source.</v>

14
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>And we went missing and then they found</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Then they basically found his body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>So why or who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was a great,</v>

17
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Carrie wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Excellent,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

20
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>he was another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But boy,</v>

21
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at him,</v>

22
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>he looked like a computer programmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

24
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting how it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Be so deceiving.</v>

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>It's super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super high level guy.</v>

26
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was my last fight.</v>

27
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from there was actually a really tough,</v>

28
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I never really opened up about it to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest with you.</v>

29
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:04.764
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>a very tough experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:07.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think,</v>

32
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I just win the world title and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>home to Canada,</v>

33
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>which my concussion was pretty bad where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have even gone on a plane</v>

34
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>

35
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm at home and just the concussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>concussions got really bad.</v>

36
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I had to be hospitalized for a few days</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

37
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I was in a dark room for three weeks.</v>

38
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not get out of a dark room for</v>

39
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't walk.</v>

40
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess something with a concussion and</v>

41
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>started causing some neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm nervous,</v>

42
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nerve damage.</v>

43
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>That could be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>So it can cause some nerve damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have X.</v>

45
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I was like in a bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

46
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't even look out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a little red light on my phone</v>

47
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>charger was too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

48
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.350
<v Speaker 1>It was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man in red light on the phone charger</v>

49
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>would hurt your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even look at a thing.</v>

50
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>So it was at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

51
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I just win this world title.</v>

52
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>And it was a really tough time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is actually the first time I've</v>

53
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>really opened up about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a tough experience and it</v>

54
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>being in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>downstate where you're basically in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark room for three weeks.</v>

56
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors were just,</v>

57
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handy me over shit ton of percosets and</v>

58
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>oxies to kind of deal with the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

59
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:13.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

60
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>it was a tough time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

61
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>And it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what was the hardest was what</v>

62
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>was happening mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there and being like,</v>

63
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want a world.</v>

64
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

65
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do so much in this sport.</v>

66
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>And my goal was to be a legend in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>

67
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>and then it got to the point I saw my</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and how much it was affecting my</v>

69
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I decided that,</v>

70
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put this,</v>

71
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrest for a little bit.</v>

72
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>So you win the fight and after the fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>is over,</v>

73
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>was it immediately that you knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>something was wrong?</v>

74
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some adrenaline rush and I did the</v>

75
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>post fight press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was fine.</v>

76
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got back to the hotel room and I</v>

77
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>was throwing up and couldn't leave my</v>
<v Speaker 1>room and I was surprised that even got</v>

78
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>on an airplane home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctors in Canada or like,</v>

79
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>how the heck did you get on an airplane</v>
<v Speaker 1>home?</v>

80
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So it was scary times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

81
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And it took a lot of good mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

82
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of it.</v>

83
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm actually in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a position where I'm super happy and</v>

84
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that whole color commentary role</v>

85
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>with Gloria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been incredible.</v>

86
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pr,</v>

87
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem was that saturated</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat was demonized.</v>

88
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was demonized in a very corrupt way,</v>

89
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

90
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>the recent New York Times article that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was released,</v>

91
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>which was a mindblower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which detailed how the sugar industry</v>

92
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>had bribed scientists to release data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blaming saturated fat for heart disease</v>

93
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>and obesity and all these issues when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in fact sugar that was causing all</v>

94
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

95
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So they were literally rigging the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and paying scientists and it was</v>

96
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>a horrible article because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda and these lies that they</v>

97
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in the 50s.</v>

98
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Here it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the sugar industry shifted the blame</v>

99
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>to fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's if you get a chance and you</v>

100
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>want to feel sick at what can be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>with money,</v>

101
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>watch or read that because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>

102
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>It is really awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

103
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>it was an internal sugar industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>document that was discovered by a</v>

104
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>researcher at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>California in San Francisco and it was</v>

105
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it said Monday when this was out,</v>

106
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was a couple of months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

107
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>but it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It suggested that five decades of</v>

108
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>research into the role of nutrition in</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease,</v>

109
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>including many of today's dietary</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommendations may have been largely</v>

110
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>shaped by the sugar industry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda and money.</v>

111
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.510
<v Speaker 1>They spent money to literally bribe</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists to release false data.</v>

112
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really nasty,</v>

113
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the thing is not that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money either.</v>

114
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to it.</v>

115
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They paid three Harvard scientists,</v>

116
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:51.361
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent of $50,000 in today's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars to publish in 1967 review of</v>

117
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>research on sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
