18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even come close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a years of Jujitsu,</v>

19
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>years of trying to keep people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>choking me,</v>

20
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>my instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a little too jumpy.</v>

21
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

22
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Too much quick movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to calm that shit down.</v>

26
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>bow hunting is pretty much the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking than Jujitsu.</v>

27
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Cause Jujitsu,</v>

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.623
<v Speaker 1>you gotta keep you gotta constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to constantly be protecting </v>

29
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>yourself and move in and trying to close</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deal.</v>

30
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Bowhunting is like steady.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:46.584

<v Speaker 1>so you can imagine and their legs are </v>

40
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>just obviously balancing all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their legs.</v>

41
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>It just got to be jacked into those big </v>
<v Speaker 1>claws.</v>

42
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I would try to relate it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

43
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>have you ever tried to hold down a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a house cat that doesn't want to be half</v>

44
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

45
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.563
<v Speaker 1>So they have little tiny claws match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a wall would be with those jack </v>

46
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>legs and big claws could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's wild.</v>

47
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a wild cat.</v>

48
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I had a feral cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that window?</v>

49
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your cute little fellow.</v>

50
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

51
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not real.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll look at the clause on those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't know if it'll show cause </v>

55
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

56
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they have teeth like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

57
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>See those front?</v>

<v Speaker 1>nuts and shitty.</v>

<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

63
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very similar to Kangaroos.</v>

64
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It was not a real teeth though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't photoshopped.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>stepchild of Kangaroos because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of more hunched over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that tree and then the guy filming it.</v>

144
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.283

<v Speaker 2>See the bird hopping around on the </v>

145
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bird that fell out of a nest.</v>

151
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 2>What a Predator is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the speed,</v>

152
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.323
<v Speaker 2>the speed that deer shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it just shows you how opportunistic </v>

153
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 2>live animals are.</v>

154
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some,</v>

155
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>something in that deer's body tells it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat that thing.</v>

156
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.543
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no compassion out there for </v>

157
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No watch animal.</v>

161
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life.</v>

162
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:29.264
<v Speaker 2>It's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird to see a deer for some </v>

163
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eat a bird and do it on purpose.</v>

164
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Like he's all excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

165
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>

166
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 2>He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>

167
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of wildlife thing.</v>

168
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

169
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 2>they were doing some sort of a survey </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the captured these birds with a net.</v>

170
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.390
<v Speaker 2>They had this net set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

171
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.243
<v Speaker 2>in this area where these birds fly just </v>
<v Speaker 2>so they could capture these particular </v>

172
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:52.724
<v Speaker 2>birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the deer kept eating the birds and </v>

173
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't figure it out.</v>

174
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is going on here?</v>

175
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:58.214
<v Speaker 2>And then they watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a video of these deer walking </v>

176
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:01.304
<v Speaker 2>up and picking them off the net and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating these birds while the birds like </v>

177
00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Jay's house.</v>

178
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting eaten by a deer.</v>

179
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that every day?</v>

180
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I'm not surprised.</v>

181
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised either.</v>

182
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I've seen cows do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This video is a cows doing it.</v>

183
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:15.824
<v Speaker 2>For the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people didn't think that they thought </v>

184
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:20.230
<v Speaker 2>those are just herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

186
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.073
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature's just set them up to be super </v>

187
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.114
<v Speaker 2>slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if something really delicious is in </v>

188
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 2>front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was an Eddie Bravo thing.</v>

189
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this conspiracy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's not an Eddie Bravo conspiracy.</v>

192
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.610

<v Speaker 2>conspiracies,</v>

193

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super.</v>

226
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

227
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is still not even their summer,</v>

228
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's still very warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

229
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 1>where we were up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

230
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>hunting buffalo at the top man is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they call,</v>

231
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>which is out of Darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 90 to a hundred degrees.</v>

232
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.670

<v Speaker 1>now this is a freshwater crocodile,</v>

233
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:12.504
<v Speaker 1>which is not as big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as big or as aggressive as a </v>

234
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 1>saltwater Croc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could still definitely do damage.</v>

235
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 1>And this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.290
<v Speaker 1>a mere feet from where we were sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the,</v>

237
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.283
<v Speaker 1>where we'd go and take baths and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just kind of cooled down during the </v>

238
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>heat of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where he was right there.</v>

239
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>And how big is that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

240
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>

241
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

242
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>eight feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

243
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't huge,</v>

244
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.920
<v Speaker 1>but he definitely do some damage and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hold of Ya.</v>

245
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys see any of the salt water </v>
<v Speaker 1>once while you're there?</v>

246
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.641
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

247
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:48.960
<v Speaker 1>So when you were telling me about this a</v>
<v Speaker 1>one pond that was near you guys,</v>

248
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>where you saw eyes at night and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't think of that was,</v>

249
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was right there.</v>

250
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first night we saw the one,</v>

251
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 1>just that one right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went over there and videoed him and,</v>

252
00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.893
<v Speaker 1>and checked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next night Adam went down </v>

253
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 1>there to the creek and it was only about</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 15,</v>

254
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>20 feet across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just small,</v>

255
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>just very shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

256
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 1>he looked down and said there was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>six sets of eyes,</v>

257
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>red eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crocodile.</v>

258
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was,</v>

259
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd moved in.</v>

260
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>So have you ever seen a live salt water </v>
<v Speaker 1>one in the wild?</v>

261
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.603
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we did the last time I hunted </v>

262
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to remember.</v>

263
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when we were flying.</v>

264
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

265
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>when we were flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw him.</v>

266
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

267
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>cause so you have to take a flight from </v>
<v Speaker 1>where Adam lives.</v>

268
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Adam lives near Melbourne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

269
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sydney,</v>

270
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.823
<v Speaker 1>New South Wales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fly four and a half hours to Darwin </v>

271
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 1>toward these water buffalo are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

272
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.340
<v Speaker 1>And then w w last time we used a </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter to get out of Darwin to,</v>

273
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 1>and that was four hours in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>

274
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this time we had a helicopter and</v>

275
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:00.554
<v Speaker 1>so we flew the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of look at it and we saw some </v>

276
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 1>pretty big crocs from there on the river</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

277
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 1>So how do you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to stop?</v>

278
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Like when your buffalo hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know where to go?</v>

279
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I mean basically it's however far </v>

280
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:19.500
<v Speaker 1>you can walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean you kind of get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were walking,</v>

282
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say at least 10 miles a day.</v>

283
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.413
<v Speaker 1>10 10 to I think Adam and his guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time his camera guy walked 18 miles </v>

284
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 1>one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were just,</v>

285
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always,</v>

286
00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:36.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

287
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:37.440
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 miles a day.</v>

288
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>So just covering country.</v>

289
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.263
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hard hunting up there right now </v>

290
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>because this is their wet season or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tail end of their wet season.</v>

291
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And so the foliage was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really grown up really thick.</v>

292
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So it was very hard to see the buffalo </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally,</v>

293
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later when we went,</v>

294
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.333
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all burnt up because of summer and </v>

295
00:11:58.121 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 3>said there's no foliage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

296
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:00.484
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see the buffalo from miles </v>

297
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with this grass,</v>

298
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 3>the grass is in some places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

299
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 3>eight feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

300
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:10.050
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to be 50 yards away to see a </v>
<v Speaker 3>buffalo and they're,</v>

301
00:12:10.051 --> 00:12:11.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1800,</v>

302
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 3>1800 to 2000 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

303
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.873
<v Speaker 3>it's makes it hard to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it also makes it dangerous to </v>

304
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:20.030
<v Speaker 3>trail them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

305
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 3>if your blood trailing him or if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you just surprise one,</v>

306
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

307
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you surprise an animal that close a wild</v>

308
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 3>animal like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who knows how they're gonna react.</v>

309
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge animal.</v>

310
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

311
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 3>and with that grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

312
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

313
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.323
<v Speaker 3>Adam and I did a and the camera guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a podcast up there and we were </v>

314
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 3>kind of talking about the challenges of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hunt and uh,</v>

315
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.253
<v Speaker 3>that was a big part of it is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just not being able to see very much </v>

316
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:47.980
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

317
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 3>And so people never hunt buffalo this </v>
<v Speaker 3>time of year.</v>

318
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.331
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

319
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:53.670
<v Speaker 3>why would you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna,</v>

320
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody goes this time and we just want </v>

321
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:56.963
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

322
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.930
<v Speaker 3>they go later in the year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

323
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's not so much foliage.</v>

324
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 3>So they go like in their fall there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

325
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 3>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

326
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:07.204
<v Speaker 3>last time I went is December,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just before the West season </v>

327
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:10.084
<v Speaker 3>starts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the tail end of the wet season </v>

328
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:12.184
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were thinking about when we want </v>

329
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:17.190
<v Speaker 3>to take you up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be around November,</v>

330
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.860
<v Speaker 3>October,</v>
<v Speaker 3>November.</v>

331
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Cause you don't want to get stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the wet season,</v>

332
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 3>hit big rains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

333
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want it.</v>

334
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.313
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also it makes it easier to find the </v>

335
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 3>animals because there's not water </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere right now.</v>

336
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 3>There's water everywhere so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be concentrated to get water.</v>

337
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.753
<v Speaker 3>But later in the year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those lot of the water sources have </v>

338
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 3>dried up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you've got a good water hole,</v>

339
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

340
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 3>every animal is coming there.</v>

341
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these are for people who don't know.</v>

342
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.233
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an invasive species of water </v>

343
00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:49.310
<v Speaker 2>buffalo and enormous Asian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is it called?</v>

344
00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just called Asian water buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the actual name of it?</v>

345
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Thank it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or yeah,</v>

346
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.370
<v Speaker 3>there might be an ah Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just call them Asian water buffaloes.</v>

347
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.750
<v Speaker 3>That seems like there's a c in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

348
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Asiatic or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

349
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Jamie can look at Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look it up.</v>

350
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

351
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.100
<v Speaker 3>such a wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool looking animal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a him at full draw or would the </v>

382
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.330
<v Speaker 2>that's looking through the riser of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bow.</v>

383
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's that bowl coming in.</v>

384
00:15:09.131 --> 00:15:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

385
00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.720
<v Speaker 3>you can see his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just pissed off and that's,</v>

386
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.823
<v Speaker 3>he was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's at under 20 yards and he's not </v>

387
00:15:17.711 --> 00:15:18.544
<v Speaker 3>stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I shot him there frontal through </v>

388
00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:24.190
<v Speaker 3>the chest and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to,</v>

389
00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:25.990
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like self defense.</v>

390
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.163
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are animals that if hunters </v>

391
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 2>don't go up there and kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually hire people to go up there</v>

392
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:34.260
<v Speaker 2>and killed him right there.</v>

393
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

394
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean these things have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has spread disease up there.</v>

395
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:39.374
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

396
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.253
<v Speaker 3>a non native species and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any water source up there is ruined any </v>

397
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 3>natural habitat has been ruined because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many buffalo.</v>

398
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 3>So they just want him killed basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

399
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like similar to coyotes here,</v>

400
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of 2000 pounds or yeah.</v>

401
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Predators either.</v>

402
00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing else to kill him.</v>

403
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe a CROC could kill a small one.</v>

404
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

405
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:05.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just need,</v>

406
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:07.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Coyote's down here in North America,</v>

407
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:08.654
<v Speaker 3>don't ruin water sources and ruin </v>
<v Speaker 3>habitat like these things do these </v>

408
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:12.590
<v Speaker 3>things that are just wrecking machines </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

409
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.890
<v Speaker 3>there's hundreds of thousands of them up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

410
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.220
<v Speaker 2>So they ruined Walsh water sources for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the native animals as well.</v>

411
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I call the free things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>

412
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause they shit and Piss in the water.</v>

413
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:24.973
<v Speaker 2>Well it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia is so strange and a as is New </v>

415
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Zealand in that all these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>imported animals,</v>

416
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 2>they're in the 18 hundreds and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess even before was it,</v>

417
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.510
<v Speaker 2>when did they establish Australia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand?</v>

418
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.553
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget when they these to see if you </v>

419
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.624
<v Speaker 2>could find out when they established,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about this recently with Josh </v>

420
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.473
<v Speaker 2>Zaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't we?</v>

421
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.673
<v Speaker 2>But they um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brought in all these animals with </v>

422
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:48.224
<v Speaker 2>no game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just let them loose and then they </v>

423
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 2>let the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

424
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.340
<v Speaker 2>So in New Zealand they have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful stags,</v>

425
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.203
<v Speaker 2>these incredible animals and at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>places they have to shoot them at of </v>

426
00:16:58.791 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 2>helicopters just to control the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

427
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:05.000
<v Speaker 2>which we're it for people in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like unheard of.</v>

428
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Like how could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's that's,</v>

429
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.230
<v Speaker 2>that's like an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a majestic animal.</v>

430
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:10.064
<v Speaker 2>You're going to shoot him out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopters to just leave them there to </v>

431
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:11.750
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

432
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 3>It's way different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

433
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:13.784
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up there,</v>

434
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.833
<v Speaker 3>there's just not enough hunters because </v>
<v Speaker 3>in all of Australia they say there's as </v>

435
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 3>many people as there are in la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the La area here in the whole country,</v>

436
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Saint New Zealand says it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

437
00:17:26.621 --> 00:17:30.070
<v Speaker 2>The first European explored a sight New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zealand was able,</v>

438
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Jan's Zune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what name Jan Zune Tasmin on the 13th of</v>

439
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.413
<v Speaker 2>December in 1642 but that's obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a European people been there for a </v>

440
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:43.930
<v Speaker 2>long fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

441
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.943
<v Speaker 2>And Australia was 1788 and shortly </v>
<v Speaker 2>thereafter then they bringing in all </v>

442
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>these</v>

443
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 1>animals and the idea was that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make it like a European hunting</v>

444
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

445
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.963
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for rich,</v>

446
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 1>the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

447
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.843
<v Speaker 1>w what Douche bags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they released all these animals but </v>

448
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:06.070
<v Speaker 1>with no predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 1>And so people were going to come over </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Europe and they were going to go to</v>

450
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Australia and hot the rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that,</v>

451
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.543
<v Speaker 1>and they told me that seems like it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1985 they're going to wipe out all </v>

452
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 1>the buffalo and they had some money </v>
<v Speaker 1>funded for it and they were going to try</v>

453
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of them and they got halfway </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and quit.</v>

454
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 1>They killed like half of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

455
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:30.114
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

456
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Speaker 1>And then they quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now it was just as I was saying,</v>

457
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.700
<v Speaker 1>the whole country is about the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

458
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:36.534
<v Speaker 1>You were telling me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did know that the whole country </v>

459
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.000
<v Speaker 1>has the same amount of people's live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>la here.</v>

460
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 1>So there's just not that many hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

461
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:44.604
<v Speaker 1>a small percentage of them are hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's nobody to control all these </v>

462
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:47.994
<v Speaker 1>number of non native species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's from a water buffalo to the </v>

463
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>fallow deer that I was hunting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagger.</v>

464
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Speaker 1>There's not as many stags is fallow </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>

465
00:18:57.871 --> 00:18:59.850
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these species just,</v>

466
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 1>there's no measure for control really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

467
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And they brought in a bunch of other non</v>
<v Speaker 1>native species to,</v>

468
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.433
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an exercise in conservation gone </v>

469
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 1>totally wrong because they brought in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Katz to take care of certain animals and</v>

470
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:14.364
<v Speaker 1>they brought in Fox and then the Fox and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cats are out of control and they </v>

471
00:19:17.251 --> 00:19:18.084
<v Speaker 1>kill all the ground nesting birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's Kinda fucked up to us here </v>

472
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:25.530
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people in Australia hunt cats,</v>

473

<v Speaker 1>them the way in the hold 'em up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

505
00:20:21.361 --> 00:20:22.380
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

506
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that have researched it in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in North America,</v>

507
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.980
<v Speaker 1>a cats kill somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood of 3 billion birds a year.</v>

508
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billion.</v>

509
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That when they found that out,</v>

510
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.880
<v Speaker 1>like apparently like scientists were </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked.</v>

511
00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:43.881
<v Speaker 1>The biologists were shocked is between </v>
<v Speaker 1>1.5 and three point something billion.</v>

512
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's not even counting like mice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rabbits.</v>

513
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 1>All the other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed squirrels.</v>

514
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a cap.</v>

515
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.330
<v Speaker 1>They used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

516
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I used to live across street from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>park and uh,</v>

517
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I had this one male cat and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a murderer.</v>

518
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.273
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget watching him walk </v>

519
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:06.040
<v Speaker 1>across this a park with a squirrel </v>
<v Speaker 1>between his legs.</v>

520
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.350
<v Speaker 1>So he was biting down the squirrels </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>

521
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.433
<v Speaker 1>the squirrels dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the squirrel was his size </v>

522
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:14.000
<v Speaker 1>practically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was in between his leg.</v>

523
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 1>So He's straddling it and walking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

524
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 1>dragging it along so you could show it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

525
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was super psyched.</v>

526
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

527
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what I got.</v>

528
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a large percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his weight right there.</v>

529
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:29.460
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was probably no bullshit.</v>

530
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.020
<v Speaker 1>At least three quarters the size of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

531
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.570
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a big cat and it was a fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking squirrel.</v>

532
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:35.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

533
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.450
<v Speaker 1>that probably would've been a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>

534
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:38.993
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The adverse squirrel cats are the </v>

535
00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:43.840
<v Speaker 1>weirdest animals man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're cool with us,</v>

536
00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 1>but they're straight killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

537
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 1>But the only story I remember about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat,</v>

538
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember where I heard it or who</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me,</v>

539
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

540
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:54.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was one of my cop friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

541
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

542
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.463
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

543
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>like an old say it's an elderly person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a dog,</v>

544
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 1>they die.</v>

545
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.180
<v Speaker 1>The dog is that people come and find the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body that,</v>

546
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 1>and the dog's laying there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

547
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 1>just like a loyal whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

548
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 1>if a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have a cat and they die,</v>

549
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the cat eats our eyelids and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lips.</v>

550
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right away.</v>

551
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 1>If you stop feeding that cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat's like,</v>

552
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating it looked like knits owner.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

554
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.213
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really all you need to know </v>

555
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:23.530
<v Speaker 1>about a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat each other too.</v>

556
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crazy old people.</v>

557
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this one lady who was a hoarder </v>

558
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.713
<v Speaker 1>and she had a bunch of dead cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had so many cats in our house and </v>

559
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.240
<v Speaker 1>the cats had died and so she wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding the cats.</v>

560
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.860
<v Speaker 1>The cats were eating the dead cat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cameron Hanes,</v>

563
00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.100

<v Speaker 1>Doesn't even let me go out,</v>

565
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.570
<v Speaker 1>let me out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill some birds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we need to be out in live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

569
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 1>that two and a half weeks I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

570
00:22:55.571 --> 00:22:56.900
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

571
00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:57.883
<v Speaker 1>I took two showers a whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be asleep bag and it must smell </v>

572
00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:03.130
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a hey,</v>

573
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.143
<v Speaker 1>that's just how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people are supposed to </v>

574
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 1>smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even tell.</v>

575
00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:10.030
<v Speaker 1>We're just used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

576
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've just,</v>

577
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 1>for the viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a clean pr.</v>

578
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.673
<v Speaker 1>I'd take a couple of hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know when you're hunting that's </v>

579
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:18.710
<v Speaker 1>just the way it goes.</v>

586
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys are walking on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>frozen glass.</v>

587
00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:40.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

588
00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:41.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is covered with Frost.</v>

589
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.320
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it was night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was freezing,</v>

590
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like 32</v>

591
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.050
<v Speaker 3>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were used to,</v>

592
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 3>we thought we were going to be hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 90 to a hundred degree weather.</v>

593
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:51.411
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

594
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:52.520
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

595
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:53.354
<v Speaker 3>when you're laying in a sleeping bag </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's only rated to 40 degrees in his </v>

596
00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:59.270
<v Speaker 3>32 and sleeping on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's rough.</v>

597
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:00.403
<v Speaker 3>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you're saying that those deer were </v>

598
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 3>like super turned on to where like there</v>
<v Speaker 3>were tuned in,</v>

599
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 3>like they were very skinny edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been hunted and uh,</v>

600
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have lions like we have here,</v>

601
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 3>which keeps the deer on edge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

602
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 3>cause we have lions are just killers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

603
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a Predator like that,</v>

604
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:25.841
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an antelope specie and or it's a,</v>

605
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.740
<v Speaker 3>they can see so well and so fast </v>
<v Speaker 3>reacting.</v>

606
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.050
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they,</v>

607
00:24:33.051 --> 00:24:34.460
<v Speaker 3>this is a fallow deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

608
00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what do they relate it to?</v>

609
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

610
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 3>I just said it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said an antelope,</v>

611
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure if once I said it I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

612
00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:46.130
<v Speaker 3>are they so don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't quote me on that.</v>

613
00:24:46.131 --> 00:24:46.964
<v Speaker 3>We might have to look that one up too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But all I know is the reason why I said </v>

614
00:24:49.461 --> 00:24:50.294
<v Speaker 3>that is because they can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean antelope and a torres for having </v>

615
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.750
<v Speaker 3>amazing vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

616
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:56.690
<v Speaker 3>10 times what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what humans have apparently.</v>

617
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.920
<v Speaker 3>And that's how these were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

618
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if the deer antelope or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

619
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:05.000
<v Speaker 3>but they can see extremely well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were seeing you from like a long</v>

620
00:25:05.001 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 3>ways out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you couldn't,</v>

621
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.333
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was this one buck out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stock and I had a cameraman with me and </v>

622
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 3>that the key for stalking animals is </v>
<v Speaker 3>always staying in the shade.</v>

623
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:17.803
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you stay in the shade and you got </v>

624
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 3>Cammo on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're in the sun,</v>

625
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 3>you know how it is looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking into,</v>

626
00:25:23.781 --> 00:25:24.614
<v Speaker 3>if you're in the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tried to look into a house you can't </v>

627
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:26.390
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

628
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same thing with shadow.</v>

629
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:29.780
<v Speaker 3>So you always have mitch out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

630
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.320
<v Speaker 3>we were 330 yards away from this buck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was stocking,</v>

631
00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:34.154
<v Speaker 3>he was feeding in this creek and we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>this small patch of sunlight to cross </v>

632
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.300
<v Speaker 3>330 yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a long way away.</v>

633
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.260
<v Speaker 3>And I told the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

634
00:25:43.261 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just got to get across here.</v>

635
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Just stay low and get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

636
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 3>hustle through there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we hunched over and got in seconds.</v>

637
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 3>We were through there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to the shade,</v>

638
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 3>looked over at the buck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He standing there staring.</v>

639
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

640
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 3>How He's already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're in the shade.</v>

641
00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 3>So then for sure we weren't moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

642
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:06.440
<v Speaker 3>don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's just staring,</v>

643
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 3>staring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>staring and staring.</v>

644
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't move.</v>

645
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.633
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

646
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't move.</v>

647
00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:13.244
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on.</v>

648
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.710
<v Speaker 3>He's just looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything is going to spook them.</v>

649
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not moving.</v>

650
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.880
<v Speaker 3>And he was crouched down on his knees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so finally the buck like took a few,</v>

651
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

652
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 3>bites or grass and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

653
00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 3>he's feeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next thing gone.</v>

654
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 3>So all he did is took a couple bites of </v>
<v Speaker 3>grass for the road.</v>

655
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:34.761
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

656
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I already know about a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm taking this with me.</v>

657
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.020
<v Speaker 3>And he was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

658
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:40.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're smart.</v>

659
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.040
<v Speaker 3>That's long rifle range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had bows.</v>

660
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.970
<v Speaker 3>It's just a barely this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

661
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 3>and we have to get close with a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you can imagine it just if that,</v>

662
00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:53.040
<v Speaker 3>that one example tells you what it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like basically.</v>

663
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.710
<v Speaker 4>So we were talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

664
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.150
<v Speaker 4>both setups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you had brought to both setups.</v>

665
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.560
<v Speaker 4>He brought one for deer and you bought </v>
<v Speaker 4>one for Buffalo.</v>

666
00:27:02.561 --> 00:27:07.540
<v Speaker 4>So for people that don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two different ways that you were</v>

667
00:27:07.541 --> 00:27:08.374
<v Speaker 4>going to approach this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The buffalo is a giant heavy boned </v>

668
00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:13.570
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a real heavy Arrow,</v>

669
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:17.980
<v Speaker 4>which is going to go slower and those </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours are just too slow for those deer.</v>

670
00:27:17.981 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 4>And the deer would actually move out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way before the Arab.</v>

671
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

672
00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.510
<v Speaker 3>Like Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

673
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.660
<v Speaker 3>it Wa it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

674
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.020
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing with penetration with an Arrow</v>

675
00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:29.883
<v Speaker 3>is weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way to the Arrow equates to more </v>

676
00:27:32.471 --> 00:27:33.304
<v Speaker 3>penetration with heavy bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know that we talked about the </v>

677
00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:39.820
<v Speaker 3>buffalo 1800 to 2000 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you need something that hits hard.</v>

678
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a heavier Arrow,</v>

679
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.653
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna fly slower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those were flying at 245 feet a </v>

680
00:27:46.181 --> 00:27:49.420
<v Speaker 3>second out of my high poundage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bo and I thought,</v>

681
00:27:49.421 --> 00:27:51.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good enough.</v>

682
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

683
00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.910
<v Speaker 3>these will be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was shooting it so well.</v>

684
00:27:54.911 --> 00:27:56.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm so accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

685
00:27:56.171 --> 00:27:58.660
<v Speaker 3>practicing not to 90 yards all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't really well.</v>

686
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.310
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

687
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.950
<v Speaker 3>I know it's supposed to be for Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to use it for deer.</v>

688
00:28:02.951 --> 00:28:03.784
<v Speaker 3>So the first week there I tried it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>deer and it was just like these deer </v>

689
00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.020
<v Speaker 3>were seemingly 10 yards away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but having the Arrow got two minutes.</v>

690
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking a long shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

691
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.710
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was just a fluke,</v>

692
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.390
<v Speaker 3>just a flu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would see it,</v>

693
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.523
<v Speaker 3>hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would hear it and they would duck </v>

694
00:28:18.731 --> 00:28:21.280
<v Speaker 3>out of the way or just be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

695
00:28:21.281 --> 00:28:24.400
<v Speaker 3>just like be 10 yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would move out of the way before</v>

696
00:28:24.401 --> 00:28:25.430
<v Speaker 3>the area got to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

697
00:28:25.431 --> 00:28:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

698
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.750
<v Speaker 3>so the finally I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe it's just in a super calm.</v>

699
00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:33.460
<v Speaker 3>They're so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so quiet.</v>

700
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.353
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know my bose or quiet a heavy </v>

701
00:28:35.531 --> 00:28:37.330
<v Speaker 3>arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes a bow even quieter,</v>

702
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it absorbs that sound.</v>

703
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.210
<v Speaker 3>And the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your limbs aren't just like that.</v>

704
00:28:43.211 --> 00:28:44.044
<v Speaker 3>There is more of like an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it still makes an always on a super </v>

705
00:28:46.511 --> 00:28:50.770
<v Speaker 3>calm windless day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's cold,</v>

706
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:51.783
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just that sound's going to </v>

707
00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:53.584
<v Speaker 3>get across her.</v>

708
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.630
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe it's just a fluke.</v>

709
00:28:55.631 --> 00:28:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the deer were pick something up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pickup some movement.</v>

710
00:28:59.441 --> 00:29:02.890
<v Speaker 3>So they were just on me and is whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not worried about it,</v>

711
00:29:02.891 --> 00:29:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not used to missing,</v>

712
00:29:04.301 --> 00:29:05.134
<v Speaker 3>I'm used to be very disciplined on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>shots and taking high percentage shots </v>

713
00:29:10.421 --> 00:29:13.450
<v Speaker 3>that relaxed animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I do do my stock right,</v>

714
00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.523
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goal is always to shoot an animal </v>

715
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.330
<v Speaker 3>that has no idea on there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

716
00:29:19.331 --> 00:29:21.990
<v Speaker 3>so it's relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

717
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.550
<v Speaker 3>so that wasn't happening here and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

718
00:29:24.551 --> 00:29:26.890
<v Speaker 3>well maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's just because they're high,</v>

719
00:29:26.891 --> 00:29:28.510
<v Speaker 3>strong and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were on me.</v>

720
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.910
<v Speaker 3>So what would the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

721
00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.760
<v Speaker 3>the time where I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

722
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.280
<v Speaker 3>these arrows aren't going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a wild boar.</v>

723
00:29:36.281 --> 00:29:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big boar,</v>

724
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.960
<v Speaker 3>45 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

725
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 3>this should be</v>

726
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 1>slam dunk money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I co camera over my shoulder.</v>

727
00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 1>He had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were there.</v>

728
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Drawback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>

729
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 1>And he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was facing,</v>

730
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his head to the left and he was heading </v>

731
00:29:55.661 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>back to the right probably a few feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>away by the time the Arrow got there.</v>

732
00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even have to even,</v>

733
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I like shot and went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

734
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that gone?</v>

735
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:09.230
<v Speaker 1>That fast spun and just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then at that time I,</v>

736
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:09.911
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

737
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:11.500
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not going to work.</v>

738
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy because although there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no predators,</v>

739
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:18.790
<v Speaker 1>they're the hunters that are there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there all the time.</v>

740
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

741
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.063
<v Speaker 1>there's no season sees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals are just tuned in there hunting </v>

742
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

743
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it mostly rifle.</v>

744
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're used to,</v>

745
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.763
<v Speaker 1>if they see somebody that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger because they've been shot at </v>

746
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:34.660
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

747
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of yards.</v>

748
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

749
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was challenging.</v>

750
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:40.541
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

751
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.160
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I changed from those,</v>

752
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>245 grain arrows and I thought,</v>

753
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:46.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to shoot my,</v>

754
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:48.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not 245,</v>

755
00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:49.534
<v Speaker 1>245 feet per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 687 green arrow to a lighter </v>

756
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:53.501
<v Speaker 1>arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

757
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:55.660
<v Speaker 1>well maybe this will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

758
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it shooting 300 feet per second?</v>

759
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 1>At that time did you change products?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

760
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Did you go to the tow car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

761
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.290
<v Speaker 1>You step with the solids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

762
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I shot a with above flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually,</v>

763
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny actually what I ended up </v>

764
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 1>killing the deer with two was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

765
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 1>what were the magnus stingers and I also</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

766
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 1>but they expand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that expandable head.</v>

767
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that one that I used on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bear?</v>

768
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.770
<v Speaker 1>It was a grave digger grave digger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

769
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:27.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

770
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 1>That'll ruthless name that head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

771
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.780
<v Speaker 1>that had flies so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

772
00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 1>is money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So use that as well.</v>

773
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're out there man,</v>

774
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.880
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're around Sydney,</v>

775
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.430
<v Speaker 1>which is where people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

776
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 1>there's those animals are hunted pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty regularly,</v>

777
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.103
<v Speaker 1>but then you're taking that flight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>four and a half hours and then a </v>

778
00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:49.564
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in the area where the </v>

779
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:53.380
<v Speaker 1>buffalo are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nobody out there.</v>

780
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's remote.</v>

781
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.310
<v Speaker 1>That is a wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild place.</v>

782
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 1>When you think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of Australia,</v>

783
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the size of North America with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people as Los Angeles,</v>

784
00:32:04.391 --> 00:32:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but the area where you're at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that is as wild as it gets.</v>

785
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean w w you fly those four and a half</v>

786
00:32:10.751 --> 00:32:11.584
<v Speaker 1>hour from Sydney to Darwin and most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there you're looking down at </v>

787
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.200
<v Speaker 1>country with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

788
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.960
<v Speaker 1>no roads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

789
00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.070
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

790
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:21.993
<v Speaker 1>that's a large majority of Australia is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and it's just overrun with </v>

791
00:32:25.841 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

792
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

793
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's crazy punch.</v>

794
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that we did find some,</v>

795
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:35.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.210
<v Speaker 1>some drawings up there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

797
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.160
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

798
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.063
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

799
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.790
<v Speaker 2>all the natives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

800
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the aborigines.</v>

801
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.143
<v Speaker 2>And did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you know that those were there </v>

802
00:32:45.891 --> 00:32:48.070
<v Speaker 2>before you went there to doubt them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that there were the pilot,</v>

803
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 2>the pilot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

804
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we wanted to go see him.</v>

805
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are they in a cave like where they're</v>

806
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

807
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.241
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

808
00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:57.074
<v Speaker 2>whether or not to get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be on like the underside of a </v>

809
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 2>rock where we went and we filmed under </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

810
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:02.954
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could imagine people getting out of </v>

811
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:09.190
<v Speaker 2>the rain there and they're huge boulders</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're getting,</v>

812
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.630
<v Speaker 2>and it was just a perfect spot to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>dry.</v>

813
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.580
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the rain was,</v>

814
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>if they drew on a part of the rock where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rain was hitting,</v>

815
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>obviously it was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in these,</v>

816
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 2>these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were protected.</v>

817
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 2>So drawings were still there.</v>

818
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Last Time Adam was here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about,</v>

819
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the aborigines there and explain</v>

820
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 2>some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when we went back to my house,</v>

821
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.081
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

822
00:33:30.081 --> 00:33:30.914
<v Speaker 2>we had dinner and we sat around talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he told me some crazy stories about </v>

823
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.390
<v Speaker 2>the horrors if those people face and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had been wiped out.</v>

824
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.253
<v Speaker 2>Like they had been poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he went to this one cave and he </v>

825
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:44.180
<v Speaker 2>found bones all through this cave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

826
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:45.014
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like human bones and he's like </v>

827
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 2>children's bones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd find children's bones.</v>

828
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.533
<v Speaker 2>And then he had heard this story from </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the other aborigines that live </v>

829
00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:54.734
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone had brought food to all </v>

830
00:33:57.021 --> 00:33:57.854
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the aborigines there and just </v>

831
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:01.310
<v Speaker 2>poisoned the food and just killed them </v>
<v Speaker 2>all off.</v>

832
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

833
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.220
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

834
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 2>It's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

835
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.740
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't know.</v>

836
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.013
<v Speaker 2>They don't know who made those </v>
<v Speaker 2>hieroglyphs are there or the cave </v>

837
00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:13.220
<v Speaker 2>drawings or whatever.</v>

838
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.720
<v Speaker 2>They weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or when they did it either.</v>

839
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they say,</v>

840
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:17.683
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it up on my instagram page and I </v>

841
00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:21.044
<v Speaker 2>saw some comments there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're saying that the more </v>

842
00:34:22.821 --> 00:34:25.460
<v Speaker 2>brightly colored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the older they are.</v>

843
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know.</v>

844
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.460
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the pilot mentioned 10,000 years</v>

845
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:32.294
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

846
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I was just guessing the Flexi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

847
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you just threw that out there.</v>

848
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:40.310
<v Speaker 2>How would you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just something,</v>

849
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure somebody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

850
00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:43.370
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That studies that,</v>

851
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.233
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure this is probably a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like when you think about the </v>

852
00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:50.360
<v Speaker 2>actual numbers of how much land you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

853
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:53.450
<v Speaker 2>how few people live out there and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of those things are probably there.</v>

854
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.493
<v Speaker 2>And also one of the things that Adam was</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me that's crazy as you could </v>

855
00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.870
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

856
00:34:57.871 --> 00:35:00.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they refer to themselves,</v>

857
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a aborigines.</v>

858
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 2>They call themselves a mob like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>

859
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:06.650
<v Speaker 2>instead of a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mob and they're like,</v>

860
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:09.080
<v Speaker 2>there could be one mob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said there could be a mob.</v>

861
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.590
<v Speaker 2>He goes full kilometers away and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak a totally different language.</v>

862
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

863
00:35:13.101 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what I go,</v>

864
00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 2>how many languages are there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

865
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds what?</v>

866
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds.</v>

867
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they can't talk to each other.</v>

868
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:21.134
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

869
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no written language.</v>

870
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

871
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.180
<v Speaker 2>they have different expressions for </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

872
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

873
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I heard that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

874
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

875
00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:33.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like a tribal society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

876
00:35:33.591 --> 00:35:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way it goes.</v>

877
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:36.171
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

878
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 2>it is like a tribal society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like you're,</v>

879
00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

880
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:45.290
<v Speaker 2>right now there's culture and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization that is linked to who knows</v>

881
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:49.590
<v Speaker 2>how many hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not thousands of years ago,</v>

882
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.400
<v Speaker 2>and it will go away because there won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be people that understand it.</v>

883
00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 2>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

884
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.800
<v Speaker 2>not someone who is studying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

885
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.873
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many different versions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the way they communicate that it's </v>

886
00:35:59.431 --> 00:36:00.264
<v Speaker 2>just like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're literally watching history </v>

887
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.741
<v Speaker 2>dissolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

888
00:36:02.741 --> 00:36:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

889
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:03.643
<v Speaker 3>In front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

890
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

891
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a Ma,</v>

892
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:10.910
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing to be in that country </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking in hunting in the same that,</v>

893
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.130
<v Speaker 3>that they have for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.510
<v Speaker 3>however many years.</v>

895
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:15.573
<v Speaker 2>And what did they hunt back then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is obviously before the </v>

896
00:36:17.291 --> 00:36:19.600
<v Speaker 2>buffalo came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they brought the fallow deer,</v>

897
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:20.463
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just whatever wallabies or while he's a </v>

898
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.410
<v Speaker 2>native thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos and she,</v>

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

901
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.190
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was cool</v>

902
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:33.480
<v Speaker 3>being under that rock and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and envisioning them being there too.</v>

903
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

904
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.300
<v Speaker 3>that long ago doing the same thing we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing.</v>

905
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

906
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.293
<v Speaker 2>that's a real mind blower man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so fascinating thinking about </v>

907
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:44.184
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That particular continent of Australia </v>

908
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.293
<v Speaker 2>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe used it as a prison colony in </v>

909
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:52.110
<v Speaker 2>England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brought a bunch of people over there and</v>

910
00:36:52.111 --> 00:36:52.411
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

911
00:36:52.411 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 2>you people are assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay here.</v>

912
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Dell is on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an island off of Australia,</v>

913
00:36:57.691 --> 00:36:59.280
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they used for that.</v>

914
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Well they used Australia for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

915
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that island?</v>

916
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I know we were doing an island as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they still do.</v>

917
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:08.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what they tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants.</v>

918
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

919
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.863
<v Speaker 2>And they have to live there for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of time before they can </v>

920
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:12.690
<v Speaker 2>come over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

921
00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:15.330
<v Speaker 2>They have some weird immigration laws in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

922
00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:16.164
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if people that are complaining </v>

923
00:37:17.701 --> 00:37:22.200
<v Speaker 2>about trump wanting to build a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen clearly island way worse and it's</v>

924
00:37:22.201 --> 00:37:23.570
<v Speaker 2>like a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

925
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.890
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I understand it right,</v>

926
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like a prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they have to stay there for,</v>

927
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

928
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:30.660
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of time before they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>a citizen.</v>

929
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you could find that Jimmy,</v>

930
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:32.933
<v Speaker 2>Josh zips actually brought it up to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was explaining how brutal the </v>

931
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.273
<v Speaker 2>immigration laws are over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to anybody moving to </v>

932
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand.</v>

933
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.960
<v Speaker 2>They have a good thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

934
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you haven't been to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is lovely.</v>

935
00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.320
<v Speaker 2>People there are fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're super friendly.</v>

936
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.450
<v Speaker 2>They're really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

937
00:37:51.451 --> 00:37:54.630
<v Speaker 2>there's not that many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's expensive though.</v>

938
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>amen.</v>

941
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his house was like a two bedroom</v>

942
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:04.680
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or $500,000.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

944
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense though.</v>

945
00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 2>You got to bring shit over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

946
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

947
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.170
<v Speaker 2>They were saying the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

948
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.960
<v Speaker 2>when I was in Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

949
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.093
<v Speaker 2>the guy who driving us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling us how much cars costs </v>

950
00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:17.880
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cost so much more money,</v>

951
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:22.020
<v Speaker 2>especially like people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a classic American muscle cars.</v>

952
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was talking about how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 1968 mustang was worth.</v>

953
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.753
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably worth twice what it's </v>

954
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 2>worth in a merrily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

955
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 2>because they have to ship them over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

956
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 2>What they have over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sweet,</v>

957
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:37.150

958
00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.013
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a Toyota Tundra as it like a </v>

959
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 2>ton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>

960
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:43.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it a ute.</v>

961
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.520
<v Speaker 2>That's a pickup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utility vehicle.</v>

965
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.913
<v Speaker 2>Learn the lingo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a ute is a pickup and it was a </v>

966
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Toyota high lux diesel.</v>

967
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 2>And is this what Adam was driving around</v>

971
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.650

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

973
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Adam has that.</v>

974
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:10.084
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I thought was </v>

975
00:39:11.201 --> 00:39:12.034
<v Speaker 2>weird when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was how many people have snorkels on </v>

976
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:14.681
<v Speaker 2>their trucks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

977
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:15.514
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one right there that's driving </v>

978
00:39:16.751 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 2>through water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

979
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not just water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also dust.</v>

980
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.973
<v Speaker 2>Elderly chokes up your air filters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have those things way up high so </v>

981
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 2>that it a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the engine's getting the air,</v>

982
00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:32.770
<v Speaker 2>like apparently it mitigates a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dust cause a lot of the dust is like</v>

983
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 2>a headlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

<v Speaker 2>little bit more clear air there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's out of my wheelhouse.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1005
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.390

<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:39.094
<v Speaker 2>They have an expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could take a range rover into the </v>

1011
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:42.244
<v Speaker 2>bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need a land rover to get out of </v>

1012
00:40:43.121 --> 00:40:44.200
<v Speaker 2>the bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

1013

1015
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.023
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kinda crazy how well they last and </v>

1016
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:56.800
<v Speaker 2>when you really think about like for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>longest time America did a real shit job</v>

1017
00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:57.634
<v Speaker 2>of making cars that last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's was a period in American cars </v>

1018
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.413
<v Speaker 2>from like the 1970s till I think till </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably like the late nineties a 2000 </v>

1019
00:41:06.281 --> 00:41:07.114

<v Speaker 3>we like hanging out with you and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I was explaining this to Adam to </v>

1054
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:35.383
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we did my podcast up there in the </v>

1055
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:39.640
<v Speaker 3>bush is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever since I,</v>

1056
00:42:39.641 --> 00:42:40.474
<v Speaker 3>I've hunted way back when Roy moved to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alaska and I was left hunting a </v>

1057
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.900
<v Speaker 3>wilderness on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it so much.</v>

1058
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I kept wanting to find somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>would love it as much as I,</v>

1059
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 3>so I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how awesome this is.</v>

1060
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.273
<v Speaker 3>Isn't this awesome?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I kept taking people there and try </v>

1061
00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 3>to convince them how awesome it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't awesome for them.</v>

1062
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:02.803
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want to share something that </v>

1063
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:09.080
<v Speaker 3>impacts you so much with other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who appreciate it.</v>

1064
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.213
<v Speaker 3>So that's why that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was saying when Adam I </v>

1065
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:16.160
<v Speaker 3>were talking is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1066
00:43:16.161 --> 00:43:16.994
<v Speaker 3>you love bow hunting and so that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you are so interested in invested </v>

1067
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.760
<v Speaker 3>in something and have such a passion for</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1068
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.713
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing better when somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>then when somebody else shares that </v>

1069
00:43:25.521 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Speaker 3>passion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1070
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

1071
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:29.023
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was why there's a few different </v>

1072
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:31.880
<v Speaker 3>reasons why you were going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

1073
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited about that.</v>

1074
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.410
<v Speaker 4>I also think the difficulty factor is </v>
<v Speaker 4>what turns people off.</v>

1075
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they expect it to be so </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult.</v>

1076
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:40.690
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1077
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:41.523
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you try to introduce bow hunting to </v>

1078
00:43:42.551 --> 00:43:43.390
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1079
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.850
<v Speaker 4>just shooting a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think,</v>

1080
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.440
<v Speaker 4>oh well we'll see you pull the string </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

1081
00:43:47.441 --> 00:43:49.000
<v Speaker 4>You pointed the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll let it go.</v>

1082
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Good luck with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes some fucking years.</v>

1083
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.100
<v Speaker 4>It takes years to get competent with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball.</v>

1084
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:55.091
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1085
00:43:55.091 --> 00:43:55.924
<v Speaker 4>I remember when you first started </v>
<v Speaker 4>showing me how to shoot when we first </v>

1086
00:44:00.251 --> 00:44:04.750
<v Speaker 4>shot in my backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I immediately recognized,</v>

1087
00:44:04.751 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Speaker 4>I think like after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all you've got a 90 pound bow,</v>

1088
00:44:07.961 --> 00:44:09.480
<v Speaker 4>which I definitely shouldn't have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling back.</v>

1089
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.860
<v Speaker 4>My shoulder was fucking killing me after</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first hour.</v>

1090
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.333
<v Speaker 4>Like this takes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to build up to this God damn </v>

1091
00:44:16.241 --> 00:44:17.074
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I remember thinking like to be </v>

1092
00:44:18.911 --> 00:44:22.150
<v Speaker 4>accurate with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just went down a rabbit hole.</v>

1093
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.273
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just took my first step down a crazy </v>

1094
00:44:25.301 --> 00:44:30.100
<v Speaker 4>rabbit hole and who knows where it leads</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is not easy and I'm a,</v>

1095
00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:35.101
<v Speaker 4>I have a very addictive yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I need to figure out ways to channel</v>

1096
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:36.354
<v Speaker 4>that addiction in positive ways cause I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can get lost doing things that are not </v>

1097
00:44:40.021 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So bow hunting and archery itself.</v>

1098
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:44.820
<v Speaker 4>To me it seemed like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1099
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.460
<v Speaker 4>this is a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a worthy pursuit.</v>

1100
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:49.810
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating and I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very interested in it.</v>

1101
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:54.090
<v Speaker 4>But for a lot of people I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>very daunting.</v>

1102
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1103
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:55.583
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People think of hunting is like elmer </v>

1104
00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.520
<v Speaker 4>fudd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

1105
00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:03.990
<v Speaker 4>you'd go out there or they see some </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting scene in a movie where there's a</v>

1106
00:45:03.991 --> 00:45:04.824
<v Speaker 4>bunch of rednecks and they're fat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're was sitting in a tree stand or </v>

1107
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:07.860
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1108
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.753
<v Speaker 4>And they think it's easy and they think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bunch of people that are just </v>

1109
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:15.561
<v Speaker 4>killing animals and they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when you actually go out and do</v>

1110
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:17.250
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you go do it with a person</v>

1111
00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:18.084
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you understand what this thing really </v>

1112
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:21.210
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what it really is,</v>

1113
00:45:21.211 --> 00:45:22.044
<v Speaker 4>is this incredibly difficult pursuit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that takes immense amounts of hard work </v>

1114
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:30.810
<v Speaker 4>and dedication and you gotta be in </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking shape for it.</v>

1115
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 4>And this is something that people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to realize now,</v>

1116
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.593
<v Speaker 4>and I think you're a big part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and over the last few years and all the </v>

1117
00:45:37.981 --> 00:45:38.814
<v Speaker 4>platforms that you've gone on to tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>your story is that people understand </v>

1118
00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:42.984
<v Speaker 4>that big game hunting in the West and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the western style hunting elk and mule </v>

1119
00:45:48.301 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the type of stuff that you love to do is</v>

1120
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.160
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very difficult.</v>

1121
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.930
<v Speaker 4>It is a combination of athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of extreme endurance,</v>

1122
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:02.340
<v Speaker 4>of hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>outdoorsmen ship survival skills,</v>

1123
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.500
<v Speaker 4>and then the knowledge of hunting.</v>

1124
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to be a good shot on </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of all that.</v>

1125
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.960
<v Speaker 4>You have to know archery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1126
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Then you have to be able to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1127
00:46:09.631 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 4>with that adrenaline hits all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden.</v>

1128
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.653
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's hard is people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>invested so much into it and they've </v>

1129
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:17.930
<v Speaker 4>been thinking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Mo,</v>

1130
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.620
<v Speaker 4>the crunch time for so long that when it</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens it's too much.</v>

1131
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.823
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's really hard when you've been </v>

1132
00:46:25.981 --> 00:46:28.530
<v Speaker 4>thinking about something for years </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially,</v>

1133
00:46:28.531 --> 00:46:30.690
<v Speaker 4>or at least all year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that,</v>

1134
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:31.890
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's my chance,</v>

1135
00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:34.350
<v Speaker 4>here's my chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you get it and you're not ready</v>

1136
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:38.010
<v Speaker 4>yet because it's just too much to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard to stay calm.</v>

1137
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:39.023
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also something that you need to do </v>

1138
00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of times until you understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1139
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to explain it to people about,</v>

1140
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about fighting earlier.</v>

1141
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1142
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.793
<v Speaker 4>when Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone has never fought before and </v>

1143
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:53.540
<v Speaker 4>never competed before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1144
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.433
<v Speaker 4>the scary thing is not really the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's nerve racking is not the actual </v>

1145
00:46:58.561 --> 00:47:01.470
<v Speaker 4>fighting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once the fighting starts,</v>

1146
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.520
<v Speaker 4>you're actually kind of like just in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>zone and you're just doing it.</v>

1147
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:06.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be intimidated,</v>

1148
00:47:06.631 --> 00:47:07.464
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're fighting a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike Tyson or Anderson Silva or </v>

1149
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.860
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be shitting your pants.</v>

1150
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.830
<v Speaker 4>But the real terrifying stuff is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>buildup,</v>

1151
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:14.783
<v Speaker 4>the lead up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's kind of the same thing with </v>

1152
00:47:16.951 --> 00:47:20.220
<v Speaker 4>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the moment before the shot.</v>

1153
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:21.323
<v Speaker 4>It's your adrenaline is pumping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you had a shoot an eight </v>

1154
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:29.260
<v Speaker 4>ball across the table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long shot and your life was on the line,</v>

1155
00:47:29.261 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you don't get any warm up shots.</v>

1156
00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.690
<v Speaker 4>There's no warmup shots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just all of a sudden,</v>

1157
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.990
<v Speaker 4>here's this one shot for all the marbles</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you've got to stay calm.</v>

1158
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.380
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1159
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.040
<v Speaker 4>and the animals might be moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.580
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck no.</v>

1161
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.730
<v Speaker 3>I was saying that on this last hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1162
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:47.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had me,</v>

1163
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Adam and remy warrant and supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to be pretty good hunter,</v>

1164
00:47:52.571 --> 00:47:56.760
<v Speaker 3>the best of the best and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggling to get something killed.</v>

1165
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.170
<v Speaker 3>And I was just like imagine how </v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrating this would be for somebody,</v>

1166
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.633
<v Speaker 3>a new hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's no wonder people try to bow </v>

1167
00:48:04.951 --> 00:48:07.440
<v Speaker 3>hunt and then just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

1168
00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.720
<v Speaker 3>This is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1169
00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that challenge.</v>

1170
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that whole journey,</v>

1171
00:48:14.281 --> 00:48:17.710
<v Speaker 3>which is why I want to do that special </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I want,</v>

1172
00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:18.653
<v Speaker 3>I want to share all of us positive about</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting it to as many people as you </v>

1173
00:48:22.531 --> 00:48:23.364
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we are reaching new people these </v>

1174
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.350
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1175
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:26.020
<v Speaker 3>Hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1176
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:30.000
<v Speaker 3>it's in the cross hairs in some aspects </v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

1177
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:33.270
<v Speaker 3>But we're also other people are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I get,</v>

1178
00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean I went to an archery shop up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1179
00:48:36.901 --> 00:48:41.901
<v Speaker 3>Benson's archery in Sydney and we just </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a few hours notice saying,</v>

1180
00:48:42.711 --> 00:48:43.544
<v Speaker 3>Hey Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam and I are going to stop by swing </v>

1181
00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:47.940
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and quite a few people came.</v>

1182
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1183
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.580
<v Speaker 3>it was surprising how many people showed</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1184
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.480
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of them were vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1185
00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:57.060
<v Speaker 3>six months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to your show.</v>

1186
00:48:57.061 --> 00:48:58.440
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1187
00:48:58.441 --> 00:49:01.620
<v Speaker 3>I found out about you from Joe Rogan or </v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hunt.</v>

1188
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.600
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even eat meat.</v>

1189
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.493
<v Speaker 3>And all these different stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different from all these </v>

1190
00:49:06.901 --> 00:49:09.960
<v Speaker 3>different areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we are reaching new people and I want</v>

1191
00:49:09.961 --> 00:49:12.540
<v Speaker 3>to make sure our message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one of,</v>

1192
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.433
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of respect and reverence and awe and </v>

1193
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.950
<v Speaker 3>appreciation for everything out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for survival and for just,</v>

1194
00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of the life outside of the city,</v>

1195
00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:26.520
<v Speaker 3>I want that shown in a way that I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>we would.</v>

1196
00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:31.140
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I'm selfishly want this to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a big thing,</v>

1197
00:49:31.141 --> 00:49:33.780
<v Speaker 3>just because I'm sick of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1198
00:49:33.781 --> 00:49:36.630
<v Speaker 3>the elmer fudd thing or um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1199
00:49:36.631 --> 00:49:37.320
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

1200
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:42.320
<v Speaker 3>I was watching a movie the other day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they showed a hunter and it was like the</v>

1201
00:49:42.631 --> 00:49:45.030
<v Speaker 3>girl was on there and she was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1202
00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:45.864
<v Speaker 3>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's three girls that were kidnapped </v>

1203
00:49:47.161 --> 00:49:50.040
<v Speaker 3>and one of them had hunted as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a younger girl.</v>

1204
00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.730
<v Speaker 3>And so she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know what movie that is?</v>

1205
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she was had the upper hand,</v>

1206
00:49:56.041 --> 00:49:59.280
<v Speaker 3>she was tougher and she was more </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared because she had been a hunter.</v>

1207
00:49:59.281 --> 00:49:59.821
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1208
00:49:59.821 --> 00:50:00.654
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they show her as a little girl </v>

1209
00:50:02.761 --> 00:50:07.761
<v Speaker 3>hunting and her perverted uncle had </v>
<v Speaker 3>molested her hunting,</v>

1210
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:10.620
<v Speaker 3>drinking beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

1211
00:50:10.621 --> 00:50:13.890
<v Speaker 3>That movie split Split.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

1212
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.040
<v Speaker 3>So the hunter in there with some child </v>
<v Speaker 3>molester,</v>

1213
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.233
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1214
00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:24.630
<v Speaker 4>why is the most misunderstood and </v>
<v Speaker 4>misrepresented discipline?</v>

1215
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.613
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1216
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 4>that we have here in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1217
00:50:28.161 --> 00:50:33.161
<v Speaker 4>it's so confusing to people because when</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think of a food,</v>

1218
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 4>we think of restaurants and we think a </v>
<v Speaker 4>supermarket.</v>

1219
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:37.094
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't think of wild animals and the </v>

1220
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:44.480
<v Speaker 4>connection that people feel like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have what their food is.</v>

1221
00:50:44.481 --> 00:50:46.730
<v Speaker 4>One thing that comes up all the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>lately,</v>

1222
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.450
<v Speaker 4>so people are constantly looking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>these farm to table places.</v>

1223
00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.350
<v Speaker 4>I visit a farm to table place out here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1224
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:56.420
<v Speaker 4>called a peddler's fork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a really good place.</v>

1225
00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 4>They have great eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you get the eggs,</v>

1226
00:50:58.101 --> 00:50:58.934
<v Speaker 4>they were like real dark yoke and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>food is all grass fed beef or from a </v>

1227
00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:05.660
<v Speaker 4>farm if they have a connection to and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they buy the meat from the farm.</v>

1228
00:51:05.661 --> 00:51:08.540
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these farm to table places where they,</v>

1229
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:09.613
<v Speaker 4>these restaurants have a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with the people that </v>

1230
00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:13.600
<v Speaker 4>actually grow the food.</v>

1231
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.820
<v Speaker 4>So everything's organic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know where it comes from and people</v>

1232
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:17.654
<v Speaker 4>are super connected to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They love the idea that because factory </v>

1233
00:51:20.421 --> 00:51:21.254
<v Speaker 4>farming is kind of freaking people out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for the longest time it was </v>

1234
00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 4>happening without us knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1235
00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.870
<v Speaker 4>I think during the eighties and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nineties it was all going on and no one,</v>

1236
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.560
<v Speaker 4>no one understood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1237
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 4>So now people are becoming more aware </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the Internet,</v>

1238
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.983
<v Speaker 4>because of information and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming more aware of where their food </v>

1239
00:51:39.231 --> 00:51:40.064
<v Speaker 4>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're also seeing a higher number </v>

1240
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:46.580
<v Speaker 4>of people that their response to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>factory farming thing is,</v>

1241
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:47.331
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1242
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:48.530
<v Speaker 4>I'll go vegetarian all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1243
00:51:48.531 --> 00:51:49.600
<v Speaker 4>I'll go vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Yeah,</v>

1244
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.370
<v Speaker 4>before I hunted with Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was my thought.</v>

1245
00:51:52.371 --> 00:51:53.204
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to participate in factory </v>

1246
00:51:55.101 --> 00:51:55.790
<v Speaker 4>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.430
<v Speaker 4>So what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do one of two things.</v>

1248
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.263
<v Speaker 4>I can either go hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to hunt for my own food </v>

1249
00:52:01.341 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 4>because I knew there's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1250
00:52:03.381 --> 00:52:04.214
<v Speaker 4>it's too easy to just get a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would always like pick up a steak and </v>

1251
00:52:06.651 --> 00:52:08.050
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't me an animal like a,</v>

1252
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:08.923
<v Speaker 4>here I am at the supermarket now it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>styrofoam container wrapped in Saran </v>

1253
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.760
<v Speaker 4>wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is fucking weird.</v>

1254
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.983
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that you could just do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my thought was if I shoot an animal </v>

1255
00:52:18.471 --> 00:52:19.304
<v Speaker 4>and I hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I didn't know how it was going to </v>

1256
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.170
<v Speaker 4>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never shy.</v>

1257
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 4>I've fished all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>

1258
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.320
<v Speaker 4>but when I shot that deer and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1259
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:26.711
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

1260
00:52:26.711 --> 00:52:27.980
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1261
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:28.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was an extreme amount of </v>

1262
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:31.370
<v Speaker 4>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on video.</v>

1263
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:32.204
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see it on media or anybody who </v>

1264
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:34.450
<v Speaker 4>wants to watch it.</v>

1265
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:36.710
<v Speaker 4>You could watch it online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first time I ever shot a deer,</v>

1266
00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:38.350
<v Speaker 4>it was intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1267
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:39.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1268
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.970
<v Speaker 4>and then cutting it up and eating it </v>
<v Speaker 4>that night.</v>

1269
00:52:40.971 --> 00:52:42.350
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this makes sense.</v>

1270
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.753
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when you actually find out </v>

1271
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.260
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that these animals,</v>

1272
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:53.410
<v Speaker 4>the money that co gum from hunting tags </v>
<v Speaker 4>and even from buying hunting gear,</v>

1273
00:52:53.661 --> 00:52:56.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a percentage of money that goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards conservation.</v>

1274
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:57.523
<v Speaker 4>And this is all very carefully thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>out by people like you and by these </v>

1275
00:53:00.621 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 4>people that really respect and care for </v>
<v Speaker 4>these animals.</v>

1276
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:07.160
<v Speaker 4>And you get deeper and deeper into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you understand what it really is.</v>

1277
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:07.994
<v Speaker 4>And then you see this whole community of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people like yourself and Remy </v>

1278
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:12.703
<v Speaker 4>Warren and these hardcore hunters that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are also like deeply connected to the </v>

1279
00:53:16.911 --> 00:53:20.510
<v Speaker 4>land and conservation and deeply </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate these animals.</v>

1280
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 4>And this is how they get all their meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how they live.</v>

1281
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.060
<v Speaker 4>And like that was extremely appealing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1282
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

1283
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:32.780
<v Speaker 3>I think Steve or has done a great job </v>
<v Speaker 3>make getting that message out in a,</v>

1284
00:53:32.781 --> 00:53:35.480
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a perfect way really.</v>

1285
00:53:35.481 --> 00:53:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a great spokesman and,</v>

1286
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.010
<v Speaker 3>and his show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to watch his show before meteor.</v>

1287
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:40.873
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what it was called </v>

1288
00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:42.680
<v Speaker 3>within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was?</v>

1289
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1290
00:53:43.221 --> 00:53:43.821
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1291
00:53:43.821 --> 00:53:46.850
<v Speaker 3>and I remember he had just something </v>
<v Speaker 3>about him that I'm like,</v>

1292
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is different.</v>

1293
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.600
<v Speaker 3>I liked I was a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1294
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a hunter myself my whole life,</v>

1295
00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:52.094
<v Speaker 3>but his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his portrayal was different than what </v>

1296
00:53:55.401 --> 00:53:56.810
<v Speaker 3>we'd seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1297
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:58.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the me and some of the other </v>

1298
00:54:00.831 --> 00:54:01.664
<v Speaker 3>people you've mentioned and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Adam have just carried that on and </v>

1299
00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:09.050
<v Speaker 3>tried to do a good job of educating </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who don't know any better.</v>

1300
00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.300
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1301
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:16.340
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish everybody could be out there.</v>

1302
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.173
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that last day we were up in the </v>

1303
00:54:19.401 --> 00:54:21.120
<v Speaker 3>mountains there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1304
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.800
<v Speaker 3>after I had killed my deer and we had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>back strap,</v>

1305
00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:28.130
<v Speaker 3>so we're picking up camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting everything away.</v>

1306
00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:29.810
<v Speaker 3>But I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>

1307
00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome fallow deer backstrap,</v>

1308
00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:35.720
<v Speaker 3>which is like the prime for people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know as a prime cut.</v>

1309
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:37.543
<v Speaker 3>And I cut it all up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cleaned it all off every piece of </v>

1310
00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:46.100
<v Speaker 3>anything that was on at hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's any tree bark,</v>

1311
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:48.710
<v Speaker 3>anything that was on there was just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect clean piece of meat.</v>

1312
00:54:48.711 --> 00:54:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I sliced it all up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got a green stick to put it on.</v>

1313
00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skewered it on,</v>

1314
00:54:55.771 --> 00:54:57.790
<v Speaker 3>on green,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1315
00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.690
<v Speaker 3>wood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it's,</v>

1316
00:54:59.691 --> 00:55:01.640
<v Speaker 3>if it's dry wood that we'll just going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to burn.</v>

1317
00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:02.341
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1318
00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:03.174
<v Speaker 3>you can't cook on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's gotta be green and we put it </v>

1319
00:55:05.061 --> 00:55:08.060
<v Speaker 3>over the fire there and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we seasoned it,</v>

1320
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:09.890
<v Speaker 3>it was so good.</v>

1321
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:13.280
<v Speaker 3>It was probably some of the best meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever eaten.</v>

1322
00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.500
<v Speaker 3>And standing around the campfire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just pulling that off,</v>

1323
00:55:15.501 --> 00:55:16.334
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stick that we had cooked it over </v>

1324
00:55:17.871 --> 00:55:18.704
<v Speaker 3>the open flame was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish everybody could know what that </v>

1325
00:55:21.561 --> 00:55:26.561
<v Speaker 3>was like to know that that deer just </v>
<v Speaker 3>previous to that was alive in the woods.</v>

1326
00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.460
<v Speaker 3>We harvested them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is Aka killed him.</v>

1327
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:32.653
<v Speaker 3>And then Adam and that's that circle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life or whatever you want to call it or </v>

1328
00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:37.183
<v Speaker 3>just that moment that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish everybody could experience it </v>

1329
00:55:40.071 --> 00:55:43.070
<v Speaker 3>because I just think they'd have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different take on,</v>

1330
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:47.810
<v Speaker 3>on hunter hunting and hunters and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being self sustaining.</v>

1331
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.033
<v Speaker 4>It's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meat is very different when you've </v>

1332
00:55:50.361 --> 00:55:51.194
<v Speaker 4>tilled it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to describe without </v>

1333
00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:53.930
<v Speaker 4>experiencing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1334
00:55:53.931 --> 00:55:55.640
<v Speaker 4>I could try,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could give it my best shot,</v>

1335
00:55:55.641 --> 00:55:56.750
<v Speaker 4>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll fall short.</v>

1336
00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.630
<v Speaker 4>But I remember eating that meat that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>ate,</v>

1337
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was in Montana with Rinella,</v>

1338
00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:02.383
<v Speaker 4>the first hunt and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so delicious and we're cooking </v>

1339
00:56:05.031 --> 00:56:07.850
<v Speaker 4>and over at Campfire and Steven brought </v>
<v Speaker 4>this little grill,</v>

1340
00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:08.841
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a grill,</v>

1341
00:56:08.841 --> 00:56:09.950
<v Speaker 4>like a great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1342
00:56:09.951 --> 00:56:14.951
<v Speaker 4>that we'd sat down over the fire and </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and it's like,</v>

1343
00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.360
<v Speaker 4>like if you buy a steak and you cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>

1344
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or call this a good steak.</v>

1345
00:56:22.101 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 4>This is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's no connection</v>

1346
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.060
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1347
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:25.893
<v Speaker 2>none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you are eating an animal that you </v>

1348
00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 2>killed yourself and it's difficult to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1349
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:33.640
<v Speaker 2>you were hard hunting for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many days for you got that deer.</v>

1350
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:34.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this intense respect and </v>

1351
00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 2>connection that I think we all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1352
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:41.104
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we harp on about it so many times that </v>

1353
00:56:42.001 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 2>people listen to these podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Jesus Christ,</v>

1354
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:46.010
<v Speaker 2>you go stop talking about how awesome </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting is,</v>

1355
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.840
<v Speaker 2>is it's because it's impacted both of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very,</v>

1356
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:51.880
<v Speaker 2>very positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a very,</v>

1357
00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:52.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a primal genetic sort of a </v>

1358
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 2>ancestral thing that's happening when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you hunt.</v>

1359
00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1360
00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some lights that go off the,</v>

1361
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:04.990
<v Speaker 2>you didn't even know where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1362
00:57:04.991 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know there was a switch </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there and like,</v>

1363
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a part of my brain that's lit up</v>

1364
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 2>that it was never lit up before.</v>

1365
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.273
<v Speaker 2>And it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not what everybody thinks that the </v>

1366
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:16.660
<v Speaker 2>negative aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a barbaric thing.</v>

1367
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not a cruelty thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very respectful thing.</v>

1368
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:20.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understand the people that have </v>

1369
00:57:24.221 --> 00:57:25.054
<v Speaker 2>bad feelings about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand the people that look at it </v>

1370
00:57:26.891 --> 00:57:29.470
<v Speaker 2>like animal cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have to do that.</v>

1371
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.453
<v Speaker 2>You can get food other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can eat beans and you don't need to </v>

1372
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:35.290
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand how they're thinking,</v>

1373
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 2>but my thought process is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1374
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:42.190
<v Speaker 2>My thought process is what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing,</v>

1375
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:43.024
<v Speaker 2>what all these people that do that hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>is your entering into the wild and you </v>

1376
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 2>are for a small window a week or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

1377
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.810
<v Speaker 2>You're becoming a part of this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle of nature.</v>

1378
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:56.710
<v Speaker 2>You're taking something out of that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving something as well.</v>

1379
00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 2>You're spending a ton of money.</v>

1380
00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.553
<v Speaker 2>That money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a the money for the </v>

1381
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:03.910
<v Speaker 2>outfitters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money for the tags and money for the</v>

1382
00:58:03.911 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 2>gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

1383
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Percentage of that goes to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the habitat is maintained.</v>

1384
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Make sure that the animal populations </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintained,</v>

1385
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:15.820
<v Speaker 2>make sure that department of fishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>game is well staffed with biologists,</v>

1386
00:58:15.821 --> 00:58:18.550
<v Speaker 2>with people that are monitoring these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals because guess what?</v>

1387
00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:20.150
<v Speaker 2>If that doesn't get done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1388
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:22.180
<v Speaker 2>it's these animals are not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there anymore,</v>

1389
00:58:22.181 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to be taken care of.</v>

1390
00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:28.020
<v Speaker 2>And North America has the best wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 2>management program or,</v>

1391
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.313
<v Speaker 2>or management system of anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why almost all the species </v>

1392
00:58:33.101 --> 00:58:33.934
<v Speaker 2>that we have here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more now than there almost ever </v>

1393
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:38.770
<v Speaker 2>has been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even with shrinking habitat,</v>

1394
00:58:38.771 --> 00:58:41.410
<v Speaker 2>because we're encroaching on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on where they live,</v>

1395
00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:45.130
<v Speaker 2>but we're still the number still </v>
<v Speaker 2>flourish because we're not,</v>

1396
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:46.390
<v Speaker 2>hunters aren't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1397
00:58:46.391 --> 00:58:47.270
<v Speaker 2>let's go kill life.</v>

1398
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm all out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1399
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.050
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's managed.</v>

1400
00:58:50.051 --> 00:58:52.510
<v Speaker 2>It's fishing game as managers are funded</v>
<v Speaker 2>by hunters.</v>

1401
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And what we pay that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1402
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.050
<v Speaker 2>with the tags and license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

1403
00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:59.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a system to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>

1404
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:03.040
<v Speaker 2>like they're in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were getting up in the morning out of</v>

1405
00:59:03.041 --> 00:59:06.430
<v Speaker 2>the sleeping bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbing her bow and taken off.</v>

1406
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:10.090
<v Speaker 2>We're hunters as it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feels,</v>

1407
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.620
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1408
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.330
<v Speaker 2>it feels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1409
00:59:13.331 --> 00:59:14.164
<v Speaker 2>I wish people could know what it feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like because I see people comment on my </v>

1410
00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:19.540
<v Speaker 2>social media and they saved the susans </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the 19th century anymore.</v>

1411
00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:21.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be a neanderthal or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1412
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1413
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1414
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 3>we are hunters.</v>

1415
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:25.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well most of those people of </v>

1416
00:59:26.081 --> 00:59:28.810
<v Speaker 4>cheeseburgers and their instagram pages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fucking hilarious.</v>

1417
00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:31.540
<v Speaker 4>There's so much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one chick,</v>

1418
00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:35.650
<v Speaker 4>she posted something mean when I posted </v>
<v Speaker 4>a picture of some elk that I was cooking</v>

1419
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:37.330
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey honey,</v>

1420
00:59:37.331 --> 00:59:39.220
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got like call girls honey,</v>

1421
00:59:39.221 --> 00:59:40.660
<v Speaker 4>because it makes them feel like I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexist.</v>

1422
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.333
<v Speaker 4>You got a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to fucking blt on your page </v>

1423
00:59:44.171 --> 00:59:45.580
<v Speaker 4>sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1424
00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:46.421
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1425
00:59:46.421 --> 00:59:49.660
<v Speaker 4>that was just from four months ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>before I was enlightened.</v>

1426
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:50.703
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1427
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.650
<v Speaker 4>you became enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always the most adamant vegans like</v>

1428
00:59:53.651 --> 00:59:56.520
<v Speaker 4>just became one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>proselytizing,</v>

1429
00:59:56.530 --> 01:00:00.520
<v Speaker 4>ruthlessly aggressive once I understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're coming from.</v>

1430
01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:01.383
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's very important for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get our message across is that like </v>

1431
01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:07.610
<v Speaker 4>it went on animal haters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not this.</v>

1432
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.473
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for people to understand that </v>

1433
01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:14.080
<v Speaker 4>someone could love animals and love the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of animals and love wildlife,</v>

1434
01:00:14.081 --> 01:00:14.920
<v Speaker 4>but still eat them.</v>

1435
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1436
01:00:16.021 --> 01:00:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

1437
01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:17.483
<v Speaker 3>I climbed up in this tree there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found this place where the deer were </v>

1438
01:00:20.941 --> 01:00:23.400
<v Speaker 3>coming into this field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1439
01:00:23.401 --> 01:00:24.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1440
01:00:24.661 --> 01:00:25.800
<v Speaker 3>this area had been hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1441
01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:26.723
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had figured nobody had ever a hundred </v>

1442
01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:29.400
<v Speaker 3>out of a tree there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1443
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like a white tail back here,</v>

1444
01:00:31.351 --> 01:00:32.184
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1445
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.460
<v Speaker 3>in the east or in the south,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Theresa 100 all the time.</v>

1446
01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:36.031
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1447
01:00:36.031 --> 01:00:39.210
<v Speaker 3>I think I can get up in this tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these deer coming out in this area.</v>

1448
01:00:39.211 --> 01:00:43.200
<v Speaker 3>I probably have a pretty good chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was up there in the tree and,</v>

1449
01:00:43.201 --> 01:00:44.034
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these doughs and Fonz or out in the </v>

1450
01:00:45.301 --> 01:00:48.660
<v Speaker 3>field and they were running around </v>
<v Speaker 3>chasing each other plain.</v>

1451
01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.733
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like speeding all around in </v>

1452
01:00:51.391 --> 01:00:54.510
<v Speaker 3>circles and bumping into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1453
01:00:54.511 --> 01:00:56.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was cool to see.</v>

1454
01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.790
<v Speaker 3>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1455
01:00:58.830 --> 01:00:59.663
<v Speaker 3>a doe and a spike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a young buck came out right under my </v>

1456
01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:05.550
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This spike was 24,</v>

1457
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.580
<v Speaker 3>25 yards away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically a chip shot with a bow,</v>

1458
01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.450
<v Speaker 3>especially had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there and I,</v>

1459
01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:15.180
<v Speaker 3>there was a thought that we were getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>low on meeting camp and,</v>

1460
01:01:15.181 --> 01:01:16.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't killed a deer.</v>

1461
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1462
01:01:18.331 --> 01:01:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I had said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1463
01:01:19.411 --> 01:01:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm killing any buck that comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1464
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:23.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking him.</v>

1465
01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:25.920
<v Speaker 3>And then I was watching him up there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

1466
01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:27.120
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1467
01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.620
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1468
01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.410
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be the right animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just like,</v>

1469
01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not some blood thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1470
01:01:33.571 --> 01:01:34.404
<v Speaker 3>I still watch the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still appreciate their beauty and </v>

1471
01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:37.021
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1472
01:01:37.021 --> 01:01:39.300
<v Speaker 3>they're frolicking about or whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to call it.</v>

1473
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.613
<v Speaker 3>And it's still enjoyed that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this young buck was down and I had said </v>

1474
01:01:43.261 --> 01:01:44.760
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get meat for camp,</v>

1475
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.070
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not some bloodthirsty guy.</v>

1476
01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:47.910
<v Speaker 3>So I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1477
01:01:47.911 --> 01:01:48.744
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to watch him and you </v>

1478
01:01:49.681 --> 01:01:50.431
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it.</v>

1479
01:01:50.431 --> 01:01:52.250
<v Speaker 3>And he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the buck,</v>

1480
01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:55.170
<v Speaker 3>I ended up killing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stepped out.</v>

1481
01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:56.910
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1482
01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:59.190
<v Speaker 3>an old Bach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

1483
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:03.210
<v Speaker 3>you could see his hip bones because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so run down from the ride and he was</v>

1484
01:02:03.211 --> 01:02:05.400
<v Speaker 3>getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could tell he was an older,</v>

1485
01:02:05.401 --> 01:02:06.450
<v Speaker 3>mature deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1486
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.313
<v Speaker 3>that's what I want to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to take an animal past its prime </v>

1487
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.243
<v Speaker 3>that has done his job for spreaders </v>
<v Speaker 3>genes for the health of the herd and </v>

1488
01:02:15.361 --> 01:02:17.700
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the animals we want to take out.</v>

1489
01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:20.670
<v Speaker 3>And so he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just a rundown</v>

1490
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:23.130
<v Speaker 2>old Bach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I took,</v>

1491
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't they,</v>

1492
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:25.763
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate someone who wants to take an </v>

1493
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:31.980
<v Speaker 2>older big mature animal with trophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>

1494
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:32.641
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1495
01:02:32.641 --> 01:02:34.740
<v Speaker 2>you just want the antler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just want a big,</v>

1496
01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:36.283
<v Speaker 2>but they don't understand that that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the animal that you should </v>

1497
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:39.024
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1498
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:41.160
<v Speaker 2>And he's still a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still great me.</v>

1499
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1500
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that,</v>

1501
01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.030
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1502
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Speaker 2>for the health of the herd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one you want,</v>

1503
01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing it right,</v>

1504
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:50.381
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1505
01:02:50.381 --> 01:02:51.214
<v Speaker 2>young ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll get a chance to fill his </v>

1506
01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:53.070
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1507
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:56.220
<v Speaker 2>And that would be the natural position </v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was an,</v>

1508
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.440
<v Speaker 2>this is the natural position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's predators,</v>

1509
01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 2>the natural position is the really young</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>

1510
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:03.870
<v Speaker 2>like the Fonz get taken out and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>really old ones start getting worn down.</v>

1511
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:04.703
<v Speaker 2>They get taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then everything in the middle gets </v>

1512
01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:06.864
<v Speaker 2>to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this guy who was eight years </v>

1513
01:03:08.641 --> 01:03:09.474
<v Speaker 2>old or whatever he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had plenty of opportunity to shed </v>

1514
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.430
<v Speaker 2>spread his genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so his,</v>

1515
01:03:14.431 --> 01:03:18.320
<v Speaker 2>his offspring will be everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'll get a chance now.</v>

1516
01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:19.283
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is nobody makes it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody makes the whole live there </v>

1517
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.240
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All by everybody.</v>

1518
01:03:24.241 --> 01:03:25.530
<v Speaker 2>We're all dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1519
01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.990
<v Speaker 2>just so if I wouldn't have killed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucket,</v>

1520
01:03:27.991 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean he's going to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

1521
01:03:29.461 --> 01:03:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to die one way or another.</v>

1522
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to become a ferry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he died,</v>

1523
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:34.943
<v Speaker 2>I shot him and he was dead within </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds is guaranteed and people are </v>

1524
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:42.870
<v Speaker 2>always talk shit about this is the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>best way he could go.</v>

1525
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want them starving to death or</v>

1526
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:46.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying because his teeth don't work </v>

1527
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.170
<v Speaker 2>anymore and literally can't eat food.</v>

1528
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 2>You know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen animals where you,</v>

1529
01:03:52.441 --> 01:03:53.274
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at their teeth and they're </v>

1530
01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:56.000
<v Speaker 2>almost none left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.750
<v Speaker 2>You get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really old buck.</v>

1532
01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.670
<v Speaker 2>This is buck teeth were flat in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1533
01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:01.640
<v Speaker 2>So it was just when you can't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to gum,</v>

1534
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:03.110
<v Speaker 2>they can't gum enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:04:03.111 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Speaker 2>They can't talk a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:07.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1537
01:04:07.021 --> 01:04:07.854
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Adam also found two bucks that had </v>

1538
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.400
<v Speaker 2>fought and got stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were fighting,</v>

1539
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:16.710
<v Speaker 2>an offense was in between them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a cattle fence.</v>

1540
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:19.020
<v Speaker 2>They got stuck in the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Died.</v>

1541
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just their life is,</v>

1542
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many guys out here in the street,</v>

1543
01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and kill each other and gets stuck</v>

1544
01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:28.300
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen.</v>

1545
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It's life in the wild is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1546
01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.380
<v Speaker 2>unless you're out there and you witness </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that,</v>

1547
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you just live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1548
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not real.</v>

1549
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I think the real problem is perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1550
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think unless you're there,</v>

1551
01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:45.990
<v Speaker 2>unless you are experiencing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness itself,</v>

1552
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.153
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about my experience on </v>

1553
01:04:48.631 --> 01:04:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Prince of Wales island that um,</v>

1584
01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.440
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to see it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of your computer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1589
01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my goal with,</v>

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we've been talking about and I </v>

1591
01:06:14.791 --> 01:06:16.800
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about the difficulty.</v>

1592
01:06:16.801 --> 01:06:18.810
<v Speaker 3>I did remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to mention this.</v>

1593
01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ha the hell was,</v>

1594
01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been on a lot of haunts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of places over the years and uh,</v>

1595
01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't struggled like ahead on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] it was so difficult.</v>

1596
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:32.670
<v Speaker 3>I was telling the guys back there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1597
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:35.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm questioning my life right now.</v>

1598
01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:39.210
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing with my life?</v>

1599
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.540
<v Speaker 3>And it was just because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to happen.</v>

1600
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.793
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the animals don't care about my </v>

1601
01:06:46.561 --> 01:06:49.020
<v Speaker 3>goals that they don't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1602
01:06:49.021 --> 01:06:51.990
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to be making this great </v>
<v Speaker 3>film and portray hunting.</v>

1603
01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.690
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're not,</v>

1604
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.420
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just staying alive.</v>

1605
01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.050
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

1606
01:06:58.050 --> 01:06:59.940
<v Speaker 3>So it was just like everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1607
01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I want her to do or achieve </v>
<v Speaker 3>or my,</v>

1608
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.590
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to happen.</v>

1609
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.630
<v Speaker 3>And it felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1610
01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:08.370
<v Speaker 3>have I lost it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1611
01:07:08.371 --> 01:07:09.204
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1612
01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:11.160
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is hard,</v>

1613
01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:16.680
<v Speaker 3>but when it works and you do it right in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shot happens,</v>

1614
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.930
<v Speaker 3>then it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1615
01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:20.183
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that doing something so </v>

1616
01:07:23.671 --> 01:07:25.200
<v Speaker 3>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1617
01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.350
<v Speaker 3>and being successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've said this before,</v>

1618
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.420
<v Speaker 3>has made me who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1619
01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:31.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without,</v>

1620
01:07:31.201 --> 01:07:34.300
<v Speaker 3>without a challenge like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1621
01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno where I'd be right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1622
01:07:36.061 --> 01:07:37.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1623
01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you cuss it and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1624
01:07:41.761 --> 01:07:43.800
<v Speaker 3>you were just so appreciative of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>journey.</v>

1625
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:45.183
<v Speaker 2>Well those difficult moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that makes success </v>

1627
01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:50.830
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile if success was easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you woke up in the morning,</v>

1628
01:07:50.831 --> 01:07:53.170
<v Speaker 2>first day yawn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a cup of coffee,</v>

1629
01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:54.004
<v Speaker 2>step five steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the biggest deer that's ever </v>

1630
01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:57.460
<v Speaker 2>lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot one right through his heart.</v>

1631
01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.380
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't even feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't,</v>

1632
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:01.270
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

1633
01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:03.910
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think people understand how </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult it is to,</v>

1634
01:08:03.911 --> 01:08:06.520
<v Speaker 2>because they watch these TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever watched a hunting show?</v>

1635
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:07.354
<v Speaker 2>There were half an hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're watching 22 minutes without </v>

1636
01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:09.761
<v Speaker 2>commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1637
01:08:09.761 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 22 minutes,</v>

1638
01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they usually build up for the first,</v>

1639
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes when you know,</v>

1640
01:08:14.711 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>we came close to them but we</v>

1641
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.450
<v Speaker 4>could not get a shot and then finally </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get a shot,</v>

1642
01:08:18.451 --> 01:08:23.451
<v Speaker 4>which you don't see is that these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes days and days and days of 10 12</v>

1643
01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:28.190
<v Speaker 4>hours hike up and down mountains up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and up and down.</v>

1644
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 4>And when I met you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason why I got in contact with you</v>

1645
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:32.594
<v Speaker 4>and the reason why I met you was because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was so confused as to why someone </v>

1646
01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:38.990
<v Speaker 4>would need to run ultra marathons or to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get ready for hunting.</v>

1647
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:41.270
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this guy doing?</v>

1648
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:44.200
<v Speaker 4>Like why is he lifting weights and doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this shit for it?</v>

1649
01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:45.940
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like this.</v>

1650
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I was just getting into it and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out like I was,</v>

1651
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.640
<v Speaker 4>I would start to watch things on </v>
<v Speaker 4>television though,</v>

1652
01:08:52.641 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 4>starting to read certain articles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>read certain books.</v>

1653
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.871
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1654
01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:59.960
<v Speaker 4>what is this whole fitness connection to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting?</v>

1655
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Like why do they need to be in shape?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1656
01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm in pretty good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's the big deal?</v>

1657
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went with Rinella and when I went with</v>

1658
01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Grinnell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I realized is like,</v>

1659
01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:07.754
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got pretty winded going up these </v>

1660
01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.710
<v Speaker 4>fucking hills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hiking,</v>

1661
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:10.641
<v Speaker 4>hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tires,</v>

1662
01:09:10.641 --> 01:09:12.320
<v Speaker 4>you out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially high altitude.</v>

1663
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 4>And then I see your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your videos online.</v>

1664
01:09:15.021 --> 01:09:16.880
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this guy into?</v>

1665
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.650
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1666
01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:21.130
<v Speaker 4>as I go deeper and deeper into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized like,</v>

1667
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.770
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like an extreme pursuit.</v>

1668
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.680
<v Speaker 4>This is not just like something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just go out and do this.</v>

1669
01:09:27.681 --> 01:09:31.120
<v Speaker 4>It's something that's really hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of people there,</v>

1670
01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:31.731
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1671
01:09:31.731 --> 01:09:34.790
<v Speaker 4>I've read this one article,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's one guy who was unsuccessful</v>

1672
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:38.000
<v Speaker 4>12 years in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elk hunting before he finally,</v>

1673
01:09:38.001 --> 01:09:42.290
<v Speaker 4>I shot an elk like 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how many times did this guy go out?</v>

1674
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:43.940
<v Speaker 4>How many days did he camp and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>forest,</v>

1675
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.240
<v Speaker 4>how many days did he try to stock and </v>
<v Speaker 4>get winded or snap on a twig at the last</v>

1676
01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.020
<v Speaker 4>minute or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1677
01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.430
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the elk sees him and bolt it.</v>

1678
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Most people are unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1679
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine out of 10 every year on successful.</v>

1680
01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.080
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunting with archery,</v>

1681
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about,</v>

1682
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:03.020
<v Speaker 4>it's about 10% is it 10% yeah.</v>

1683
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:08.000
<v Speaker 3>So nine out of 10 are unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people who don't hunt,</v>

1684
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 3>who see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1685
01:10:09.381 --> 01:10:10.850
<v Speaker 3>dead stuff all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think,</v>

1686
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:12.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go out and kill an animal.</v>

1687
01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1688
01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most 90% don't.</v>

1689
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:16.783
<v Speaker 3>It is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like until you're out </v>

1690
01:10:20.901 --> 01:10:21.734
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got the bow in your hand and you're </v>

1691
01:10:23.151 --> 01:10:23.984
<v Speaker 3>trying to close in on that animal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to do everything right </v>

1692
01:10:25.911 --> 01:10:26.744
<v Speaker 3>from a to z with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many variables during </v>

1693
01:10:30.231 --> 01:10:34.730
<v Speaker 3>that whole path as like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems a possible sometimes,</v>

1694
01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even even for me after 30 years,</v>

1695
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.353
<v Speaker 4>and this is a very strange connection </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you get with nature and forget </v>

1696
01:10:41.331 --> 01:10:44.180
<v Speaker 4>about even the fact that you're pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 4>these animals to hunt them and eat them.</v>

1697
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:45.343
<v Speaker 4>But there's a very strange connection </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you get when you're out there in </v>

1698
01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:48.914
<v Speaker 4>that total quiet woods where they live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in their world and you lock eyes </v>

1699
01:10:53.631 --> 01:10:54.464
<v Speaker 4>with them and you meet them and you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and you're in this place with no </v>

1700
01:10:56.481 --> 01:11:00.470
<v Speaker 4>cell phone reception with no people </v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere near you for miles and miles.</v>

1701
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally different feeling.</v>

1702
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Life shows you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1703
01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.000
<v Speaker 4>another aspect of itself that you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know existed.</v>

1704
01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:08.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1705
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's out there every day.</v>

1706
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're just,</v>

1707
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and living in our,</v>

1708
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:16.620
<v Speaker 3>we're muted were very nice.</v>

1709
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:17.483
<v Speaker 4>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about cities and this </v>

1710
01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:20.430
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1711
01:11:20.431 --> 01:11:22.050
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

1712
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.333
<v Speaker 4>I like a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked the fact that you can go to a </v>

1713
01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:26.190
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like going to the movies.</v>

1714
01:11:26.191 --> 01:11:27.470
<v Speaker 4>I like the fact that if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1715
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:29.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your phone breaks,</v>

1716
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:31.140
<v Speaker 4>you go to the fucking mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a new cell phone,</v>

1717
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.000
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1718
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:37.020
<v Speaker 4>not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the other stuff is fantastic too and</v>

1719
01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:37.854
<v Speaker 4>we're disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A giant percentage of our population </v>

1720
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:41.364
<v Speaker 4>lives in these urban environments that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a complete and total disconnect </v>

1721
01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:45.954
<v Speaker 4>from the actual life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like life on earth is not just urban </v>

1722
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:55.440
<v Speaker 4>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life on earth has this broad spectrum of</v>

1723
01:11:55.530 --> 01:12:00.530
<v Speaker 4>different ways it manifests itself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to experience all these different ones.</v>

1724
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:04.980
<v Speaker 4>To be in Alberta and see black bears in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wild to be,</v>

1725
01:12:04.981 --> 01:12:05.814
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Colorado and see mule deer and being </v>

1726
01:12:08.461 --> 01:12:11.130
<v Speaker 4>in the woods and the mountains and to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>around these different animals,</v>

1727
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.473
<v Speaker 4>it's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different understanding of the </v>

1728
01:12:15.091 --> 01:12:18.900
<v Speaker 4>actual existence that living things have</v>
<v Speaker 4>here on earth.</v>

1729
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:19.734
<v Speaker 4>That living things that share the air </v>
<v Speaker 4>you breathe and the water you drink and </v>

1730
01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 4>the earth itself.</v>

1731
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:27.330
<v Speaker 3>How was it that was the best part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that trip?</v>

1732
01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Cause we would split up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1733
01:12:29.281 --> 01:12:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Adam would go one way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go another way in the morning.</v>

1734
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I'd have mark womack with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd have a,</v>

1735
01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 3>jamison was his camera man's name would </v>
<v Speaker 3>go with him.</v>

1736
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:41.040
<v Speaker 3>And the best part was at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

1737
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.270
<v Speaker 3>hearing what everybody saw and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1738
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:46.340
<v Speaker 3>not what if you killed something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause we didn't care.</v>

1739
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were there a long time,</v>

1740
01:12:47.551 --> 01:12:50.580
<v Speaker 3>it didn't kill very much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just what everybody saw,</v>

1741
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:52.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the bucks being locked up that were</v>

1742
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:53.940
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>

1743
01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:54.774
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one morning we were up and a w heard </v>

1744
01:12:59.311 --> 01:13:00.144
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a commotion up ahead of us and mark's </v>

1745
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:03.200
<v Speaker 3>mark says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1746
01:13:03.201 --> 01:13:05.840
<v Speaker 3>it's a bug rubbing his antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I listen for a second.</v>

1747
01:13:05.841 --> 01:13:06.211
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1748
01:13:06.211 --> 01:13:07.044
<v Speaker 3>that's two bucks fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we took off up the hill and I got 25 </v>

1749
01:13:09.721 --> 01:13:11.640
<v Speaker 3>yards away and these bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going at it,</v>

1750
01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:13.200
<v Speaker 3>just fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing each other around.</v>

1751
01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:16.290
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get a clear shot,</v>

1752
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.150
<v Speaker 3>didn't get out there and time to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1753
01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:21.000
<v Speaker 3>But that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Adam would say,</v>

1754
01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:22.710
<v Speaker 3>well he called in three Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1755
01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:23.544
<v Speaker 3>he did a varmint call on three Fox came </v>
<v Speaker 3>running in or he saw this many wild </v>

1756
01:13:28.111 --> 01:13:28.944
<v Speaker 3>boars or he was close to getting inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>a giant fallow Bach and however it </v>

1757
01:13:34.501 --> 01:13:35.334
<v Speaker 3>didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would share a story about </v>

1758
01:13:37.291 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 3>what I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1759
01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:41.220
<v Speaker 3>about another brown snake or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1760
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:42.263
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was so fun just getting together </v>

1761
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:47.820
<v Speaker 3>over the campfire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not talking about what we killed,</v>

1762
01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:50.820
<v Speaker 3>but just what we saw and experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1763
01:13:50.821 --> 01:13:52.380
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1764
01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:53.243
<v Speaker 3>I was flew home last night and just got </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this morning to La and I'm looking </v>

1765
01:13:56.251 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 3>around in the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about all the people,</v>

1766
01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:03.861
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how many actually would get me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1767
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.130
<v Speaker 3>cause I feel like an outsider a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

1768
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 3>especially coming back from the hunt and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just looking at everybody thinking I</v>

1769
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.170
<v Speaker 1>don't get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't get me,</v>

1770
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>but you'll at least understand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

1771
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1772
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was checking my luggage in it,</v>

1773
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I was flew virgin coming her back from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sydney to La and you know,</v>

1774
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lady there,</v>

1775
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 1>the check and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1776
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.670
<v Speaker 1>what's in that case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1777
01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 1>it's about a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1778
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1779
01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bow and arrow.</v>

1780
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:39.550
<v Speaker 1>What were you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1781
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in.</v>

1782
01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were you hunting?</v>

1783
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell me.</v>

1784
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't want to hear it.</v>

1785
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you have leather shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1786
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I was hunting buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1787
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 1>there's buffalo here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1788
01:14:51.881 --> 01:14:52.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not here,</v>

1789
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1790
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of buffalo in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1791
01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:57.971
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1792
01:14:57.971 --> 01:14:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can fly with a bow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrow.</v>

1793
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't.</v>

1794
01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1795
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:05.134
<v Speaker 1>it's just like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like a firearm or weapon </v>

1796
01:15:07.511 --> 01:15:08.380
<v Speaker 1>type thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1797
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.410
<v Speaker 1>you just check it in just normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1798
01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

1799
01:15:12.881 --> 01:15:13.601
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1800
01:15:13.601 --> 01:15:14.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1801
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.260
<v Speaker 1>how old was this lady?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1802
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:19.270
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was much younger than me probably.</v>

1803
01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fly with a bone.</v>

1804
01:15:22.661 --> 01:15:25.270
<v Speaker 1>And what was she telling you that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

1805
01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 1>She never looked into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1806
01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1807
01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have to do anything.</v>

1808
01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.373
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to sign all this </v>

1809
01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 1>stuff because they're not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just like,</v>

1810
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1811
01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I fly with this all over the world as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady worked there.</v>

1812
01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1813
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.371
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1814
01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:45.160
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she said there are way more strict,</v>

1815
01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:47.130
<v Speaker 1>which maybe they are verge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was most true.</v>

1816
01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.160
<v Speaker 1>That's where she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes.</v>

1817
01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:48.731
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1818
01:15:48.731 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I've just flew quantis to Darwin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1819
01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.160
<v Speaker 1>and nobody said a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it,</v>

1820
01:15:54.161 --> 01:15:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

1821
01:15:55.121 --> 01:15:57.160
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been in Australia before </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it?</v>

1822
01:15:57.161 --> 01:15:57.994
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1823
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened.</v>

1824
01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I've been everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never an issue.</v>

1825
01:16:01.151 --> 01:16:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to blow.</v>

1826
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trust me.</v>

1827
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1828
01:16:06.951 --> 01:16:07.900
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1829
01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:10.210
<v Speaker 1>there's times that I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1830
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:12.880
<v Speaker 1>am I the outsider or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what?</v>

1831
01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1832
01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:14.824
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>

1833
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:18.770
<v Speaker 4>we were talking before this when we were</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the way over here about a show.</v>

1834
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:20.990
<v Speaker 4>They wanted me to come on and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns,</v>

1835
01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.093
<v Speaker 4>but there's going to be like a large </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience and is going to be a bunch of </v>

1836
01:16:24.861 --> 01:16:25.694
<v Speaker 4>people on the panel and you talk for </v>
<v Speaker 4>seven minutes and you go to commercial </v>

1837
01:16:27.741 --> 01:16:29.600
<v Speaker 4>break and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not interested.</v>

1838
01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:30.733
<v Speaker 4>I'm not interested in doing that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's a long conversation </v>

1839
01:16:33.531 --> 01:16:34.364
<v Speaker 4>that you have to have with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a while for you to understand </v>

1840
01:16:37.041 --> 01:16:37.874
<v Speaker 4>their point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes a while for them to understand </v>

1841
01:16:39.681 --> 01:16:40.514
<v Speaker 4>your point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes a while to establish the fact </v>

1842
01:16:43.401 --> 01:16:47.000
<v Speaker 4>that you're a very reasonable person and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a very nuanced conversation.</v>

1843
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:51.380
<v Speaker 4>Much like when that guy in France ran </v>
<v Speaker 4>over a bunch of people with his truck,</v>

1844
01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the truck should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>outlawed.</v>

1845
01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:54.453
<v Speaker 4>And I think the real issue is human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings that are capable of doing </v>

1846
01:16:56.901 --> 01:16:58.940
<v Speaker 4>horrible shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blind people,</v>

1847
01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:01.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are they capable of doing that?</v>

1848
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:02.143
<v Speaker 4>Let's get to the bottom of that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>let's stop ignoring all the factors and </v>

1849
01:17:05.451 --> 01:17:07.640
<v Speaker 4>just concentrating only on the weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1850
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.700
<v Speaker 4>That kind of is a long</v>

1851
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.880
<v Speaker 2>conversation that I think it takes hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hours and you still might not get to</v>

1852
01:17:13.881 --> 01:17:17.120
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel about like you talking</v>

1853
01:17:17.121 --> 01:17:19.360
<v Speaker 2>to someone about hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you came over here,</v>

1854
01:17:19.361 --> 01:17:20.750
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to tell them.</v>

1855
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone says like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a boat,</v>

1856
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:24.290
<v Speaker 2>like what's in the case?</v>

<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I practice our tree.</v>

1858
01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier that way.</v>

1866
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.760

<v Speaker 2>it takes too long.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think I'm,</v>

1869
01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like hiding who I am,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to hear.</v>

1879
01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Well it's Kinda Kinda like with my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my social media,</v>

1880
01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I like putting up stuff that so I can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>weed the people out,</v>

1881
01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:13.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like holding,</v>

1882
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 2>holding the buffalo head in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1883
01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:18.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to weed out so that people</v>

1884
01:18:18.741 --> 01:18:19.574
<v Speaker 2>who I really don't want here anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get mad at you for </v>

1885
01:18:22.221 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they would get mad anyway.</v>

1886
01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:25.203
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of people that listen </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these conversations and they get a </v>

1887
01:18:29.991 --> 01:18:31.700
<v Speaker 2>perspective that they would have never </v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

1888
01:18:31.701 --> 01:18:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are listening,</v>

1889
01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:34.970
<v Speaker 2>that are in their car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are on there,</v>

1890
01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:36.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the boss or whatever,</v>

1891
01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.113
<v Speaker 2>and they've got the headphones on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking about this in a way </v>

1892
01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:44.290
<v Speaker 2>that they never thought about it before </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in their mind they've,</v>

1893
01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:45.373
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact they live in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>urban environments and they've never </v>

1894
01:18:47.121 --> 01:18:47.954
<v Speaker 2>been exposed to hunting and they get all</v>
<v Speaker 2>their meat from a store or from a </v>

1895
01:18:50.151 --> 01:18:54.830
<v Speaker 2>supermarket or from a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just never heard anybody talk about</v>

1896
01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:55.520
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1897
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.130
<v Speaker 2>And this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird part of our life.</v>

1898
01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a dangerous disconnect I think with</v>

1899
01:19:00.591 --> 01:19:01.424
<v Speaker 2>life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dangerous disconnect of restaurants </v>

1900
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 2>and supermarkets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here's,</v>

1901
01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:08.780
<v Speaker 2>here's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people just get tuned in to what</v>

1902
01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:10.100
<v Speaker 2>they're interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

1903
01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even instagram does it.</v>

1904
01:19:11.931 --> 01:19:14.780
<v Speaker 2>So on the explore page or whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1905
01:19:14.781 --> 01:19:15.614
<v Speaker 2>what comes up is what you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it comes up on my page is like a </v>

1906
01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.290
<v Speaker 2>hunting and fitness and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's all that.</v>

1907
01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.560
<v Speaker 2>So whatever you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's gay guys are or cooking,</v>

1908
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:31.940
<v Speaker 2>that's what's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

1909
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.823
<v Speaker 2>that's your world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of what our world is now </v>

1910
01:19:35.331 --> 01:19:36.164
<v Speaker 2>as we only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're only exposed to really what we </v>

1911
01:19:39.561 --> 01:19:41.280
<v Speaker 2>want to be exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1912
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1913
01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm hunting buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1914
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.680
<v Speaker 2>that lady be exposed to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1915
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1916
01:19:49.641 --> 01:19:50.474
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1917
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1918
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's comparable.</v>

1919
01:19:53.291 --> 01:19:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Comparably know what my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1920
01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.890
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying makes a whole lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense is that people,</v>

1921
01:19:57.891 --> 01:19:58.724
<v Speaker 2>do they find these communities with </v>
<v Speaker 2>likeminded people and becomes an echo </v>

1922
01:20:01.461 --> 01:20:02.294
<v Speaker 2>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1923
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're preaching to the choir,</v>

1924
01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:07.590
<v Speaker 2>and that goes all the way back to like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million hours ago,</v>

1925
01:20:07.591 --> 01:20:08.424
<v Speaker 2>it feels like since we've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about why that Netflix thing is so </v>

1926
01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:12.024
<v Speaker 2>appealing to me and having you involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just because we've reached so many </v>

1927
01:20:16.081 --> 01:20:20.550
<v Speaker 2>new people and hunting is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so important to me.</v>

1928
01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1929
01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:23.483
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so people can understand what </v>

1930
01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:29.070
<v Speaker 2>motivates us and why it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want that,</v>

1931
01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:31.110
<v Speaker 2>just want that shown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1932
01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:31.921
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's shared.</v>

1933
01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's definitely a way to do it.</v>

1934
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:36.030
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where we should go.</v>

1935
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the buffalo place or </v>

1936
01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:40.770
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a great idea to do.</v>

1937
01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven Nellis show net is on Netflix.</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you're shooing factory farm,</v>

1966
01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:51.810
<v Speaker 2>you're avoiding factory farming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating more salads in evening,</v>

1967
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:52.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1968
01:21:52.810 --> 01:21:56.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm to table vegetables instead,</v>

1969
01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.610
<v Speaker 2>you are definitely contributing to less </v>
<v Speaker 2>death and suffering.</v>

1970
01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:00.600
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1971
01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:03.880
<v Speaker 2>but you can tip it into some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just are,</v>

1972
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:05.070
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grain.</v>

1973
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:08.070
<v Speaker 2>If you eat grain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're contributing to a w for,</v>

1974
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.840
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you care about?</v>

1975
01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you care about insects?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where do you draw the line?</v>

1976
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't care about insects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you're okay.</v>

1977
01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:17.100
<v Speaker 2>But if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think that insects are life well,</v>

1978
01:22:17.101 --> 01:22:18.630
<v Speaker 2>there's pesticides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking,</v>

1979
01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:19.723
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a holocaust everyday out there </v>

1980
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.673
<v Speaker 2>fucking bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're spraying those goddamn things </v>

1981
01:22:24.391 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

1982
01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:26.304
<v Speaker 2>if you want to have a healthy crops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why they have these </v>

1983
01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:32.890
<v Speaker 2>pesticides cause they want to kill these</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that are trying to eat the crops</v>

1984
01:22:32.891 --> 01:22:35.970
<v Speaker 2>to kill these little bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>

1985
01:22:35.971 --> 01:22:36.804
<v Speaker 2>I just keep going back to this recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>trip just because I think about it and </v>

1986

<v Speaker 2>here's another example.</v>

1987
01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:41.784

<v Speaker 2>are second most deadly and we saw a </v>

1988
01:22:45.631 --> 01:22:48.720
<v Speaker 2>number of brown snakes in the road while</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were driving.</v>

1989
01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.970

<v Speaker 1>to hate.</v>

2012
01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2013
01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:31.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2014
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:34.180
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

2015
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is sensitive to,</v>

2016
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2017
01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.673
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're just cold blooded </v>

2018
01:23:41.411 --> 01:23:42.244
<v Speaker 1>killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2019
01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one time we did,</v>

2020
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't believe him about something</v>

2021
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:52.000
<v Speaker 1>and he was so upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2022
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

2023
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm brutally honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2024
01:23:54.641 --> 01:23:56.740
<v Speaker 1>and he's like mad that I didn't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2025
01:23:57.010 --> 01:24:02.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's like he's a warmhearted person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not just a,</v>

2026
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.663
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not running over snakes and kill a </v>

2027
01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:06.010
<v Speaker 1>robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2028
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:06.371
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2029
01:24:06.371 --> 01:24:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And so people think that we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2030
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.830
<v Speaker 1>these cold blooded killers out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbaric or whatever.</v>

2031
01:24:11.831 --> 01:24:12.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2032
01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:13.893
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to judge people who </v>

2033
01:24:15.701 --> 01:24:17.410
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like we are just,</v>

2034
01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:21.460
<v Speaker 1>we understand the circle of life better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.353
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2036
01:24:22.410 --> 01:24:23.243
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you definitely more accustomed to being </v>

2037
01:24:25.021 --> 01:24:27.880
<v Speaker 4>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're definitely exposed to more.</v>

2038
01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2039
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.320
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2040
01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:32.483
<v Speaker 4>I have friends that are vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of vegans and people think </v>

2041
01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:38.280
<v Speaker 4>that for some reason I hate vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mock a lot of things.</v>

2042
01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:39.323
<v Speaker 4>I make fun of things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are targets and a lot of like the </v>

2043
01:24:42.481 --> 01:24:47.430
<v Speaker 4>proselytizing nature of vegans in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>angry self,</v>

2044
01:24:47.431 --> 01:24:50.190
<v Speaker 4>righteous moral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high ground stance that they take.</v>

2045
01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.410
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to mock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right there.</v>

2046
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.270
<v Speaker 4>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

2047
01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:58.650
<v Speaker 4>I think most of the people that do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do it for good reasons.</v>

2048
01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.491
<v Speaker 4>Most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2049
01:24:59.491 --> 01:24:59.971
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2050
01:24:59.971 --> 01:25:00.804
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying the lifestyle and eating that </v>

2051
01:25:02.671 --> 01:25:03.504
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also health problems with </v>

2052
01:25:05.161 --> 01:25:05.994
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2053
01:25:06.210 --> 01:25:07.620
<v Speaker 4>people don't like you saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

2054
01:25:07.621 --> 01:25:10.770
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people that have tried </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and they give up after awhile because</v>

2055
01:25:10.771 --> 01:25:13.440
<v Speaker 4>it bought up my friend Sophie from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy store.</v>

2056
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.530
<v Speaker 4>She just started eating eggs again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.860
<v Speaker 4>For the longest time she was just trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to just go straight Vegan.</v>

2058
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:22.050
<v Speaker 4>She kept getting her blood work back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't healthy.</v>

2059
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2060
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:24.990
<v Speaker 4>actually she wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she wasn't a work.</v>

2061
01:25:24.991 --> 01:25:28.140
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris was the blood car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went Vegan for a while,</v>

2062
01:25:28.141 --> 01:25:28.974
<v Speaker 4>but his blood work was all fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he started eating fish and eggs and </v>

2063
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.093
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's people that buy </v>

2064
01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:39.110
<v Speaker 4>different bodies are more adaptable to </v>
<v Speaker 4>different kinds of diets and some people</v>

2065
01:25:39.781 --> 01:25:40.614
<v Speaker 4>just don't do well and are all plant </v>
<v Speaker 4>based diet and maybe they're not as </v>

2066
01:25:42.931 --> 01:25:45.150
<v Speaker 4>disciplined as some folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're not doing it right.</v>

2067
01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:46.013
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2068
01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.030
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody,</v>

2069
01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:52.080
<v Speaker 4>everybody's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

2070
01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:55.830
<v Speaker 4>with going out and killing animals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating them.</v>

2071
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.903
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's where we differ from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people that think that you </v>

2072
01:26:01.111 --> 01:26:01.944
<v Speaker 4>should not be allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You not be allowed because it's </v>

2073
01:26:04.221 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 4>barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's barbaric.</v>

2074
01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.830
<v Speaker 4>I think it's spiritual and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>what freaks people out.</v>

2075
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:12.320
<v Speaker 4>They get very angry if you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2076
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they wouldn't get angry if he talked</v>

2077
01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:15.410
<v Speaker 4>about native Americans doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2078
01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.253
<v Speaker 3>it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is is like the big </v>

2079
01:26:18.241 --> 01:26:20.910
<v Speaker 3>difference is I don't care if they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat meat.</v>

2080
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:25.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't judge them for not eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they judge us for killing.</v>

2081
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:27.210
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2082
01:26:27.211 --> 01:26:28.044
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty one sided as far as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't accept being a hunter and being </v>

2083
01:26:32.131 --> 01:26:32.964
<v Speaker 3>self sufficient while any hunter I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't going on Vegan pages and talking </v>

2084
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:40.290
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2085
01:26:40.530 --> 01:26:41.363
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's just weird how they're so </v>

2086
01:26:43.201 --> 01:26:46.670
<v Speaker 3>hateful and so one sided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2087
01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:50.100
<v Speaker 3>up on our soapbox and I don't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we would do that.</v>

2088
01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we'll do it.</v>

2089
01:26:51.630 --> 01:26:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I know there's going to be people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>say they're going to say,</v>

2090
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:55.441
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2091
01:26:55.441 --> 01:26:56.274
<v Speaker 3>they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many times am I going to be on here </v>

2092
01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.670
<v Speaker 3>as many times as he can come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about podcast folks.</v>

2093
01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:06.930
<v Speaker 3>What's the record of the most people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>here for the most number of,</v>

2094
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeat guests,</v>

2095
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>somebody probably knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably Joey Diaz.</v>

2096
01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Callan's probably pushed challen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2097
01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:14.640
<v Speaker 3>account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the,</v>

2098
01:27:14.641 --> 01:27:16.500
<v Speaker 3>all the fight companions and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he brought,</v>

2099
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that's true.</v>

2100
01:27:17.791 --> 01:27:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll say,</v>

2101
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.990
<v Speaker 3>talking about more boring hunting shit.</v>

2102
01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:25.660
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you don't have to listen folks.</v>

2103
01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.793
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got one later today with Jordan </v>

2104
01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:29.613
<v Speaker 4>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you we're not going to be </v>

2105
01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:30.990
<v Speaker 4>talking about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's,</v>

2106
01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:31.913
<v Speaker 4>who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a professor at the University of </v>

2107
01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might hut.</v>

2108
01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:36.220
<v Speaker 4>He might,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it does though.</v>

2109
01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hunts liberals,</v>

2110
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:40.990
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things is about,</v>

2111
01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:43.390
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're talking about earlier that we</v>

2112
01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:44.224
<v Speaker 4>were saying that people sort of find </v>
<v Speaker 4>their area and it becomes like an echo </v>

2113
01:27:47.771 --> 01:27:48.604
<v Speaker 4>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's one of the issues </v>

2114
01:27:49.901 --> 01:27:52.690
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's veganism or even hunting,</v>

2115
01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:53.883
<v Speaker 4>is that I think that people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need to be had to have these </v>

2116
01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:57.604
<v Speaker 4>dialogues with people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily agree with that so they can </v>

2117
01:28:00.761 --> 01:28:03.940
<v Speaker 4>find out how the other person thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2118
01:28:03.941 --> 01:28:04.774
<v Speaker 4>if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you are talking to a person who is a </v>

2119
01:28:06.101 --> 01:28:09.190
<v Speaker 4>hunter and you find out that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually just a cruel psychopath,</v>

2120
01:28:09.191 --> 01:28:10.120
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>

2121
01:28:10.121 --> 01:28:11.320
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't want to hang out with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

2122
01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2123
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.740
<v Speaker 4>I haven't experienced that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know they must be out there.</v>

2124
01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:19.420
<v Speaker 4>So if you were sitting across him having</v>
<v Speaker 4>a freaks and everything and everything.</v>

2125
01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:20.493
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you were having a conversation with </v>

2126
01:28:21.641 --> 01:28:24.550
<v Speaker 4>someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would be,</v>

2127
01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:29.200
<v Speaker 4>it would be disturbing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that most people that,</v>

2128
01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:30.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2129
01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:34.000
<v Speaker 4>especially people like yourself or a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>like remy warren or Steve Rinella,</v>

2130
01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:35.013
<v Speaker 4>very well spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was also an advocate for </v>

2131
01:28:36.941 --> 01:28:38.710
<v Speaker 4>conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loves wildlife.</v>

2132
01:28:38.711 --> 01:28:39.544
<v Speaker 4>If they sat down and had a long form </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation like this with someone </v>

2133
01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:47.170
<v Speaker 4>who's a reasonable person who was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vegan for all the right reasons,</v>

2134
01:28:47.171 --> 01:28:49.500
<v Speaker 4>there's a vegan because they care about </v>
<v Speaker 4>life and cause they,</v>

2135
01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:50.403
<v Speaker 4>they want to be cruelty free and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to live life with his little </v>

2136
01:28:53.201 --> 01:28:54.034
<v Speaker 4>footprint as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they'd be surprised at how much </v>

2137
01:28:56.771 --> 01:28:57.760
<v Speaker 4>common ground they find.</v>

2138
01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you,</v>

2139
01:28:58.871 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anybody spent a day in the woods with</v>

2140
01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:03.144
<v Speaker 3>remy or Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be shocked at how much not </v>

2141
01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:07.104
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know just how much they know about </v>

2142
01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.090
<v Speaker 3>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2143
01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:15.690
<v Speaker 3>about where they're hunting about </v>
<v Speaker 3>different species,</v>

2144
01:29:15.691 --> 01:29:19.140
<v Speaker 3>about the animals and tendencies and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>foliage.</v>

2145
01:29:19.141 --> 01:29:22.050
<v Speaker 3>And I mean those guys are amazing.</v>

2146
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.923
<v Speaker 4>Almost like we were talking about like </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the aborigines were kind of losing </v>

2147
01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:27.494
<v Speaker 4>their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're losing out on an understanding of </v>

2148
01:29:29.811 --> 01:29:30.644
<v Speaker 4>how these people live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a little bit of that could be </v>

2149
01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:33.980
<v Speaker 4>said about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2150
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.843
<v Speaker 4>the culture of hunting is that if it </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes away and if it w w there was a </v>

2151
01:29:39.951 --> 01:29:44.840
<v Speaker 4>trend about 10 maybe 1520 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where from what I've read at least,</v>

2152
01:29:44.841 --> 01:29:47.210
<v Speaker 4>obviously I'm pretty new to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only been hunting for five years,</v>

2153
01:29:47.211 --> 01:29:52.100
<v Speaker 4>but that they were considerably worried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were really worried.</v>

2154
01:29:52.190 --> 01:29:53.023
<v Speaker 4>There was a real thought that the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>few generations that hunting was going </v>

2155
01:29:56.301 --> 01:29:57.134
<v Speaker 4>to dwindle down to such a such a low </v>
<v Speaker 4>number that the hunters would not have </v>

2156
01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:07.070
<v Speaker 4>the same sort of impact in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of politically where they could</v>

2157
01:30:07.071 --> 01:30:10.470
<v Speaker 4>affect the retaining of public lands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2158
01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.150
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a huge issue with,</v>

2159
01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.053
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Americans today and you're seeing </v>

2160
01:30:14.211 --> 01:30:15.044
<v Speaker 4>it with this trump administration where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing the erosion of the </v>

2161
01:30:16.941 --> 01:30:17.774
<v Speaker 4>environmental protection agency and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>erosion of the status that protected </v>

2162
01:30:21.471 --> 01:30:22.304
<v Speaker 4>status at some national monuments have </v>
<v Speaker 4>and perhaps public lands have people </v>

2163
01:30:25.401 --> 01:30:27.890
<v Speaker 4>were super nervous and you had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation,</v>

2164
01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:28.933
<v Speaker 4>a long conversation with Jason Chaffetz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaffetz Chaffetz Chaffetz who had a </v>

2165
01:30:34.401 --> 01:30:38.090
<v Speaker 4>very controversial bill that he had out </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was pulled back.</v>

2166
01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:39.133
<v Speaker 4>It was a bill to sell off public land </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was pulled back because of the </v>

2167
01:30:43.011 --> 01:30:45.170
<v Speaker 4>activism of hunters in the people care.</v>

2168
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:45.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2169
01:30:45.901 --> 01:30:46.734
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was what they determine what they </v>

2170
01:30:47.971 --> 01:30:50.040
<v Speaker 3>were going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2171
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:52.380
<v Speaker 3>determine was disposable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:53.720
<v Speaker 3>3 million acres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2173
01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Disposable as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2174
01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.393
<v Speaker 3>that was hr six 21 and then there's Hr </v>
<v Speaker 3>six 22 also said there's two of them </v>

2175
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:01.650
<v Speaker 3>kind of back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different,</v>

2176
01:31:01.651 --> 01:31:05.610
<v Speaker 3>six 22 just took away the law </v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcement on public lands,</v>

2177
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:07.103
<v Speaker 3>which at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and t and they wanted to take it from </v>

2178
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:11.370
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the federal government,</v>

2179
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:13.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give it to the state,</v>

2180
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:17.610
<v Speaker 3>which people think that that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way where the states can say,</v>

2181
01:31:17.611 --> 01:31:18.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't afford it,</v>

2182
01:31:18.631 --> 01:31:22.500
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to have to sell this </v>
<v Speaker 3>public land because it's a resource.</v>

2183
01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:23.373
<v Speaker 3>And in the states have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the states have to balance our budget </v>

2184
01:31:26.311 --> 01:31:28.530
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Federal government doesn't.</v>

2185
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:29.813
<v Speaker 3>So if the state has to balance its </v>
<v Speaker 3>budget and it's not penciling out and </v>

2186
01:31:33.271 --> 01:31:36.660
<v Speaker 3>they can sell x amount of acres and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to help,</v>

2187
01:31:36.661 --> 01:31:38.520
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all there is to it.</v>

2188
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2189
01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:41.543
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

2190
01:31:42.170 --> 01:31:44.340
<v Speaker 3>there's also wildfire protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2191
01:31:44.341 --> 01:31:44.701
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2192
01:31:44.701 --> 01:31:45.534
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2193
01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.570
<v Speaker 4>bunch of issue fighting wildfires is </v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

2194
01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:50.090
<v Speaker 4>it's a federal issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it's private land,</v>

2195
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:52.790
<v Speaker 4>if the state sells it all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit's gone.</v>

2196
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:54.590
<v Speaker 4>There's no more federal protection.</v>

2197
01:31:55.230 --> 01:31:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look at,</v>

2198
01:31:56.670 --> 01:31:58.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2199
01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big one.</v>

2200
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And so sportsmen's really stepped up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was through social media,</v>

2201
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.823
<v Speaker 1>how they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we have more of a voice than we've </v>

2202
01:32:07.301 --> 01:32:08.290
<v Speaker 1>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2203
01:32:08.291 --> 01:32:12.100
<v Speaker 1>before it was just these politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>making decisions and you know,</v>

2204
01:32:12.101 --> 01:32:14.500
<v Speaker 1>the US little people didn't really have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a say.</v>

2205
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Now we have a say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jason Chaffetz,</v>

2206
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:19.504
<v Speaker 1>you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2207
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:23.050
<v Speaker 1>why would he care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd look at his instagram page.</v>

2208
01:32:23.051 --> 01:32:24.090
<v Speaker 1>He might have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2209
01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he has 20,000 whereas we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have pretty big numbers,</v>

2210
01:32:28.541 --> 01:32:31.060
<v Speaker 1>especially you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you mentioned something about it,</v>

2211
01:32:31.061 --> 01:32:34.330
<v Speaker 1>he gets overwhelmed with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2212
01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 1>are you looking out for us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing the right thing by us?</v>

2213
01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:38.301
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2214
01:32:38.301 --> 01:32:42.220
<v Speaker 1>we won't vote you in next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then it makes those guys think,</v>

2215
01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see his town hall meeting?</v>

2216
01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:46.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2217
01:32:46.931 --> 01:32:47.764
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all sportsmen and sportswomen </v>

2218
01:32:48.971 --> 01:32:52.870
<v Speaker 1>showed up and they all people that care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about public lands and they went crazy.</v>

2219
01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I don't,</v>

2220
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:56.510
<v Speaker 1>that was a kind of a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2221
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2222
01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I was had mixed mixed feelings on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the yelling and stuff doesn't,</v>

2223
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.720
<v Speaker 1>it least it sends a very clear message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

2224
01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't accomplish much as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2225
01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:09.603
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2226
01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it sends a message for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:13.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a dangerous and he's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a politician anymore.</v>

2228
01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:15.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I nuns resign and I don't know.</v>

2229
01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

2230
01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:17.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see every once in a while he likes </v>

2231
01:33:18.461 --> 01:33:19.810
<v Speaker 1>some of my stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

2232
01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:21.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear he's going into male </v>

2233
01:33:21.731 --> 01:33:24.430
<v Speaker 1>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>

2234
01:33:25.450 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2235
01:33:26.411 --> 01:33:29.290
<v Speaker 1>can you go google that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just made that up.</v>

2236
01:33:29.291 --> 01:33:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I know Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening,</v>

2237
01:33:30.461 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedian and I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2238
01:33:32.381 --> 01:33:33.220
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

2239
01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:36.690
<v Speaker 1>he seemed like a super nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2240
01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a politician.</v>

2241
01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:38.860
<v Speaker 1>And I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2242
01:33:38.861 --> 01:33:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Lucy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2243
01:33:39.941 --> 01:33:40.774
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the first politician I've ever </v>

2244
01:33:42.161 --> 01:33:43.660
<v Speaker 1>met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2245
01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:44.523
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've lived a charmed life puzzled by </v>

2246
01:33:46.481 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 1>representative Shavitz decision to quit </v>
<v Speaker 1>congress.</v>

2247
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:50.183
<v Speaker 1>Ben Is that fucking deal going in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>town hall and have all those people </v>

2248
01:33:53.171 --> 01:33:54.550
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably thinking,</v>

2249
01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:55.690
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2250
01:33:55.691 --> 01:33:56.650
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2251
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.090
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seemed nice,</v>

2252
01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:01.120
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that politicians have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>personable.</v>

2253
01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:02.900
<v Speaker 1>That's how they get elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2254
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:05.470
<v Speaker 1>you ever watch house of cards now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had show,</v>

2255
01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:09.280
<v Speaker 1>she'll watch it freaking the fuck out if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really like you should be scared.</v>

2256
01:34:09.281 --> 01:34:11.020
<v Speaker 1>We should all be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to,</v>

2257
01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to learn more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

2258
01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I haven't asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2259
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.710
<v Speaker 1>what's going on or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2260
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:18.603
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that he at least took </v>

2261
01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:23.990
<v Speaker 1>time out to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2262
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:27.040
<v Speaker 1>instead of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not sure why he did,</v>

2263
01:34:27.041 --> 01:34:29.110
<v Speaker 1>but I appreciated the fact that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2264
01:34:29.111 --> 01:34:32.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting guy because he saves</v>

2265
01:34:32.831 --> 01:34:35.410
<v Speaker 1>money for the people by sleeping in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

2266
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:36.663
<v Speaker 1>He was a cot in his office that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeps in to save money on hotel rooms </v>

2267
01:34:39.570 --> 01:34:41.110
<v Speaker 1>for the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2268
01:34:41.111 --> 01:34:41.944
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like he's a total piece of </v>

2269
01:34:43.331 --> 01:34:44.164
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2270
01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:45.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get that feeling.</v>

2271
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:47.260
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2272
01:34:47.261 --> 01:34:48.094
<v Speaker 1>Rinella has a very bad opinion of him </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on his record with defending </v>

2273
01:34:53.171 --> 01:34:54.004
<v Speaker 1>public lands and Rinella thinks that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not understand the significance of </v>

2274
01:34:57.711 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 1>these decisions.</v>

2275
01:34:58.770 --> 01:34:59.603
<v Speaker 2>These decisions are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are a step in the wrong direction </v>

2276
01:35:03.321 --> 01:35:04.154
<v Speaker 2>that will snowball out of control and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>will eventually lead to privatizing </v>

2277
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.300
<v Speaker 2>public lands and the loss of the access </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them by the American people that,</v>

2278
01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all set aside by Teddy Roosevelt </v>

2279
01:35:13.371 --> 01:35:16.880
<v Speaker 2>and all those people that had such great</v>
<v Speaker 2>insight and foresight back in the day.</v>

2280
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:18.223
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2281
01:35:18.230 --> 01:35:20.060
<v Speaker 2>that was the worry with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

2282
01:35:20.061 --> 01:35:20.451
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2283
01:35:20.451 --> 01:35:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm just taking the law enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

2284
01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from these lands and gay,</v>

2285
01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:27.110
<v Speaker 2>or not taking your way but giving it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>

2286
01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.580
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the whole budget thing,</v>

2287
01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.780
<v Speaker 2>so people were thinking that when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have enough money,</v>

2288
01:35:32.781 --> 01:35:35.600
<v Speaker 2>not just for the law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for,</v>

2289
01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:38.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcing illegal timber,</v>

2290
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.313
<v Speaker 2>timber harvest and dumping trash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when all that happens that that </v>

2291
01:35:44.211 --> 01:35:45.920
<v Speaker 2>lessens the value of the land.</v>

2292
01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.100
<v Speaker 2>So when the value of the land is lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's just like,</v>

2293
01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:49.911
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2294
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:54.290
<v Speaker 2>This is a garbage dump anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it makes it easier.</v>

2295
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:57.500
<v Speaker 2>So they thought that was just a step in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the transition of moving,</v>

2296
01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:02.620
<v Speaker 2>taking that away from public land and </v>
<v Speaker 2>privatizing it is opinion and maybe,</v>

2297
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2298
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Well he seemed like Jason seem like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very nice guy when you were interviewing</v>

2299
01:36:07.221 --> 01:36:08.054
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about that </v>

2300
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:10.663
<v Speaker 2>particular issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you talk to God like Brunello </v>

2301
01:36:12.501 --> 01:36:15.170
<v Speaker 2>who is deeply invested in it and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>well read on it,</v>

2302
01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:16.543
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is of the opinion 100% that it's an </v>

2303
01:36:19.071 --> 01:36:19.904
<v Speaker 2>incredibly negative idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hr has six 21 which has gone and six 22 </v>

2304
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 2>which he thinks is equally negative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks it's essentially like a Trojan</v>

2305
01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:29.564
<v Speaker 2>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2306
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:30.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told him,</v>

2307
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I said too,</v>

2308
01:36:31.941 --> 01:36:32.810
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2309
01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 2>sportsmen don't support six 22 either.</v>

2310
01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.330
<v Speaker 2>The girls get mad when you call it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sportsman probably.</v>

2311
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Is there another word outdoors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People towards,</v>

2312
01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:44.510
<v Speaker 2>people can't say sports people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2313
01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:46.940
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lacrosse players sick of that.</v>

2314
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you're a man,</v>

2315
01:36:49.101 --> 01:36:51.770
<v Speaker 2>your male privilege is showing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh son of a bitch.</v>

2316
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was white privilege that </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2317
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have it all.</v>

2318
01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:57.230
<v Speaker 2>American privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White privilege.</v>

2319
01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.260
<v Speaker 2>CIS gender privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peanut butter,</v>

2320
01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.000
<v Speaker 2>jelly ratios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peanut butter and jellies.</v>

2321
01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Racist Take Fletcher had that on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know what that was about.</v>

2322
01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:08.430
<v Speaker 2>All I saw was your post and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>headline,</v>

2323
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:11.900
<v Speaker 2>just like I didn't surprise me though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think the peanut butter and Jelly</v>

2324
01:37:11.901 --> 01:37:12.734
<v Speaker 2>is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how deep it gets because white </v>

2325
01:37:15.111 --> 01:37:15.944
<v Speaker 2>people eat peanut butter and Jelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas black people don't necessarily </v>

2326
01:37:19.341 --> 01:37:20.174
<v Speaker 2>eat peanut butter and jelly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to have peanut butter and jelly as a </v>

2327
01:37:22.161 --> 01:37:27.161
<v Speaker 2>food choice in school for our kids is </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist because other ethnic groups don't</v>

2328
01:37:28.731 --> 01:37:32.000
<v Speaker 2>necessarily eat peanut butter and jelly.</v>

2329
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:34.850
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2330
01:37:34.851 --> 01:37:35.684
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't like peanut butter and </v>

2331
01:37:37.311 --> 01:37:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Jelly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2332
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:41.750
<v Speaker 2>some communists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe Chinese folks.</v>

2333
01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from of the stars.</v>

2334
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunters probably don't.</v>

2335
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:46.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy from that movie molested that </v>

2336
01:37:47.871 --> 01:37:49.220
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2337
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:50.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who North Koreans?</v>

2338
01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the most evil ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they don't like me to burn.</v>

2339
01:37:53.261 --> 01:37:55.010
<v Speaker 2>The only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably I don't,</v>

2340
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:57.000
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's delicious food choice.</v>

2341
01:37:57.370 --> 01:37:59.550
<v Speaker 2>People are just working too hard to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>

2342
01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:03.510
<v Speaker 2>So you are exactly 100% correct right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2343
01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:05.610
<v Speaker 2>People are working too hard to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>

2344
01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:06.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:38:06.331 --> 01:38:07.164
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of folks out there that </v>

2346
01:38:08.701 --> 01:38:11.130
<v Speaker 2>just looking for something to get ticked</v>
<v Speaker 2>off at.</v>

2347
01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.020
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too easy.</v>

2348
01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy to get by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2349
01:38:14.671 --> 01:38:19.671
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's also something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when life is too fucking easy.</v>

2350
01:38:20.050 --> 01:38:20.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough struggle when we're </v>

2351
01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:22.854
<v Speaker 2>talking about kids and about putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids through difficult things so </v>

2352
01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:27.144
<v Speaker 2>that they understand accomplishing goals</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they understand how things aren't </v>

2353
01:38:30.181 --> 01:38:30.630
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>

2354
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:31.463
<v Speaker 2>You have to struggle through stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how it's hard today because you </v>

2355
01:38:35.971 --> 01:38:37.230
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing well.</v>

2356
01:38:37.231 --> 01:38:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our kids are fine.</v>

2357
01:38:39.230 --> 01:38:40.063
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to worry about where </v>

2358
01:38:40.651 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 2>food's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be there.</v>

2359
01:38:41.911 --> 01:38:43.080
<v Speaker 2>You open the fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the food.</v>

2360
01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to figure out like,</v>

2361
01:38:45.571 --> 01:38:46.404
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get this kid to understand </v>

2362
01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:50.550
<v Speaker 2>and appreciate the value of a difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>task?</v>

2363
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:51.563
<v Speaker 2>Overcoming that difficult task and </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that good feeling that you have </v>

2364
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:57.180
<v Speaker 2>of building character and of and </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing,</v>

2365
01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:58.014
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can push through something like you </v>

2366
01:38:59.461 --> 01:39:02.160
<v Speaker 2>had to do during that tough hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

2367
01:39:02.161 --> 01:39:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Questioning yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then finally success.</v>

2368
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have that good feeling,</v>

2369
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:11.220
<v Speaker 2>good feeling of success and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment and of realizing that you</v>

2370
01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:12.083
<v Speaker 2>will fight those demons in your mind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you will stay the course and keep </v>

2371
01:39:16.081 --> 01:39:16.914
<v Speaker 2>hammering as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get through on the other end with </v>

2372
01:39:18.991 --> 01:39:19.824
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

2373
01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:20.713
<v Speaker 2>And you've done it before and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though you've been doing it for fucking </v>

2374
01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:26.100
<v Speaker 2>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those questions still come to your mind.</v>

2375
01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.050
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that for me personally,</v>

2376
01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:28.884
<v Speaker 2>that's why work as hard as I do just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you get wake up calls like that </v>

2377
01:39:32.671 --> 01:39:33.660
<v Speaker 2>and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2378
01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be on my a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2379
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:38.400
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the reasons why I like doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>really difficult things,</v>

2380
01:39:38.401 --> 01:39:41.340
<v Speaker 2>which leads me to what you've got me </v>
<v Speaker 2>into his running.</v>

2381
01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>steep hill near my house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2399
01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:28.140

2400
01:40:28.141 --> 01:40:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Steep Hill once you get to the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you go back up as awesome.</v>

2401
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:35.040
<v Speaker 2>It is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is always hard.</v>

2402
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:38.940
<v Speaker 2>It's never easy when I'm getting to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of that thing,</v>

2403
01:40:38.941 --> 01:40:40.230
<v Speaker 2>but I could make it all the way up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>

2404
01:40:40.231 --> 01:40:41.520

<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

2411

<v Speaker 2>cardio on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't,</v>

2414
01:40:56.110 --> 01:40:59.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickbox for couple of weeks because I've</v>

2415
01:40:59.561 --> 01:41:00.394
<v Speaker 2>been too busy doing other stuff and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to keep with the running because </v>

2416
01:41:03.431 --> 01:41:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I was getting some accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2417
01:41:04.901 --> 01:41:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I was getting some um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 2>progress out of it.</v>

2419
01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I was seeing progress and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2420
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2421
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:12.850
<v Speaker 2>going back into some of my other </v>
<v Speaker 2>workouts.</v>

2422
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:13.803
<v Speaker 2>It didn't affect my weightlifting and </v>

2424
01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it really affected it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It affected it a real positive way cause</v>

2425
01:41:20.771 --> 01:41:21.604
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing all hills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm basically sprinting a lot jacked </v>

2426
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.870
<v Speaker 2>spike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I was a,</v>

2427
01:41:28.871 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I was doing rounds in the bag the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fourth round and I was still slamming </v>

2432
01:41:38.201 --> 01:41:40.360
<v Speaker 2>the bag and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is weird.</v>

2433
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:42.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like I've got like an extra gear </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2434
01:41:42.490 --> 01:41:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Did A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you dropped any weight?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've dropped a few pounds.</v>

2436
01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Probably like somewhere between one 94 </v>
<v Speaker 2>one 96 where I was,</v>

2437
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I was hovering around 200 but I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped down before just by my diet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>eight pounds in a week in Mexico.</v>

2440
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good for weight control.</v>

2442
01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Where's definitely not taste good </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2443
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:11.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I haven't been doing Jujitsu very </v>

2444
01:42:11.801 --> 01:42:14.800
<v Speaker 2>much when I do Jujitsu a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking,</v>

2445
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:17.110
<v Speaker 2>the weight just flies off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really need anything.</v>

2446
01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:18.723
<v Speaker 2>I could eat a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a Jujitsu just so calorie </v>

2447
01:42:22.811 --> 01:42:24.030
<v Speaker 2>intensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2448
01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:24.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2449
01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 2>the way it burns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fighting for your life.</v>

2450
01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's know,</v>

2451
01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:31.990
<v Speaker 2>what's your running goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2452
01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a running goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2453
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely going to keep doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep getting in better shape.</v>

2454
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.690
<v Speaker 2>And then if something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I decide,</v>

2455
01:42:40.691 --> 01:42:42.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need something to strive for,</v>

2456
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:45.220
<v Speaker 2>then here's my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2457
01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.113
<v Speaker 2>I want to do the key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pam Ran Five K next year and fucking </v>

2458
01:42:48.761 --> 01:42:52.300
<v Speaker 2>kick ass at it instead of this year when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it where I was like,</v>

2459
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:54.430
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is hard.</v>

2460
01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the zero running.</v>

2461
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:56.793
<v Speaker 2>How about this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost 25 seconds short of the two hour </v>

2462
01:42:59.561 --> 01:43:01.840
<v Speaker 2>marathon barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>

2463
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:05.590
<v Speaker 2>He did break the world record though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It broke the world record.</v>

2464
01:43:05.591 --> 01:43:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Two hours and 20 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 seconds I believe it was.</v>

2465
01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.353
<v Speaker 2>So he was only 25 seconds short of </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking what people think is this </v>

2466
01:43:13.871 --> 01:43:16.270
<v Speaker 2>unattainable record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

2467
01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:18.220
<v Speaker 2>He'll break it or someone like him would</v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

2468
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Somebody will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2469
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:23.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's so close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Nike's apparently lied to you will</v>

2470
01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.313
<v Speaker 2>invest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2471
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not built like that guy.</v>

2472
01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.530
<v Speaker 2>They're all built the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

2473
01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.020
<v Speaker 5>popsicle sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super humid.</v>

2474
01:43:31.021 --> 01:43:33.420
<v Speaker 5>When he was running this too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like 70% humidity,</v>

2475
01:43:33.570 --> 01:43:36.680
<v Speaker 5>which isn't like ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No hot water.</v>

2476
01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:37.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's high.</v>

2477
01:43:37.890 --> 01:43:39.690
<v Speaker 5>Well that probably could have been the </v>
<v Speaker 5>20 seconds.</v>

2478
01:43:39.691 --> 01:43:40.590
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh for sure.</v>

2479
01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.433
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they could do that in Seattle in </v>

2480
01:43:42.481 --> 01:43:44.820
<v Speaker 5>the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The course is running on is in Milan.</v>

2481
01:43:44.821 --> 01:43:47.010
<v Speaker 5>I guess there's an article I just read </v>
<v Speaker 5>yesterday.</v>

2482
01:43:47.011 --> 01:43:49.470
<v Speaker 5>I think it was on tech crunch maybe or </v>
<v Speaker 5>wired.</v>

2483
01:43:49.471 --> 01:43:50.304
<v Speaker 5>Somebody like a for there was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>break a half marathon and he wanted to </v>

2484
01:43:53.661 --> 01:43:54.494
<v Speaker 5>see if he could break a 90 minute or </v>
<v Speaker 5>half marathon and was his first time </v>

2485
01:43:57.261 --> 01:43:58.094
<v Speaker 5>running on that course and he broke up </v>
<v Speaker 5>like two and a half minutes so that </v>

2486
01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:04.040
<v Speaker 5>there's something special about that </v>
<v Speaker 5>course to take a mile and a half track.</v>

2487
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:06.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why you'd be able to run </v>
<v Speaker 5>faster necessarily there,</v>

2488
01:44:06.531 --> 01:44:10.250
<v Speaker 5>but punk can and those shoes they made </v>
<v Speaker 5>two or what is it?</v>

2489
01:44:10.251 --> 01:44:15.020
<v Speaker 5>What's the deal with the shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something spus super special training.</v>

2490

2492
01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you had under armor he would've</v>
<v Speaker 2>won.</v>

2493
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:23.200
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe keep hammering.</v>

2494
01:44:23.201 --> 01:44:24.034
<v Speaker 2>Choose good under armour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep hammering shoes that you could get </v>

<v Speaker 2>interesting content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2537
01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:12.010
<v Speaker 2>well that's what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the instagram story was nice,</v>

2538
01:46:12.190 --> 01:46:14.680
<v Speaker 2>but I would have really loved it if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were street.</v>

2539
01:46:14.681 --> 01:46:17.080
<v Speaker 2>If there was a way to stream like more </v>
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>

2540
01:46:17.081 --> 01:46:20.920
<v Speaker 2>like you had like very specific moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's streaming and I think that as</v>

2541
01:46:20.921 --> 01:46:21.754
<v Speaker 2>technology advances especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see what a Ilan Musk is trying </v>

2542
01:46:24.791 --> 01:46:25.624
<v Speaker 2>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to fill the world with one </v>

2543
01:46:27.101 --> 01:46:27.934
<v Speaker 2>gigabyte Internet and he's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is launch satellites into the year </v>

2544
01:46:30.941 --> 01:46:35.200
<v Speaker 2>that's going to allow people to have one</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigabyte is fucking insane fast.</v>

2545
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:39.040
<v Speaker 2>And if that happens you can stream live </v>
<v Speaker 2>from anywhere.</v>

2546
01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:39.993
<v Speaker 2>But say goodbye to privacy by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be drones filming people </v>

2547
01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:47.500
<v Speaker 2>right outside their window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get really crazy but live.</v>

2548
01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 2>But what's going to be interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can in a place like</v>

2549
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.650
<v Speaker 4>where you were and you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2550
01:46:52.651 --> 01:46:55.590
<v Speaker 4>call people from your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can film things,</v>

2551
01:46:55.591 --> 01:46:56.424
<v Speaker 4>you could stream live and all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be available and you would have </v>

2552
01:46:59.581 --> 01:47:02.160
<v Speaker 4>real Internet access in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the bush.</v>

2553
01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>for giving me this.</v>

2586
01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Just talk about landforms.</v>

2587
01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:16.950
<v Speaker 4>I really do think that it's made a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>impact.</v>

2588
01:48:16.951 --> 01:48:20.940
<v Speaker 4>And I think you and Rinella and Remy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Warren and Adam and the people that I've</v>

2589
01:48:20.941 --> 01:48:21.774
<v Speaker 4>had on it and Jim shockey and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real representatives of the noble </v>

2590
01:48:27.061 --> 01:48:28.970
<v Speaker 4>pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2591
01:48:28.971 --> 01:48:33.971
<v Speaker 4>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real hardcore enthusiasts that truly</v>

2592
01:48:35.161 --> 01:48:38.670
<v Speaker 4>have a deep love of nature and they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>given these people,</v>

2593
01:48:38.671 --> 01:48:39.504
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this platform and giving these people </v>

2594
01:48:40.951 --> 01:48:43.140
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this way to communicate these ideas.</v>

2595
01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:46.290
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the millions and millions of people that</v>

2596
01:48:46.291 --> 01:48:48.690
<v Speaker 4>have listened to you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's changed perception.</v>

2597
01:48:48.691 --> 01:48:49.524
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that perception is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a ripple effect and that </v>

2598
01:48:52.171 --> 01:48:55.410
<v Speaker 4>perception is going to lead people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe read your book,</v>

2599
01:48:55.610 --> 01:48:56.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

2600
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.650
<v Speaker 4>read maybe Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his book,</v>

2601
01:48:58.651 --> 01:49:02.580
<v Speaker 4>meat eater or maybe listen to some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these books on tape or maybe,</v>

2602
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:03.414
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look into Aldo leopold or looking to </v>

2603
01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:06.353
<v Speaker 4>some of these people that have really </v>
<v Speaker 4>been these huge figures in conservation </v>

2604
01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:11.544
<v Speaker 4>and the love of wildlife and hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'll get a different </v>

2605
01:49:13.891 --> 01:49:14.724
<v Speaker 4>understanding of it than people have had</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of movies like that split movie </v>

2606
01:49:18.301 --> 01:49:19.190
<v Speaker 4>where the hunters or purse,</v>

2607
01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trade is a child molester.</v>

2608
01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you said hunting was dying</v>

2609
01:49:24.731 --> 01:49:25.564
<v Speaker 1>or you know the one that was the fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're like in my instagram </v>

2610
01:49:29.681 --> 01:49:32.170
<v Speaker 1>page is 20 year old guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2611
01:49:32.171 --> 01:49:33.004

<v Speaker 1>our buying bows and the bell rack back </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2614
01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:46.930
<v Speaker 1>young girls waiting for her,</v>

<v Speaker 2>taking aim as about that lifestyle.</v>

2617
01:49:51.701 --> 01:49:52.534
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I feel like we're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning the corner maybe a little bit </v>

2618
01:49:55.841 --> 01:49:56.674
<v Speaker 2>and so we just keep that momentum going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for sure it's turning the </v>

2619
01:49:58.961 --> 01:49:59.621
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2620
01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:00.454
<v Speaker 2>as far as what I see in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication that I get with people </v>

2621
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:05.170
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the bowl rock,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wayne the other day,</v>

2626
01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:13.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even remember what day it was,</v>

2627
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:17.650

<v Speaker 2>day in a day.</v>

2628

<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2629
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:20.673
<v Speaker 2>For folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like 50,000 plus dollars in bows </v>

2630
01:50:24.281 --> 01:50:26.650
<v Speaker 2>in a day and bows or a specialized </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2631
01:50:26.651 --> 01:50:29.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that people,</v>

2632
01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:29.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2633
01:50:29.771 --> 01:50:30.604
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a steep learning curve to get </v>

2634
01:50:32.351 --> 01:50:33.550
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2635
01:50:33.551 --> 01:50:37.360
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about if there was a hoyt academy.</v>

2636
01:50:37.570 --> 01:50:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In California,</v>

2637
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:42.280
<v Speaker 2>if there's a place to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a whole lot of places to go.</v>

2638
01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:43.323
<v Speaker 2>Like when you took Scott Eastwood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went to that place down in </v>

2639
01:50:45.191 --> 01:50:46.480
<v Speaker 2>riverside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>riverside,</v>

2640
01:50:46.481 --> 01:50:47.380
<v Speaker 2>our streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>

2641
01:50:47.381 --> 01:50:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few great places like that,</v>

2642
01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:55.110
<v Speaker 2>but there's 30 million people here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be five of those spots.</v>

2643
01:50:55.271 --> 01:50:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2644
01:50:56.170 --> 01:50:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if hoyt had a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>where our,</v>

2645
01:50:59.241 --> 01:51:01.440
<v Speaker 2>ideally they had more than one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2646
01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:04.390
<v Speaker 2>where people could go and you would get </v>
<v Speaker 2>fitted.</v>

2647
01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:06.880
<v Speaker 2>They would find out what's your proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>draw length.</v>

2648
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:07.950
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2679
01:52:31.541 --> 01:52:32.470
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:41.190
<v Speaker 2>The sorcery of archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2683
01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:42.850
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful discipline.</v>

2684
01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean even if someone never choose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and honestly if</v>

2685
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 1>you really want to get into hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just straight up hunting,</v>

2686
01:52:48.651 --> 01:52:50.150
<v Speaker 1>he'd probably just start with a rifle </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2687
01:52:50.151 --> 01:52:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a far easier way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2688
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't say that.</v>

2689
01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Or wear earplugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do do it,</v>

2690
01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to blow your ears out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2691
01:52:58.161 --> 01:52:58.994
<v Speaker 1>Another problem that I'm running into is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have been hunting for a </v>

2692
01:53:01.701 --> 01:53:02.534
<v Speaker 1>good portion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a portion of their life have bad </v>

2693
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:04.994
<v Speaker 1>hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my ears ring all the time for </v>

2694
01:53:06.691 --> 01:53:08.000
<v Speaker 1>when I rifle hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2695
01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a kid cause I used to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot my 300 winchester magnum up at the</v>

2696
01:53:11.691 --> 01:53:14.350
<v Speaker 1>rock pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's thing was so loud.</v>

2697
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I used to love shooting and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2698
01:53:16.521 --> 01:53:18.080
<v Speaker 1>you're a pussy if you weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2699
01:53:18.081 --> 01:53:20.690
<v Speaker 1>nobody wore here re hearing protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Crazy.</v>

2700
01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just like nobody wore bike helmets </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

2701
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.863
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2702
01:53:23.890 --> 01:53:25.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now my ears,</v>

2703
01:53:25.471 --> 01:53:27.260
<v Speaker 1>this ring all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2704
01:53:27.261 --> 01:53:29.510

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2736

<v Speaker 1>he made fun of me.</v>

2737
01:54:49.191 --> 01:54:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I always put in my instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my music on the instant story.</v>

2738
01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Rap a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2739
01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.410
<v Speaker 1>a lot of rap though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2740
01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:57.340
<v Speaker 1>And country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what I listen to.</v>

2741
01:54:57.530 --> 01:54:59.750
<v Speaker 1>But then he had this song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2742
01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.441
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a song from?</v>

2744
01:55:02.421 --> 01:55:04.220
<v Speaker 1>From me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did he say?</v>

2745
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made something out.</v>

2746
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who probably lied.</v>

2747
01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Are there any Australian wrappers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are.</v>

2748
01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that anybody knows,</v>

2749
01:55:12.261 --> 01:55:13.820
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember they had,</v>

2750
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:14.683
<v Speaker 1>we had the radio on down there and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some rap on there that had no </v>

2751
01:55:18.141 --> 01:55:20.030
<v Speaker 1>idea what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be from there.</v>

2752
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Well there's so many different rappers </v>
<v Speaker 1>now though.</v>

2753
01:55:24.501 --> 01:55:26.480
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you could know all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2754
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:27.343
<v Speaker 1>It's like we've reached a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturation point with music where there </v>

2755
01:55:30.831 --> 01:55:31.664
<v Speaker 1>is no god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean every year that coming out with </v>

2756
01:55:32.841 --> 01:55:34.100
<v Speaker 1>new music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2757
01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:34.993
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean you get used to the certain </v>

2758
01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.750
<v Speaker 1>sounds or certain styles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was like something I had never.</v>

2759
01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to a lot.</v>

2760
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I was in Brazil.</v>

2761
01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:46.120
<v Speaker 2>You were in Brazil with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2762
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:47.850

<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>

2774
01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:11.550

2775
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Be Humble.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's white,</v>

2778
01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:26.340
<v Speaker 2>white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black people over there.</v>

2779
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:27.563
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>American expats sneak over there.</v>

2781
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:33.270

<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

2782
01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:34.283
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the few places I would </v>

2783
01:56:36.361 --> 01:56:38.510
<v Speaker 2>live outside of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if the shit hit,</v>

2784
01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:39.353
<v Speaker 2>that's nice there.</v>

2785
01:56:39.450 --> 01:56:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Canada and Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are my spots.</v>

2786
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:42.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>

2787
01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:43.133
<v Speaker 2>I mean Sydney traffic is ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they fucking drive on the wrong </v>

2788
01:56:46.681 --> 01:56:47.880
<v Speaker 2>side of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all confused.</v>

2789
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's on the left.</v>

2790
01:56:49.261 --> 01:56:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing over here or </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there?</v>

2791
01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's switch this around everybody.</v>

2792
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.750
<v Speaker 2>That's probably why it's all messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look,</v>

2793
01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.230
<v Speaker 2>the roads are in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

2794
01:56:58.231 --> 01:57:00.960
<v Speaker 2>They got roads in the right spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traveling the inside.</v>

2795
01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple fix.</v>

2796
01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll fix.</v>

2797
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.640
<v Speaker 2>How's Sydney?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So traffic filled.</v>

2798
01:57:05.641 --> 01:57:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people live in Sydney?</v>
<v Speaker 2>5 million.</v>

2799
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

2800
01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If 5 million.</v>

2801
01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.250
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2802
01:57:14.251 --> 01:57:19.251
<v Speaker 2>it took think of that because there's 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>million people in all of Australia or is</v>

2803
01:57:19.681 --> 01:57:21.300
<v Speaker 2>it less?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a little less,</v>

2804
01:57:21.301 --> 01:57:22.440
<v Speaker 2>probably less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2805
01:57:22.441 --> 01:57:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's 20 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

2806
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:30.230
<v Speaker 2>that would be like if there was 75 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million in Los Angeles.</v>

2807
01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more centered and more than that.</v>

2808
01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:39.090
<v Speaker 2>It'd be more be like 80 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 million people just in Los Angeles.</v>

2809
01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only like,</v>

2810
01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:45.120
<v Speaker 2>like a few big city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Melbourne or,</v>

2811
01:57:45.121 --> 01:57:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I probably said it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>23.7 million in all of Australia to five</v>

2812
01:57:49.301 --> 01:57:51.720
<v Speaker 2>or in Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2813
01:57:51.721 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>25% of the entire population.</v>

2814
01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful city though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2815
01:57:56.690 --> 01:57:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Sydney is really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2816
01:57:58.860 --> 01:57:59.431

<v Speaker 2>we were going to go to the boat shop and</v>

2818
01:58:02.401 --> 01:58:03.360

2822
01:58:07.111 --> 01:58:09.240
<v Speaker 2>So we did it on the map quest sang or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2823
01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.460

2825
01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:19.230

<v Speaker 2>Everything is fine.</v>

2826
01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.240
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about shit up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2827
01:58:21.241 --> 01:58:23.610
<v Speaker 2>You've got two lane roads and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

2828
01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:26.220
<v Speaker 2>If you don't make it through one traffic</v>
<v Speaker 2>light cycle,</v>

2829
01:58:26.221 --> 01:58:27.950
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is going on?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well you get used to a place like that </v>

2832
01:58:32.161 --> 01:58:33.390
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2833
01:58:33.391 --> 01:58:34.224
<v Speaker 2>and he life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice and calm and it feels </v>

2834
01:58:36.781 --> 01:58:37.614
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like life feels different in a small </v>

2835
01:58:39.331 --> 01:58:40.910
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a,</v>

2836
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:41.913
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is some woo woo spiritual </v>

2837
01:58:43.751 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 2>bullshit that I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2838
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:46.473
<v Speaker 2>no science behind whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like people give off energy </v>

2839
01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:50.763
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not something's happening or </v>

2840
01:58:52.871 --> 01:58:54.880
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of humans in there,</v>

2841
01:58:54.881 --> 01:58:55.714
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of energy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel and when you're in a smaller </v>

2842
01:58:58.001 --> 01:58:59.650
<v Speaker 2>town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're calmer.</v>

2843
01:58:59.770 --> 01:59:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that.</v>

2844
01:59:01.330 --> 01:59:02.163
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it's just the </v>

2845
01:59:05.561 --> 01:59:07.750
<v Speaker 2>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this cars.</v>

2846
01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:10.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's the actual amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans in an area.</v>

2847
01:59:10.841 --> 01:59:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some sort of a psychic </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy that they give off.</v>

02:00:26.501 --> 02:00:28.390
<v Speaker 2>like people don't have the time.</v>

2881
02:00:28.690 --> 02:00:29.523
<v Speaker 2>Like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to Jason Carter on some </v>

2882
02:00:31.571 --> 02:00:32.404
<v Speaker 2>podcasts who's talking about pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 2>one individual buck for like two weeks </v>

2883
02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:37.173
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck is two weeks ago after one </v>

2884
02:00:39.221 --> 02:00:40.990
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is crazy.</v>

2885
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Who's got that kind of time only like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

2886
02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:47.420
<v Speaker 2>like crazy before people pro type </v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

2887
02:00:47.421 --> 02:00:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2888
02:00:48.490 --> 02:00:49.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2889
02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:51.220
<v Speaker 2>It takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2890
02:00:51.221 --> 02:00:53.700
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even just the dedication to,</v>

2891
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:56.320
<v Speaker 2>to regular practice takes time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>archery,</v>

2892
02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:01.300
<v Speaker 2>but that's the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no mean archery is,</v>

2893
02:01:01.301 --> 02:01:02.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2894
02:01:03.070 --> 02:01:04.900
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of hunting,</v>

2895
02:01:04.901 --> 02:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>it really is the ultimate pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate in difficulty.</v>

2896
02:01:08.290 --> 02:01:10.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I stopped at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>compound thing.</v>

2897
02:01:10.151 --> 02:01:10.984
<v Speaker 2>People go to troy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional archery component or truce </v>

2898
02:01:12.941 --> 02:01:15.940
<v Speaker 2>for pussies settled down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2899
02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:18.430
<v Speaker 2>And that was enough fiber kill killer </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a rock.</v>

2900
02:01:18.490 --> 02:01:19.600
<v Speaker 2>How about you kill it with a rock layer?</v>

2901
02:01:19.610 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Cake person did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2902
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:21.880
<v Speaker 2>you wearing shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pussy.</v>

2903
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to wear shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always want to drink.</v>

2904
02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:25.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2905
02:01:25.061 --> 02:01:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I always wondered how anybody would kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2906
02:01:26.781 --> 02:01:27.614
<v Speaker 2>The recurve where I was hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I said my 245 feet per second </v>

2907
02:01:30.641 --> 02:01:31.810
<v Speaker 2>bolus slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2908
02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>That'd be super fast for a traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>bow.</v>

2909
02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

2910
02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I could imagine with this deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd just,</v>

2911
02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be very tough.</v>

2912
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Very tough here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably could.</v>

2913
02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know you were there.</v>

2914
02:01:44.161 --> 02:01:44.994
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2915
02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:49.070
<v Speaker 2>But it sounds like the area you were in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were very unnaturally hyped up,</v>

2916
02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.153
<v Speaker 2>like unnaturally wired because there've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been hunted by so many people think </v>

2917
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:53.953
<v Speaker 2>they're just normally wired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when people kill them is when </v>

2918
02:01:56.511 --> 02:01:57.770
<v Speaker 2>they're writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2919
02:01:57.771 --> 02:01:58.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're distracted because there it's </v>

2920
02:01:59.931 --> 02:02:01.140
<v Speaker 2>a breeding season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2921
02:02:01.190 --> 02:02:02.023
<v Speaker 2>So this is post Rut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those bucks are not even with dose at </v>

2922
02:02:05.361 --> 02:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>

2923
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2924
02:02:08.150 --> 02:02:10.460
<v Speaker 2>just tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But during the ride it would,</v>

2925
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:14.330
<v Speaker 2>it would be easier just be like hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>elk during the road as opposed to not,</v>

2926
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>or honey you do to the club with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boner.</v>

2927
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get distracted.</v>

2928
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I've never hunted a dude with a button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad.</v>

2929
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering.</v>

2930
02:02:24.710 --> 02:02:25.543
<v Speaker 2>I have questions and sometimes I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I beat around the Bush to get to the </v>

2931
02:02:28.911 --> 02:02:32.200
<v Speaker 2>answer all I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got what you're doing right then.</v>

2932
02:02:35.230 --> 02:02:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is this,</v>

2933
02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:37.773
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how these different animals </v>

2934
02:02:39.261 --> 02:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>have like different seasons that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>come into.</v>

2935
02:02:42.170 --> 02:02:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that only one time a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>they breed,</v>

2936
02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:47.270
<v Speaker 2>like there are a mammal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a dog.</v>

2937
02:02:47.271 --> 02:02:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Like dogs want to fuck all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like deer one time a year.</v>

2938
02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything starts on hop in.</v>

2939
02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Nature says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2940
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.050
<v Speaker 2>this is how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have a baby in the spring.</v>

2941
02:02:57.190 --> 02:02:59.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a way to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta do it in the fall.</v>

2942
02:02:59.360 --> 02:02:59.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2943
02:02:59.751 --> 02:03:04.070
<v Speaker 2>In the fall you got to get cracking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then she's got take some time to cook up</v>

2944
02:03:04.071 --> 02:03:06.470
<v Speaker 2>that baby and dropped that baby in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spring.</v>

2945
02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:09.500
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's bizarre.</v>

2946
02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually some bucks that were,</v>

2947
02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.940
<v Speaker 2>they call it croaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is grunting cause um,</v>

2948
02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:16.933
<v Speaker 2>they weren't really the full Rut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some doughs that didn't get bread </v>

2949
02:03:20.630 --> 02:03:21.620
<v Speaker 2>the first season.</v>

2950
02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:23.960
<v Speaker 2>If they don't get bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come back into heat.</v>

2951
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:26.930
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call them second cycle dose.</v>

2952
02:03:27.170 --> 02:03:28.520
<v Speaker 2>They were coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the bucks,</v>

2953
02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:29.503
<v Speaker 2>I mean they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do it whenever they just got to </v>

2954
02:03:30.591 --> 02:03:34.490
<v Speaker 2>wait for the female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the bucks were actually still sort of</v>

2955
02:03:34.491 --> 02:03:35.324
<v Speaker 2>writing a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We heard some croaking so that was full </v>

2956
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:39.081
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2957
02:03:39.081 --> 02:03:41.300
<v Speaker 2>there's just a few doughs that hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been bred.</v>

2958
02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the coolest things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about elk hunting.</v>

2959
02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:47.150
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing like the Rut when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear elk screaming.</v>

2960
02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Like if the people have never </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced that before,</v>

2961
02:03:49.791 --> 02:03:50.624
<v Speaker 2>even if you have no desire to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please go to a place where elk live </v>

2962
02:03:53.630 --> 02:03:55.130
<v Speaker 2>during the Rut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to hear it.</v>

2963
02:03:55.190 --> 02:03:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Cause it is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wild.</v>

2964
02:03:57.561 --> 02:03:58.394
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is so loud and the sound sounds </v>

2965
02:04:00.711 --> 02:04:02.240
<v Speaker 2>like something from the Lord of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rings.</v>

2966
02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even seem real.</v>

2967
02:04:03.710 --> 02:04:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to be in Utah this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2968
02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

<v Speaker 2>stuff there.</v>

2972
02:04:12.610 --> 02:04:13.910
<v Speaker 2>We're definitely going to film some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2973

2978
02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:27.493
<v Speaker 2>hundred yards away and it's wide open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Utah's a little bit more wooded </v>

2979
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:32.510
<v Speaker 2>and we'll try to get a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>closer.</v>
