<v Speaker 2>what I love is that you kept this studio the same as the old one because the</v>

11
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:25.120
<v Speaker 2>vibe was perfect.</v>

12

23
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 3>when you use a desk for a long time,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is in big Sur.</v>

69
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 3>That was when he was in the early stages of his eruption.</v>

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 3>That was like right around when he was writing hell's angels.</v>

71
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Probably 61.</v>

72

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

73

77
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.431
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

78
00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:27.820

<v Speaker 3>the one that was the mainstream one.</v>

81
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.293
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>

82
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

85
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.871
<v Speaker 3>And then there was,</v>

86
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

87
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.080

88
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 3>That's really good too.</v>

89
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

90
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:44.140
<v Speaker 3>if you could get ahold of fucking Hemingway's desk.</v>

91
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.353
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

92
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

93
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.141
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

94
00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:47.974
<v Speaker 3>let me maybe like,</v>

95
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.683
<v Speaker 3>worth too much.</v>

96
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Like you wouldn't want to write on it.</v>

97
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

98
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

99
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 2>It's Hemingway's desk,</v>

101
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 2>like I can't ride on this fucking thing.</v>

102
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

103
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.881
<v Speaker 2>It was hunter's desk.</v>

104
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd tell I'd totally right on it.</v>

105
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

106
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 2>first scrape the excess coke off the top.</v>

107
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Just lick it,</v>

108
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.913
<v Speaker 2>lick it off.</v>

109
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Wipe did jazz.</v>

110
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 2>And from the underside of the table I'll get the badge sauce off the sides.</v>

111
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 2>What about his typewriter?</v>

112
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>How much you think it's typewritten?</v>

113
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Hemingway's house and hangouts preserved in Havana.</v>

114
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

115
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.270
<v Speaker 2>So the preserved where he lived and</v>

116
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.160
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's where he killed himself.</v>

117
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.990
<v Speaker 4>I think he was in Cuba when he killed himself.</v>

118
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

119
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

120
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.501
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

121
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.334
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

122
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>his style of writing.</v>

123
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And like that whole bravado that went with him,</v>

124
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 2>he was a different cat.</v>

125
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.761
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

126
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:43.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

127
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.213
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

128
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you thought of him as like an aggressive male writer.</v>

129
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Like that's an odd thing.</v>

130
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.904
<v Speaker 2>Like Hemingway,</v>

131
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>he was a aggressive,</v>

132
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

133
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.700
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

134
00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 2>you mean even Stephen King for all was most horrific depictions of violence and</v>

135
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Gore and terror in his books.</v>

136
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>He's not thought of is like I said,</v>

137
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 2>posing physical thing.</v>

138
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

139
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Hemingway was in the war.</v>

140
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

141
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.530
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

142
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

143
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 2>He is elderly age.</v>

144
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.860
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>

145
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 4>he used to go skiing in the winter in a,</v>

146
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Switzerland and they would all,</v>

147
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:22.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

148
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.260
<v Speaker 4>there was no chairlifts back then.</v>

149
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:29.261
<v Speaker 4>So you would fucking grab your 50 pounds skis and walk up the side of the Alps,</v>

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Kind of exercise,</v>

156
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.790
<v Speaker 2>like carrying skis uphill in the snow.</v>

157
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

158

00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:50.391
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I bet there were jacked.</v>

161
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I put those skiers from the olden days.</v>

162
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

165
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.760
<v Speaker 4>And the skis were long back then.</v>

166
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.950
<v Speaker 4>They were like twice as long as they are now.</v>

167
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.990
<v Speaker 4>When did anybody figure out a ski lift?</v>

168
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.473
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

178
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:27.801
<v Speaker 4>maybe you do a dozen runs going up a couple miles and this one you do one run.</v>

179
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.083
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

180
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

200
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

201
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.011
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

202
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 4>How quickly you can fuck up your body skiing.</v>

203
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 4>I am so,</v>

204
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 4>I've skied my whole life.</v>

205
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 4>I've never had an injury and I ski hard.</v>

206
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 4>I hit ain't every fucking jump.</v>

207
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:09.914
<v Speaker 4>I can find</v>

208
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 3>the only one that I know that like my friend Matt,</v>

209
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 3>he broke his ankle or he broke his ankle and it happened in the course of like a</v>

210
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.690
<v Speaker 3>just a year.</v>

211
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

212
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 3>Two friends at school.</v>

213
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Parents at school blew out their ACL.</v>

214
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

215
00:06:25.921 --> 00:06:28.330
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to do that when you're 43 you don't.</v>

216
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.661
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

217
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:31.810
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing is you get to a certain age and you the risk reward because</v>

218
00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:36.160
<v Speaker 4>injuries take so much longer to heal and you have so much less time to live.</v>

219
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.031
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>

220
00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 4>the math doesn't work anymore to ski.</v>

221
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.460
<v Speaker 3>You've got to protect your knees if you can.</v>

222
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

223
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.890
<v Speaker 3>Your knees are so God damn important.</v>

224
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Whenever people have like hurt knees and they keep working out,</v>

225
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 3>I always cringe.</v>

226
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

227
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.921
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

228
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:51.131
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

229
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:52.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get it fixed.</v>

230
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to rehab it and like,</v>

231
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:54.430
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

232
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.930
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about rehabbing.</v>

233
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.771
<v Speaker 3>No rehabbing.</v>

234
00:06:56.771 --> 00:07:00.610
<v Speaker 3>You just going to ignore the fact that you don't have an ACL like rehabbing.</v>

235
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

236
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.391
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

237
00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:01.930
<v Speaker 3>it get it fixed.</v>

238
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.740
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to,</v>

239
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.470
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the stability in your knees.</v>

240
00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of guys who blow it out and they keep exercising and they just</v>

241
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:09.450
<v Speaker 3>chew the inside of their knee.</v>

242
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.673
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

243
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

244
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:12.510
<v Speaker 4>I got something going on in my,</v>

245
00:07:12.511 --> 00:07:14.910
<v Speaker 4>the inside of my left knee for two fucking months.</v>

246
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 4>If I try to squat down,</v>

247
00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:20.190
<v Speaker 4>it kills is like a tended on the inside of the knee.</v>

248
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.600
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

249
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.200
<v Speaker 4>so I'm,</v>

250
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna start some physical therapy this week to try to figure it out,</v>

251
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:25.231
<v Speaker 4>cause I can't,</v>

252
00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:28.800
<v Speaker 4>I have an exercise and fucking two months just because of this one thing.</v>

253
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.431
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

254
00:07:29.431 --> 00:07:30.264
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to do?</v>

255
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.920
<v Speaker 4>But I do more cardio.</v>

256
00:07:31.921 --> 00:07:33.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't really lift that much.</v>

257
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever thought about getting like PRP or Regena keen or anything into it?</v>

258
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.481
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

259
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.314
<v Speaker 4>now what's that?</v>

260
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

261
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 3>PRP is platelet rich plasma.</v>

262
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 3>And will they do is they take your blood and there's some sort of a process they</v>

263
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:51.130
<v Speaker 3>do and the separate it and then they take this platelet rich plasma and the</v>

264
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 3>injected into the wounded area and accelerates healing.</v>

265
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have really good results with that.</v>

266
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

267
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 3>and then there's this stuff called Regena keen that's like platelet rich plasma,</v>

268
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:05.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's apparently the next step up and what they do is they heat your blood</v>

269
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 3>and by heating it,</v>

270
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 3>it produces some,</v>

271
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.501
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

272
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:10.191
<v Speaker 3>If you're a doctor,</v>

273
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry that I'm butchering this if you're a scientist,</v>

274
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.970
<v Speaker 3>but I think it produces some sort of a anti-inflammatory serum because your</v>

275
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 3>blood is reacting to the heat.</v>

276
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.341
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

277
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Here's the here explains,</v>

278
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 3>I've had this done and it was really effective.</v>

279
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:27.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

280
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 3>Serum removed from the layer and cultured with glass beads so that a white blood</v>

281
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:37.481
<v Speaker 3>white blood cells per to use r r a p which is a natural anti-inflammatory glass</v>

282
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 3>beads going into your knee.</v>

283
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what that's saying.</v>

284
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.280
<v Speaker 3>It says Cierra was removed from this layer and cultured with glass beads,</v>

285
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 3>so it's removed after the platelet.</v>

286
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Rich Plasma said they made complete Louis Rich plasma.</v>

287
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 3>They get the serum and then they,</v>

288
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 3>and then they culture it so that the white blood cells produced this natural</v>

289
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 3>antiinflammatory.</v>

290
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 3>So they trick the white blood cells.</v>

291
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe for lack of a better word.</v>

292
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.031
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 3>if they get surgery,</v>

299
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 3>they get surgery and then they have some of this done to,</v>

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 3>it accelerates the healing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

334
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.190
<v Speaker 3>but I want your blood in my car,</v>

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's legal.</v>

337
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.150
<v Speaker 3>You can sell all kinds of things.</v>

338
00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:07.331
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

339
00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:09.010
<v Speaker 3>but you can't sell somebody your own blood.</v>

340
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

341
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

342
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he could sell your own blood?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

347
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 3>There's a website you could probably do.</v>

348
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.453
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>

349
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.791
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

350
00:10:18.791 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 3>like a dark web and that whole myth about selling people's cases.</v>

<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

353
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 4>William Shatner would be dealing it if he could.</v>

354
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:24.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

355
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.090
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

357
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 3>You could just like,</v>

358
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.660
<v Speaker 3>if someone was selling blood like some,</v>

359
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.610
<v Speaker 3>young enterprising young gals on the internet that smelled like dirty socks.</v>

363
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.643
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

364

365
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.663
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>

366
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.343
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:44.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nothing goes to waste.</v>

370
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

371
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Nothing goes full blood for sale.</v>

372
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 3>India is illegal.</v>

373
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:51.361
<v Speaker 3>Red Market.</v>

374
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:52.194
<v Speaker 3>What is this Jamie?</v>

375
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.291
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>

377
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.443
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

378
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it like medically though in an alleyway.</v>

379
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

380
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 3>But that's how they do it there,</v>

381
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:00.751
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

383
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Or is there still a ban on a</v>

384
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Haitian people and gay people giving blood?</v>

385
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good question because they've,</v>

386
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 3>they've gotten so close to stopping HIV,</v>

387
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.203
<v Speaker 3>they can get it like,</v>

388
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 3>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

389
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 3>they can get it like to you to the point where you're,</v>

390
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.980
<v Speaker 3>you can't even detect it.</v>

391
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.873
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

392
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.103
<v Speaker 3>Which is incredible.</v>

393
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

394
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.980
<v Speaker 4>And then now in the third world,</v>

395
00:11:26.981 --> 00:11:27.401
<v Speaker 4>because my,</v>

396
00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:27.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

397
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 4>my friend Peter Current,</v>

398
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.740
<v Speaker 4>he lives in a symbolic way and uh,</v>

399
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.491
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

400
00:11:33.491 --> 00:11:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Mozambique and he used to work for the health department in La County.</v>

401
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:40.330
<v Speaker 4>He was the guy that was in charge of AIDS prevention.</v>

402
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 4>And so he got a job working over in Africa and he said that you can now cure,</v>

403
00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:48.311
<v Speaker 4>not cure,</v>

404
00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:53.311
<v Speaker 4>but stabilize somebody with HIV with a pill that's like $60 a month</v>

405
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

406
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

407
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

408
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 2>They've got the price way down in Africa now.</v>

409
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

410
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Why is there's so many cases of HIV in Africa?</v>

411
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

412
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 2>well I think when nutrition is poor but then there's more cutting and bleeding</v>

413
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 2>because I had heard that a lot of what you see in terms of like if they're</v>

414
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 2>talking about aids in Africa,</v>

415
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 2>that it's very easy to put aids,</v>

416
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 2>like put like that category aids,</v>

417
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

418
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.970
<v Speaker 2>that sometimes it's just people with damaged immune systems from a host of</v>

419
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 2>different diseases that it's sometimes people aren't getting tested.</v>

420
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I was wondered like how many those people are tested for HIV?</v>

421
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

422
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.471
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

423
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:39.304
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

424
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.810
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that a guy like magic Johnson has had it since you remember when</v>

425
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you heard Magic Johnson had I was in a panic.</v>

426
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

427
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was a Zombie movie.</v>

428
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Like it's happened.</v>

429
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:51.490
<v Speaker 2>It started and then people were just going to get it.</v>

430
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 2>We're all gonna dive aids.</v>

431
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Everybody what our generation when you and I were like 21 that's what everybody</v>

432
00:12:56.681 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

433
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's going to die from AIDS right now.</v>

434
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Magic Johnson's looks great.</v>

435
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 2>He's still alive.</v>

437
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

438
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I think of how many people who've died.</v>

439
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.880
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have HIV and we're worried about this one thing.</v>

440
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I remember he wanted to play in the all star game and all the players were like,</v>

441
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:11.821
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

442
00:13:11.821 --> 00:13:12.654
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

443
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 2>It's to be a slam dunk contest.</v>

444
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 2>But this Jesus Christ.</v>

445
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 2>But what did,</v>

446
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.700
<v Speaker 2>what did fucking Damon Wayans you used to have a bit about Dennis Rodman</v>

447
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.730
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

448
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.080
<v Speaker 2>It's about Dennis Rodman spit and then magic Johnson smile to accelerate his</v>

449
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:35.914
<v Speaker 2>symptoms.</v>

450
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

451
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.890
<v Speaker 2>if he wanted to try to get hardcore with them,</v>

452
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>

453
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I hope he did.</v>

454
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Damon's,</v>

455
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge Damon Waynes fan,</v>

456
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.090
<v Speaker 2>so I hope I'm not butchering his bit.</v>

457
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

458
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.880
<v Speaker 2>but I think that was one.</v>

459
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I know that was his line.</v>

460
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate your symptom.</v>

461
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:57.723
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

462
00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Damian Wayans my opinion is like one of the most ignored greats.</v>

463
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.041
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

464
00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:04.671
<v Speaker 5>100%.</v>

465
00:14:04.671 --> 00:14:07.750
<v Speaker 5>I used to open for him sometimes and uh,</v>

466
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.751
<v Speaker 5>twice.</v>

467
00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:10.850
<v Speaker 5>I remember him coming in on a Thursday night.</v>

468
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.380
<v Speaker 5>It was Thursday to Sunday.</v>

469
00:14:12.381 --> 00:14:13.790
<v Speaker 5>Faneuil hall comedy connection.</v>

470
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.770
<v Speaker 5>Thursday night he comes in fucking yellow pads.</v>

471
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.850
<v Speaker 5>He goes up and just regurgitates a new hour and gets,</v>

472
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:23.511
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

473
00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:25.010
<v Speaker 5>laugh for a new hour.</v>

474
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.160
<v Speaker 5>Friday night he comes back tighter,</v>

475
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.930
<v Speaker 5>tighter Sunday night.</v>

476
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.540
<v Speaker 5>It's like he would fucking destroy with a new hour.</v>

477
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.160
<v Speaker 5>It was so crazy.</v>

478
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.570
<v Speaker 2>He's really good man.</v>

479
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

480
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.620
<v Speaker 2>He would go,</v>

481
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.620
<v Speaker 2>he would just go up at the comedy store and literally let whatever thought came</v>

482
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:47.970
<v Speaker 2>into his head and he would take long sets and he would take that stuff and he</v>

483
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.030
<v Speaker 2>would turn that stuff into killer closing bits.</v>

484
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

485
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>But for whatever</v>

486
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.371
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>

487
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:54.740
<v Speaker 3>I think he just got into doing sitcoms more.</v>

488
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

489

<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was going to be the original cast.</v>

635
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I might've been part of the original cast.</v>

636
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.451
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That would be cool.</v>

656
00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 2>That show was so good.</v>

657
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching it.</v>

658
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I was playing pool in Yonkers,</v>

659
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:01.730
<v Speaker 2>New York and I looked up at this,</v>

660
00:19:01.731 --> 00:19:05.730
<v Speaker 2>this TV set and it was a Jim Carrey doing the,</v>

661
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.863
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

662
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 2>the fire marsh or fire fire Marshal Bill.</v>

663
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.691
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

664
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.220
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on?</v>

665
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

666
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.060
<v Speaker 2>This guy's got a burnt up face.</v>

667
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Rosie Perez was the core your ground for for the first four seasons.</v>

668
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

669
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

670
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.141
<v Speaker 2>Rosie Perez,</v>

671
00:19:21.141 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 2>a giant boxing fan.</v>

672
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

673
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Giant boxing,</v>

674
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

675
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

676
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.431
<v Speaker 2>Like people,</v>

677
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 2>like she's like a boxing expert.</v>

678
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Not like an expert.</v>

679
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Like she could train fighters,</v>

680
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 2>but like people asked her questions about boxing.</v>

681
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 2>She's a real enthusiast.</v>

682
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 2>That's a better term instead of an expert.</v>

683
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe she is an expert,</v>

684
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:38.514
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

685
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

686
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.440
<v Speaker 2>she is always around box.</v>

687
00:19:41.441 --> 00:19:42.031
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so,</v>

688
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:43.510
<v Speaker 2>because you always think of her as having,</v>

689
00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 2>that's the cute voice and you know,</v>

690
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 2>in all of those comedies and to see her at like boxing matches a really right</v>

691
00:19:49.951 --> 00:19:50.260
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

692
00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:50.660

698
00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:55.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

699
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

700
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:56.290
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

701
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:56.971

<v Speaker 2>so different than like,</v>

707
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:05.191

00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:08.220

<v Speaker 2>I can't believe they have a character like this.</v>

736
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.780
<v Speaker 2>It was so over the top.</v>

737
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Jim Carrey or maybe</v>

738
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

739
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 5>the one of the Wayans brothers has bought up the rights for reruns because they</v>

740
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 5>don't want that</v>

741
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.043
<v Speaker 3>blowback?</v>

742
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

743
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:57.511
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

744
00:20:57.511 --> 00:20:58.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a different era.</v>

745
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.630
<v Speaker 3>You have to accept as a different era.</v>

746
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.513
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

747
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.503
<v Speaker 3>people were different.</v>

748
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

749
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.000
<v Speaker 3>people are changing and it's really interesting,</v>

750
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.630
<v Speaker 3>obvious sign that things that were super acceptable.</v>

751
00:21:09.631 --> 00:21:11.760
<v Speaker 3>And when was this in living color?</v>

752
00:21:11.761 --> 00:21:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was like 92,</v>

753
00:21:14.101 --> 00:21:15.090
<v Speaker 3>90 to 94.</v>

754
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.650
<v Speaker 3>9,094 yeah.</v>

755
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.680
<v Speaker 3>So that the way you could do certain bits and what you'd get away with and put</v>

756
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:23.851
<v Speaker 3>on television,</v>

757
00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:24.684
<v Speaker 3>it was just different.</v>

758
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.240
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's one of the,</v>

759
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:32.270
<v Speaker 3>like probably one of the least understood things that's happening with us with</v>

760
00:21:32.941 --> 00:21:37.770
<v Speaker 3>social media is as the rapid evolution of what's acceptable,</v>

761
00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:38.970
<v Speaker 3>not acceptable anymore.</v>

762
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.070
<v Speaker 3>And it's changing very quickly.</v>

763
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.600
<v Speaker 3>In terms of subjects,</v>

764
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.270
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the way you approach things,</v>

765
00:21:45.271 --> 00:21:49.350
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like obvious bigotry or obvious bias,</v>

766
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:51.300
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's all getting very highlighted.</v>

767
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.331
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

768
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

769
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.420
<v Speaker 5>I think the big question is whether or not you see an artist as somebody who's</v>

770
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.260
<v Speaker 5>taking their inner vision and putting it out and you go for the ride or you</v>

771
00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:03.094
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>

772
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.150
<v Speaker 5>Or is it,</v>

773
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.920
<v Speaker 5>are we supposed to be representing society in our standup?</v>

774
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 5>Or is it all supposed to be fair,</v>

775
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.860
<v Speaker 5>balanced representations of different ethnic groups and genders?</v>

776
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:15.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

777
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:15.770
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

778
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:16.603
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

779
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.060
<v Speaker 5>when did it all have to become a morality tale?</v>

780
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 5>When did every depiction of every race have to be fair?</v>

781
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.823
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

782
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.870
<v Speaker 5>can't you have an asshole who's black?</v>

783
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 5>Can't you have a killer who's gay without it becoming a depiction of that</v>

784
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:31.834
<v Speaker 5>entire,</v>

785
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.733
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

786
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.603
<v Speaker 5>subgroup?</v>

787
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

788
00:22:34.261 --> 00:22:35.094
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

789
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.510
<v Speaker 3>if what our real problem is that prejudice does exist,</v>

790
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.800
<v Speaker 3>so when it does exist,</v>

791
00:22:40.801 --> 00:22:43.020
<v Speaker 3>you kind of look for it and things and you say,</v>

792
00:22:43.021 --> 00:22:43.650
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

793
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.780
<v Speaker 3>this has the characteristics of prejudice.</v>

794
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.980
<v Speaker 3>I see this here.</v>

795
00:22:46.981 --> 00:22:49.650
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're doing here that I think this is prejudice.</v>

796
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 3>We say,</v>

797
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:50.311
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

798
00:22:50.311 --> 00:22:50.371
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

799
00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:50.581
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

800
00:22:50.581 --> 00:22:52.710
<v Speaker 3>This is making fun of Puerto Rican men.</v>

801
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.360
<v Speaker 3>This is not prejudice.</v>

802
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

803
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.420
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

804
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

805
00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:00.990
<v Speaker 3>an account of real occurrences that I've turned into humor.</v>

806
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

807
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:01.681
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

808
00:23:01.681 --> 00:23:04.890
<v Speaker 3>the flamboyant masculinity of Puerto Rican men.</v>

809
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

810
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.110
<v Speaker 3>like in New York,</v>

811
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.630
<v Speaker 3>like that's if you,</v>

812
00:23:09.631 --> 00:23:13.980
<v Speaker 3>if you thought of a type of a Latino sort of,</v>

813
00:23:13.981 --> 00:23:14.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

814
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.870
<v Speaker 3>the bravado,</v>

815
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

816
00:23:16.321 --> 00:23:17.340
<v Speaker 3>the music,</v>

817
00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:18.061
<v Speaker 3>the food,</v>

818
00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 3>everything spicy.</v>

819
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.330
<v Speaker 3>Like if you can't make fun of that.</v>

820
00:23:21.331 --> 00:23:21.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

821
00:23:21.511 --> 00:23:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

822
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.560
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

823
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.080
<v Speaker 5>I Know Collin Quinn does a whole thing about how racist,</v>

824
00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:25.380
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

825
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.330
<v Speaker 5>Puerto Ricans who never inside or outside,</v>

826
00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:28.164
<v Speaker 5>they're always both.</v>

827
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 5>Like there's always a window open.</v>

828
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.080
<v Speaker 5>People on the inside and outside of dogging the car door is always open.</v>

829
00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:35.130
<v Speaker 5>They're half in the car.</v>

830
00:23:35.131 --> 00:23:36.150
<v Speaker 5>They're half right.</v>

831
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.350
<v Speaker 5>This isn't racist.</v>

832
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.640
<v Speaker 5>This is observation.</v>

833
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 5>Can I take an option rate?</v>

834
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.790
<v Speaker 5>Can I tell you that yesterday,</v>

835
00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 5>about twice a week I go to this Japanese market in Mar Vista and they've got all</v>

836
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 5>different</v>

837
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.761
<v Speaker 4>kinds of,</v>

838
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

839
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:47.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

840
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:52.721
<v Speaker 4>you can get Sushi tempura whatever the parking lot for this place,</v>

841
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:58.541
<v Speaker 4>because 80% of the people that are Asian film it and put it on a fucking</v>

842
00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.601
<v Speaker 4>television channel.</v>

843
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:00.320
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

844
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 4>it is just people.</v>

845
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you produce it?</v>

846
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.010
<v Speaker 4>I could announce it like I was Adj Foy.</v>

847
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.810
<v Speaker 3>You're an Emmy award winning writer.</v>

848
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.580
<v Speaker 3>You could actually do something like that.</v>

849
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.050
<v Speaker 3>You're like a legit writer.</v>

850
00:24:11.051 --> 00:24:12.310
<v Speaker 3>You could totally produce that.</v>

851
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine announced it like Nascar.</v>

852
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.090
<v Speaker 4>It's just people like not getting how to get out of a parking spot with us</v>

853
00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:24.091
<v Speaker 4>taking like eight k turns and people on the wrong side of the street and backing</v>

854
00:24:24.251 --> 00:24:27.100
<v Speaker 4>up without looking over the shoulders and they're all Asian and it's fucking</v>

855
00:24:27.101 --> 00:24:27.910
<v Speaker 4>hilarious.</v>

856
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.600
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

857
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.830
<v Speaker 4>I didn't tell them to do it.</v>

858
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.690
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say it was wrong,</v>

859
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:33.280
<v Speaker 4>but it's happening.</v>

860
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:34.863
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

861
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Dave explained it,</v>

862
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:37.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

863
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.210
<v Speaker 3>why it's a stereotype,</v>

864
00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:42.150
<v Speaker 3>but why also why Asian people would,</v>

865
00:24:42.151 --> 00:24:42.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

866
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.750
<v Speaker 3>be more likely to walk straight.</v>

867
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.560
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

868
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:46.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

869
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.521
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>

870
00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:50.670
<v Speaker 3>if you go to China or if you go to any of those,</v>

871
00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:50.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

872
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:51.683
<v Speaker 3>Asian company,</v>

873
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:51.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

874
00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:52.763
<v Speaker 3>Asian countries,</v>

875
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.900
<v Speaker 3>when people walk straight at each other,</v>

876
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.570
<v Speaker 3>they all kind of have this way of touching and they just,</v>

877
00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.590
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people,</v>

878
00:24:58.591 --> 00:25:00.270
<v Speaker 3>they're just grinding past each other.</v>

879
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

880
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.411
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

881
00:25:01.411 --> 00:25:04.020
<v Speaker 3>So when you're in China in particular,</v>

882
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.590
<v Speaker 3>people are like indifferent to bumping into you.</v>

883
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.180
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother them at all.</v>

884
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.350
<v Speaker 3>They just bump into you.</v>

885
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're in the aisle of a plane,</v>

886
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:13.860
<v Speaker 3>they just bump into you.</v>

887
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

888
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.861
<v Speaker 3>Like they'll do it.</v>

889
00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:16.570
<v Speaker 3>The little kids just walk right through it.</v>

890
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

891
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.491
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

892
00:25:17.491 --> 00:25:18.301
<v Speaker 3>that's how they did.</v>

893
00:25:18.301 --> 00:25:19.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not rude.</v>

894
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Just like how's culturally different?</v>

895
00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

896
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:21.763
<v Speaker 3>It's more crowded.</v>

897
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Why can't you comment on that?</v>

898
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Or couldn't you comment on that?</v>

899
00:25:24.781 --> 00:25:25.614
<v Speaker 3>If that's a real thing,</v>

900
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:26.610
<v Speaker 3>because that is a real thing.</v>

901
00:25:26.611 --> 00:25:27.450
<v Speaker 3>They do do that.</v>

902
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

903
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.610
<v Speaker 3>They also do a lot of great stuff.</v>

904
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:29.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

905
00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:30.780
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you're not,</v>

906
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a negative judgment on the entire race because they have this one</v>

907
00:25:34.051 --> 00:25:34.884
<v Speaker 3>characteristic,</v>

908
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.920
<v Speaker 3>but to ignore that one characteristic seems crazy.</v>

909
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

910
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:38.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

911
00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:41.190
<v Speaker 3>why can't I talk about something like,</v>

912
00:25:41.191 --> 00:25:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

913
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.590
<v Speaker 3>it's not mean I'm not a bad person to talk about a real thing that you see and I</v>

914
00:25:46.591 --> 00:25:47.040
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

915
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

916
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.310
<v Speaker 4>I get booed on stage sometimes.</v>

917
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:53.410
<v Speaker 4>Now that never used to happen for what?</v>

918
00:25:53.411 --> 00:25:54.244
<v Speaker 4>What'd you say?</v>

919
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.870
<v Speaker 4>I did a joke.</v>

920
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.070
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to say the joke,</v>

921
00:25:57.071 --> 00:25:58.260
<v Speaker 4>but just say it.</v>

922
00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't care because I don't think it's offensive,</v>

923
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.100
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>

924
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.520
<v Speaker 4>but this person did and it was uh,</v>

925
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

929
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.210
<v Speaker 4>Those little whores are out there popping up their tables wherever you are</v>

930
00:26:10.211 --> 00:26:11.560

<v Speaker 4>shitty overprice.</v>

932
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.580
<v Speaker 4>But you buy them cause it makes you feel good.</v>

933
00:26:15.581 --> 00:26:16.630
<v Speaker 4>Like you're a good person,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's universally accepted.</v>

955
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

956

<v Speaker 2>I don't eat that stuff.</v>

973
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you kind of have to buy girl scout cookies.</v>

974
00:27:24.391 --> 00:27:25.430
<v Speaker 2>You want to support the girls camp,</v>

975
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.760
<v Speaker 2>but you know it's such a scam.</v>

976
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 2>All that money goes to the manufacturer.</v>

977
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Apparently the girl scouts make like 20% of the the cookie money.</v>

978
00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Probably the MOA.</v>

985
00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Moa is,</v>

986
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.860

987
00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Those are the shit.</v>

988
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 2>With a cold glass of milk.</v>

00:27:51.631 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 2>It almost tastes like neat.</v>

994
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Then look at it.</v>

995
00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.821
<v Speaker 2>It's chocolate.</v>

996
00:27:55.821 --> 00:27:56.411
<v Speaker 2>Eat Coconut.</v>

997
00:27:56.411 --> 00:27:57.244
<v Speaker 2>He goodness.</v>

998
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Why do they have to be so bad for you?</v>

999
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.823
<v Speaker 2>When I was,</v>

1000
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.410
<v Speaker 2>when I was working on a TV show,</v>

1001
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.520
<v Speaker 2>one of the producers had a daughter who was in the girl scouts and I guess you</v>

1002
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 2>win contest if you sell over if you sell the most cookie boxes.</v>

1003
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:18.000
<v Speaker 2>So when the audience would stream out after the show is a daily Shell and the</v>

1004
00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:20.040
<v Speaker 2>audience was stream out and uh,</v>

1005
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Speaker 2>the girl had a table set up to sell our cookies and she was selling a hundred</v>

1006
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:29.661
<v Speaker 2>boxes a day and for every day she was there fucking won that contest dam.</v>

1007
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 2>And they would have the audience,</v>

1008
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:38.460
<v Speaker 2>a warm up guy like plug it during the shell,</v>

1009
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:39.241
<v Speaker 2>like after the shit,</v>

1010
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 2>like a comedian selling his cds after the show you go buy some girl scout</v>

1011
00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:45.150
<v Speaker 2>cookies on the way out and all these,</v>

1012
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.570
<v Speaker 2>these fat people from the Midwest or like Kooky,</v>

1013
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.420
<v Speaker 2>like Marie Callender's died.</v>

1014
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Just have pie.</v>

1015
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Just Pie.</v>

1016
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.363
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Pie.</v>

1017
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.013
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1018
00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Not even good pie.</v>

1019
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.911
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>

1020
00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:01.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's not great considering it's all they do.</v>

1021
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I should have eaten there.</v>

1022
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever eaten there.</v>

1023
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I eat it one,</v>

1024
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I had their Pi.</v>

1025
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.840

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.253
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go broke,</v>

1032
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 2>but they're everywhere.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We know you have an element.</v>

1034
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.580
<v Speaker 2>We know you have flour branch out a little bit.</v>

1035
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Like who the fuck gets famous as selling pies?</v>

1036
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Like how genius is that company?</v>

1037
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Admins member Edmonds intimates,</v>

1038
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.211
<v Speaker 2>but then they,</v>

1039
00:29:32.211 --> 00:29:32.730
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1040
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.480
<v Speaker 2>they broke out.</v>

1041
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 2>They started doing cakes and cookies too,</v>

1042
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:35.490
<v Speaker 2>but they all,</v>

1043
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.200
<v Speaker 2>they did just pies for a long time.</v>

1044
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.591
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1045
00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 2>They used to have this,</v>

1046
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.160
<v Speaker 2>this Ah God,</v>

1047
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.850
<v Speaker 2>this pastry.</v>

1048
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think of what the hell it was,</v>

1049
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 3>but it had like,</v>

1050
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.750
<v Speaker 3>like hard sugar on the outside of it and then it had some sort of creamy sweet</v>

1051
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 3>stuff on the inside of it.</v>

1052
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1053
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Was it good?</v>

1054
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.131
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>

1056
00:29:58.131 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 3>We lived off that shit.</v>

1057
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 3>We ain't meds every night.</v>

1058
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:00.964
<v Speaker 3>They had like,</v>

1059
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.470
<v Speaker 3>they had one that had like a chocolate filling in it and it was powdered outsize</v>

1060
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.353
<v Speaker 3>filled</v>

1061
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.080
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>

1062
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.760
<v Speaker 3>They went out of business and then they say,</v>

1063
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:09.971
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1064
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 3>that was the cheese one.</v>

1065
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.580
<v Speaker 3>That was a good one too.</v>

1066
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I remember the cheese filled crumb,</v>

1067
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1068
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 3>they had some ridiculously delicious shit.</v>

1069
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:19.330
<v Speaker 3>What are the other big ones?</v>

1071
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1072
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:23.200
<v Speaker 3>I decided to fight in a tournament once because a,</v>

1073
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I had a crazy sugar high from Dunkin donuts.</v>

1074
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 3>I'd hurt myself or hurt,</v>

1075
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1076
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 3>something in my crotch and I couldn't work out for like a week that pulled some</v>

1077
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:36.460
<v Speaker 3>sort of a muscle and there was a big tournament that was coming up.</v>

1078
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.193
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1079
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.951
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

1080
00:30:38.951 --> 00:30:40.060
<v Speaker 3>the guys that are competed with,</v>

1081
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:40.811
<v Speaker 3>we're going to this tournament.</v>

1082
00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 3>It was like I had just fought like a week before.</v>

1083
00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:43.451
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1084
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can do it.</v>

1085
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:44.681
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1086
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't feel right.</v>

1087
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna take the whole week off.</v>

1088
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 3>So I decided I'm just going to take off,</v>

1089
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 3>let this thing heal.</v>

1090
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:50.951
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1091
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:51.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1092
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.050
<v Speaker 3>delivering my newspapers and I go to Dunkin donuts and I got this powdered lemon</v>

1093
00:30:56.051 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 3>filled donut.</v>

1094
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I got one of those and I got a,</v>

1095
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:01.020
<v Speaker 3>a Boston cream donut,</v>

1096
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.433
<v Speaker 3>one of those.</v>

1097
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.010
<v Speaker 3>And I got a,</v>

1098
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 3>I ate like three donuts cause I'd be exhausted,</v>

1099
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 3>tired,</v>

1100
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:08.800
<v Speaker 3>drinking coffee,</v>

1101
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:10.750
<v Speaker 3>delivering fucking newspapers for three hours.</v>

1102
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 3>And I was so jacked on sugar and coffee that I said,</v>

1103
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:16.271
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

1104
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:17.104
<v Speaker 3>I want to fight.</v>

1105
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 3>And so I drove.</v>

1106
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.370
<v Speaker 3>I drove into town like right before everybody was leaving.</v>

1107
00:31:23.371 --> 00:31:23.681
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

1108
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:24.430
<v Speaker 3>why are you here?</v>

1109
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1110
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fight anyway,</v>

1111
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:26.674
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1112
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Like Beavis and Butthead,</v>

1113
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I won.</v>

1114
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Speaker 3>I won the tournament.</v>

1115
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.010
<v Speaker 3>It was a giant tournament for me.</v>

1116
00:31:33.011 --> 00:31:33.844
<v Speaker 3>It was big.</v>

1117
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.170
<v Speaker 3>It was the American open.</v>

1118
00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:36.004
<v Speaker 3>It was like a big,</v>

1119
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.023
<v Speaker 3>it's a big deal.</v>

1120
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1121
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1122
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't going to do it.</v>

1123
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 3>I got jacked up on sugar and made a rash decision.</v>

1124
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 3>I can see you winning the first match,</v>

1125
00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:44.930
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>

1126
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:45.520
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>

1127
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 3>then you crash.</v>

1128
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:47.131
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1129
00:31:47.131 --> 00:31:48.010
<v Speaker 3>you got to keep fighting.</v>

1130
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.431
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1131
00:31:48.431 --> 00:31:49.181
<v Speaker 3>it didn't.</v>

1132
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:50.650
<v Speaker 3>It worked out somehow or another,</v>

1133
00:31:50.651 --> 00:31:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I guess I ate when I got there too,</v>

1134
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.160
<v Speaker 3>but also the week off,</v>

1135
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:54.821
<v Speaker 3>I'd never done that.</v>

1136
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Like taking a week off.</v>

1137
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes when you do something like that where you,</v>

1138
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 3>if you exercise too much,</v>

1139
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:05.680
<v Speaker 3>you're really always in a state of recovery and your body doesn't get a chance</v>

1140
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:07.600
<v Speaker 3>to like fully charged back up again.</v>

1141
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.420
<v Speaker 3>So at the time I was probably 19 and I was going hard like every day,</v>

1142
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.191
<v Speaker 3>every day that I could,</v>

1143
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 3>so I'd never really taken a week off.</v>

1144
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 3>So taking a week off and just be like,</v>

1145
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:16.240
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1146
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:16.810
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1147
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I did take a week off when I started getting laid.</v>

1148
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 3>That is one thing that happened the first time he got late.</v>

1150
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.620
<v Speaker 3>When I first started getting laid,</v>

1152
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 3>I took a long time off and at yelled at.</v>

1153
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Like I yelled and I wasn't doing any training.</v>

1155
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 3>I came back all tanned and shit.</v>

1156
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.890
<v Speaker 3>All he did was fuck.</v>

1157
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a workout at</v>

1158
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.581
<v Speaker 4>that age.</v>

1159
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:41.414
<v Speaker 4>That's a workout.</v>

1160
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 4>You know that those weren't 20 minutes sessions.</v>

1161
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1162
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.020
<v Speaker 3>it's weird how your,</v>

1163
00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:49.230
<v Speaker 3>your body changes from no,</v>

1164
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.430
<v Speaker 3>no urge to fuck to like fucking is your whole life.</v>

1165
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're 18 years old,</v>

1166
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.390
<v Speaker 3>it's your whole life.</v>

1167
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Like you found the craziest drug ever.</v>

1168
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.011
<v Speaker 3>And like two years ago,</v>

1170
00:33:02.011 --> 00:33:02.910
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't in your life.</v>

1171
00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1172
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden it's in your life and then all of a sudden you're having</v>

1173
00:33:05.851 --> 00:33:06.750
<v Speaker 3>sex and you're like,</v>

1174
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that.</v>

1175
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.000
<v Speaker 4>And you can't believe that,</v>

1177
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:14.140
<v Speaker 4>that women are letting you do it because for years they were stopping you and</v>

1178
00:33:14.141 --> 00:33:15.520
<v Speaker 4>now they're initiating.</v>

1179
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1180
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:16.711
<v Speaker 3>Can't leave.</v>

1181
00:33:16.711 --> 00:33:17.221
<v Speaker 3>They want it.</v>

1182
00:33:17.221 --> 00:33:18.510
<v Speaker 3>You actually want me to fuck you.</v>

1183
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.740
<v Speaker 3>This is what you like.</v>

1185
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1186
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1187
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.980
<v Speaker 3>It feels wrong.</v>

1189
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.020
<v Speaker 3>But if you insist it feels wrong that you like,</v>

1190
00:33:26.021 --> 00:33:29.760
<v Speaker 3>it is a weird mentality that we think it's wrong that they like,</v>

1191
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.970
<v Speaker 3>is that a Christian thing?</v>

1192
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.040
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>

1193
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it has to do with,</v>

1194
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:34.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1195
00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.280
<v Speaker 3>initially if you read sex at dawn a,</v>

1196
00:33:38.281 --> 00:33:41.020
<v Speaker 3>he's got a really interesting series of,</v>

1197
00:33:41.021 --> 00:33:41.854
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1198
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.470
<v Speaker 3>thoughts on the origins of sexual behavior and why,</v>

1199
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:50.310
<v Speaker 3>why we all sort of have adopted this one thing now.</v>

1200
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.480
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

1201
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.313
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you,</v>

1202
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.640
<v Speaker 4>I think it's Christian.</v>

1203
00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:54.670
<v Speaker 4>I know it is for me.</v>

1204
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.181
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1205
00:33:55.181 --> 00:33:55.661
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of,</v>

1206
00:33:55.661 --> 00:33:55.840
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1207
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.461
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of shame.</v>

1208
00:33:56.461 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.463
<v Speaker 3>That all that stuff.</v>

1210
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it has to do with people getting pregnant too.</v>

1211
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.993
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 3>I think it had to do with,</v>

1213
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 3>it was too easy for a girl to get pregnant.</v>

1214
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 3>And if a girl got pregnant back when people were fucking just barely making it</v>

1215
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:10.820
<v Speaker 3>out of the caves.</v>

1216
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1217
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.430
<v Speaker 3>It was either really good cause he had food or it was a real burden because you</v>

1218
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:17.640
<v Speaker 3>had to take care of this baby now.</v>

1219
00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.011
<v Speaker 3>Now you're,</v>

1220
00:34:18.011 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be gathering food for us.</v>

1221
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1222
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a lot of that going on.</v>

1223
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 3>So if you were going to be with a person and you decided to make babies,</v>

1224
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:29.900
<v Speaker 3>you got to be sure that this person is going to be there and take care of</v>

1225
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 3>everything and you're,</v>

1226
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:31.850
<v Speaker 3>you're all set up.</v>

1227
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 3>So you can't just be banging a bunch of guys on the side and having kids with</v>

1229
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:35.331
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

1230
00:34:35.331 --> 00:34:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Then who's going to raise your kids?</v>

1231
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.353
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1232
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:40.010
<v Speaker 3>This guy's going to come over and talk to his kid and he's going to come over</v>

1233
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:40.844
<v Speaker 3>and talk to his kid.</v>

1234
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1235
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.333
<v Speaker 3>That'd becomes a problem.</v>

1236
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1237
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>

1238
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.070
<v Speaker 4>and the amazing thing is that having kids back then for guys,</v>

1239
00:34:48.071 --> 00:34:51.490
<v Speaker 4>the reason why guys stuck around was,</v>

1240
00:34:51.491 --> 00:34:51.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1241
00:34:51.761 --> 00:34:54.490
<v Speaker 4>we have 401k is an IRA accounts back then.</v>

1242
00:34:54.491 --> 00:34:55.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you,</v>

1243
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.890
<v Speaker 4>when you couldn't gather anymore,</v>

1244
00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.130
<v Speaker 4>you are at the mercy of charity and so if you had a lot of kids,</v>

1245
00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:02.710
<v Speaker 4>you had a chance of being able to actually live into your old age.</v>

1246
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1247
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:03.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1248
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.500
<v Speaker 3>They would take care of you.</v>

1249
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1250
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:07.800
<v Speaker 3>It's also interesting too,</v>

1251
00:35:07.801 --> 00:35:12.480
<v Speaker 3>because there was so much infant mortality back then that there was a,</v>

1252
00:35:12.481 --> 00:35:16.560
<v Speaker 3>a lot of places where there's real good evidence that they had fertility cults,</v>

1253
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:21.390
<v Speaker 3>like they were trying to figure out ways to get pregnant more and easier,</v>

1254
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.920
<v Speaker 3>and they're just trying to have a bunch of kids.</v>

1255
00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:23.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:23.874
<v Speaker 3>Because kids were,</v>

1257
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:24.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1258
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.100
<v Speaker 3>kids tied a lot.</v>

1259
00:35:26.101 --> 00:35:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1260
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:30.840
<v Speaker 3>Then dying from injury and sickness and a lot of people died from sickness,</v>

1261
00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:31.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1262
00:35:31.081 --> 00:35:32.190
<v Speaker 3>no vaccines.</v>

1263
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1264
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:36.810
<v Speaker 3>When you just at the mercy and then also it's the beginning of agriculture.</v>

1265
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 3>All these diseases are emerging that we don't have immune systems for it because</v>

1266
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:41.334
<v Speaker 3>they're being,</v>

1267
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 3>they're being jumped from like they're there,</v>

1268
00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 3>they're jumping from pigs to people.</v>

1269
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 3>They're jumping from chickens and birds to people.</v>

1270
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 3>That's where the source of most of these pandemic diseases come from.</v>

1271
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.250
<v Speaker 3>It comes from large scale agriculture.</v>

1272
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Those funky pigs all tucked together in these little cages that doesn't come for</v>

1273
00:35:58.051 --> 00:35:58.850
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>

1274
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some demons are being brewed in that mix.</v>

1275
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:36:02.461 --> 00:36:02.911
<v Speaker 3>Like this,</v>

1277
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1278
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.050
<v Speaker 3>what was this?</v>

1279
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.490
<v Speaker 3>What was the source of,</v>

1280
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:06.324
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1281
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 3>the Spanish flu,</v>

1282
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.860
<v Speaker 3>which I think was the most deadly epidemic in u s history.</v>

1283
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:14.931
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1284
00:36:14.931 --> 00:36:15.451
<v Speaker 3>is that right?</v>

1285
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:16.660
<v Speaker 3>It was international too.</v>

1286
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Was International for sure.</v>

1287
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 3>I think for sure it was the most deadly epidemic in the u s yeah,</v>

1288
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:24.840
<v Speaker 3>but I think he came,</v>

1289
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it came from Spain.</v>

1290
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.990
<v Speaker 3>I think I want to say it came from somewhere around Virginia.</v>

1291
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Does that bullshit?</v>

1292
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 3>This is going to take time probably in New Jersey.</v>

1293
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.060
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it came from some sort of farm situation.</v>

1294
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.523
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>

1295
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:42.931
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

1296
00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:44.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing no surprises.</v>

1297
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Not more of that now because you see some of these like pig farms and they have</v>

1298
00:36:47.851 --> 00:36:48.684
<v Speaker 3>links.</v>

1299
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 3>There are lakes of waste.</v>

1300
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the drone footage?</v>

1301
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Is that what we're talking about?</v>

1302
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.091
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1303
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Some guy fluid,</v>

1304
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:55.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1305
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.150
<v Speaker 3>cause they have these ag gag laws,</v>

1306
00:36:57.151 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 3>which apparently one of them just got shot down.</v>

1307
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 3>Somebody sent me an email</v>

1308
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.270
<v Speaker 3>that some,</v>

1309
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was Idaho or Iowa,</v>

1310
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:07.681
<v Speaker 3>one of those places.</v>

1311
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:08.010
<v Speaker 3>One was,</v>

1312
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:09.420
<v Speaker 3>I states that,</v>

1313
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1314
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1315
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.633
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1316
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.160
<v Speaker 3>ag gag laws got shutdown to ag.</v>

1317
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:14.761
<v Speaker 3>Gag laws are,</v>

1318
00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:19.200
<v Speaker 3>say if you are working in a slaughterhouse and you saw horrific conditions,</v>

1319
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.670
<v Speaker 3>you got your cell phone out,</v>

1320
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 3>you filmed it,</v>

1321
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 3>you could get prosecuted,</v>

1322
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 3>you would go to jail,</v>

1323
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.500
<v Speaker 3>you could be sued.</v>

1324
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:26.610
<v Speaker 3>Because if walking,</v>

1325
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.500
<v Speaker 3>all of those documentaries that came out,</v>

1326
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.190
<v Speaker 3>well it's,</v>

1327
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.461
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1328
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 3>I think those ag gag laws existed as soon as they figured out that people could</v>

1329
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:33.714
<v Speaker 3>film thing.</v>

1330
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1331
00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:36.900
<v Speaker 3>because a few people released videos of her and it looked,</v>

1332
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 3>those ag gag laws kept,</v>

1333
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:40.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1334
00:37:40.441 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 3>kept people from talking about a lot of creepy shit.</v>

1335
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Like this video,</v>

1336
00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.050
<v Speaker 3>if you see this video,</v>

1337
00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:50.850
<v Speaker 3>this guy decided since no one's gonna give him access to film the place openly,</v>

1338
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 3>she's going to fly over it.</v>

1339
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 3>So he flew over with a drone Spanish flu thing.</v>

1340
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:56.401
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1341
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:57.031
<v Speaker 3>For many years,</v>

1342
00:37:57.031 --> 00:38:00.930
<v Speaker 3>medical historians and epidemiologists hypothesize that the outbreak could have</v>

1343
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:04.920
<v Speaker 3>started in a British army base in [inaudible] place,</v>

1344
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 3>France or at Fort Riley in Kansas,</v>

1345
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 3>where the first American cases of the new strain of flu were recorded in March</v>

1346
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 3>of 1918 more recently,</v>

1347
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:18.630
<v Speaker 3>experts have experts have proposed a third hypothesis.</v>

1348
00:38:18.631 --> 00:38:23.631
<v Speaker 3>The Spanish flu originated somewhere in northern China in late 1917 and swiftly</v>

1349
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 3>move to eastern Europe within 140,000 Chinese laborers and,</v>

1350
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1351
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 3>the French and British governments recruited to perform manual labor to free up</v>

1352
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 3>the troops for war time duty.</v>

1353
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1354
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:36.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1355
00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I think more people died of that.</v>

1356
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Then they die then died in world war one.</v>

1357
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.481
<v Speaker 2>The fifth song,</v>

1358
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:45.340
<v Speaker 2>50 million people were killed because of this damn,</v>

1359
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.330
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1360
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Just think about core disposal.</v>

1361
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.340
<v Speaker 2>50 million people claiming,</v>

1362
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.120
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

1363
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1364
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:57.660
<v Speaker 2>claiming more lives in a single year than either the first world war or the four</v>

1365
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:00.040
<v Speaker 2>year long black death,</v>

1366
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:04.630
<v Speaker 2>bubonic plague outbreak that swept Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages.</v>

1367
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is one that for whatever reason,</v>

1368
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.220
<v Speaker 2>people talk about the plague.</v>

1369
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.960
<v Speaker 2>They talk about the bubonic plague,</v>

1370
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.580
<v Speaker 2>like everyone's here,</v>

1371
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 2>but no one talks about the Spanish flu.</v>

1372
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a rare,</v>

1373
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.271
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1374
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:17.590
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get brought up that often.</v>

1375
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 2>If you see this number,</v>

1376
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 2>this number of people die.</v>

1377
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:23.830
<v Speaker 2>50 millions of people in a year in a year.</v>

1378
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:24.664
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1379
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.250
<v Speaker 2>People talk about how bad that is right now,</v>

1380
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what they're saying.</v>

1381
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Speaker 2>They're saying it killed more lives in a single year than either the first world</v>

1382
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 2>war or the four year long black death people on.</v>

1383
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 2>It's when they have killed and that he may have kept one third of the population</v>

1384
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:38.741
<v Speaker 2>was sick with it.</v>

1385
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:39.820
<v Speaker 2>At least they didn't all die.</v>

1386
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.650
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

1387
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean he taught,</v>

1388
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 2>people think that the world is in such bad shape.</v>

1389
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.110
<v Speaker 2>We don't have plagues.</v>

1390
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1391
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.960
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

1392
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.960
<v Speaker 2>the the poverty rate for the average poverty rate in the world has gone up for</v>

1393
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:56.380
<v Speaker 2>like the last 10 years.</v>

1394
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.640
<v Speaker 2>There's less poverty,</v>

1395
00:39:57.641 --> 00:39:58.061
<v Speaker 2>there's less.</v>

1396
00:39:58.061 --> 00:40:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Starvation is more education.</v>

1397
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1398
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:01.624
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>

1399
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of good shit going on too,</v>

1400
00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:04.690
<v Speaker 2>but just think about that.</v>

1401
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.050
<v Speaker 2>We haven't had a world war in what,</v>

1402
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:09.190
<v Speaker 2>70 years?</v>

1403
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1404
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>

1405
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.390
<v Speaker 2>it's been quite a while.</v>

1406
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.051
<v Speaker 2>Not to say it,</v>

1407
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>not to diminish the wars that are happening now,</v>

1408
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:17.950
<v Speaker 2>but something that really affected,</v>

1409
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:18.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1410
00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:22.060
<v Speaker 2>the entire population always feel like even since high school that it's always</v>

1411
00:40:22.061 --> 00:40:23.140
<v Speaker 2>been like around the corner.</v>

1412
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.950
<v Speaker 2>That was when we were in high school was the big fears that we're going to go to</v>

1414
00:40:26.951 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 2>war with the Russians.</v>

1415
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember going into the coat room and putting your head between your</v>

1416
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:30.970
<v Speaker 2>knees?</v>

1417
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to do that?</v>

1418
00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we did that and we used to do this and we did the debt get under</v>

1419
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:36.130
<v Speaker 2>the desk drill,</v>

1434
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:58.510
<v Speaker 2>so they just made up some nonsense.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1444
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Just stop and think about how close we were to doing something so stupid that</v>

1445
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:19.420
<v Speaker 2>this could have become a reality.</v>

1446
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.340
<v Speaker 2>And how now think about how this is a reality in certain parts of the world.</v>

1447
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Like in our place,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1449
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.490
<v Speaker 2>but in other places it is.</v>

1450
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1451

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:34.743
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1454
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to things like drone warfare,</v>

1455
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.650
<v Speaker 3>that freaks me out.</v>

1456
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:41.151
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1457
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 3>It's very effective at shooting terrorist.</v>

1458
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:43.251
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1459
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:43.581
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1460
00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:43.821
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1461
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:44.391
<v Speaker 3>It's excellent.</v>

1462
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 3>It's also super effective at killing civilians.</v>

1463
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Super effective.</v>

1464
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.971
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1465
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:51.260
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about,</v>

1466
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:52.180
<v Speaker 4>when you think about how,</v>

1467
00:41:52.181 --> 00:41:54.680
<v Speaker 4>how we're being perceived and the rest of the world,</v>

1468
00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 4>there's something about not even being present for the accidental killing that</v>

1469
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:00.500
<v Speaker 4>makes it just,</v>

1470
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.053
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1471
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:02.730
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1472
00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Twice as bad.</v>

1473
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:04.740
<v Speaker 3>It just seems weird.</v>

1474
00:42:04.741 --> 00:42:07.410
<v Speaker 3>And apparently it gives him pretty severe PTSD.</v>

1475
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1476
00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1477
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1478
00:42:09.031 --> 00:42:09.271
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1479
00:42:09.271 --> 00:42:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm laughing because I'm like thinking like that's so crazy that they don't even</v>

1480
00:42:12.301 --> 00:42:14.820
<v Speaker 3>have to be there and they're getting PTSD.</v>

1481
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:15.031
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1482
00:42:15.031 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 3>just the fact that they're doing it from a remote,</v>

1483
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.530
<v Speaker 3>I heard that pilots are freaking out there.</v>

1484
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.593
<v Speaker 3>Some of them.</v>

1485
00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1486
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1487
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.400
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1488
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.840
<v Speaker 3>this is just what I'm reading might not even be true now.</v>

1489
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.210
<v Speaker 3>I read that sensationalized,</v>

1490
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.180
<v Speaker 3>but I would imagine that would kind of fuck with your head.</v>

1491
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1492
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1493
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 4>The first couple of times it'd be fun.</v>

1494
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.770
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like a video game and then you,</v>

1495
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 4>and then we'd start to sink in when you heard,</v>

1496
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 4>when you heard the reports later.</v>

1497
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.280
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1498
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:40.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1499
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:41.264
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to,</v>

1500
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 3>so detach yourself from it that it would be like this growing thing in the back</v>

1501
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 3>of your mind.</v>

1502
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1503
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.990
<v Speaker 3>He was just launching missiles into apartment buildings</v>

1504
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.190
<v Speaker 3>and they're telling you it's okay.</v>

1505
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Everybody says it's okay.</v>

1506
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1507
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 3>This is what you're supposed to do.</v>

1508
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1509
00:42:58.850 --> 00:42:59.960
<v Speaker 3>when I talked to,</v>

1510
00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1511
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.870
<v Speaker 3>this gentleman than I know that was in the CIA,</v>

1512
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.840
<v Speaker 3>he said that all those decisions are done by lawyers.</v>

1513
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.460
<v Speaker 3>How really?</v>

1514
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1515
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not they do it or not do it.</v>

1516
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:09.561
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1517
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:10.071
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>

1518
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:15.071
<v Speaker 3>lawyers are deciding whether or not it's like likely to be successful.</v>

1519
00:43:15.111 --> 00:43:16.700
<v Speaker 3>What's the legal ramifications?</v>

1520
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:17.534
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1521
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:18.850
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about that kind of stuff,</v>

1522
00:43:18.851 --> 00:43:19.131
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1523
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:19.840
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

1524
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of us decided by lawyers.</v>

1525
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:22.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm like Whoa.</v>

1526
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.490
<v Speaker 4>Cause they want to know if you show her operated the,</v>

1527
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.350
<v Speaker 4>the siting and [inaudible]</v>

1528
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:27.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1529
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1530
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 3>And they want to make sure that all the ducks are in order.</v>

1531
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1532
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.731
<v Speaker 3>Which I mean,</v>

1533
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 3>is that better or is that worse?</v>

1534
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:33.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1535
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:35.960
<v Speaker 3>is it better to just leave it to the generals to design,</v>

1536
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1537
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:41.600
<v Speaker 3>you get this cartoonish impression of what that would be like some general,</v>

1538
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:45.770
<v Speaker 3>like the fucking guy from avatar would go down there who are going to fuck</v>

1539
00:43:45.771 --> 00:43:46.410
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

1540
00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.720
<v Speaker 3>That's what everybody's worried about.</v>

1541
00:43:47.721 --> 00:43:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1542
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:48.970
<v Speaker 3>The character,</v>

1543
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.790
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1544
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.730
<v Speaker 3>the cartoonish out of control.</v>

1545
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Murderous soldier.</v>

1546
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.173
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1547
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1548
00:43:56.361 --> 00:43:57.570
<v Speaker 4>What was the Kubrick movie?</v>

1549
00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:59.001
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1550
00:43:59.001 --> 00:44:00.050
<v Speaker 3>a full metal jacket.</v>

1553
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:05.230
<v Speaker 4>Peter Sally's was in it and it was about how I,</v>

1554
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.440
<v Speaker 4>how I something the nuclear,</v>

1555

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:11.483
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1558
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.353
<v Speaker 4>Like the general,</v>

1559
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.180
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1560
00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:13.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1561
00:44:13.511 --> 00:44:14.830
<v Speaker 3>They're always like cartoonish.</v>

1562
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

1563
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.610
<v Speaker 3>You better hope guys like that are on your side.</v>

1564
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.791
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Strange.</v>

1565
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:21.040
<v Speaker 3>So that was a great movie man.</v>

1566
00:44:21.041 --> 00:44:22.840
<v Speaker 3>It was so weird to watch it today.</v>

1567
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1568
00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I watched it a few years back.</v>

1569
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:25.443
<v Speaker 3>Did you really?</v>

1570
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:25.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1571
00:44:25.751 --> 00:44:28.060
<v Speaker 3>like maybe four or five years back and washed it and I was like,</v>

1572
00:44:28.061 --> 00:44:28.601
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1573
00:44:28.601 --> 00:44:33.601
<v Speaker 3>It's so wild to watch these little captured moments in time where you can see</v>

1574
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 3>like people were different then.</v>

1575
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1576
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 3>like old movies.</v>

1577
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 3>When you watch old movies,</v>

1578
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 3>you know what the biggest indication that something's different is women didn't</v>

1579
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:45.174
<v Speaker 3>work out that.</v>

1580
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1581
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.320
<v Speaker 3>they weren't like fit like we are used to seeing a lot of actresses that are on</v>

1582
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:53.160
<v Speaker 3>TV and the movies date,</v>

1583
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 3>they all do like crossfit or something.</v>

1584
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 3>They're all working out.</v>

1585
00:44:56.971 --> 00:45:01.920
<v Speaker 3>They're all taking gymnastics or something or they're doing spin classes and and</v>

1586
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 3>they have trainers and doing these box jumps and shit.</v>

1587
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Like girls are built now it's a different thing.</v>

1588
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 3>If you go look at like King Kong look like Fay Wray and King Kong soft.</v>

1589
00:45:12.031 --> 00:45:12.710
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

1590
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1591
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 3>They're not even picking up their groceries.</v>

1592
00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.070
<v Speaker 3>They're built different.</v>

1593
00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1594
00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:18.580
<v Speaker 2>and they don't last.</v>

1595
00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.900
<v Speaker 2>If they didn't do manual labor,</v>

1596
00:45:19.901 --> 00:45:20.734
<v Speaker 2>they don't last.</v>

1597
00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Some of them do when they do.</v>

1598
00:45:23.981 --> 00:45:24.641
<v Speaker 2>It's a shock.</v>

1599
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Like Raquel Welch,</v>

1600
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.840
<v Speaker 2>like deep into her sixties Janice is still hot,</v>

1601
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:30.610
<v Speaker 2>so feel around right to the end.</v>

1602
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1603
00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1604
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a few of them that were so potent that they're,</v>

1605
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.310
<v Speaker 2>they're spell lasted there.</v>

1606
00:45:36.311 --> 00:45:41.311
<v Speaker 2>Their entire existence is just started this Jane Fonda Workout Fonda back in the</v>

1607
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.640
<v Speaker 2>day with the doggy thing.</v>

1608
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.361
<v Speaker 2>What was that like?</v>

1609
00:45:43.361 --> 00:45:46.130
<v Speaker 2>1970s seven to me.</v>

1610
00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:49.323
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

1611
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.990
<v Speaker 2>that was crazy.</v>

1612
00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.810
<v Speaker 2>That was so fucking big.</v>

1613
00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.720
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time women were marketed to for exercise.</v>

1614
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1615
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.491
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1616
00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:05.491
<v Speaker 2>I think before that women may be competed in athletic events like Diane sticks</v>

1617
00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.240
<v Speaker 2>and shit like that when they were young,</v>

1618
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.000
<v Speaker 2>but then when they probably got families or moved on to jobs,</v>

1619
00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:10.930
<v Speaker 2>they probably stopped.</v>

1620
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.610
<v Speaker 2>What is this one go?</v>

1621
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:13.900
<v Speaker 2>A robot championship.</v>

1622
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1623
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Look at this as a choreographed dance.</v>

1624
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.620
<v Speaker 2>This is so strange.</v>

1625
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1626
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.151
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1627
00:46:22.151 --> 00:46:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember aerobics click.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll be kind of just dance around and you would do stop,</v>

1632
00:46:30.261 --> 00:46:31.130
<v Speaker 2>feel the pump,</v>

1633
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.010

1634
00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.540
<v Speaker 2>They turn everybody gay for about five years.</v>

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>

1743
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1744
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1745
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 2>But how weird that people,</v>

1746
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.930
<v Speaker 2>so do you remember people actually dressing like that and in a class situation,</v>

1747
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.460
<v Speaker 2>did they go to classes,</v>

1748
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.220
<v Speaker 2>dress like that grade school?</v>

1749
00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 2>We had uniforms and stuff.</v>

1750
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:43.711
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

1751
00:49:43.711 --> 00:49:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1752
00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 2>If I never took it a robotics class.</v>

1753
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.170
<v Speaker 2>But see if you could find video footage of an aerobics class.</v>

1754
00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 2>If all the guys that dress like that,</v>

1755
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 2>those dudes got punked.</v>

1756
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1757
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Somebody talked him into dressing like a dancer.</v>

1758
00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1759
00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1760
00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.740
<v Speaker 2>And they're not showing the kids this video.</v>

1761
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1762
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.030
<v Speaker 2>So you used to be stupid.</v>

1763
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:07.690
<v Speaker 2>So what if you're stupid once you're stupid forever.</v>

1764
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>

1765
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:09.603
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1766
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Your kids love seeing you looking stupid tiff.</v>

1767
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 2>And you should tell him I had a mullet.</v>

1768
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.343
<v Speaker 2>They laugh.</v>

1769
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.620
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I always do and I told my kids would do something wrong.</v>

1770
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 2>They've done something wrong.</v>

1771
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:19.211
<v Speaker 2>I say I,</v>

1772
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:20.044
<v Speaker 2>I did worse,</v>

1773
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 2>way worse.</v>

1774
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.530
<v Speaker 2>I did exactly what you did and I lied about it.</v>

1775
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.393
<v Speaker 2>I always lied.</v>

1776
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.280
<v Speaker 2>My parents asked me if I did anything wrong,</v>

1777
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.153
<v Speaker 2>always loud.</v>

1778
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1779
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 3>I know if he did something or you didn't do it,</v>

1780
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:30.704
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mad at you.</v>

1781
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to make you not do it in the future cause I want you to learn</v>

1782
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.983
<v Speaker 3>why it's bad.</v>

1783
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.970
<v Speaker 3>And so I would always tell that's good.</v>

1784
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 3>The number one thing I always do and I get mad sometimes.</v>

1785
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just there's,</v>

1786
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.580
<v Speaker 3>there's no way you can't sometimes,</v>

1787
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 3>especially as they get older,</v>

1788
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 3>they get upset about things and you got who you got to calm down.</v>

1789
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 3>You gotta to like figure out how to calm down and stop screaming at each other.</v>

1790
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Sisters scream at each other.</v>

1791
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 3>You took my thing.</v>

1792
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.000
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

1793
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it's not,</v>

1794
00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 3>you gave it to me.</v>

1795
00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1796
00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.930
<v Speaker 3>but I can take it back.</v>

1797
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:02.701
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

1798
00:51:02.701 --> 00:51:03.540
<v Speaker 4>The pitch they can get.</v>

1799
00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.090
<v Speaker 4>Cause usually when people get that hostile to each other,</v>

1800
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.560
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1801
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:06.901
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1802
00:51:06.901 --> 00:51:08.430
<v Speaker 4>you're worried there's going to be a physical fight.</v>

1803
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.620
<v Speaker 4>But sisters can take it two,</v>

1804
00:51:10.621 --> 00:51:11.401
<v Speaker 4>three times.</v>

1805
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.890
<v Speaker 4>That level it makes you so uncomfortable,</v>

1806
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.510
<v Speaker 4>but then they'll cuddle with each other.</v>

1807
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1808
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:17.800
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>

1809
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.190
<v Speaker 3>That's sweet difference.</v>

1810
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:20.460
<v Speaker 3>Two years.</v>

1811
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:20.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1812
00:51:20.621 --> 00:51:23.050
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting watching them evolve,</v>

1813
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:28.320
<v Speaker 3>like watching them learn new facts and learn new things and wash their little</v>

1814
00:51:28.721 --> 00:51:30.010
<v Speaker 3>brain filled with information.</v>

1815
00:51:30.011 --> 00:51:32.470
<v Speaker 3>Their vocabulary starts growing and you're like,</v>

1816
00:51:32.471 --> 00:51:33.520
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1817
00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1818
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.823
<v Speaker 3>And you realize like,</v>

1819
00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1820
00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:36.011
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1821
00:51:36.011 --> 00:51:36.731
<v Speaker 3>I've said this before,</v>

1822
00:51:36.731 --> 00:51:38.140
<v Speaker 3>but it bears repeating.</v>

1823
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.990
<v Speaker 3>We look at people in a static state.</v>

1824
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:45.460
<v Speaker 3>We're always looking at people like if I see a guy and he's 40 years old and</v>

1825
00:51:45.461 --> 00:51:46.294
<v Speaker 3>he's an asshole,</v>

1826
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.250
<v Speaker 3>oh that's that 40 year old asshole.</v>

1827
00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.241
<v Speaker 3>That fucking guy.</v>

1828
00:51:49.241 --> 00:51:50.074
<v Speaker 3>I know that guy.</v>

1829
00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.720
<v Speaker 3>That guy is so annoying.</v>

1830
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:54.730
<v Speaker 3>But you don't think are that was a baby.</v>

1831
00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1832
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:59.090
<v Speaker 3>that was a baby with a bunch of shitty data thrown out him.</v>

1833
00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:01.300
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of Shitty interactions,</v>

1834
00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:02.650
<v Speaker 3>bad genes,</v>

1835
00:52:02.651 --> 00:52:04.090
<v Speaker 3>bad environment.</v>

1836
00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some alcoholism,</v>

1837
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:06.960
<v Speaker 3>maybe who,</v>

1838
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:07.580
<v Speaker 3>maybe some,</v>

1839
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1840
00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.320
<v Speaker 3>throw it in all of it,</v>

1841
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:09.801
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1842
00:52:09.801 --> 00:52:11.120
<v Speaker 4>The lady HD</v>

1843
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.220
<v Speaker 3>bad nutrition.</v>

1844
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Throw it all in there,</v>

1845
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.631
<v Speaker 3>throw it all in there.</v>

1846
00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.370
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of bad breaks in life.</v>

1847
00:52:16.371 --> 00:52:17.204
<v Speaker 3>Throw it all in there,</v>

1848
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:17.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1849
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean that happens to so many people.</v>

1850
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.100
<v Speaker 3>So you look at them and instead of,</v>

1851
00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.820
<v Speaker 3>I always like look at what they are now like,</v>

1852
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:25.820
<v Speaker 3>oh this guy.</v>

1853
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 3>But what they are,</v>

1854
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:32.261
<v Speaker 3>all of them including you and me is a baby that became an older thing.</v>

1855
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:33.981
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1856
00:52:33.981 --> 00:52:38.981
<v Speaker 3>and a great deal of people whose lives are chaotically fucked up.</v>

1857
00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:42.140
<v Speaker 3>It's through no fault of their own.</v>

1858
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a great deal of him.</v>

1859
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.810
<v Speaker 3>It's a large number.</v>

1860
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1861
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:46.483
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1862
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.880
<v Speaker 3>and as I've gotten older and tried to be more compassionate and more,</v>

1863
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1864
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.110
<v Speaker 3>more understanding,</v>

1865
00:52:54.111 --> 00:52:54.944
<v Speaker 3>more patient,</v>

1866
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 3>those are the things that I worked on a lot and I still struggle with it.</v>

1867
00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.260
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1868
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.221
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1869
00:53:01.221 --> 00:53:02.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's anything you ever really,</v>

1870
00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:03.800
<v Speaker 3>totally get over,</v>

1871
00:53:03.801 --> 00:53:04.700
<v Speaker 3>but you get better.</v>

1872
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.070
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>

1873
00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:08.870
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot over the years here.</v>

1874
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:09.770
<v Speaker 3>A lot more patient.</v>

1875
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1876
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:15.880
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of that has to do with just getting better at being a person when</v>

1877
00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:17.301
<v Speaker 3>you work on it.</v>

1878
00:53:17.301 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 3>But I think also a lot of it has to do with my change of my attitude about</v>

1879
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 3>people and that I,</v>

1880
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I started to think of them as</v>

1881
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 7>a product of a lot of different interactions and that we,</v>

1882
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:32.911
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1883
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 7>you hear the term white privilege,</v>

1884
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 7>it's a fucked up term,</v>

1885
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1886
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:36.743
<v Speaker 7>It's weird.</v>

1887
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 7>But you have to admit,</v>

1888
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:44.750
<v Speaker 7>if you're a person and nothing completely catastrophic has happened to you and</v>

1889
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 7>you became this 50 year old successful comedian that's an Emmy award winning</v>

1890
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:52.380
<v Speaker 7>writer and like,</v>

1891
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:53.401
<v Speaker 7>Yay,</v>

1892
00:53:53.401 --> 00:53:54.720
<v Speaker 7>bad things happen to you.</v>

1893
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1894
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.650
<v Speaker 7>But they could have been fucking way worse.</v>

1895
00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 7>It could've been way worse.</v>

1896
00:54:00.331 --> 00:54:03.840
<v Speaker 7>And for some people it is fucking way worse.</v>

1897
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.200
<v Speaker 7>They just got a shit roll the dice from the jump and it's been bad experience</v>

1898
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:15.441
<v Speaker 7>after bad experience and fucking abuse and violence and jail and the,</v>

1899
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.440
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1900
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.280
<v Speaker 7>you can't get out.</v>

1901
00:54:17.281 --> 00:54:18.031
<v Speaker 7>There's no way out.</v>

1902
00:54:18.031 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 7>You can't even read.</v>

1903
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:19.600
<v Speaker 7>She's like,</v>

1904
00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 7>you're frothing around at see,</v>

1905
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 7>trying to keep your head above water</v>

1906
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:27.300
<v Speaker 7>and you run into them when they're 32 at a gas station.</v>

1907
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 7>And it's as much,</v>

1908
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.130
<v Speaker 7>it's a,</v>

1909
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1910
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:37.350
<v Speaker 7>it's not saying it's not their fault because whenever someone does anything to</v>

1911
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:37.680
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

1912
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.520
<v Speaker 7>it's their fault.</v>

1913
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:40.620
<v Speaker 7>Like if someone commits violence on you,</v>

1914
00:54:40.621 --> 00:54:41.700
<v Speaker 7>they shouldn't have done that.</v>

1915
00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:42.370
<v Speaker 7>It's their fault.</v>

1916
00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:43.203
<v Speaker 7>That's agreed.</v>

1917
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:47.970
<v Speaker 7>But what were the underlying factors that led this to happen?</v>

1918
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 7>And for all this talk that we do in this country about,</v>

1919
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.181
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1920
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:57.540
<v Speaker 7>about violence and crime and the problem of violence and crime,</v>

1921
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 7>nobody ever looks at it in terms of like,</v>

1922
00:55:00.421 --> 00:55:05.160
<v Speaker 7>how do you stop children from being raised fucked up and violent?</v>

1923
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 7>How do you stop them from being abused?</v>

1924
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:11.040
<v Speaker 7>How do you step in you that cause that's the root of all of it,</v>

1925
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:11.441
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1926
00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:15.280
<v Speaker 5>And I think early childhood education can make a big difference because if you</v>

1927
00:55:15.281 --> 00:55:17.050
<v Speaker 5>have a kid growing up and you know,</v>

1928
00:55:17.051 --> 00:55:18.160
<v Speaker 5>the dad took off,</v>

1929
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.941
<v Speaker 5>there's no money,</v>

1930
00:55:18.941 --> 00:55:20.080
<v Speaker 5>he's living on the streets.</v>

1931
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.210
<v Speaker 5>If you can create an environment for that four year old to come in and have two</v>

1932
00:55:25.211 --> 00:55:26.200
<v Speaker 5>decent meals,</v>

1933
00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:27.460
<v Speaker 5>a nap time,</v>

1934
00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.170
<v Speaker 5>some structured play,</v>

1935
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.740
<v Speaker 5>it makes all the difference in the world because that can become like the family</v>

1936
00:55:32.741 --> 00:55:33.290
<v Speaker 5>to them.</v>

1937
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:34.340
<v Speaker 7>Now let me ask you this,</v>

1938
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:36.223
<v Speaker 7>cause this is the,</v>

1939
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:40.220
<v Speaker 7>we're in the biggest crisis in terms of immigration,</v>

1940
00:55:40.221 --> 00:55:41.660
<v Speaker 7>in terms of national discussion.</v>

1941
00:55:41.661 --> 00:55:42.620
<v Speaker 7>The biggest discussion of it,</v>

1942
00:55:42.621 --> 00:55:44.450
<v Speaker 7>they're not going to ever remember right now.</v>

1943
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.590
<v Speaker 7>This wall shit where the government is completely shut down and no one's budging</v>

1944
00:55:48.591 --> 00:55:49.191
<v Speaker 7>on either side.</v>

1945
00:55:49.191 --> 00:55:51.860
<v Speaker 7>And all these government workers are not getting paid and so on because Trump</v>

1946
00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.210
<v Speaker 7>wants $5 billion for this wall.</v>

1947
00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:55.993
<v Speaker 7>I'm not.</v>

1948
00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.253
<v Speaker 7>Let's just,</v>

1949
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:59.810
<v Speaker 7>in an ideal world,</v>

1950
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:04.150
<v Speaker 7>it would be ideal if the way the world worked was the way America works where</v>

1951
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.240
<v Speaker 7>you could just go wherever you want.</v>

1952
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.400
<v Speaker 7>That'd be the ideal world.</v>

1953
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:12.620
<v Speaker 7>If the whole world was America in the in the sense of you can go to New Mexico,</v>

1954
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:14.540
<v Speaker 7>you didn't have to get paperwork signed.</v>

1955
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:15.690
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to know.</v>

1956
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:20.240
<v Speaker 7>It has to tell you whether or not you're allowed to go visit or not go visit.</v>

1957
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:21.440
<v Speaker 7>He just drive there.</v>

1958
00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:22.371
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

1959
00:56:22.371 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 7>that's a nice thing about America.</v>

1960
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:25.150
<v Speaker 7>It's almost like Europe,</v>

1961
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.530
<v Speaker 7>but you don't need a passport.</v>

1962
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.161
<v Speaker 7>Not In,</v>

1963
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:27.791
<v Speaker 7>it's like Europe.</v>

1964
00:56:27.791 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 7>I know you guys have been around longer and all that good stuff.</v>

1965
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:30.671
<v Speaker 7>That's not what I mean.</v>

1966
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:32.680
<v Speaker 7>I mean in terms of there's a bunch of different fields.</v>

1967
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 7>It's all speaking one language,</v>

1968
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 7>but like there's a big difference between visiting Montana and visiting Miami.</v>

1969
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:39.371
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1970
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 7>if you go to billings,</v>

1971
00:56:40.601 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 7>Montana and hang out with the local folk at a coffee shop and then you go to</v>

1972
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 7>some fucking crazy after I already after hours party in Miami and Miami beach at</v>

1973
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:50.810
<v Speaker 7>four in the morning and p did,</v>

1974
00:56:50.811 --> 00:56:52.660
<v Speaker 7>he shows up and fucking,</v>

1975
00:56:52.661 --> 00:56:53.081
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1976
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 7>and there's all these celebrities and people are doing coke on the floor and</v>

1977
00:56:56.441 --> 00:56:56.591
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1978
00:56:56.591 --> 00:56:58.540
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is this?</v>

1979
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:59.940
<v Speaker 7>This is a different world.</v>

1980
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 7>It's a different world and there's a bunch of these different worlds.</v>

1981
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 7>New York City's a different world.</v>

1982
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:03.941
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1983
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:05.080
<v Speaker 7>La is a different world.</v>

1984
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 7>You're allowed to go there.</v>

1985
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.960
<v Speaker 7>Wouldn't it be great if the whole world was like that?</v>

1986
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.460
<v Speaker 7>You can just kind of go wherever you want it to go and it would all sort itself</v>

1987
00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>

1988
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 7>The idea is you can't because it would fuck up our quality of life and would</v>

1989
00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 7>make us less safe.</v>

1990
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:19.780
<v Speaker 7>And I get the argument,</v>

1991
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:22.450
<v Speaker 7>certainly you don't want to bring in criminals and murderers.</v>

1992
00:57:22.451 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 7>You don't want drug dealers making their way into this country and starting gang</v>

1993
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:26.740
<v Speaker 7>violence and all that stuff.</v>

1994
00:57:26.741 --> 00:57:27.100
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

1995
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 7>you're absolutely right.</v>

1996
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:30.490
<v Speaker 7>And to deny that I think it's pretty fucking foolish.</v>

1997
00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:31.751
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1998
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:34.420
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a matter of like there's a lot to it.</v>

1999
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a fluid.</v>

2000
00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 4>The border is always going to be fluid and it needs to be fluid.</v>

2001
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:38.651
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2002
00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 4>we need the immigrant spirit of coming in and a lot of them do start small</v>

2003
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 4>businesses when you know,</v>

2004
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:44.531
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

2005
00:57:44.531 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 4>when they're brought in legally.</v>

2006
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:47.163
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2007
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 4>and so how do you,</v>

2008
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:53.590
<v Speaker 4>how do you create a flow of people that is good for us cause they say most of</v>

2009
00:57:53.591 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 4>the immigrants that come here are the smartest,</v>

2010
00:57:56.201 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 4>sharpest people,</v>

2011
00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.650
<v Speaker 4>most driven and wherever they're from.</v>

2012
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.870
<v Speaker 4>So we're actually drawing a really good,</v>

2013
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:02.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2014
00:58:02.441 --> 00:58:02.590
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

2015
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:04.000
<v Speaker 4>they talk so much about the criminals,</v>

2016
00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:08.350
<v Speaker 4>but the truth is most of them that are coming over here are the ones that</v>

2017
00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.240
<v Speaker 4>probably have the most to offer to this country.</v>

2018
00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.780
<v Speaker 7>Well exactly like our parents' generation.</v>

2019
00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.340
<v Speaker 7>Like our grandparents,</v>

2020
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.420
<v Speaker 7>like my grandparents.</v>

2021
00:58:15.421 --> 00:58:16.120
<v Speaker 7>Like when did your,</v>

2022
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.340
<v Speaker 7>your grandparents come over here?</v>

2023
00:58:17.341 --> 00:58:17.400
<v Speaker 7>It,</v>

2024
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.280
<v Speaker 7>was it your grandparents or</v>

2025
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:20.630
<v Speaker 4>teen 10 my grandparents.</v>

2026
00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2027
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.733
<v Speaker 4>mine as well.</v>

2028
00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:25.160
<v Speaker 4>My grandfather was one of 13 and 12 of them came over here.</v>

2029
00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.860
<v Speaker 4>And they lived in a two room fucking mud hut.</v>

2030
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Somehow they kept finding the money to send one kid over at a time.</v>

2031
00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:35.000
<v Speaker 4>Like usually when there were about 15 whole crazy shit.</v>

2032
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2033
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:38.790
<v Speaker 7>See that kind of shit is what I'm talking about.</v>

2034
00:58:38.791 --> 00:58:40.170
<v Speaker 7>Like those kind of people,</v>

2035
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:42.960
<v Speaker 7>shouldn't they be allowed to come here?</v>

2036
00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

2037
00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.700
<v Speaker 7>that's how this thing got started.</v>

2038
00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:49.950
<v Speaker 7>The real problem is that their spots that suck as the real problem.</v>

2039
00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:51.510
<v Speaker 7>It's like we were talking about like white privilege.</v>

2040
00:58:51.511 --> 00:58:52.650
<v Speaker 7>White privilege is not the problem.</v>

2041
00:58:52.651 --> 00:58:53.760
<v Speaker 7>The problem is racism.</v>

2042
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:57.000
<v Speaker 7>Racism doesn't exist in everyone's exactly the same.</v>

2043
00:58:57.210 --> 00:58:59.460
<v Speaker 7>And then we're okay and then we don't need to worry about white privilege.</v>

2044
00:58:59.461 --> 00:59:00.660
<v Speaker 7>What the real problem.</v>

2045
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.650
<v Speaker 7>You're not getting,</v>

2046
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:05.820
<v Speaker 7>you're not getting racist things thrown at you the way black people are.</v>

2047
00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:06.031
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2048
00:59:06.031 --> 00:59:06.780
<v Speaker 7>for sure.</v>

2049
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.740
<v Speaker 7>But that's not the problem.</v>

2050
00:59:07.741 --> 00:59:10.080
<v Speaker 7>The problem is racist things being thrown at black people.</v>

2051
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.800
<v Speaker 7>It's not that I don't get it right.</v>

2052
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:16.230
<v Speaker 7>It's say you get it right and it's like it took to highlight the fact that it's</v>

2053
00:59:16.231 --> 00:59:17.280
<v Speaker 7>not happening to me.</v>

2054
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.560
<v Speaker 7>I get what you're saying.</v>

2055
00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.980
<v Speaker 7>But the real problem,</v>

2056
00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:21.290
<v Speaker 7>we're,</v>

2057
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.620
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a distraction that the real problem is the racism itself.</v>

2058
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:25.520
<v Speaker 7>The real problem is the,</v>

2059
00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:30.850
<v Speaker 7>when you see actual Nazis in 2018 2019 actual ones,</v>

2060
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 7>real ones like not,</v>

2061
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:35.600
<v Speaker 7>not just dressing up cause they think it's a hoot.</v>

2062
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 7>You go move rebel.</v>

2063
00:59:37.401 --> 00:59:38.910
<v Speaker 7>I'm fucking road.</v>

2064
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:41.020
<v Speaker 7>I got a piece of tape under my nose.</v>

2065
00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

2066
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.090
<v Speaker 7>there's a fucking people that aren't really Nazis,</v>

2067
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:45.250
<v Speaker 7>but they're dumb here.</v>

2068
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:45.830
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2069
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 7>But then you see a real Nazi in 2019 you're like,</v>

2070
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:48.501
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

2071
00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:50.810
<v Speaker 7>that real racism.</v>

2072
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.673
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2073
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:53.800
<v Speaker 4>Now when they go into a,</v>

2074
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:58.690
<v Speaker 4>I was in Portland and they said there's regular clashes like once a month</v>

2075
00:59:58.691 --> 01:00:02.650
<v Speaker 4>there's a demonstration and it's either the alt right having a demonstration and</v>

2076
01:00:02.651 --> 01:00:03.281
<v Speaker 4>then the a,</v>

2077
01:00:03.281 --> 01:00:03.851
<v Speaker 4>what do they call them?</v>

2078
01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:08.851
<v Speaker 4>The something far Antifa Antifa show up and they have regular fights and it's</v>

2079
01:00:08.921 --> 01:00:09.910
<v Speaker 4>fucking Nazis.</v>

2080
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:11.330
<v Speaker 4>God Damn.</v>

2081
01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:14.440
<v Speaker 4>Oregon's a fucked up state because it was originally,</v>

2082
01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.450
<v Speaker 4>there were no black people allowed in Oregon.</v>

2083
01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.170
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

2084
01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:17.950
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

2085
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:18.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2086
01:00:18.191 --> 01:00:19.120
<v Speaker 4>cause now Portland is,</v>

2087
01:00:19.121 --> 01:00:20.320
<v Speaker 4>is very progressive,</v>

2088
01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.180
<v Speaker 4>super progressive or acid,</v>

2089
01:00:22.181 --> 01:00:23.560
<v Speaker 4>but there's no black people there.</v>

2090
01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:25.210
<v Speaker 4>So it seems there are,</v>

2091
01:00:25.211 --> 01:00:25.410
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2092
01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:26.890
<v Speaker 4>he feels a little hollow that when you're there,</v>

2093
01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.530
<v Speaker 4>I just did new year's Eve shows there and they were,</v>

2094
01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:29.951
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

2095
01:00:29.951 --> 01:00:32.110
<v Speaker 4>it was all white.</v>

2096
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:33.790
<v Speaker 4>It was all white.</v>

2097
01:00:33.791 --> 01:00:34.624
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>

2098
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:35.920
<v Speaker 4>That is weird.</v>

2099
01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.071
<v Speaker 4>There.</v>

2100
01:00:36.071 --> 01:00:36.400
<v Speaker 4>Dot.</v>

2101
01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.890
<v Speaker 4>If I was black I would go to Portland and his second,</v>

2102
01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.870
<v Speaker 4>you'd have so many friends instantly.</v>

2103
01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:42.760
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to high five.</v>

2104
01:00:42.761 --> 01:00:44.680
<v Speaker 4>You have you over for dinner.</v>

2105
01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.153
<v Speaker 7>It's um,</v>

2106
01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:53.070
<v Speaker 7>the real problem for sure is any kind of discrimination because that,</v>

2107
01:00:53.071 --> 01:00:55.540
<v Speaker 7>that also fucks with us too because if,</v>

2108
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.220
<v Speaker 7>if people are discriminating against people,</v>

2109
01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:58.180
<v Speaker 7>we can't even make fun of them.</v>

2110
01:00:58.181 --> 01:01:00.580
<v Speaker 7>Now we have to leave him alone because he's punching down like,</v>

2111
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:02.170
<v Speaker 7>but it's right there.</v>

2112
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.480
<v Speaker 4>The best joke,</v>

2113
01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you think about it as a stand up,</v>

2114
01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:07.600
<v Speaker 4>what your topics are,</v>

2115
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.830
<v Speaker 4>race,</v>

2116
01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:09.910
<v Speaker 4>racism,</v>

2117
01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:12.160
<v Speaker 4>sexuality,</v>

2118
01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.113
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>

2119
01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.141
<v Speaker 4>it costs,</v>

2120
01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:15.450
<v Speaker 4>people don't do politics.</v>

2121
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2122
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.750
<v Speaker 4>I would say the average comic is talking about two topics.</v>

2123
01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Racism and sexuality.</v>

2124
01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:27.650
<v Speaker 7>You did a great job of co covering politics without,</v>

2125
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.740
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2126
01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.240
<v Speaker 7>actually being political.</v>

2127
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.810
<v Speaker 7>You do a great job with that.</v>

2128
01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:32.600
<v Speaker 7>You're,</v>

2129
01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.750
<v Speaker 7>you're Hillary Clinton bit.</v>

2130
01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:38.363
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2131
01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.260
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2132
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.870
<v Speaker 4>I did this thing during the election about her and I didn't mean it to knock</v>

2133
01:01:42.871 --> 01:01:43.141
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>

2134
01:01:43.141 --> 01:01:45.660
<v Speaker 4>but it really wasn't about knocking anybody.</v>

2135
01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.300
<v Speaker 4>It was about her having a dry pussy and you know,</v>

2136
01:01:48.301 --> 01:01:50.790
<v Speaker 4>that's the kind of political comedy you can expect from me.</v>

2137
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:54.750
<v Speaker 7>It was also about countdown till Trump calls her a con.</v>

2138
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.430
<v Speaker 7>That was my favorite.</v>

2139
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.340
<v Speaker 7>It was my favorite line about the election.</v>

2140
01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:05.891
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

2141
01:02:05.891 --> 01:02:06.521
<v Speaker 4>I did the,</v>

2142
01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:10.990
<v Speaker 4>I did the dry cut jokes about her and then a true Carrie was in the audience and</v>

2143
01:02:10.991 --> 01:02:12.190
<v Speaker 4>he came up to me after the show.</v>

2144
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.730
<v Speaker 4>He gave me an entire piece of paper with more jokes on that premise.</v>

2145
01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.550
<v Speaker 4>He had tears in his eyes.</v>

2146
01:02:18.551 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the thing I've ever seen</v>

2147
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.161
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

2148
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:20.994
<v Speaker 5>Take these.</v>

2149
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 5>He loves filth.</v>

2150
01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.700
<v Speaker 7>Drew Carey's one of the nicest guys you ever.</v>

2151
01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:24.941
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2152
01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:25.570
<v Speaker 7>he's great.</v>

2153
01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:26.860
<v Speaker 7>I met him at the Improv and dude,</v>

2154
01:02:26.861 --> 01:02:28.000
<v Speaker 7>he talks to everybody.</v>

2155
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.670
<v Speaker 7>He was given young comics advice,</v>

2156
01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.050
<v Speaker 7>telling them write a joke a day.</v>

2157
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:32.950
<v Speaker 7>Just one joke a day.</v>

2158
01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:33.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2159
01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.420
<v Speaker 7>You get one joke a day.</v>

2160
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:35.980
<v Speaker 7>That's good advice for a week.</v>

2161
01:02:35.981 --> 01:02:36.814
<v Speaker 7>You've got seven jokes.</v>

2162
01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.020
<v Speaker 7>Make yourself write a joke.</v>

2163
01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:38.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2164
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.020
<v Speaker 7>that's right.</v>

2165
01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.360
<v Speaker 7>How do you write a joke yesterday?</v>

2166
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.110
<v Speaker 7>Nah,</v>

2167
01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:42.940
<v Speaker 7>I wrote some shit that wasn't funny.</v>

2168
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:45.160
<v Speaker 7>That's root some shit.</v>

2169
01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:45.351
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2170
01:02:45.351 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 7>we did.</v>

2171
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.680
<v Speaker 7>You and I did the store together last night.</v>

2172
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.951
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2173
01:02:47.951 --> 01:02:49.300
<v Speaker 7>And the last night I came home wrote.</v>

2174
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:50.321
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2176
01:02:50.321 --> 01:02:50.801
<v Speaker 7>I'm just,</v>

2177
01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:51.220
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2178
01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:51.400
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2179
01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.920
<v Speaker 7>I've in this stage of a couple of these bits and I'm working on right now where</v>

2180
01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:55.270
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2181
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:56.103
<v Speaker 7>they're just like,</v>

2182
01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.670
<v Speaker 7>they're on Bambi legs.</v>

2183
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:59.020
<v Speaker 7>They'll go south on me.</v>

2184
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:01.420
<v Speaker 7>I'll lose the script.</v>

2185
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.313
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2186
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:02.621
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2187
01:03:02.621 --> 01:03:03.250
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2188
01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:07.510
<v Speaker 7>it's interesting because when you go from doing a special and then chuck and</v>

2189
01:03:07.511 --> 01:03:09.190
<v Speaker 7>everything out and starting from scratch,</v>

2190
01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.570
<v Speaker 7>it's the most fun time.</v>

2191
01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:11.020
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:11.601
<v Speaker 7>Cause you're like a,</v>

2193
01:03:11.601 --> 01:03:11.861
<v Speaker 7>you look,</v>

2194
01:03:11.861 --> 01:03:12.880
<v Speaker 7>you're a beginner again.</v>

2195
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 5>You thinking about it all the time.</v>

2196
01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:16.770
<v Speaker 5>I'd like after dinner I've got a half hour.</v>

2197
01:03:16.771 --> 01:03:17.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2198
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:18.610
<v Speaker 5>I want to get back to that bit.</v>

2199
01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:19.663
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:19.900
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.600
<v Speaker 7>You think that you're thinking about it all the time.</v>

2202
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:22.870
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.370
<v Speaker 7>Like you're thinking about bits all the time.</v>

2204
01:03:24.371 --> 01:03:27.070
<v Speaker 7>Whereas once you have an act together and you could do,</v>

2205
01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:27.701
<v Speaker 7>you do an hour,</v>

2206
01:03:27.701 --> 01:03:28.840
<v Speaker 7>20 minutes easy,</v>

2207
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:30.310
<v Speaker 7>then you're not thinking about it that much.</v>

2208
01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.630
<v Speaker 7>You're thinking about when you do it,</v>

2209
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:32.670
<v Speaker 7>are you thinking about it when you're right,</v>

2210
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:32.930
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>

2211
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.060
<v Speaker 7>thinking about it all day?</v>

2212
01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:34.471
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2213
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 5>You're tweaking it in in motion.</v>

2214
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're on stage and you've got the hour down,</v>

2215
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:39.931
<v Speaker 5>that's when we,</v>

2216
01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 5>you and I were talking about a comedian you just told to take a little extra</v>

2217
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 5>time before they did this special and it really is and that extra few months</v>

2218
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.140
<v Speaker 5>that you find emphasizing this syllable makes the joke,</v>

2219
01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:54.390
<v Speaker 5>get an applause break instead of just laughs.</v>

2220
01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.570
<v Speaker 7>It's also one of the most interactive art forms ever.</v>

2221
01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:01.390
<v Speaker 7>Whereas you need other people to do it.</v>

2222
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:03.610
<v Speaker 7>You need other people to watch.</v>

2223
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.340
<v Speaker 7>There's no way I can do that without you,</v>

2224
01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:07.780
<v Speaker 7>without people listening,</v>

2225
01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:08.980
<v Speaker 7>the watching,</v>

2226
01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:09.670
<v Speaker 7>whatever it is.</v>

2227
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:10.061
<v Speaker 7>I can't,</v>

2228
01:04:10.061 --> 01:04:10.900
<v Speaker 7>you can't do it right.</v>

2229
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:14.080
<v Speaker 7>You need them because they help you make it.</v>

2230
01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:18.250
<v Speaker 7>Their reactions to what you're saying tightens up what you're saying right</v>

2231
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.581
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

2232
01:04:18.581 --> 01:04:21.100
<v Speaker 7>Reactions to make you throw away.</v>

2233
01:04:21.101 --> 01:04:22.810
<v Speaker 7>Certain parts just aren't working right,</v>

2234
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:23.891
<v Speaker 7>but you think it's funny.</v>

2235
01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:24.724
<v Speaker 7>They don't think it's funny.</v>

2236
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:27.610
<v Speaker 7>Like how many times did they not think it's funny before you decided that part</v>

2237
01:04:27.611 --> 01:04:28.540
<v Speaker 7>might not be that good?</v>

2238
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:29.830
<v Speaker 7>Let me concentrate on this part.</v>

2239
01:04:29.831 --> 01:04:31.150
<v Speaker 7>This part seems to have fruit to it.</v>

2240
01:04:31.151 --> 01:04:31.720
<v Speaker 7>This part,</v>

2241
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.800
<v Speaker 7>this is the part that kills,</v>

2242
01:04:32.801 --> 01:04:34.330
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even expect this part to work,</v>

2243
01:04:34.331 --> 01:04:37.690
<v Speaker 7>but this partner and become a bigger part of the bit than the first part and</v>

2244
01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:39.130
<v Speaker 7>then weird stuff starts branching off,</v>

2245
01:04:39.131 --> 01:04:40.930
<v Speaker 7>but I don't think branches off in front of people.</v>

2246
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.440
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2247
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.273
<v Speaker 7>it's weird.</v>

2248
01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:42.731
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2249
01:04:42.731 --> 01:04:44.380
<v Speaker 5>it really is interesting.</v>

2250
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:44.590
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

2251
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:44.891
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2252
01:04:44.891 --> 01:04:47.260
<v Speaker 5>if you could track a comedian writing a bit,</v>

2253
01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:50.140
<v Speaker 5>a good comic who really takes on a premise like you do,</v>

2254
01:04:50.141 --> 01:04:54.820
<v Speaker 5>like take on a thought or a philosophy and step it out as far as it can possibly</v>

2255
01:04:54.821 --> 01:04:56.070
<v Speaker 5>go and walk,</v>

2256
01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.480
<v Speaker 5>track that person doing that set for six months.</v>

2257
01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:03.280
<v Speaker 5>It can morph to where this almost nothing left from the original premise all the</v>

2258
01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:03.850
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

2259
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:04.180
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:04.421
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:05:04.421 --> 01:05:07.360
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes I'll take an old joke and I'll use it as a scaffolding.</v>

2262
01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.050
<v Speaker 7>Like when I'm writing again and I've got no luck,</v>

2263
01:05:11.051 --> 01:05:12.580
<v Speaker 7>I'm trapped and I'm like,</v>

2264
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.120
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] no way to get from this bid to it,</v>

2265
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:15.280
<v Speaker 7>but not going the old joke.</v>

2266
01:05:15.281 --> 01:05:16.510
<v Speaker 7>I'm a shovel old joke in there.</v>

2267
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.033
<v Speaker 7>And then</v>

2268
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.761
<v Speaker 2>from that,</v>

2269
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>like the little bursts that you get out of that,</v>

2270
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:24.280
<v Speaker 2>we'll carry on and make the s the next premise better.</v>

2271
01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:27.700
<v Speaker 2>It's got a little bit more momentum to it and now you can explore it a little</v>

2272
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:28.630
<v Speaker 2>lightheaded,</v>

2273
01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 2>a little lighthearted,</v>

2274
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:31.120
<v Speaker 2>little little easier,</v>

2275
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:33.010
<v Speaker 2>less tense because the new stuff,</v>

2276
01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:34.061
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>

2277
01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 2>That fucks me up the most is that I'm not exactly sure what's the best way to do</v>

2278
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:38.831
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2279
01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:42.250
<v Speaker 2>So I'm thinking about while I'm saying it instead of just being in the moment,</v>

2280
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 2>right until I,</v>

2281
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 2>until you can just get it to the point where you can be in the moment,</v>

2282
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.110
<v Speaker 2>it's just clunky,</v>

2283
01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 2>but because it's clunky,</v>

2284
01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:49.570
<v Speaker 2>you're nervous and because you're nervous,</v>

2285
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:50.550
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about it all the time.</v>

2286
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2287
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes like this obsession.</v>

2288
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:55.840
<v Speaker 2>So if I feel like more premises start popping up that way,</v>

2289
01:05:55.841 --> 01:05:56.320
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

2290
01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have this hyper focus that's way less comfortable than being like</v>

2291
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:06.250
<v Speaker 2>having an hour and 20 down ready to film.</v>

2292
01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2293
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.750
<v Speaker 2>it's way less comfortable,</v>

2294
01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:11.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably more productive in terms of like creatively of course,</v>

2295
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.310
<v Speaker 2>but I always,</v>

2296
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:13.091
<v Speaker 2>I always think of like,</v>

2297
01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:14.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like learning a new language.</v>

2298
01:06:14.531 --> 01:06:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Every time I have a new bit,</v>

2299
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:16.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2300
01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:20.080
<v Speaker 2>how do I translate this thought in my head into like you said,</v>

2301
01:06:20.081 --> 01:06:20.980
<v Speaker 2>what's my approach?</v>

2302
01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:23.830
<v Speaker 2>What's my strategy to get that idea across?</v>

2303
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:26.860
<v Speaker 2>And so you're thinking about that and it slows down you.</v>

2304
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:27.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2305
01:06:27.131 --> 01:06:28.360
<v Speaker 2>You're not in the moment as much.</v>

2306
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to start doing some real late night sets too.</v>

2307
01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.530
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea.</v>

2308
01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 2>When you gotta do tired people,</v>

2309
01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:34.801
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2310
01:06:34.801 --> 01:06:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Like 13 people in the room,</v>

2311
01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:37.720
<v Speaker 2>you got to try those.</v>

2312
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Those little spots out to you can get a little too used to do and crowds and if</v>

2313
01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 2>you're a little too used to and crowds,</v>

2314
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 2>what happens is people want to laugh.</v>

2315
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.840
<v Speaker 2>They want to laugh.</v>

2316
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 2>The dare to have a good time.</v>

2317
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.320
<v Speaker 2>When you get at one o'clock in the morning,</v>

2318
01:06:53.321 --> 01:06:54.750
<v Speaker 2>they've already laughed.</v>

2319
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:55.260
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2320
01:06:55.260 --> 01:07:00.030
<v Speaker 2>they've laughed and laughed and laughed and they've laughed for hours.</v>

2321
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>

2322
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.090
<v Speaker 2>some of them get there at nine and they stay till two.</v>

2323
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2324
01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.120
<v Speaker 2>They just get up to pee or another drink,</v>

2325
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.901
<v Speaker 2>have another seat,</v>

2326
01:07:07.901 --> 01:07:11.890
<v Speaker 2>and you're watching a crazy lineup of comedians you get on at one o'clock in the</v>

2327
01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:12.221
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

2328
01:07:12.221 --> 01:07:13.780
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like the dawn Barris hour,</v>

2329
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:16.770
<v Speaker 2>that fucking you're,</v>

2330
01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 2>you're getting in front of people that have seen everything.</v>

2331
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:24.190
<v Speaker 2>So if you make them laugh that that's a legit bit.</v>

2332
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:28.870
<v Speaker 2>If you can get through to these people when they've probably heard everything,</v>

2334
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:33.220
<v Speaker 2>well then it gets you in your voice more because when there's only 15 people out</v>

2335
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:37.390
<v Speaker 2>there versus 300 couple hours earlier,</v>

2336
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:42.100
<v Speaker 2>at 300 you're performing something out to the back of the room.</v>

2337
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.260
<v Speaker 2>They talk about playing to the back of the room.</v>

2338
01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 2>In bigger rooms,</v>

2339
01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:46.930
<v Speaker 2>you have to be more physical,</v>

2340
01:07:46.931 --> 01:07:48.940
<v Speaker 2>you have to slow down and,</v>

2341
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:50.290
<v Speaker 2>and then when you have 15 people,</v>

2342
01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:52.420
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you're in your human being,</v>

2343
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:54.040
<v Speaker 2>talking to human beings voice.</v>

2344
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:58.420
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes that's where you can find really the flow of the joke a lot better</v>

2345
01:07:58.690 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>because you're not,</v>

2346
01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 2>you're not pumping it up,</v>

2347
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.390
<v Speaker 2>you're just saying it.</v>

2348
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2349
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:04.383
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2350
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:08.710
<v Speaker 2>But I think you have to do those larger places too,</v>

2351
01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:11.290
<v Speaker 2>just to know how to do them.</v>

2352
01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Like there are different thing you can do a big theater,</v>

2353
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 2>a big theater need to</v>

2354
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.750
<v Speaker 7>be comfortable with the fact that there's,</v>

2355
01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:18.020
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2356
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 7>x amount of thousands of people in that room and in,</v>

2357
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:22.430
<v Speaker 7>unless you do a bunch of those,</v>

2358
01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.930
<v Speaker 7>like you and I have done a few of them together.</v>

2359
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:24.200
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2360
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:24.790
<v Speaker 7>they're fun.</v>

2361
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:25.160
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.000
<v Speaker 7>But you have a time.</v>

2363
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.690
<v Speaker 7>There's a timing thing that's different.</v>

2364
01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.740
<v Speaker 7>You have to like wait a little longer.</v>

2365
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:31.360
<v Speaker 7>You can't,</v>

2366
01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.370
<v Speaker 7>can't beat your punchlines like one after the other.</v>

2367
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:37.520
<v Speaker 7>Like you can in a club and the club you could just keep,</v>

2368
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:40.400
<v Speaker 7>you can keep hammering because there's only so many people in the room.</v>

2369
01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:42.160
<v Speaker 7>We won't overpower the sound system</v>

2370
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 4>and that's why for so long comedy central,</v>

2371
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.950
<v Speaker 4>the mandate was always they want the special shot in a nice theater like a,</v>

2372
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2373
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:53.330
<v Speaker 4>1500 2000 seat or where they can get that big,</v>

2374
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.240
<v Speaker 4>the crane camera shooting down and,</v>

2375
01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.910
<v Speaker 4>and the truth is for most including myself,</v>

2376
01:08:58.911 --> 01:09:00.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a theater comic,</v>

2377
01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:01.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm a club comic.</v>

2378
01:09:01.081 --> 01:09:06.020
<v Speaker 4>So all of a sudden I shoot my special in a room that holds 1600 people and it</v>

2379
01:09:06.021 --> 01:09:06.681
<v Speaker 4>was in,</v>

2380
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:09.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't look back at it and go that's exactly how I want it to be.</v>

2381
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 4>Sane.</v>

2382
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:12.230
<v Speaker 4>I was slower,</v>

2383
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:12.900
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2384
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.700
<v Speaker 4>I was bigger and it's like I would have rather done it in a like a nice little</v>

2385
01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 4>400 seat club</v>

2386
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.501
<v Speaker 7>also.</v>

2387
01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:21.290
<v Speaker 7>You weren't doing a lot of those places so we weren't comfortable with it.</v>

2388
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.120
<v Speaker 7>Like when you do those really big places,</v>

2389
01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 7>once you get comfortable with it,</v>

2390
01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:25.580
<v Speaker 7>you start treating and liquor club.</v>

2391
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.180
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2392
01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.260
<v Speaker 7>like one of my most comfortable sets was one of the biggest places ever did the</v>

2393
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:31.920
<v Speaker 7>Scotia Bank arena in,</v>

2394
01:09:31.921 --> 01:09:33.710
<v Speaker 7>in Toronto at the end of my tour.</v>

2395
01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.150
<v Speaker 7>But is at the end of the tour.</v>

2396
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:38.210
<v Speaker 7>The very last spot before the Netflix special came out.</v>

2397
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.560
<v Speaker 7>So I had,</v>

2398
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:44.870
<v Speaker 7>I'd been doing stand up like real regular in these big giant ass places for</v>

2399
01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:45.860
<v Speaker 7>months.</v>

2400
01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 7>So when I got there it felt like the store felt like doing the main room.</v>

2401
01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:51.080
<v Speaker 7>It was just a bigger main room.</v>

2402
01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:51.740
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2403
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:51.951
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2404
01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 7>you just,</v>

2405
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.233
<v Speaker 7>it was just fun.</v>

2406
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.110
<v Speaker 7>Just have a good time.</v>

2407
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:54.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2408
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:56.570
<v Speaker 7>it's just doing a lot of those.</v>

2409
01:09:56.571 --> 01:10:00.230
<v Speaker 7>You got to do 'em but you really do have to do the little tiny shitty ones.</v>

2410
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 7>You've got to do those 1:00 AM spots.</v>

2411
01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.950
<v Speaker 7>You've got to do those belly rooms spots.</v>

2412
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.430
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2413
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.180
<v Speaker 7>That's a big one.</v>

2414
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.230
<v Speaker 7>The peli rooms a big one.</v>

2415
01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.450
<v Speaker 4>That's him right there.</v>

2416
01:10:07.451 --> 01:10:07.961
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

2417
01:10:07.961 --> 01:10:10.330
<v Speaker 4>If you are not connected to them,</v>

2418
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:12.910
<v Speaker 4>they do not laugh and a few are connected.</v>

2419
01:10:12.911 --> 01:10:15.640
<v Speaker 4>It's the greatest crowd because there's only what,</v>

2420
01:10:15.641 --> 01:10:16.710
<v Speaker 4>60 people in there,</v>

2421
01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.340
<v Speaker 4>huh?</v>

2422
01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.530
<v Speaker 7>Oh something like that.</v>

2423
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:20.460
<v Speaker 4>I also like doing alternative room.</v>

2424
01:10:20.461 --> 01:10:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I go to Largo,</v>

2425
01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:24.710
<v Speaker 4>go up there in front of the cool kids and you know,</v>

2426
01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 4>have to be a little more PC and</v>

2427
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:30.770
<v Speaker 7>you should have a fake act that you do only for Largo,</v>

2428
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 7>like put together.</v>

2429
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:35.000
<v Speaker 7>Actually I did Largo with a Whitney a lot.</v>

2430
01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:38.090
<v Speaker 7>I like Largo Hardwick was on that show too.</v>

2431
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:38.540
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

2432
01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:39.080
<v Speaker 7>someone else,</v>

2433
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:39.913
<v Speaker 7>maybe Adam Ray.</v>

2434
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:41.210
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2435
01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:42.780
<v Speaker 7>Adam Devine and um,</v>

2436
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.641
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>

2437
01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:45.170
<v Speaker 7>it was a fun time and it was really fun.</v>

2438
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:47.510
<v Speaker 7>Largo is a really interesting old place too,</v>

2439
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:48.560
<v Speaker 7>but all those,</v>

2440
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 7>those are all seen things like I would love if somebody did,</v>

2441
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:56.360
<v Speaker 7>they put an act together that's only for like that crowd,</v>

2442
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:59.900
<v Speaker 7>but it's like just onion ask enough that it sneaks through,</v>

2443
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:01.813
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

2444
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.480
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2445
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:02.781
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

2446
01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:07.781
<v Speaker 7>Just a really like a guy who plays like the strongest ally possible for</v>

2447
01:11:09.621 --> 01:11:10.454
<v Speaker 7>everything,</v>

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 7>gay rights rights,</v>

2450
01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 7>women's</v>

2451
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.203
<v Speaker 8>rights.</v>

2452
01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:18.450
<v Speaker 8>It's like the ultimate ally or norm,</v>

2453
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:21.580
<v Speaker 8>everything Birkenstock,</v>

<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

2455
01:11:21.841 --> 01:11:26.841
<v Speaker 8>We can do whatever we do to make them a character and then write really good</v>

2456
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:28.080
<v Speaker 8>jokes.</v>

2457
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:28.460
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>

2458
01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:28.711
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

2459
01:11:28.711 --> 01:11:29.431
<v Speaker 8>Really good.</v>

2460
01:11:29.431 --> 01:11:31.080
<v Speaker 8>Jokes like that would be an interesting approach.</v>

2461
01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:33.030
<v Speaker 8>Almost like a Borat type project.</v>

2462
01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.540
<v Speaker 8>Like create an all comic who's like,</v>

2463
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:38.160
<v Speaker 8>who's really calculated,</v>

2464
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.170
<v Speaker 8>who's really probably just trying to get pussy.</v>

2465
01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:40.541
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2466
01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:40.770
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

2467
01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:41.603
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

2468
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:43.710
<v Speaker 8>but puts together the right words,</v>

2469
01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:44.011
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2470
01:11:44.011 --> 01:11:46.710
<v Speaker 8>if you don't support intersectionality,</v>

2471
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:50.160
<v Speaker 8>then get the fuck out of my face.</v>

2472
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:51.163
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2473
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:55.230
<v Speaker 8>And then he should try to get laid after every show as part of the care course.</v>

2474
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:55.441
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2475
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 8>It'd be just super sleazy with coke and needles.</v>

2476
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:59.860
<v Speaker 8>Fucking syringes evil today</v>

2477
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 8>he's got shaky bottles of bills.</v>

2478
01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:08.550
<v Speaker 8>It takes the pussy hat off his head and starts fucking it backstage.</v>

2479
01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:11.160
<v Speaker 8>He's got a flashlight for a pussyhat.</v>

2480
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:12.570
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

2481
01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:14.840
<v Speaker 8>There'll be a hilarious character.</v>

2482
01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.130
<v Speaker 8>The thing</v>

2483
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:19.100
<v Speaker 7>about people is who are you really?</v>

2484
01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.190
<v Speaker 7>And when you're like,</v>

2485
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:23.390
<v Speaker 7>when you're talking to people,</v>

2486
01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:24.620
<v Speaker 7>do you know who you are?</v>

2487
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:25.040
<v Speaker 7>Do you,</v>

2488
01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.450
<v Speaker 7>you sure you know who you are?</v>

2489
01:12:26.451 --> 01:12:26.661
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2490
01:12:26.661 --> 01:12:29.870
<v Speaker 7>are you 100% certain and cool and calm?</v>

2491
01:12:29.871 --> 01:12:30.950
<v Speaker 7>I don't think most of us are.</v>

2492
01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:36.160
<v Speaker 7>Like most of us are like constantly evolving the way we behave in think,</v>

2493
01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:37.580
<v Speaker 7>constantly thinking about it.</v>

2494
01:12:37.581 --> 01:12:39.260
<v Speaker 7>Maybe things went wrong last night.</v>

2495
01:12:39.261 --> 01:12:40.130
<v Speaker 7>I got to stop drinking.</v>

2496
01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.720
<v Speaker 7>There's always like something like,</v>

2497
01:12:41.721 --> 01:12:41.890
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2498
01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.010
<v Speaker 7>I gotta get my ass to the gym.</v>

2499
01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:43.731
<v Speaker 7>There's always something.</v>

2500
01:12:43.731 --> 01:12:45.650
<v Speaker 7>There's always something you're trying to improve and move around.</v>

2501
01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:49.610
<v Speaker 7>So if you are a person who is,</v>

2502
01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:50.541
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2503
01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:55.541
<v Speaker 7>if you don't know exactly where you're coming from but you want to sell that,</v>

2504
01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:57.200
<v Speaker 7>you know where you're coming from.</v>

2505
01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.570
<v Speaker 7>He wanted people to believe you know where you're coming from,</v>

2506
01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.230
<v Speaker 7>then you,</v>

2507
01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:05.230
<v Speaker 7>then you get all this momentum behind you and you almost can't get away from it.</v>

2508
01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:06.981
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2509
01:13:06.981 --> 01:13:07.814
<v Speaker 7>like you're,</v>

2510
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:08.751
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2511
01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:09.111
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2512
01:13:09.111 --> 01:13:11.420
<v Speaker 7>you see this a lot with people that are trying to be spiritual</v>

2513
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:16.160
<v Speaker 7>or they're always trying to sell you on the idea that they're spiritual.</v>

2514
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:17.210
<v Speaker 7>They're always pushing.</v>

2515
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.140
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>

2516
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:18.801
<v Speaker 7>this is me,</v>

2517
01:13:18.801 --> 01:13:19.220
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2518
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:19.790
<v Speaker 7>this is me.</v>

2519
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:20.623
<v Speaker 7>Are you sure?</v>

2520
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:21.770
<v Speaker 7>Are you sure?</v>

2521
01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.420
<v Speaker 7>I can think who we are.</v>

2522
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.470
<v Speaker 7>All of us is,</v>

2523
01:13:24.471 --> 01:13:29.270
<v Speaker 7>a lot of it is like who we've encountered and how we've interacted with those</v>

2524
01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:30.104
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

2525
01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:31.051
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2526
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:33.000
<v Speaker 8>And then the uniform comes along with it.</v>

2527
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:33.800
<v Speaker 8>And the Diet,</v>

2528
01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 8>there's like a whole follow this manual that,</v>

2529
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:37.020
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2530
01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.040
<v Speaker 8>they talk about hipsters,</v>

2531
01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 8>which,</v>

2532
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.653
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2533
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.030
<v Speaker 8>it's a pretty wide umbrella.</v>

2534
01:13:42.031 --> 01:13:43.710
<v Speaker 8>About what kind of hipsters there are,</v>

2535
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:48.711
<v Speaker 8>but just the idea of wearing a uniform always kind of puts me off on people like</v>

2536
01:13:48.781 --> 01:13:49.614
<v Speaker 8>you stopped,</v>

2537
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:53.340
<v Speaker 8>you stopped growing if you're going to put on what all the other people that you</v>

2538
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:54.480
<v Speaker 8>want to be like are wearing.</v>

2539
01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:54.921
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:13:54.921 --> 01:13:55.760
<v Speaker 7>This is the thing.</v>

2541
01:13:55.761 --> 01:14:00.761
<v Speaker 7>It's like the opinions aren't necessarily wrong because they're your opinions,</v>

2542
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.520
<v Speaker 7>but the thing of the,</v>

2543
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.340
<v Speaker 7>the thing of any kind of ideology,</v>

2544
01:14:04.341 --> 01:14:09.140
<v Speaker 7>whether it's a hipster all ideology or if it's a fucking conservative,</v>

2545
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 7>right wing farm worker ideology.</v>

2546
01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 7>Like when people adopt those,</v>

2547
01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 7>it's very little deviation and a lot of times an not even really thinking</v>

2548
01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 7>entirely about what they're saying.</v>

2549
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.360
<v Speaker 7>They just,</v>

2550
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.240
<v Speaker 7>they just know what is going to get the right positive reaction from their clan.</v>

2551
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:24.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:25.361
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad.</v>

2553
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:25.961
<v Speaker 4>My Mom,</v>

2554
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:26.650
<v Speaker 4>who is,</v>

2555
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:26.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2556
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:29.440
<v Speaker 4>we grew up pretty liberal family in New York.</v>

2557
01:14:29.441 --> 01:14:33.280
<v Speaker 4>My Dad was in radio and he talked politics on the air and it was pretty far left</v>

2558
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.901
<v Speaker 4>reading that,</v>

2559
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:35.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2560
01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 4>my mom worked at the New York Times,</v>

2561
01:14:36.971 --> 01:14:38.320
<v Speaker 4>he can't get any more liberal in that.</v>

2562
01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:43.321
<v Speaker 4>And so then she moved down to Florida where everybody watches Fox News in her</v>

2563
01:14:44.441 --> 01:14:48.280
<v Speaker 4>building and they all sit around the pool and they fucking berate her because</v>

2564
01:14:48.281 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 4>they don't agree with them.</v>

2565
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.141
<v Speaker 4>And I just say,</v>

2566
01:14:50.141 --> 01:14:50.951
<v Speaker 4>good for you mom.</v>

2567
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:51.640
<v Speaker 4>You haven't,</v>

2568
01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.170
<v Speaker 4>cause a lot of people go down there and they were,</v>

2569
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.510
<v Speaker 4>they changed their views because they are so,</v>

2570
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:56.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2571
01:14:56.141 --> 01:14:58.300
<v Speaker 4>intimidated by not fitting in with the,</v>

2572
01:14:58.450 --> 01:14:59.980
<v Speaker 4>it's your social group.</v>

2573
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:00.940
<v Speaker 4>It's a different country.</v>

2574
01:15:00.941 --> 01:15:03.640
<v Speaker 4>Florida's different kinds of saying American Europe.</v>

2575
01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:05.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2576
01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.350
<v Speaker 4>And that you go to Florida does a different country.</v>

2577
01:15:07.351 --> 01:15:08.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah it is.</v>

2578
01:15:08.111 --> 01:15:08.560
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

2579
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.350
<v Speaker 4>it's two different countries because if not three,</v>

2580
01:15:11.351 --> 01:15:13.360
<v Speaker 4>because you've got the locals,</v>

2581
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:18.010
<v Speaker 4>which I'd put them against Mississippi and Alabama for being deep south.</v>

2582
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.620
<v Speaker 4>And then you've got the retirement people,</v>

2583
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 4>which is old Jews from New York and then you've got the Latino Element Florida.</v>

2584
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:26.170
<v Speaker 4>It's V it's three different,</v>

2585
01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.820
<v Speaker 7>a lot of old Italians from New York to Oh yeah,</v>

2586
01:15:28.821 --> 01:15:29.211
<v Speaker 7>that's right.</v>

01:15:33.911 --> 01:15:35.180
<v Speaker 7>Talk and get in the boat</v>

2591

<v Speaker 4>Get some good Italian food in Florida.</v>

2593
01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:43.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2594
01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.300
<v Speaker 7>Got some good food.</v>

2595
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:44.841
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>

2596
01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:45.321
<v Speaker 7>you're right.</v>

2597
01:15:45.321 --> 01:15:46.340
<v Speaker 7>The upper part of it,</v>

2598
01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:46.941
<v Speaker 7>especially,</v>

2599
01:15:46.941 --> 01:15:48.710
<v Speaker 7>that's like all that mean,</v>

2600
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:50.630
<v Speaker 7>might as well be any other southern state.</v>

2601
01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:51.090
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

2602
01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:51.470
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

2603
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:53.570
<v Speaker 7>And then at the bottom it's Cubans.</v>

2604
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:53.850
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2605
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:54.681
<v Speaker 7>no running shit.</v>

2606
01:15:54.681 --> 01:15:55.514
<v Speaker 7>And Miami.</v>

2607
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.870
<v Speaker 7>Miami's just international.</v>

2608
01:15:56.871 --> 01:15:58.520
<v Speaker 7>Miami is like an international city.</v>

2609
01:15:58.521 --> 01:16:00.890
<v Speaker 7>It's like an international city that's in America.</v>

2610
01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:01.641
<v Speaker 7>That'd be that.</v>

2611
01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:03.500
<v Speaker 7>It's so different than Seattle.</v>

2612
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:06.380
<v Speaker 7>Like in terms of feel and like the way you're walking around,</v>

2613
01:16:06.381 --> 01:16:09.560
<v Speaker 7>everybody's like thin and in tight clothes and you know,</v>

2614
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:13.400
<v Speaker 7>people are partying and fucking dancing and music's coming out of cars.</v>

2615
01:16:13.401 --> 01:16:13.581
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2616
01:16:13.581 --> 01:16:14.000
<v Speaker 7>Whoa,</v>

2617
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:14.390
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

2618
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:15.223
<v Speaker 7>spaces alive.</v>

2619
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:16.061
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2620
01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:19.650
<v Speaker 4>It's alive and it's going to be underwater soon when they get a suit.</v>

2621
01:16:19.651 --> 01:16:22.150
<v Speaker 4>And when the moon is in certain positions in Florida,</v>

2622
01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:23.950
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't even matter what tide is.</v>

2623
01:16:23.951 --> 01:16:24.510
<v Speaker 4>The fucking,</v>

2624
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:24.950
<v Speaker 4>if it,</v>

2625
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:27.610
<v Speaker 4>if there's a high tide and no storm,</v>

2626
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 4>they still streets still flood in Miami.</v>

2627
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:31.840
<v Speaker 4>It's getting bad.</v>

2628
01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 4>Is that real?</v>

2629
01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.813
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2630
01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:35.480
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2631
01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.290
<v Speaker 7>here's what they gotta do.</v>

2632
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:38.390
<v Speaker 7>They're gotta dig under the city and then lift it up.</v>

2633
01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:38.540
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2634
01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.373
<v Speaker 7>that's right.</v>

2635
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.210
<v Speaker 7>Just go all the way under Ilan mosque.</v>

2636
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:46.160
<v Speaker 7>Use that on machine thing and you want to put some giant metal bars and just</v>

2637
01:16:46.161 --> 01:16:47.300
<v Speaker 7>jack it up to chick,</v>

2638
01:16:47.301 --> 01:16:47.511
<v Speaker 7>chick,</v>

2639
01:16:47.511 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 7>chick,</v>

2640
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:48.220
<v Speaker 4>check,</v>

2641
01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:49.053
<v Speaker 4>check.</v>

2642
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.240
<v Speaker 4>He got the Italian down there.</v>

2643
01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:53.200
<v Speaker 4>They do construction,</v>

2644
01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.610
<v Speaker 7>but what if they do in New Orleans deal where they put up a levee?</v>

2645
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:57.271
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2646
01:16:57.271 --> 01:16:58.380
<v Speaker 7>That's what they're going to need to do.</v>

2647
01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.400
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ.</v>

2648
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:01.770
<v Speaker 7>I think the problem with that though,</v>

2649
01:17:01.771 --> 01:17:06.600
<v Speaker 7>what I read was that there's something about the porous nature of the soil in</v>

2650
01:17:06.601 --> 01:17:08.820
<v Speaker 7>Miami that the waters are going to come to the ground.</v>

2651
01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:09.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:11.620
<v Speaker 7>The ground under the cities of south Florida's larceny for the IRD,</v>

2653
01:17:11.621 --> 01:17:12.980
<v Speaker 7>it's largely poorest live.</v>

2654
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:13.873
<v Speaker 7>Jamie's on the ball,</v>

2655
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 7>largely porous limestone,</v>

2656
01:17:15.801 --> 01:17:18.740
<v Speaker 7>which means water will eventually rise up through it,</v>

2657
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:20.443
<v Speaker 7>so they're fucked.</v>

2658
01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.440
<v Speaker 7>They're fucked no matter what.</v>

2659
01:17:21.441 --> 01:17:22.790
<v Speaker 7>Even with a levy there fucked that.</v>

2660
01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 7>Water's just going to get through the ground right up.</v>

2661
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:28.610
<v Speaker 7>You know how like you're on the beach and you could dig a hole in the sand and</v>

2662
01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:29.600
<v Speaker 7>eventually you hit water.</v>

2663
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:30.463
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:31.940
<v Speaker 7>That always freaked me out.</v>

2665
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:32.331
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2666
01:17:32.331 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>

2667
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.883
<v Speaker 7>I now</v>

2668
01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:36.201
<v Speaker 7>wait a minute.</v>

2669
01:17:36.201 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 7>This water under here.</v>

2670
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:38.150
<v Speaker 7>How much water?</v>

2671
01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:38.460
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

2672
01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.590
<v Speaker 5>my kid was sitting in one of those holes and I'm like,</v>

2673
01:17:40.591 --> 01:17:42.540
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get fucking sucked underground.</v>

2674
01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:42.761
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2675
01:17:42.761 --> 01:17:43.594
<v Speaker 7>I didn't like it.</v>

2676
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:44.620
<v Speaker 7>I didn't like it.</v>

2677
01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:45.453
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2678
01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:45.851
<v Speaker 7>I was,</v>

2679
01:17:45.851 --> 01:17:46.060
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2680
01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.940
<v Speaker 7>listening to a radio lab podcast on quicksand.</v>

2681
01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:52.570
<v Speaker 7>It was really cool podcasts because it made me think I went,</v>

2682
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:53.560
<v Speaker 7>oh yeah.</v>

2683
01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.990
<v Speaker 7>Nobody worries about quicksand anymore.</v>

2684
01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.820
<v Speaker 7>Is that a real thing when we exact kids,</v>

2685
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:58.271
<v Speaker 7>dude?</v>

2686
01:17:58.271 --> 01:17:58.441
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2687
01:17:58.441 --> 01:17:58.630
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2688
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:59.620
<v Speaker 7>Quicksand is a real thing.</v>

2689
01:17:59.640 --> 01:17:59.950
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2690
01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:00.250
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2691
01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:00.910
<v Speaker 7>It's a real thing.</v>

2692
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:03.100
<v Speaker 7>You can fall into this soupy,</v>

2693
01:18:03.101 --> 01:18:04.540
<v Speaker 7>watery sandy shit,</v>

2694
01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.670
<v Speaker 7>and if you don't try to swim out of it,</v>

2695
01:18:06.671 --> 01:18:07.780
<v Speaker 7>you try to walk out of it.</v>

2696
01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:08.763
<v Speaker 7>You could drown.</v>

2697
01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:09.100
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:09.933
<v Speaker 7>You could die in there.</v>

2699
01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.940
<v Speaker 7>People have definitely died and you might not even get out if you try to swim</v>

2700
01:18:12.941 --> 01:18:13.360
<v Speaker 7>out,</v>

2701
01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.560
<v Speaker 7>but that's how you handle it.</v>

2702
01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:18.700
<v Speaker 7>You handle it the same way you handle water and if you try walking through it,</v>

2703
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:19.150
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2704
01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:20.900
<v Speaker 7>Like people just get sucked into the Merck.</v>

2705
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.341
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2706
01:18:21.341 --> 01:18:21.461
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

2707
01:18:21.461 --> 01:18:21.940
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

2708
01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:22.541
<v Speaker 7>if you think about it,</v>

2709
01:18:22.541 --> 01:18:25.990
<v Speaker 7>there's like a certain amount of density to what you need to stand on.</v>

2710
01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:26.261
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2711
01:18:26.261 --> 01:18:27.220
<v Speaker 7>That's why mud,</v>

2712
01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.061
<v Speaker 7>it's not hard.</v>

2713
01:18:28.061 --> 01:18:28.820
<v Speaker 7>You use,</v>

2714
01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.910
<v Speaker 7>you just go in there and you can get really stuck.</v>

2715
01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:31.570
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2716
01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:33.670
<v Speaker 7>Well if it's more watery than that,</v>

2717
01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:34.750
<v Speaker 7>then what happens?</v>

2718
01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:37.430
<v Speaker 7>Well then you can't even stand then you</v>

2719
01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:40.203
<v Speaker 7>people just panicked.</v>

2720
01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.140
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2721
01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:41.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2722
01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:42.753
<v Speaker 7>You've got to swim.</v>

2723
01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.593
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2724
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.433
<v Speaker 7>If you can,</v>

2725
01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.790
<v Speaker 7>because there's all this weight on you too.</v>

2726
01:18:45.791 --> 01:18:47.530
<v Speaker 7>You have to realize that that stuff's dense.</v>

2727
01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.581
<v Speaker 7>So it's watery,</v>

2728
01:18:48.581 --> 01:18:51.430
<v Speaker 7>but it's also heavy and then your clothes are covered in it,</v>

2729
01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:53.530
<v Speaker 7>so your clothes become really heavy</v>

2730
01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:55.920
<v Speaker 5>and so nobody can save you because if they get close,</v>

2731
01:18:55.921 --> 01:18:56.754
<v Speaker 5>they're going to fall in.</v>

2732
01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.593
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

2733
01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.430
<v Speaker 7>If,</v>

2735
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.921
<v Speaker 7>if they,</v>

2736
01:18:58.921 --> 01:18:59.370
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2737
01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:00.660
<v Speaker 7>if you're going to drag them down,</v>

2738
01:19:00.661 --> 01:19:01.210
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2739
01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:01.401
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

2740
01:19:01.401 --> 01:19:02.670
<v Speaker 7>it's hard to swim with somebody.</v>

2741
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:04.320
<v Speaker 7>You know that as well as anybody.</v>

2742
01:19:04.321 --> 01:19:05.190
<v Speaker 7>You saved somebody.</v>

2743
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2744
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.450
<v Speaker 5>I was in Costa Rica and uh,</v>

2745
01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.700
<v Speaker 5>we were down at this Ga,</v>

2746
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.401
<v Speaker 5>this water,</v>

2747
01:19:10.401 --> 01:19:11.930
<v Speaker 5>it was the biggest waterfall I've ever seen.</v>

2748
01:19:11.931 --> 01:19:15.590
<v Speaker 5>It was like hundreds of feet high and Atlanta did in this lagoon,</v>

2749
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.840
<v Speaker 5>this round lagoon and the water,</v>

2750
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.790
<v Speaker 5>they told you don't go near the water.</v>

2751
01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.730
<v Speaker 5>And so there's these Japanese girls sitting on the edge.</v>

2752
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:27.500
<v Speaker 5>They got their feet in and then one of them like jumps in and the water fucking</v>

2753
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.690
<v Speaker 5>sucks her down immediately.</v>

2754
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:31.140
<v Speaker 5>And I dove out.</v>

2755
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.701
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

2756
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:35.270
<v Speaker 5>I have a lifeguarding to Greg from when I was stoned and 16.</v>

2757
01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:39.680
<v Speaker 5>And so I dove into the water and I grabbed her and luckily I was checking them</v>

2758
01:19:39.681 --> 01:19:41.300
<v Speaker 5>out because they were these beautiful Japanese.</v>

2759
01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:43.250
<v Speaker 5>So I had my eyes on them.</v>

2760
01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:44.091
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2761
01:19:44.091 --> 01:19:45.530
<v Speaker 5>so I dive in and I grabbed,</v>

2762
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.810
<v Speaker 5>I grabbed her and I pulled it to the surface.</v>

2763
01:19:47.811 --> 01:19:50.420
<v Speaker 5>I do the cross arm carry and I've pulled our polar out.</v>

2764
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:51.880
<v Speaker 5>And you know what she did well,</v>

2765
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:52.783
<v Speaker 5>just turned,</v>

2766
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:53.690
<v Speaker 5>turned to her friends.</v>

2767
01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.950
<v Speaker 5>They all like console there.</v>

2768
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:56.120
<v Speaker 5>Nobody said thank you,</v>

2769
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.320
<v Speaker 5>I fucking saved her life.</v>

2770
01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.040
<v Speaker 5>So anyway.</v>

2771
01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2772
01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:00.170

2777
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:06.960
<v Speaker 5>Japanese,</v>

2778
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 5>I think she was Japanese.</v>

2779
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.260
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2780
01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:08.430
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2781
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:09.151
<v Speaker 5>they were Japanese.</v>

2782
01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:09.670
<v Speaker 5>Japanese,</v>

<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2784
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.850
<v Speaker 5>She probably thought you were a lifeguard.</v>

2785
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2786
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:13.530
<v Speaker 5>Probably thought that's what happened.</v>

2787
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2788
01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:14.431
<v Speaker 5>And then I,</v>

2789
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:16.770
<v Speaker 5>and then I left and I'm with my family and,</v>

2790
01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:17.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2792
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 5>so I was so fucking bummed.</v>

2793
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:22.050
<v Speaker 5>Then we get to the parking lot and,</v>

2794
01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2795

2796
01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 5>and they started chanting hero to me.</v>

2797
01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:29.451
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2798

<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be a great feeling.</v>

2802
01:20:37.431 --> 01:20:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Even if they didn't say thank you,</v>

2825
01:21:14.811 --> 01:21:16.370

<v Speaker 2>What if you go crazy?</v>

2875
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.680
<v Speaker 2>What if you never come back?</v>

2876
01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.280
<v Speaker 2>But if you get antisemetic cause a judo,</v>

2877
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:13.531
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

2878
01:22:13.531 --> 01:22:17.910
<v Speaker 2>what if you do like for sure some people have smoked too much pot and blown a</v>

2879
01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:18.780
<v Speaker 2>fucking gasket,</v>

2880
01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.010
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest.</v>

2881
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2882
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:21.890
<v Speaker 2>It has to have happen.</v>

2883
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:24.200
<v Speaker 5>They say that actually they're finding,</v>

2884
01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.030
<v Speaker 5>my wife just told me this yesterday,</v>

2885
01:22:26.031 --> 01:22:30.410
<v Speaker 5>she read this article about people with schizophrenia are getting older and</v>

2886
01:22:30.411 --> 01:22:33.770
<v Speaker 5>they're smoking pot more because it's legal and uh,</v>

2887
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:38.830
<v Speaker 5>they're finding people are coming in with a schizophrenia episodes from smoking</v>

2888
01:22:39.531 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 5>too much pot</v>

2889
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.520
<v Speaker 2>that worst gets a phrenic or ready or became schizophrenia from the pot.</v>

2890
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:45.563
<v Speaker 2>Not sure.</v>

2891
01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I think when you,</v>

2892
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:48.540
<v Speaker 2>especially when you get too high,</v>

2893
01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:50.790
<v Speaker 2>it feels exactly like being crazy.</v>

2894
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2895
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 2>And I think when,</v>

2896
01:22:53.191 --> 01:22:53.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2897
01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:58.410
<v Speaker 2>there's been moments for sure that I smoked too much pot and I freaked the fuck</v>

2898
01:22:58.411 --> 01:22:59.130
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2899
01:22:59.130 --> 01:22:59.521
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2900
01:22:59.521 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2901
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:01.470
<v Speaker 2>when that happens,</v>

2902
01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.870
<v Speaker 2>it almost always feels like,</v>

2903
01:23:03.871 --> 01:23:04.171
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2904
01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 2>if I had to live life like this,</v>

2905
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 7>and it's one of the things that I tried to take any consideration when I,</v>

2906
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:12.250
<v Speaker 7>when I think about people having something wrong with the way their brain</v>

2907
01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:17.251
<v Speaker 7>processes information or the way they talk is like thinking about how you feel</v>

2908
01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:21.370
<v Speaker 7>when you're on like a 200 milligram edible and you're like,</v>

2909
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:21.791
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>

2910
01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:22.630
<v Speaker 7>I just can't do this.</v>

2911
01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:23.411
<v Speaker 7>This is just too much.</v>

2912
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:27.730
<v Speaker 7>Everything is anxiety and the freak out and life and death and all of your</v>

2913
01:23:27.731 --> 01:23:31.620
<v Speaker 7>memories pouring back into your head like a waterfall and you can't call them</v>

2914
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.290
<v Speaker 7>circles.</v>

2915
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:37.290
<v Speaker 7>They're spinning plates and all you want is for it to end please.</v>

2916
01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:38.940
<v Speaker 7>And a lie down here.</v>

2917
01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.540
<v Speaker 7>I hear when you take a shower,</v>

2918
01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 7>it helps you get in the shower.</v>

2919
01:23:42.311 --> 01:23:43.144
<v Speaker 7>You're still freaked out.</v>

2920
01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:48.070
<v Speaker 7>If that was your whole life and you got to think what is,</v>

2921
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:48.430
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2922
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:51.310
<v Speaker 7>what's your state of consciousness versus another person's?</v>

2923
01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:52.240
<v Speaker 7>You have to guess.</v>

2924
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.170
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>

2925
01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:54.730
<v Speaker 7>I've never been in your mind.</v>

2926
01:23:54.731 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how your mind works.</v>

2927
01:23:56.291 --> 01:24:00.370
<v Speaker 7>I have to guess that your mind is some reasonable,</v>

2928
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.820
<v Speaker 7>it's got something like the way my mind works,</v>

2929
01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.160
<v Speaker 7>the way you look at life and we talk about so many things.</v>

2930
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:07.510
<v Speaker 7>We agree on so many things.</v>

2931
01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 7>I've got to think you're processing is very similar to mine,</v>

2932
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.630
<v Speaker 7>but there's gotta be people out there where it's chaos where it's just like you</v>

2933
01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:14.830
<v Speaker 7>would the 200 milligram edible.</v>

2934
01:24:14.831 --> 01:24:16.660
<v Speaker 7>You're just like fuck all day.</v>

2935
01:24:16.661 --> 01:24:17.494
<v Speaker 7>It's just so like what,</v>

2936
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.550
<v Speaker 7>who's who's doing that?</v>

2937
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:19.121
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2938
01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:19.691
<v Speaker 7>people do.</v>

2939
01:24:19.691 --> 01:24:22.750
<v Speaker 7>Just people watching the man from the is a building near us and just people</v>

2940
01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:23.584
<v Speaker 7>watching me like,</v>

2941
01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:24.790
<v Speaker 7>and they can't escape,</v>

2942
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:26.020
<v Speaker 7>can escape the Kennys can't,</v>

2943
01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:31.060
<v Speaker 7>they're trapped in this is fucking constant snow ball effect of anxiety and</v>

2944
01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.001
<v Speaker 7>chaos.</v>

2945
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:34.600
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2946
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.920
<v Speaker 7>and you've got a wondered like what,</v>

2947
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 7>how much of that is brain chemistry?</v>

2948
01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:42.460
<v Speaker 7>How much of that is brain chemistry that's been adjusted by nature and by life</v>

2949
01:24:42.461 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 7>experiences and abuse and all these different factors that happen to people that</v>

2950
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 7>make them lose their grip.</v>

2951
01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:49.673
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2952
01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:50.090
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2953
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.390
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2954
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.691
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2955
01:24:50.691 --> 01:24:52.310
<v Speaker 5>you see them on the street and he just,</v>

2956
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2957
01:24:52.761 --> 01:24:54.950
<v Speaker 5>there's a woman that is near my house.</v>

2958
01:24:54.951 --> 01:24:59.951
<v Speaker 5>She's at a bus stop and she's been at this bus stop for three years and I have</v>

2959
01:25:00.501 --> 01:25:01.011
<v Speaker 5>never,</v>

2960
01:25:01.011 --> 01:25:03.530
<v Speaker 5>and I pass her two or three times a day and I check,</v>

2961
01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:06.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm kind of obsessed with checking on her every time I drive by.</v>

2962
01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.293
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2963
01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.770
<v Speaker 5>she's never not been in that bus stop sitting down.</v>

2964
01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:16.580
<v Speaker 5>She's either reading or just under a blanket.</v>

2965
01:25:16.581 --> 01:25:17.660
<v Speaker 5>She's chain smokes.</v>

2966
01:25:17.661 --> 01:25:19.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where she gets a cigarettes.</v>

2967
01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.240
<v Speaker 5>She's got a cell phone.</v>

2968
01:25:20.241 --> 01:25:21.680
<v Speaker 5>Don't know how she charges it,</v>

2969
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.680
<v Speaker 5>but I guess she goes to the bathroom at the gas station maybe.</v>

2970
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.200
<v Speaker 5>Maybe people give her money and she goes,</v>

2971
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:27.320
<v Speaker 5>doesn't beg,</v>

2972
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:28.250
<v Speaker 5>doesn't engage,</v>

2973
01:25:28.251 --> 01:25:29.120
<v Speaker 5>just sits at this.</v>

2974
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 5>And it's a,</v>

2975
01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:30.440
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

2976
01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.080
<v Speaker 5>she's in front of a gas station and a busy road.</v>

2977
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:33.950
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2978
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:36.500
<v Speaker 5>it's the worst spot to say pouring rain.</v>

2979
01:25:36.501 --> 01:25:38.940
<v Speaker 5>She's out there cold winter.</v>

2980
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:39.980
<v Speaker 5>She's out there.</v>

2981
01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.210
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2982
01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.233
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2983
01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:45.180
<v Speaker 7>Does the bus stop?</v>

2984
01:25:45.181 --> 01:25:46.014
<v Speaker 7>Have a cover?</v>

2985
01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:47.123
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2986
01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:48.090
<v Speaker 5>but not,</v>

2987
01:25:48.091 --> 01:25:48.601
<v Speaker 5>not like,</v>

2988
01:25:48.601 --> 01:25:49.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2989
01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.550
<v Speaker 5>the sides are not there.</v>

2990
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:51.170
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2991
01:25:51.170 --> 01:25:52.320
<v Speaker 5>so on driving rain,</v>

2992
01:25:52.321 --> 01:25:52.561
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2993
01:25:52.561 --> 01:25:53.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2994
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:53.581
<v Speaker 5>so she's just,</v>

2995
01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:54.390
<v Speaker 5>she's soaked.</v>

2996
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:55.223
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2997
01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.680
<v Speaker 5>And you see her talking to herself a little bit and you just think Jesus Christ.</v>

2998
01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:00.360
<v Speaker 5>And so I looked her up online,</v>

2999
01:26:00.361 --> 01:26:03.270
<v Speaker 5>I researched her and it turns out she's from Venice.</v>

3000
01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.550
<v Speaker 5>She went to Venice high and she's got a,</v>

3001
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 5>she's got parents in the neighborhood and they know she's there.</v>

3002
01:26:09.471 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 5>They can't get her to leave.</v>

3003
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 5>Social workers come by and they just realized she's happy there.</v>

3004
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:15.051
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3005
01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:16.880
<v Speaker 5>we're not happy but she's safe there.</v>

3006
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 5>Something about that spot maybe cause it's like the busiest spot round.</v>

3007
01:26:21.171 --> 01:26:22.430
<v Speaker 5>It makes her feel safe.</v>

3008
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3009
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:24.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3010
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that your kid,</v>

3011
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3012
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:30.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3013
01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 2>As you kid blows a gasket and you got to let go at a certain point.</v>

3014
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:36.103
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

3015
01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:39.690
<v Speaker 5>You can't make them take their medication after the age of 18 and for some</v>

3016
01:26:39.691 --> 01:26:43.110
<v Speaker 5>reason a lot of schizophrenia don't like taking their medication because of the</v>

3017
01:26:43.111 --> 01:26:44.010
<v Speaker 5>way it makes them feel.</v>

3018
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.800
<v Speaker 2>God it man.</v>

3019
01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3020
01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.370
<v Speaker 2>What are the other options?</v>

3021
01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.180
<v Speaker 2>My think lithium is the main drug and then there's a couple other ones that</v>

3022
01:26:52.181 --> 01:26:52.750
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

3023
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Is there any behavioral therapy or physical therapy?</v>

3024
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.611
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3025
01:26:57.611 --> 01:26:58.390
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

3026
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3027
01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.940
<v Speaker 5>I think it's about replacing thoughts.</v>

3028
01:27:00.941 --> 01:27:02.590
<v Speaker 5>It's cognitive behavioral therapy.</v>

3029
01:27:02.591 --> 01:27:03.041
<v Speaker 5>They have to,</v>

3030
01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:04.600
<v Speaker 5>when they start thinking something,</v>

3031
01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.200
<v Speaker 5>they have to replace it with another thought and they have to train in that</v>

3032
01:27:08.201 --> 01:27:09.430
<v Speaker 5>until they can stop</v>

3033
01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.790
<v Speaker 2>the the voices.</v>

3034
01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:11.130
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

3035
01:27:11.130 --> 01:27:13.460
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's mostly medication.</v>

3036
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:14.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3037
01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I think we have an aversion to treating the brain the same way we treat other</v>

3038
01:27:20.121 --> 01:27:21.170
<v Speaker 2>things that get broken.</v>

3039
01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3040
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:22.580
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

3041
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:22.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3042
01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:23.744
<v Speaker 2>a few,</v>

3043
01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.150
<v Speaker 2>you have something wrong with your liver.</v>

3044
01:27:26.670 --> 01:27:26.970
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3045
01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:27.380
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

3046
01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:27.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3047
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:28.850
<v Speaker 2>you've got liver disease.</v>

3048
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Well we're going to give you medication for the liver.</v>

3049
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Or there's something wrong with your brain.</v>

3050
01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:32.601
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3051
01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:33.434
<v Speaker 2>are you sure?</v>

3052
01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:34.581
<v Speaker 2>You sure the sun,</v>

3053
01:27:34.581 --> 01:27:35.414
<v Speaker 2>right brain,</v>

3054
01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 2>you know what's wrong,</v>

3055
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3056
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Like your brain's really not producing enough chemicals.</v>

3057
01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:40.694
<v Speaker 2>Is that it?</v>

3058
01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Or is it just the way you look at things?</v>

3059
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:43.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3060
01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:44.240
<v Speaker 2>they look at it as a weakness.</v>

3061
01:27:44.241 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3062
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:45.021
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

3063
01:27:45.021 --> 01:27:45.890
<v Speaker 2>This is a weakness.</v>

3064
01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:46.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3065
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.930
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing.</v>

3066
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:50.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing because sometimes it is,</v>

3067
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people are weak,</v>

3068
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:54.260
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes that's not it.</v>

3069
01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes there's something wrong.</v>

3070
01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 2>And so if you are a person who's got something wrong and people were telling</v>

3071
01:27:59.520 --> 01:27:59.611
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3072
01:27:59.611 --> 01:28:00.444
<v Speaker 2>you just week,</v>

3073
01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:01.460
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3074
01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:01.601
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3075
01:28:01.601 --> 01:28:01.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3076
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.140
<v Speaker 2>this is fucked up.</v>

3077
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Like this is this,</v>

3078
01:28:04.431 --> 01:28:07.970
<v Speaker 2>this is a terrible feeling and this is everyday for me all day.</v>

3079
01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3080
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.920
<v Speaker 2>There's just something wrong going on in there.</v>

3081
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Like it has to be that there's variables to the way your brain works.</v>

3082
01:28:14.031 --> 01:28:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Just why,</v>

3083
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:18.590
<v Speaker 2>like there's variables to the way your eyes function or any other part of your</v>

3084
01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:19.120
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

3085
01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:19.490
<v Speaker 2>This is very,</v>

3086
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:19.631
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3087
01:28:19.631 --> 01:28:20.270
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

3088
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 2>it's not equal.</v>

3089
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Everybody doesn't get the same dose.</v>

3090
01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:23.251
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3091
01:28:23.251 --> 01:28:23.461
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3092
01:28:23.461 --> 01:28:25.590
<v Speaker 5>depression is something that,</v>

3093
01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:28.320
<v Speaker 5>it's funny because I think I've asked you and you don't have depression.</v>

3094
01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.010
<v Speaker 5>And My,</v>

3095
01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:29.430
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

3096
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:30.750
<v Speaker 5>my buddy Mike Gibbons,</v>

3097
01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:34.770
<v Speaker 5>he's my best friend and we connect like you and me on everything.</v>

3098
01:28:34.771 --> 01:28:37.620
<v Speaker 5>But I have so much fucking depression that I,</v>

3099
01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:38.850
<v Speaker 5>I deal with it every day.</v>

3100
01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:39.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3101
01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:39.751
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3102
01:28:39.751 --> 01:28:40.291
<v Speaker 5>and I can't,</v>

3103
01:28:40.291 --> 01:28:41.340
<v Speaker 5>I have to meditate.</v>

3104
01:28:41.341 --> 01:28:42.510
<v Speaker 5>I got an exercise.</v>

3105
01:28:42.511 --> 01:28:43.230
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3106
01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:43.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3107
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:44.423
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3108
01:28:45.670 --> 01:28:46.930
<v Speaker 2>medicate everything.</v>

3109
01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.071
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

3110
01:28:48.071 --> 01:28:48.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3111
01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:48.941
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

3112
01:28:48.941 --> 01:28:49.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3113
01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.350
<v Speaker 2>while you're injured right now,</v>

3114
01:28:50.351 --> 01:28:51.161
<v Speaker 2>you can't work out.</v>

3115
01:28:51.161 --> 01:28:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3116
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:51.950
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3117
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:55.000
<v Speaker 2>And does that affect you when you take the time to help you?</v>

3118
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3119
01:28:55.241 --> 01:28:56.074
<v Speaker 2>I've been in a Rut,</v>

3120
01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:57.190
<v Speaker 2>if not exercising.</v>

3121
01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.870
<v Speaker 2>When you do exercise a lot,</v>

3122
01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.210
<v Speaker 2>does it alleviate your symptoms,</v>

3123
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 2>your feel?</v>

3124
01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Very</v>

3125
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:02.521
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

3126
01:29:02.521 --> 01:29:02.940
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3127
01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:03.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3128
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.463
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3129
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:05.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing this thing now.</v>

3130
01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:09.450
<v Speaker 5>I think Neil Brennan recommended it and a magnet thing.</v>

3131
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3132
01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:10.853
<v Speaker 5>Tms.</v>

3133
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:13.290
<v Speaker 5>Transcranial magnetic stimulation.</v>

3134
01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3135
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.251
<v Speaker 5>He said it was amazing.</v>

3136
01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 5>I've done it for 10 weeks.</v>

3137
01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:16.500
<v Speaker 5>Every single day.</v>

3138
01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.220
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3139
01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:17.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3140
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:18.420
<v Speaker 5>Just did it this morning.</v>

3141
01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:19.680
<v Speaker 5>Do you do it to yourself?</v>

3142
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:20.041
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3143
01:29:20.041 --> 01:29:20.910
<v Speaker 5>You go in first,</v>

3144
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:23.100
<v Speaker 5>you get an Mri and they map out your brain.</v>

3145
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:28.370
<v Speaker 5>And the whole theory behind it is that they can use magnetic stimulation to sort</v>

3146
01:29:28.741 --> 01:29:32.130
<v Speaker 5>of like waking up one of the lobes in your brain that's associated with</v>

3147
01:29:32.131 --> 01:29:32.964
<v Speaker 5>depression.</v>

3148
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.260
<v Speaker 5>And so you go in and first they map out your brain and then you go in and for</v>

3149
01:29:37.261 --> 01:29:38.250
<v Speaker 5>like a half hour,</v>

3150
01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:42.870
<v Speaker 5>they just pulse this magnetic thing onto your head.</v>

3151
01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:43.691
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3152
01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:46.080
<v Speaker 5>I'll very low grade MRI almost.</v>

3153
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:47.701
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3154
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:50.970
<v Speaker 5>I've had amazing results and it lasts forever.</v>

3155
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.241
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3156
01:29:51.241 --> 01:29:53.040
<v Speaker 5>you go through this cycle of it and then,</v>

3157
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:53.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3158
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:53.800
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3159
01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 5>Neil's had the same experience.</v>

3160
01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.130
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3161
01:29:56.130 --> 01:29:56.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3162
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.861
<v Speaker 5>Highly.</v>

3163
01:29:56.861 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 5>We're last forever.</v>

3164
01:29:58.130 --> 01:29:58.590
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3165
01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:00.720
<v Speaker 5>Well they say some people have to come in and,</v>

3166
01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.501
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

3167
01:30:01.501 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 5>get a,</v>

3168
01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:02.723
<v Speaker 5>get a tuneup.</v>

3169
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:04.830
<v Speaker 5>But generally it's one time.</v>

3170
01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.020
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3171
01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.540
<v Speaker 7>there's a woman named Cat Zingano.</v>

3172
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:08.390
<v Speaker 7>She's one of the UFC,</v>

3173
01:30:08.391 --> 01:30:10.940
<v Speaker 7>he's a top bantamweights and she,</v>

3174
01:30:10.941 --> 01:30:11.420
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3175
01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:15.440
<v Speaker 7>fought UFC champion Amanda Nunez back in the day and actually beat her before</v>

3176
01:30:15.441 --> 01:30:16.274
<v Speaker 7>she won the title.</v>

3177
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:20.810
<v Speaker 7>But in that fight she got hurt real bad and she talked about it on the podcast</v>

3178
01:30:20.811 --> 01:30:24.140
<v Speaker 7>that she developed a bunch of brain issues after that fight.</v>

3179
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:27.830
<v Speaker 7>Cause like her cortisol levels were all fucked up at home unless we're all</v>

3180
01:30:27.831 --> 01:30:28.580
<v Speaker 7>fucked up.</v>

3181
01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:31.190
<v Speaker 7>She developed thyroid problem she had hit in the head.</v>

3182
01:30:31.191 --> 01:30:31.780
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

3183
01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.613
<v Speaker 5>she is,</v>

3184
01:30:33.610 --> 01:30:34.170
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3185
01:30:34.170 --> 01:30:36.690
<v Speaker 7>she couldn't keep weight off just trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong</v>

3186
01:30:36.691 --> 01:30:37.260
<v Speaker 7>with her.</v>

3187
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.970
<v Speaker 7>And one of the things that helped her the best.</v>

3188
01:30:38.971 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 7>She talked about it really openly and in depth on the podcast.</v>

3189
01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:45.380
<v Speaker 7>But one of the things that helped her the best was they have this at the,</v>

3190
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:48.660
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a different kind of magnetic therapy then this one,</v>

3191
01:30:48.661 --> 01:30:50.140
<v Speaker 7>cause I think this is only,</v>

3192
01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:55.370
<v Speaker 7>the center only exists around San Diego and a lot of military guys come back and</v>

3193
01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:56.340
<v Speaker 7>use it.</v>

3194
01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:57.180
<v Speaker 7>Football players,</v>

3195
01:30:57.181 --> 01:31:00.270
<v Speaker 7>people with head injuries and someone recommended it to her and it helped her</v>

3196
01:31:00.271 --> 01:31:00.951
<v Speaker 7>tremendously.</v>

3197
01:31:00.951 --> 01:31:01.470
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3198
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:02.550
<v Speaker 7>Really brought it back.</v>

3199
01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:03.221
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3200
01:31:03.221 --> 01:31:05.620
<v Speaker 5>There's some real breakthroughs going on because um,</v>

3201
01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:06.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3202
01:31:06.191 --> 01:31:07.130
<v Speaker 5>people are and they,</v>

3203
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:07.540
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3204
01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:07.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3205
01:31:07.751 --> 01:31:11.240
<v Speaker 5>they still use like electric shock therapy and it,</v>

3206
01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:11.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3207
01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:11.800
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

3208
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.230
<v Speaker 5>with pretty good results but a lot of side effects.</v>

3209
01:31:14.231 --> 01:31:16.810
<v Speaker 5>Did you get hit in the head a lot when you were a kid?</v>

3210
01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.513
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes,</v>

3211
01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:20.370
<v Speaker 5>but did,</v>

3212
01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:22.970
<v Speaker 5>was there any like moments which get knocked down?</v>

3213
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:24.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I ever got knocked out.</v>

3214
01:31:24.281 --> 01:31:25.740
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever get hit with a bat or,</v>

3215
01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:26.741
<v Speaker 5>I played hockey,</v>

3216
01:31:26.741 --> 01:31:28.330
<v Speaker 5>so I used to check people a lot.</v>

3217
01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.290
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever get down?</v>

3218
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:31.120
<v Speaker 5>Did you get really hurt doing that?</v>

3219
01:31:32.050 --> 01:31:32.883
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

3220
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:33.401
<v Speaker 5>never that.</v>

3221
01:31:33.401 --> 01:31:33.970
<v Speaker 5>My neck,</v>

3222
01:31:33.970 --> 01:31:35.920
<v Speaker 5>my neck is still fucked up to this day from a,</v>

3223
01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:36.800
<v Speaker 5>from a check,</v>

3224
01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.080
<v Speaker 5>a head check that I made,</v>

3225
01:31:38.081 --> 01:31:40.960
<v Speaker 5>but now I don't think I ever had any concussions.</v>

3226
01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:42.611
<v Speaker 5>My friend mark,</v>

3227
01:31:42.611 --> 01:31:42.761
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3228
01:31:42.761 --> 01:31:43.000
<v Speaker 5>mine.</v>

3229
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:43.271
<v Speaker 5>Mine.</v>

3230
01:31:43.271 --> 01:31:43.481
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3231
01:31:43.481 --> 01:31:43.721
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

3232
01:31:43.721 --> 01:31:44.920
<v Speaker 5>My mind runs in the family.</v>

3233
01:31:44.921 --> 01:31:45.401
<v Speaker 5>My Mom,</v>

3234
01:31:45.401 --> 01:31:46.270
<v Speaker 5>my dad's got it.</v>

3235
01:31:46.271 --> 01:31:46.481
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3236
01:31:46.481 --> 01:31:47.050
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3237
01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:48.760
<v Speaker 5>it's very genetic depression.</v>

3238
01:31:48.761 --> 01:31:48.911
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3239
01:31:48.911 --> 01:31:49.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it is is,</v>

3240
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:51.500
<v Speaker 7>but I think it's accentuated by trauma.</v>

3241
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:52.040
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3242
01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.450
<v Speaker 7>And that's why I was asking you because,</v>

3243
01:31:53.451 --> 01:31:53.810
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3244
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:55.310
<v Speaker 7>even though you probably,</v>

3245
01:31:55.311 --> 01:31:55.551
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3246
01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:56.990
<v Speaker 7>I know you played a lot of hockey.</v>

3247
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.741
<v Speaker 7>He knew the,</v>

3248
01:31:57.741 --> 01:32:01.510
<v Speaker 7>you probably don't think about it every time you collide and even falling down,</v>

3249
01:32:01.511 --> 01:32:02.480
<v Speaker 7>slamming into the wall.</v>

3250
01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:03.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3251
01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.420
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of that.</v>

3252
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.860
<v Speaker 7>All that stuff rattles your brain.</v>

3253
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:06.851
<v Speaker 7>Believe it or not.</v>

3254
01:32:06.851 --> 01:32:09.490
<v Speaker 7>People get concussions from getting hit in the chest sometimes.</v>

3255
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.000
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>

3256
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:10.360
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3257
01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.171
<v Speaker 7>Here's cats and gone.</v>

3258
01:32:11.171 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3259
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:16.980
<v Speaker 7>it says a EEG and vitals for my RM dams treats FDA approved to treat migraines.</v>

01:32:22.271 --> 01:32:22.541

<v Speaker 7>Rancho Bernardo,</v>

3270
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:27.820
<v Speaker 7>check them out.</v>

3271
01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:28.391
<v Speaker 7>And this is a,</v>

3272
01:32:28.391 --> 01:32:30.760
<v Speaker 7>you can find this on cats and Ganos Twitter page.</v>

3273
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 7>She's got a picture of her with this apparatus on her head.</v>

3274
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:34.690
<v Speaker 7>But I know it helped her.</v>

3275
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:34.901
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3276
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:35.721
<v Speaker 7>I've heard of EEG.</v>

3277
01:32:35.721 --> 01:32:35.951
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

3278
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:37.030
<v Speaker 7>it's really effective.</v>

3279
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:37.960
<v Speaker 7>It helped her a lot.</v>

3280
01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:38.621
<v Speaker 7>He helped it.</v>

3281
01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:39.070
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3282
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.401
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3283
01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:43.700
<v Speaker 7>she could talk about what sparring was like before and afterwards.</v>

3284
01:32:43.701 --> 01:32:44.530
<v Speaker 7>So she just,</v>

3285
01:32:44.530 --> 01:32:45.820
<v Speaker 7>her coordination was off.</v>

3286
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:46.683
<v Speaker 7>She was,</v>

3287
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:49.570
<v Speaker 7>that's one of the things that happens to people when they get brain damage.</v>

3288
01:32:49.571 --> 01:32:51.280
<v Speaker 7>If they get knocked out or you know,</v>

3289
01:32:51.281 --> 01:32:52.780
<v Speaker 7>bad concussions is your,</v>

3290
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.240
<v Speaker 7>your system's not firing correctly.</v>

3291
01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:57.250
<v Speaker 7>So you'll see their body's not moving right.</v>

3292
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.930
<v Speaker 7>So it almost resets,</v>

3293
01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.100
<v Speaker 7>resets to hard,</v>

3294
01:33:00.101 --> 01:33:00.351
<v Speaker 7>dry,</v>

3295
01:33:00.351 --> 01:33:01.184
<v Speaker 7>damaged,</v>

3296
01:33:01.530 --> 01:33:02.180
<v Speaker 7>damaged,</v>

3297
01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:02.380
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

3298
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3299
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 7>the signals aren't getting to the muscles correctly.</v>

3300
01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:05.800
<v Speaker 7>So like you see,</v>

3301
01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:09.820
<v Speaker 7>one of the things that you see in older boxers when they've taken too many</v>

3302
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.240
<v Speaker 7>horrible fights and they're,</v>

3303
01:33:11.241 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 7>they're really starting to lose it,</v>

3304
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:13.610
<v Speaker 7>is there,</v>

3305
01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:15.250
<v Speaker 7>there steps look shorter,</v>

3306
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.750
<v Speaker 7>their legs or look closer together.</v>

3307
01:33:16.751 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 7>They have it.</v>

3308
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:17.300
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3309
01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.970
<v Speaker 7>they're having a harder time moving.</v>

3310
01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:23.080
<v Speaker 7>They don't have the confidence to have the balanced move around and they're</v>

3311
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.400
<v Speaker 7>their,</v>

3312
01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:23.950
<v Speaker 7>their,</v>

3313
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:26.260
<v Speaker 7>their systems circuiting.</v>

3314
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.820
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3315
01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:27.070
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3316
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:28.660
<v Speaker 7>and you're seeing it in their coordination.</v>

3317
01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 7>It's a weird thing to see too.</v>

3318
01:33:30.011 --> 01:33:34.000
<v Speaker 7>I've seen it in fighters where I remember them in their prime and then I see</v>

3319
01:33:34.001 --> 01:33:34.811
<v Speaker 7>them now and I'm like,</v>

3320
01:33:34.811 --> 01:33:35.644
<v Speaker 7>Whoa,</v>

3321
01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.450
<v Speaker 7>there's too,</v>

3322
01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:37.300
<v Speaker 7>it's two possibilities.</v>

3323
01:33:37.301 --> 01:33:38.140
<v Speaker 7>It could be an injury,</v>

3324
01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.370
<v Speaker 7>they could be dealing with an injury,</v>

3325
01:33:39.371 --> 01:33:41.250
<v Speaker 7>but if you find that there's no injury and like,</v>

3326
01:33:41.370 --> 01:33:41.860
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

3327
01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:42.760
<v Speaker 7>this is not good.</v>

3328
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.941
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3329
01:33:42.941 --> 01:33:45.850
<v Speaker 7>just look at Ben Roethlisberger out there and the pocket when he,</v>

3330
01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:47.230
<v Speaker 7>he tries to run,</v>

3331
01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:49.120
<v Speaker 7>it's like little steps.</v>

3332
01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:50.640
<v Speaker 7>No movement in the shelters.</v>

3333
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.540
<v Speaker 7>And that guy used to be fast back there,</v>

3334
01:33:52.541 --> 01:33:53.830
<v Speaker 7>but he's gotten hit a lot.</v>

3335
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.480
<v Speaker 7>Does no getting away from it,</v>

3336
01:33:55.481 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3337
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:57.063
<v Speaker 7>It is what it is.</v>

3338
01:33:57.450 --> 01:33:58.360
<v Speaker 7>If you had a,</v>

3339
01:33:58.361 --> 01:33:59.320
<v Speaker 7>you ever been knocked out?</v>

3340
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3341
01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:00.760
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3342
01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.810
<v Speaker 7>Not unconscious.</v>

3343
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.730
<v Speaker 7>I've got stopped and a kickboxing match.</v>

3344
01:34:03.731 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 7>I got hit with a big left hook boom and my legs went out from under me.</v>

3345
01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:08.680
<v Speaker 7>It was crazy.</v>

3346
01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.550
<v Speaker 7>Well it didn't even hurt.</v>

3347
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 7>It was like like because you're,</v>

3348
01:34:11.861 --> 01:34:16.180
<v Speaker 7>you're full of adrenaline so you don't feel it in terms of like a ouchy.</v>

3349
01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:18.160
<v Speaker 7>It's not like [inaudible] but it's like,</v>

3350
01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.140
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't like a painful thing.</v>

3351
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:21.430
<v Speaker 7>It was like being,</v>

3352
01:34:21.431 --> 01:34:22.900
<v Speaker 7>and then my legs just stopped working.</v>

3353
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.231
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3354
01:34:23.231 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 7>Whoa,</v>

3355
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:24.940
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck.</v>

3356
01:34:25.450 --> 01:34:28.600
<v Speaker 7>That was the hardest I ever been hit because it was just on the button.</v>

3357
01:34:28.630 --> 01:34:30.820
<v Speaker 7>It was a perfect Isaac Dwin.</v>

3358
01:34:30.821 --> 01:34:31.091
<v Speaker 7>I should,</v>

3359
01:34:31.091 --> 01:34:36.091
<v Speaker 7>as I was exhausted already at this third fight of a day in a kickboxing</v>

3360
01:34:36.131 --> 01:34:41.131
<v Speaker 7>tournament and just crank and my legs just went woopsies getting really lucky</v>

3361
01:34:41.291 --> 01:34:43.570
<v Speaker 7>with all the fighting you did that you never got knocked out.</v>

3362
01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.680
<v Speaker 7>Super Lucky.</v>

3363
01:34:44.681 --> 01:34:48.310
<v Speaker 7>But I definitely got hit in the head a bunch and even though I didn't get</v>

3364
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:49.060
<v Speaker 7>knocked out,</v>

3365
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:50.260
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of sparring.</v>

3366
01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.600
<v Speaker 7>There was a lot of getting punched in the face.</v>

3367
01:34:52.630 --> 01:34:54.040
<v Speaker 7>There was a lot of getting kicked in the head.</v>

3368
01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:55.480
<v Speaker 7>Less kicked in the head,</v>

3369
01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:56.081
<v Speaker 7>believe it or not,</v>

3370
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:56.891
<v Speaker 7>cause I was terrified.</v>

3371
01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 7>I was always moving fast.</v>

3372
01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.180
<v Speaker 7>She wear helmets?</v>

3373
01:34:59.210 --> 01:34:59.691
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3374
01:34:59.691 --> 01:35:00.950
<v Speaker 7>we wear these things.</v>

3375
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.370
<v Speaker 7>The first tournament's we used to wear these things on the back of the head and</v>

3376
01:35:04.371 --> 01:35:06.200
<v Speaker 7>that that was so when you get knocked out,</v>

3377
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.320
<v Speaker 7>your fucking head doesn't bounce too hard off the ground.</v>

3378
01:35:09.321 --> 01:35:11.060
<v Speaker 7>I'm not bullshitting you pick one spot.</v>

3379
01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.430
<v Speaker 7>There's a video of me fighting with one of those on.</v>

3380
01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 7>It's a video of me on youtube.</v>

3381
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:19.540
<v Speaker 7>I've got this spot in the back of my head that it looks like a,</v>

3382
01:35:19.541 --> 01:35:20.331
<v Speaker 7>like a bald spot.</v>

3383
01:35:20.331 --> 01:35:22.640
<v Speaker 7>Like it would have if I had hair now,</v>

3384
01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:24.050
<v Speaker 7>but it's a Yamaka.</v>

3385
01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:24.441
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3386
01:35:24.441 --> 01:35:24.780
<v Speaker 7>like a,</v>

3387
01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:26.180
<v Speaker 7>it's a red plastic thing.</v>

3388
01:35:26.181 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to tell cause it's a shitty video.</v>

3389
01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 7>But that red plastic thing was basically like a spongy thing that these to use</v>

3390
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:33.130
<v Speaker 7>in taekwondo terms.</v>

3391
01:35:33.131 --> 01:35:33.380
<v Speaker 7>Cause we,</v>

3392
01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:37.310
<v Speaker 7>it was first it was no padding and then eventually they made,</v>

3393
01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:41.500
<v Speaker 7>people start wearing these helmets and they basically like these Cushnie helmets</v>

3394
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:43.980
<v Speaker 7>that go over the top of the head and you've got to strap them out underneath.</v>

3395
01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:45.320
<v Speaker 7>See how that guy's wearing it.</v>

3396
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:46.693
<v Speaker 7>The White Guy,</v>

3397
01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:49.730
<v Speaker 7>the see the guy in the background or the right side that's wearing the white</v>

3398
01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:50.210
<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>

3399
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:51.140
<v Speaker 7>That's the standard one.</v>

3400
01:35:51.141 --> 01:35:51.670
<v Speaker 7>What I'm wearing.</v>

3401
01:35:51.670 --> 01:35:53.060
<v Speaker 7>Just a pat on the back of my head.</v>

3402
01:35:53.061 --> 01:35:53.250
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3403
01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:55.820
<v Speaker 7>See that there's like a red thing in the back of my head,</v>

3404
01:35:56.530 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Speaker 7>but that's in case I got code because when we're fighting on a fucking,</v>

3405
01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:02.360
<v Speaker 7>this is a basketball court.</v>

3406
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:04.610
<v Speaker 7>This is wood floor protection.</v>

3407
01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.410
<v Speaker 7>That was me knocking that guy out.</v>

3408
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:08.301
<v Speaker 7>That was me.</v>

3409
01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:11.200
<v Speaker 7>This is me when I'm 19 so these,</v>

3410
01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:12.770
<v Speaker 7>this was where we fought all the time.</v>

3411
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:14.270
<v Speaker 7>We always fought on hardwood floors.</v>

3412
01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:17.120
<v Speaker 7>One time I fought crazy way crazier from this.</v>

3413
01:36:17.121 --> 01:36:17.954
<v Speaker 7>Ready for this,</v>

3414
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 7>the bay state games.</v>

3415
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:21.290
<v Speaker 7>I find the bay state games.</v>

3416
01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 7>We fought on a tarp that was laid out over a cement floor.</v>

3417
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:25.430
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3418
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:26.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3419
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 7>And I knocked a guy out in his head,</v>

3420
01:36:27.831 --> 01:36:29.000
<v Speaker 7>bounced off the cement.</v>

3421
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:30.200
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

3422
01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:32.820
<v Speaker 7>Kicked this dude in the head and his head bounced off some,</v>

3423
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.310
<v Speaker 7>I'll never forget that sound.</v>

3424
01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:34.830
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

3425
01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 7>So I was 19 I didn't know what the fuck to do.</v>

3426
01:36:37.701 --> 01:36:39.380
<v Speaker 7>This is where the tournament was,</v>

3427
01:36:39.381 --> 01:36:40.160
<v Speaker 7>is okay.</v>

3428
01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:40.701
<v Speaker 7>It's okay.</v>

3429
01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:41.534
<v Speaker 7>We're going to do this.</v>

3430
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:42.620
<v Speaker 7>We're going to fight here.</v>

3431
01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:43.160
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

3432
01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:43.941
<v Speaker 7>if that was today,</v>

3433
01:36:43.941 --> 01:36:44.420
<v Speaker 7>I would like,</v>

3434
01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:46.910
<v Speaker 7>are you guys out of your fucking mind?</v>

3435
01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:47.450
<v Speaker 7>I would.</v>

3436
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:51.020
<v Speaker 7>I would be screaming if I went with my kid and he was supposed to fight in a</v>

3437
01:36:51.021 --> 01:36:55.850
<v Speaker 7>tournament and I got there and there was a thin plastic tarp stretch out over a</v>

3438
01:36:55.851 --> 01:36:57.110
<v Speaker 7>smooth concrete floor.</v>

3439
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.651
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

3440
01:36:57.651 --> 01:36:59.300
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3441
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 7>Are you crazy?</v>

3442
01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:00.590
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3443
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:01.880
<v Speaker 7>Like you need pads.</v>

3444
01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.020
<v Speaker 7>You need people to make sure they don't go out of bounds.</v>

3445
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:06.740
<v Speaker 7>Tarp laid down over concrete.</v>

01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:07.380
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3447
01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.213

3448
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:09.470
<v Speaker 7>so dangerous.</v>

3449
01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:12.350
<v Speaker 7>So I definitely got my noggin rattled.</v>

01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.990
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3453
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how many times</v>

3454
01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.470
<v Speaker 5>I said do a gymnastics for like six years.</v>

3455
01:37:19.471 --> 01:37:22.070
<v Speaker 5>Starting when I was like six backflip.</v>

3456
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.621
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3457
01:37:22.621 --> 01:37:23.250
<v Speaker 5>I could do,</v>

3458
01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:24.570
<v Speaker 5>I used to double backs.</v>

3459
01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:24.950
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3460
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:25.111
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3461
01:37:25.111 --> 01:37:25.471
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

3462
01:37:25.471 --> 01:37:25.751
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3463
01:37:25.751 --> 01:37:27.120
<v Speaker 5>I trained for like six years.</v>

3464
01:37:27.121 --> 01:37:27.930
<v Speaker 5>Hard way.</v>

3465
01:37:27.930 --> 01:37:28.860
<v Speaker 5>How did I not know this?</v>

3466
01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:29.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3467
01:37:29.131 --> 01:37:30.540
<v Speaker 5>so I used to do a,</v>

3468
01:37:30.541 --> 01:37:30.751
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3469
01:37:30.751 --> 01:37:31.531
<v Speaker 5>I could do round off,</v>

3470
01:37:31.531 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 5>back handspring into a double back.</v>

3471
01:37:33.141 --> 01:37:34.020
<v Speaker 5>And you still do that?</v>

3472
01:37:34.110 --> 01:37:34.943
<v Speaker 5>I can.</v>

3473
01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.020
<v Speaker 5>I haven't tried a single back in a while,</v>

3474
01:37:37.021 --> 01:37:37.800
<v Speaker 5>but I could do,</v>

3475
01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.960
<v Speaker 5>I could do standing back flips until a few years ago.</v>

3476
01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.220
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3477
01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:41.610
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3478
01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:42.510
<v Speaker 7>No Shit.</v>

3479
01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:43.353
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3480
01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.261
<v Speaker 5>That's so I,</v>

3481
01:37:44.261 --> 01:37:45.730
<v Speaker 5>so I just wanted to learn how to do that.</v>

3482
01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:46.361
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

3483
01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:46.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3484
01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:50.410
<v Speaker 5>I over rotated a flip one time and I fucking slammed my head in a maths back</v>

3485
01:37:50.411 --> 01:37:50.890
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

3486
01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:52.840
<v Speaker 5>When you see floor exercise today,</v>

3487
01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.520
<v Speaker 5>it's not even the same sport.</v>

3488
01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.473
<v Speaker 5>It's all</v>

3489
01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.020
<v Speaker 7>right with like two inches of padding.</v>

3490
01:37:58.170 --> 01:37:58.321
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3491
01:37:58.321 --> 01:37:58.951
<v Speaker 7>When we did it,</v>

3492
01:37:58.951 --> 01:38:00.720
<v Speaker 7>it was those fucking rubber,</v>

3493
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:01.411
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3494
01:38:01.411 --> 01:38:04.980
<v Speaker 7>half inch thick mats that you've rolled out in the corners come popping up.</v>

3495
01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:06.330
<v Speaker 7>That's what we used to do it.</v>

3496
01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:08.040
<v Speaker 7>Oh yes.</v>

3497
01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 7>You were fucking twisting your ankle all the time.</v>

3498
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 7>Landing on that shit.</v>

3499
01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:13.530
<v Speaker 7>How bad you fuck your head up when you landed.</v>

3500
01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Speaker 7>It was bad.</v>

3501
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.280
<v Speaker 7>My injuries or my ankles.</v>

3502
01:38:16.281 --> 01:38:17.190
<v Speaker 7>So I used to fuck up my,</v>

3503
01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:17.331
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3504
01:38:17.331 --> 01:38:17.851
<v Speaker 7>And then you know,</v>

3505
01:38:17.851 --> 01:38:18.361
<v Speaker 7>you can't,</v>

3506
01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:19.980
<v Speaker 7>then you can't do anything for a little while.</v>

3507
01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:20.920
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

3508
01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:25.140
<v Speaker 7>well the reason why I keep asking you about head trauma is cause my friend Mark</v>

3509
01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:25.620
<v Speaker 7>Gordon,</v>

3510
01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.960
<v Speaker 7>he's an expert in traumatic brain injury.</v>

3511
01:38:27.961 --> 01:38:31.200
<v Speaker 7>He's an endocrinologist and he studies a lot of soldiers and he's written a</v>

3512
01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:32.500
<v Speaker 7>bunch of papers on um,</v>

3513
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:33.780
<v Speaker 7>soldiers,</v>

3514
01:38:33.781 --> 01:38:34.830
<v Speaker 7>former football players,</v>

3515
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:35.371
<v Speaker 7>fighters.</v>

3516
01:38:35.371 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 7>He's worked with a bunch of people that have had brain injuries and his</v>

3517
01:38:39.571 --> 01:38:40.404
<v Speaker 7>conclusion like,</v>

3518
01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 7>and a lot of them that were suicidal,</v>

3519
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.440
<v Speaker 7>a lot of them that are severely depressed.</v>

3520
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:46.650
<v Speaker 7>And his conclusion is that for a lot of them,</v>

3521
01:38:46.651 --> 01:38:50.490
<v Speaker 7>what happened was damaged to the pituitary gland that stopped them from</v>

3522
01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:52.050
<v Speaker 7>producing hormones correctly.</v>

3523
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:54.720
<v Speaker 7>And it leads to severe lack of energy,</v>

3524
01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:55.554
<v Speaker 7>depression.</v>

3525
01:38:55.830 --> 01:39:00.600
<v Speaker 7>And it's almost always correlated with head trauma and oftentimes head trauma</v>

3526
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 7>that people forgot about why they didn't think of that big of a deal.</v>

3527
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.600
<v Speaker 7>But it could be literally wiping out on a jet ski slamming into the water game</v>

3528
01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:10.471
<v Speaker 7>and yeah.</v>

3529
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:12.720
<v Speaker 7>And then you're fucked up for years and you don't know why.</v>

3530
01:39:12.721 --> 01:39:13.680
<v Speaker 7>Skiing for sure,</v>

3531
01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.251
<v Speaker 7>falling down,</v>

3532
01:39:14.251 --> 01:39:16.200
<v Speaker 7>hitting your head snowboarding is really common.</v>

3533
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:19.470
<v Speaker 7>I've never snowboarded but apparently when the s the board kicks up,</v>

3534
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.560
<v Speaker 7>your feet go up in the air and the fucking head comes down.</v>

3535
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:22.080
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3536
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.550
<v Speaker 7>That's how people get got well,</v>

3537
01:39:23.551 --> 01:39:25.110
<v Speaker 7>and you got to wear a helmet.</v>

3538
01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:25.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3539
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.490
<v Speaker 7>And a lot of kids down.</v>

3540
01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:27.810
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3541
01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:29.760
<v Speaker 7>I've heard of kids getting fucked up.</v>

3542
01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.593
<v Speaker 7>So yeah.</v>

3543
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 7>But so all those things contribute to the foot.</v>

3544
01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:36.120
<v Speaker 7>Your brain is super delicate,</v>

3545
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:36.721
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3546
01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:38.190
<v Speaker 7>it's really complicated machinery.</v>

3547
01:39:38.191 --> 01:39:39.780
<v Speaker 7>It's like when you drop your iPhone,</v>

3548
01:39:39.781 --> 01:39:40.800
<v Speaker 7>maybe you drop at once,</v>

3549
01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.560
<v Speaker 7>how many times you drop your iPhone dropped to three times today.</v>

3550
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.801
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

3551
01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:44.011
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

3552
01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:44.430
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

3553
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:45.780
<v Speaker 7>put a fucking case on that thing.</v>

3554
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.673
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3555
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:50.460
<v Speaker 7>I mean they of these drop tests,</v>

3556
01:39:50.461 --> 01:39:50.970
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3557
01:39:50.970 --> 01:39:54.030
<v Speaker 7>They do drop tests where they drop it over concrete and see how good it is.</v>

3558
01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:57.270
<v Speaker 7>Your head is similar in that you,</v>

3559
01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 7>you can get away with getting racked in the head.</v>

3560
01:39:59.551 --> 01:40:02.920
<v Speaker 7>But I was in Hawaii recently and I dropped my phone the last time that,</v>

3561
01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:03.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3562
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:04.590
<v Speaker 7>you drop your phone and you know,</v>

3563
01:40:04.591 --> 01:40:08.100
<v Speaker 7>it's getting a little wonky and then you drop it the last time and it's just</v>

3564
01:40:08.101 --> 01:40:08.934
<v Speaker 7>gone.</v>

3565
01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:09.511
<v Speaker 7>It's gone.</v>

3566
01:40:09.511 --> 01:40:11.580
<v Speaker 7>Ceville it was just calling people.</v>

3567
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:12.150
<v Speaker 7>I would,</v>

3568
01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:12.880
<v Speaker 7>I was smelling,</v>

3569
01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.270
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3570
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:14.190
<v Speaker 7>I was showing a,</v>

3571
01:40:14.191 --> 01:40:14.760
<v Speaker 7>so when I was,</v>

3572
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:15.240
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3573
01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.830
<v Speaker 7>had the phone open and I was like,</v>

3574
01:40:16.831 --> 01:40:17.071
<v Speaker 7>watch,</v>

3575
01:40:17.071 --> 01:40:17.311
<v Speaker 7>watch,</v>

3576
01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.110
<v Speaker 7>it's on the context.</v>

3577
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:20.880
<v Speaker 7>Like it's just going to start calling people and just started calling people and</v>

3578
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:22.980
<v Speaker 7>I'd hang up and then would just call somebody else,</v>

3579
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:24.730
<v Speaker 7>hang up and it would just cost wheels.</v>

3580
01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:26.490
<v Speaker 7>It was just falling apart.</v>

3581
01:40:26.670 --> 01:40:28.410
<v Speaker 7>It wouldn't let me log in anymore.</v>

3582
01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.101
<v Speaker 7>Like it wasn't,</v>

3583
01:40:29.101 --> 01:40:33.090
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't sensing my fingers touching the screen to put in the key code.</v>

3584
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:34.470
<v Speaker 7>Who's your shit all backed up.</v>

3585
01:40:34.650 --> 01:40:34.890
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3586
01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:35.370
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3587
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:35.611
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3588
01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:36.241
<v Speaker 7>It was all backed up,</v>

3589
01:40:36.241 --> 01:40:36.631
<v Speaker 7>but it was like,</v>

3590
01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:37.464
<v Speaker 7>God dammit.</v>

3591
01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:38.460
<v Speaker 7>God dammit.</v>

3592
01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:39.293
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

3593
01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:40.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3594
01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.640
<v Speaker 7>I smashed my screen.</v>

3595
01:40:41.641 --> 01:40:41.970
<v Speaker 7>I didn't,</v>

3596
01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:43.620
<v Speaker 7>I didn't give a fuck your heads like that.</v>

3597
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:44.580
<v Speaker 7>That's my point.</v>

3598
01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:45.420
<v Speaker 7>Your heads like that.</v>

3599
01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.190
<v Speaker 7>Like if I didn't get that one last drop,</v>

3600
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:48.930
<v Speaker 7>maybe a phone would've been all right.</v>

3601
01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3602
01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:50.520
<v Speaker 7>They would've kept that phone today.</v>

3603
01:40:50.630 --> 01:40:51.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3604
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:51.181
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3605
01:40:51.181 --> 01:40:52.410
<v Speaker 7>maybe be able to look through the new phones.</v>

3606
01:40:52.411 --> 01:40:52.530
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>

3607
01:40:52.530 --> 01:40:53.200
<v Speaker 7>I don't need that.</v>

3608
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.520
<v Speaker 7>It's basically the same phone,</v>

3609
01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:55.453
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3610
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:56.323
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

3611
01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:57.560
<v Speaker 5>Draak smack.</v>

3612
01:40:58.190 --> 01:41:00.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm reading this book now about,</v>

3613
01:41:00.021 --> 01:41:00.650
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3614
01:41:00.650 --> 01:41:01.910
<v Speaker 5>speaking of changing your brain,</v>

3615
01:41:01.911 --> 01:41:04.310
<v Speaker 5>it's called a how to change your mind.</v>

3616
01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.050
<v Speaker 5>God is Michael Pollan.</v>

3617
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3618
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:07.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3619
01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:08.480
<v Speaker 5>He's been on the podcast talking about,</v>

3620
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.601
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3621
01:41:08.601 --> 01:41:09.240
<v Speaker 5>no shit.</v>

3622
01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.073
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3623
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:11.720
<v Speaker 5>Did he talk about his new book,</v>

3624
01:41:11.721 --> 01:41:12.261
<v Speaker 5>about the,</v>

3625
01:41:12.261 --> 01:41:12.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3626
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:13.220
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3627
01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:13.611
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3628
01:41:13.611 --> 01:41:14.990
<v Speaker 5>it's basically about,</v>

3629
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:16.363
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3630
01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:16.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3631
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:20.330
<v Speaker 5>psychedelics and LSD and mushrooms in particular,</v>

3632
01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.340
<v Speaker 5>and it traces the whole fucking history of it.</v>

3633
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:26.780
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea how much research was done back in the fifties and sixties.</v>

3634
01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:27.351
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3635
01:41:27.351 --> 01:41:31.310
<v Speaker 5>they had conclusive studies that were showing with,</v>

3636
01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:32.163
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3637
01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:33.740
<v Speaker 5>alcoholism.</v>

3638
01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:38.860
<v Speaker 5>People were 70% of people that underwent these treatments with psychedelics got</v>

3639
01:41:39.471 --> 01:41:40.110
<v Speaker 5>sober,</v>

3640
01:41:40.110 --> 01:41:40.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3641
01:41:40.730 --> 01:41:41.570
<v Speaker 5>depression,</v>

3642
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:42.643
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes,</v>

3643
01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:43.820
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes.</v>

3644
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.811
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3645
01:41:44.811 --> 01:41:45.591
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

3646
01:41:45.591 --> 01:41:48.350
<v Speaker 5>And all that shit just got fucking thrown away.</v>

3647
01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:53.350
<v Speaker 7>Corrupt people kept that information away from folks.</v>

3648
01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.270
<v Speaker 7>The studies that Nixon funded,</v>

3649
01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.810
<v Speaker 7>like Nixon funded a bunch of studies that showed positive benefits of marijuana.</v>

3650
01:41:59.320 --> 01:41:59.741
<v Speaker 7>How is that?</v>

3651
01:41:59.741 --> 01:42:00.010
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3652
01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:00.460
<v Speaker 7>And they,</v>

3653
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:00.880
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3654
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:03.110
<v Speaker 7>the Nixon administration just fucking Canva.</v>

3655
01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:05.920
<v Speaker 7>I get out of here with this shit not releasing this.</v>

3656
01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:06.141
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3657
01:42:06.141 --> 01:42:06.620
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

3658
01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 5>the other thing he mentioned is that it got squashed by,</v>

3659
01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:13.420
<v Speaker 5>by shrinks because they had a vested interest in people not going into the woods</v>

3660
01:42:13.421 --> 01:42:16.150
<v Speaker 5>for a weekend and coming back without their depression.</v>

3661
01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.280
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>

3662
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:17.850
<v Speaker 5>So they,</v>

3663
01:42:17.850 --> 01:42:19.870
<v Speaker 5>so they disqualified all the studies.</v>

3664
01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:20.561
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck.</v>

3665
01:42:20.561 --> 01:42:21.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3666
01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.540
<v Speaker 5>What psychiatrists were like,</v>

3667
01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:24.080
<v Speaker 5>horrified that there was the,</v>

3668
01:42:24.081 --> 01:42:25.810
<v Speaker 5>these kind of results were coming back.</v>

3669
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:27.350
<v Speaker 7>Was it that for sure?</v>

3670
01:42:27.351 --> 01:42:32.210
<v Speaker 7>Or was it people who've never taken psychedelics horrified that people are out</v>

3671
01:42:32.211 --> 01:42:33.710
<v Speaker 7>there experimenting with their consciousness?</v>

3672
01:42:33.711 --> 01:42:37.010
<v Speaker 7>Because I think a lot of these psychiatrists are probably really straight laced</v>

3673
01:42:37.011 --> 01:42:37.730
<v Speaker 7>guys.</v>

3674
01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:38.870
<v Speaker 7>And so in their mind,</v>

3675
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:43.810
<v Speaker 7>especially in the shadows of reefer madness and all the propaganda that they'd</v>

3676
01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.660
<v Speaker 7>heard in the 30s and forties and when you look at those people and they're out</v>

3677
01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:51.050
<v Speaker 7>there in the fucking desert or wherever they're going dancing around and taking</v>

3678
01:42:51.051 --> 01:42:52.130
<v Speaker 7>mushrooms under the moonlight,</v>

3679
01:42:52.131 --> 01:42:52.311
<v Speaker 7>you like,</v>

3680
01:42:52.311 --> 01:42:53.690
<v Speaker 7>they're blown their brains out here.</v>

3681
01:42:53.691 --> 01:42:54.530
<v Speaker 7>You've got to stop this.</v>

3682
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:57.080
<v Speaker 7>If they're straight laced people that have ever done psychedelics,</v>

3683
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:58.940
<v Speaker 7>they might not be in cahoots.</v>

3684
01:42:58.970 --> 01:43:03.320
<v Speaker 7>It might more likely be a bunch of people to think it's a fucking terrible idea</v>

3685
01:43:03.321 --> 01:43:04.910
<v Speaker 7>to let people run around taking acid.</v>

3686
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.210
<v Speaker 5>Well there was just some of the medical journals came out with,</v>

3687
01:43:08.211 --> 01:43:13.070
<v Speaker 5>with pieces saying that none of these studies are valid because there wasn't a,</v>

3688
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:17.030
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it is about studies that have to be consistent.</v>

3689
01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3690
01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:22.250
<v Speaker 5>but the other thing is it was political and you had Timothy leary who is,</v>

3691
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:23.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3692
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:27.590
<v Speaker 5>the worst thing to happen to this kind of testing because he was saying was it</v>

3693
01:43:27.591 --> 01:43:30.260
<v Speaker 5>dropped dropout in turn on drop,</v>

3694
01:43:30.261 --> 01:43:31.094
<v Speaker 5>drop out.</v>

3695
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:32.660
<v Speaker 5>And that whole idea they said,</v>

3696
01:43:32.661 --> 01:43:33.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3697
01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:36.380
<v Speaker 5>people taking LSD are not going to fight your wars.</v>

3698
01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:40.070
<v Speaker 5>And so that became a threat to the status quo.</v>

3699
01:43:40.670 --> 01:43:41.503
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3700
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:43.250
<v Speaker 5>And that's when the law is started to come out.</v>

3701
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:45.763
<v Speaker 5>Huh.</v>

3702
01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:46.520
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting</v>

3703
01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.790
<v Speaker 7>cause you also got a lot of people to get excited about it,</v>

3704
01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:50.213
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3705
01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:50.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3706
01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:51.653
<v Speaker 5>But got</v>

3707
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.710
<v Speaker 4>he took it away from it being a,</v>

3708
01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:55.573
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3709
01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:59.430
<v Speaker 2>a medical process and he made it about,</v>

3710
01:44:00.090 --> 01:44:00.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3711
01:44:00.511 --> 01:44:01.261
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>

3712
01:44:01.261 --> 01:44:03.570
<v Speaker 2>but in a kind of fluffy spiritual way.</v>

3713
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Well he made it a big movement.</v>

3714
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3715
01:44:05.850 --> 01:44:08.790
<v Speaker 2>I think you saw that he was probably going to change the world with that</v>

3716
01:44:08.791 --> 01:44:09.420
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

3717
01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3718
01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:10.500
<v Speaker 2>He kind of did.</v>

3719
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.750
<v Speaker 2>It definitely had a big impact.</v>

3720
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:13.111
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3721
01:44:13.111 --> 01:44:14.490
<v Speaker 2>all those people that took acid.</v>

3722
01:44:14.650 --> 01:44:15.031
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3723
01:44:15.031 --> 01:44:20.031
<v Speaker 2>think about if you really stop and think about apple and you really look at the</v>

3724
01:44:22.381 --> 01:44:23.760
<v Speaker 2>fact that apple,</v>

3725
01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs said that taken acid was like one of the greatest things that ever</v>

3726
01:44:27.731 --> 01:44:28.231
<v Speaker 2>happened to him.</v>

3727
01:44:28.231 --> 01:44:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3728
01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:29.041
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

3729
01:44:29.041 --> 01:44:30.960
<v Speaker 2>as it was famously talked about it.</v>

3730
01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:32.881
<v Speaker 2>And who knows what a,</v>

3731
01:44:32.881 --> 01:44:37.881
<v Speaker 2>what an impact that had on him deciding to start apple and what would an impact</v>

3732
01:44:38.071 --> 01:44:40.260
<v Speaker 2>apple has had and the technology world.</v>

3733
01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:40.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

3734
01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:42.030
<v Speaker 4>And talks about it in the book.</v>

3735
01:44:42.031 --> 01:44:45.810
<v Speaker 4>He draws a straight line from people starting to take all this stuff because it</v>

3736
01:44:45.811 --> 01:44:47.760
<v Speaker 4>was happening in Silicon Valley.</v>

3737
01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:50.880
<v Speaker 4>This whole psychedelic movement was like right in that area.</v>

3738
01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:52.320
<v Speaker 4>And he says that it,</v>

3739
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3740
01:44:52.681 --> 01:44:53.040
<v Speaker 4>Bill,</v>

3741
01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.810
<v Speaker 4>Bill Gates apparently took it once,</v>

3742
01:44:55.410 --> 01:44:58.170
<v Speaker 4>but that all those guys were coming in and they were,</v>

3743
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3744
01:44:58.621 --> 01:44:58.831
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3745
01:44:58.831 --> 01:45:01.050
<v Speaker 4>there were these people that would lead.</v>

3746
01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.270
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy named,</v>

3747
01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:04.163
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3748
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.633

<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3751
01:45:07.051 --> 01:45:08.670
<v Speaker 4>Ron doss has mentioned also,</v>

3752
01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:11.610
<v Speaker 4>but there was a guy name Hubbard who was really like,</v>

3753
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:12.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3754
01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:14.430
<v Speaker 4>a corporate version of LSD.</v>

3755
01:45:14.431 --> 01:45:19.431
<v Speaker 4>He was going to companies and he was taking the CEOs of companies and taking</v>

3756
01:45:19.741 --> 01:45:24.060
<v Speaker 4>them in for these three day drop acid experiences.</v>

3757
01:45:24.570 --> 01:45:25.403
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3758
01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Corporate acid.</v>

3759
01:45:28.071 --> 01:45:28.221
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3760
01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:29.810
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of doing that at burning man.</v>

3761
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:31.101
<v Speaker 2>How is that?</v>

3762
01:45:31.101 --> 01:45:31.341
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3763
01:45:31.341 --> 01:45:32.174
<v Speaker 2>Some corporations,</v>

3764
01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean not a lot,</v>

3765
01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:36.440
<v Speaker 2>but there's some cool companies and go to burning man.</v>

3766
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3767
01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.053
<v Speaker 2>You know</v>

3768
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.940
<v Speaker 4>what's this?</v>

3769
01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:40.451
<v Speaker 4>Alfred?</v>

3770
01:45:40.451 --> 01:45:41.560
<v Speaker 4>Matthew Hubbard.</v>

3771
01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.320
<v Speaker 4>He's an early proponent of the drug LSD.</v>

3772
01:45:44.321 --> 01:45:49.321
<v Speaker 4>During the 1950s he is reputed to be the Johnny Appleseed of Lsd and the first</v>

3773
01:45:49.481 --> 01:45:54.481
<v Speaker 4>person to emphasize led lsds potential as a visionary or trends and dental</v>

3774
01:45:55.401 --> 01:45:56.234
<v Speaker 4>truck.</v>

3775
01:45:56.410 --> 01:45:58.780
<v Speaker 4>But this guy had an a fucking life.</v>

3776
01:45:58.781 --> 01:46:00.610
<v Speaker 4>Somebody's got to do a movie about his life.</v>

3777
01:46:00.611 --> 01:46:00.871
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3778
01:46:00.871 --> 01:46:04.540
<v Speaker 4>he was like working for the government.</v>

3779
01:46:04.570 --> 01:46:06.130
<v Speaker 4>He was a double agent.</v>

3780
01:46:06.131 --> 01:46:06.964
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

3781
01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:08.560
<v Speaker 4>while he was dropping acid,</v>

3782
01:46:08.710 --> 01:46:09.543
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

3783
01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:12.760
<v Speaker 4>he started with nothing now I think before,</v>

3784
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:13.841
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

3785
01:46:13.841 --> 01:46:14.680
<v Speaker 4>during and after.</v>

3786
01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:19.710
<v Speaker 4>He had like eight different careers and he was like a spy and he bought it.</v>

3787
01:46:20.501 --> 01:46:24.250
<v Speaker 4>He started with nothing and ended up with like a bunch of airplanes that he was</v>

3788
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:25.420
<v Speaker 4>leasing out,</v>

3789
01:46:25.421 --> 01:46:29.200
<v Speaker 4>became a millionaire and then spent it all trying to educate people on Lsd.</v>

3790
01:46:29.201 --> 01:46:33.100
<v Speaker 4>He was worth like tens of millions of dollars and he ended up broke at the end.</v>

3791
01:46:34.690 --> 01:46:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3792
01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:36.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3793
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:37.143
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3794
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:39.820
<v Speaker 2>All for the LSD,</v>

3795
01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:43.930
<v Speaker 4>he believed in it so strongly that said it was going to change the world and it</v>

3796
01:46:43.931 --> 01:46:44.764
<v Speaker 4>would have,</v>

3797
01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:46.120
<v Speaker 4>it may still now there's,</v>

3798
01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.440
<v Speaker 4>now it's coming back.</v>

3799
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3800
01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 2>there was a hiccup or several</v>

3801
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.190
<v Speaker 7>generations had a pass before people started understanding that there's,</v>

3802
01:46:53.770 --> 01:46:54.080
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

3803
01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.340
<v Speaker 7>there's a risk to everything.</v>

3804
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:58.380
<v Speaker 7>There's a risk to sports.</v>

3805
01:46:58.381 --> 01:47:02.430
<v Speaker 7>There's a risk to every fucking thing you do driving your cars at risk.</v>

3806
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 7>There's a risk with psychedelics,</v>

3807
01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 7>but there's also a reward.</v>

3808
01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.120
<v Speaker 7>And I think if you're going to be honest,</v>

3809
01:47:07.121 --> 01:47:08.250
<v Speaker 7>do you have to look at both of them?</v>

3810
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:09.840
<v Speaker 7>You have to look at the potential risk.</v>

3811
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:14.170
<v Speaker 7>You have to look at the reward and they're not looking at the reward to try to,</v>

3812
01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.640
<v Speaker 7>there's too many people out there that are trying to deny the reward and you got</v>

3813
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:18.474
<v Speaker 7>to find out why.</v>

3814
01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 7>And in this day and age,</v>

3815
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:21.630
<v Speaker 7>it might be a conspiracy.</v>

3816
01:47:21.631 --> 01:47:26.070
<v Speaker 7>It might be some pharmaceutical industry that doesn't want it to be legal</v>

3817
01:47:26.071 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 7>because it would undermine their profits.</v>

3818
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:28.410
<v Speaker 7>It might be,</v>

3819
01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:32.970
<v Speaker 7>it might be some law enforcement unions that think it's a bad idea to make less</v>

3820
01:47:32.971 --> 01:47:33.960
<v Speaker 7>things illegal.</v>

3821
01:47:33.961 --> 01:47:34.794
<v Speaker 7>It take,</v>

3822
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:35.730
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3823
01:47:35.730 --> 01:47:36.480
<v Speaker 7>prisons.</v>

3824
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:36.721
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3825
01:47:36.721 --> 01:47:38.220
<v Speaker 7>It will take people away,</v>

3826
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:38.460
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3827
01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:40.590
<v Speaker 7>in terms of the amount of people that they need for the job.</v>

3828
01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 7>It'll,</v>

3829
01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:41.580
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3830
01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:44.220
<v Speaker 7>which I think that's another story.</v>

3831
01:47:44.221 --> 01:47:46.600
<v Speaker 7>But when you</v>

3832
01:47:49.810 --> 01:47:52.790
<v Speaker 7>and people look at that kind of stuff and you look at like the,</v>

3833
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000
<v Speaker 7>the underlying sort of patterns that we follow in this country,</v>

3834
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.321
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3835
01:48:00.321 --> 01:48:01.370
<v Speaker 7>the patterns that we like,</v>

3836
01:48:01.371 --> 01:48:05.180
<v Speaker 7>are you happy or not happy with the way things go,</v>

3837
01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:06.460
<v Speaker 7>the way things are run?</v>

3838
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:08.960
<v Speaker 7>In what sense?</v>

3839
01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:11.410
<v Speaker 7>Just in any sense in all of it.</v>

3840
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:12.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3841
01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:18.120
<v Speaker 5>I trust that we do have the best system out there and we challenge it every day.</v>

3842
01:48:19.601 --> 01:48:24.601
<v Speaker 5>And I still think that we live in a place where the tenants of our society are</v>

3843
01:48:26.111 --> 01:48:28.540
<v Speaker 5>in place for sure they swing one way or the other.</v>

3844
01:48:28.541 --> 01:48:32.410
<v Speaker 5>But I still believe in democracy and um,</v>

3845
01:48:32.411 --> 01:48:37.411
<v Speaker 5>I think the internet as an as an overall thing has been positive for people</v>

3846
01:48:38.141 --> 01:48:39.880
<v Speaker 5>getting their voices out and for,</v>

3847
01:48:39.970 --> 01:48:41.080
<v Speaker 5>for information period</v>

3848
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.173
<v Speaker 7>being distributed.</v>

3849
01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.680
<v Speaker 7>But the I,</v>

3850
01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:47.160
<v Speaker 7>the idea that we're faced with that in this day and age,</v>

3851
01:48:47.161 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 7>there's grown adults telling other grown adults what they can and can't put in</v>

3852
01:48:50.611 --> 01:48:51.444
<v Speaker 7>their body.</v>

3853
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3854
01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 7>And then not being honest about the benefits.</v>

3855
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3856
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:55.680
<v Speaker 7>That's where it gets squirrely.</v>

3857
01:48:55.681 --> 01:48:57.210
<v Speaker 7>That's where the whole thing falls apart.</v>

3858
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 7>Like you're just a guy.</v>

3859
01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 7>Like if you and I are the only two people on the planet and he only came out,</v>

3860
01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:02.400
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to let you take that acid.</v>

3861
01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:03.773
<v Speaker 7>Like why?</v>

3862
01:49:04.650 --> 01:49:04.891
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3863
01:49:04.891 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 7>because it's illegal.</v>

3864
01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:06.451
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

3865
01:49:06.451 --> 01:49:07.284
<v Speaker 7>I wrote it down.</v>

3866
01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:08.610
<v Speaker 7>Can you take the acid?</v>

3867
01:49:08.670 --> 01:49:08.861
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3868
01:49:08.861 --> 01:49:10.110
<v Speaker 7>Well that would be preposterous.</v>

3869
01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:10.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3870
01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:11.311
<v Speaker 7>But somehow or another,</v>

3871
01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:12.144
<v Speaker 7>it works.</v>

3872
01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.680
<v Speaker 7>When there's a million people,</v>

3873
01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:15.090
<v Speaker 7>then a person could tell you,</v>

3874
01:49:15.091 --> 01:49:15.410
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3875
01:49:15.410 --> 01:49:16.950
<v Speaker 7>if you're a fucking grown adult,</v>

3876
01:49:16.951 --> 01:49:20.610
<v Speaker 7>you can't tell me what I can take that stupid.</v>

3877
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.473
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3878
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.810
<v Speaker 7>If,</v>

3879
01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 7>if you can't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that what I'm going to take is</v>

3880
01:49:26.491 --> 01:49:27.630
<v Speaker 7>going to fuck with you.</v>

3881
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:29.010
<v Speaker 7>If you can't prove that,</v>

3882
01:49:29.011 --> 01:49:29.670
<v Speaker 7>then stop.</v>

3883
01:49:29.670 --> 01:49:30.503
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3884
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.991
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

3885
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:32.160
<v Speaker 7>if someone does something,</v>

3886
01:49:32.161 --> 01:49:35.610
<v Speaker 7>if takes something and does and they take PCP and they run phase first through a</v>

3887
01:49:35.611 --> 01:49:37.890
<v Speaker 7>fucking seven 11 window that's on them,</v>

3888
01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:39.150
<v Speaker 7>it's on their actions.</v>

3889
01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to try PCP and I don't think you should</v>

3890
01:49:42.421 --> 01:49:43.254
<v Speaker 7>try PCP.</v>

3891
01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:46.500
<v Speaker 7>I think when enough enough people smashed through windows and go crazy,</v>

3892
01:49:46.501 --> 01:49:46.651
<v Speaker 7>you go,</v>

3893
01:49:46.651 --> 01:49:46.831
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

3894
01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:48.240
<v Speaker 7>maybe that's a drug I should fucking avoid.</v>

3895
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:50.350
<v Speaker 7>But that's how you find out about that.</v>

3896
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:51.100
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3897
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 7>You let grown adults make their own decisions and if you're the one who's making</v>

3898
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:56.890
<v Speaker 7>the decisions for all the grown adults,</v>

3899
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 7>you better have some real fucking logic to what you're saying.</v>

3900
01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:00.760
<v Speaker 7>It turns out they don't,</v>

3901
01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:04.710
<v Speaker 5>and this is the same society that allows the pharmaceuticals to peddle opiates</v>

3902
01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.700
<v Speaker 5>to people for the last 30 years saying that it was the greatest thing you could</v>

3903
01:50:08.701 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

3904
01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.180
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

3905
01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:13.750
<v Speaker 7>I think it's good that they make money because they make medicine that helps a</v>

3906
01:50:13.751 --> 01:50:14.584
<v Speaker 7>lot of people.</v>

3907
01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.060
<v Speaker 7>They're not all bad.</v>

3908
01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.890
<v Speaker 7>I think in general,</v>

3909
01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:21.550
<v Speaker 7>pharmaceuticals have helped people in tremendous ways,</v>

3910
01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:25.030
<v Speaker 7>but you can't deny that if there's some way,</v>

3911
01:50:25.031 --> 01:50:25.571
<v Speaker 7>shape,</v>

3912
01:50:25.571 --> 01:50:30.490
<v Speaker 7>or form that people are influencing other people having access to beneficial</v>

3913
01:50:30.491 --> 01:50:33.130
<v Speaker 7>things because it would impact their profit line.</v>

3914
01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:34.790
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

3915
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 7>that's evil,</v>

3916
01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:36.880
<v Speaker 7>that's evil.</v>

3917
01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 7>You have a lot of fucking money.</v>

3918
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:43.390
<v Speaker 7>If you really going out of your way to hire lobbyists to make sure that</v>

3919
01:50:43.391 --> 01:50:45.130
<v Speaker 7>mushrooms don't get on the table,</v>

3920
01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:47.411
<v Speaker 7>come on,</v>

3921
01:50:47.411 --> 01:50:48.140
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3922
01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:48.391
<v Speaker 7>You're,</v>

3923
01:50:48.391 --> 01:50:49.120
<v Speaker 7>you are,</v>

3924
01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.980
<v Speaker 7>you're a fucking real problem.</v>

3925
01:50:50.981 --> 01:50:52.120
<v Speaker 7>That's a real problem.</v>

3926
01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:53.740
<v Speaker 7>If you look at Yin and Yang,</v>

3927
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.341
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>

3928
01:50:54.341 --> 01:50:55.050
<v Speaker 7>this is the,</v>

3929
01:50:55.050 --> 01:50:55.131
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3930
01:50:55.131 --> 01:51:00.131
<v Speaker 7>opposing forces that were battling to try to get total complete freedom of your</v>

3931
01:51:00.371 --> 01:51:01.204
<v Speaker 7>consciousness.</v>

3932
01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:02.830
<v Speaker 7>These are the opposing forces.</v>

3933
01:51:02.831 --> 01:51:03.664
<v Speaker 7>Their ignorance,</v>

3934
01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:05.050
<v Speaker 7>like these psychiatry,</v>

3935
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.650
<v Speaker 7>I guarantee you these psychiatrists were worried about correlations between</v>

3936
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:13.480
<v Speaker 7>psychotic episodes and psychedelic drug use and they're worried about people</v>

3937
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:15.490
<v Speaker 7>falling apart and they're right.</v>

3938
01:51:15.670 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 7>They're right.</v>

3939
01:51:16.210 --> 01:51:17.380
<v Speaker 7>This are the ones that wanted to get it.</v>

3940
01:51:17.381 --> 01:51:17.951
<v Speaker 7>Illegal debt,</v>

3941
01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:18.760
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3942
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:22.330
<v Speaker 7>It's like working on backflips when there's a fucking thin pad under you.</v>

3943
01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:22.631
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3944
01:51:22.631 --> 01:51:23.620
<v Speaker 7>You could fall on your head.</v>

3945
01:51:23.690 --> 01:51:24.523
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>

3946
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:24.971
<v Speaker 7>And we say,</v>

3947
01:51:24.971 --> 01:51:26.680
<v Speaker 7>don't do gymnastics.</v>

3948
01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:28.000
<v Speaker 7>People fall on their head.</v>

3949
01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:30.160
<v Speaker 7>One out of 10 falls on their head.</v>

3950
01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:31.210
<v Speaker 7>You're not doing chimney,</v>

3951
01:51:31.211 --> 01:51:32.530
<v Speaker 7>not falling on your fucking head.</v>

3952
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:32.890
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

3953
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:33.191
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

3954
01:51:33.191 --> 01:51:34.024
<v Speaker 7>This is the same thing.</v>

3955
01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:35.013
<v Speaker 7>It's the same thing.</v>

3956
01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.950
<v Speaker 7>So people worried about it that don't really have experience in it.</v>

3957
01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:43.060
<v Speaker 7>I guarantee you most of those psychiatrists just didn't have experience in it or</v>

3958
01:51:43.061 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 7>we're super cautious folks is if they did have experiences with it,</v>

3959
01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:48.370
<v Speaker 7>maybe they try a little mushroom dose and they'd be like,</v>

3960
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:49.323
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3961
01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.100
<v Speaker 5>this is amazing.</v>

3962
01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.380
<v Speaker 5>His brain and also controlling,</v>

3963
01:51:53.410 --> 01:51:54.243
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3964
01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:55.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3965
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:56.800
<v Speaker 5>set and setting.</v>

3966
01:51:56.801 --> 01:51:57.940
<v Speaker 5>They keep talking about,</v>

3967
01:51:58.330 --> 01:51:58.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3968
01:51:58.721 --> 01:52:00.450
<v Speaker 5>and realizing that the,</v>

3969
01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:05.460
<v Speaker 5>the occurrence of a psychotic episode is so much lower when it's,</v>

3970
01:52:06.521 --> 01:52:06.791
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3971

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3975
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:10.503

01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 7>Just go into this with a good intention.</v>

4000
01:52:56.691 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 7>it hits you like,</v>

4001
01:52:58.970 --> 01:53:03.970
<v Speaker 7>like a infinite cyte clone of geometric patterns in impossible colors.</v>

4002
01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:07.700
<v Speaker 7>Just blasting in your brain instantaneously.</v>

4003
01:53:07.701 --> 01:53:08.534
<v Speaker 7>And you'll have</v>

4004
01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:14.480
<v Speaker 7>going into it with the intention of letting go is probably one of the best</v>

4005
01:53:14.481 --> 01:53:18.200
<v Speaker 7>pieces of advice you could give people to avoid a freak out,</v>

4006
01:53:18.330 --> 01:53:19.000
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4007
01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:19.833
<v Speaker 7>Go with it.</v>

4008
01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:20.930
<v Speaker 7>Let it go.</v>

4009
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:21.920
<v Speaker 7>Just let yourself go.</v>

4010
01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:25.190
<v Speaker 7>And it's what it's trying to do is your ego is trying to wrestle with this</v>

4011
01:53:25.191 --> 01:53:26.060
<v Speaker 7>grizzly bear,</v>

4012
01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 7>this enormous short face.</v>

4013
01:53:28.431 --> 01:53:30.110
<v Speaker 7>Bear on steroids is trying to,</v>

4014
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:33.590
<v Speaker 7>your ego is trying to wrestle with this impossible to resist force.</v>

4015
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:36.230
<v Speaker 7>And that's what leads to a lot of people freaking out.</v>

4016
01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:37.280
<v Speaker 7>So Iga,</v>

4017
01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:40.970
<v Speaker 7>losing your ego is the ultimate goal of it.</v>

4018
01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:42.463
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4019
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.260
<v Speaker 7>I don't think anybody ever really loses or ego.</v>

4020
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:46.440
<v Speaker 7>I think you,</v>

4021
01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:47.480
<v Speaker 7>you keep it in check,</v>

4022
01:53:47.481 --> 01:53:48.710
<v Speaker 7>you lose some of it.</v>

4023
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:52.770
<v Speaker 7>You keep some of it because that's what's part of your survival mechanism.</v>

4024
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:55.010
<v Speaker 7>The real problem is like having a healthy ego.</v>

4025
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.970
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4026
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:56.370
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

4027
01:53:56.370 --> 01:53:57.203
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4028
01:53:58.510 --> 01:54:00.910
<v Speaker 7>like if your wife looks good and she's looking at herself in the mirror,</v>

4029
01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:01.271
<v Speaker 7>she was like,</v>

4030
01:54:01.271 --> 01:54:01.810
<v Speaker 7>I look good.</v>

4031
01:54:01.810 --> 01:54:02.860
<v Speaker 7>You look fucking great.</v>

4032
01:54:02.890 --> 01:54:03.730
<v Speaker 7>I do look good.</v>

4033
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:04.751
<v Speaker 7>Like she feels good.</v>

4034
01:54:04.751 --> 01:54:05.860
<v Speaker 7>It feels everybody that's ego,</v>

4035
01:54:06.130 --> 01:54:06.341
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4036
01:54:06.341 --> 01:54:07.120
<v Speaker 7>You want to know you,</v>

4037
01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:07.840
<v Speaker 7>you look good,</v>

4038
01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.130
<v Speaker 7>but it's not a bad ego.</v>

4039
01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:10.170
<v Speaker 7>It's fun.</v>

4040
01:54:10.170 --> 01:54:10.750
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4041
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:11.583
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4042
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.210
<v Speaker 7>The real problem is when it gets out of control and toxic,</v>

4043
01:54:16.211 --> 01:54:18.250
<v Speaker 7>then it looks like other people see it.</v>

4044
01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.270
<v Speaker 7>And like if you,</v>

4045
01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:19.961
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4046
01:54:19.961 --> 01:54:21.460
<v Speaker 7>you see gross,</v>

4047
01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.460
<v Speaker 7>just gross behavior,</v>

4048
01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:25.570
<v Speaker 7>grow selfishness,</v>

4049
01:54:25.571 --> 01:54:26.770
<v Speaker 7>you see that and you go,</v>

4050
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:27.041
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

4051
01:54:27.041 --> 01:54:28.720
<v Speaker 7>that's the bad part of the ego.</v>

4052
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:29.583
<v Speaker 7>That's what I'm seeing.</v>

4053
01:54:29.710 --> 01:54:30.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4054
01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:33.400
<v Speaker 7>But the key is to know which is which.</v>

4055
01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:34.450
<v Speaker 7>And that's hard.</v>

4056
01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:35.560
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to know which is which,</v>

4057
01:54:35.561 --> 01:54:38.680
<v Speaker 7>which one is the overwhelming force inside your mind?</v>

4058
01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:42.790
<v Speaker 7>Which one is the one that's controlling your consciousness and your behavior and</v>

4059
01:54:42.791 --> 01:54:43.260
<v Speaker 7>which is,</v>

4060
01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:43.920
<v Speaker 7>is it the good ones,</v>

4061
01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.440
<v Speaker 7>the bad one?</v>

4062
01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:47.830
<v Speaker 7>Is it the fun healthy one or is it the one that is a,</v>

4063
01:54:47.831 --> 01:54:48.664
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4064
01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:50.950
<v Speaker 7>completely obsessed with yourself and only yourself?</v>

4065
01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:51.520
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4066
01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:54.280
<v Speaker 7>You don't know until you have these experiences and then the,</v>

4067
01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.150
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

4068
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:57.250
<v Speaker 7>the nature of them gets exposed.</v>

4069
01:54:57.251 --> 01:55:00.280
<v Speaker 7>You'd like takes him down to the roots and you start thinking about,</v>

4070
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:01.690
<v Speaker 7>well where did all this come from?</v>

4071
01:55:01.691 --> 01:55:02.440
<v Speaker 7>Like where is it?</v>

4072
01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:02.951
<v Speaker 7>Where's all,</v>

4073
01:55:02.951 --> 01:55:04.120
<v Speaker 7>what's the source of all this?</v>

4074
01:55:04.121 --> 01:55:04.330
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

4075
01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:06.160
<v Speaker 7>oh there's a validation issue.</v>

4076
01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:07.060
<v Speaker 7>There's a this issue,</v>

4077
01:55:07.061 --> 01:55:07.960
<v Speaker 7>there's a trust issue,</v>

4078
01:55:07.961 --> 01:55:08.740
<v Speaker 7>there's a,</v>

4079
01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:09.100
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4080
01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:10.390
<v Speaker 7>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

4081
01:55:10.391 --> 01:55:15.391
<v Speaker 7>It's swirling out of that in this a unnatural form to create the negative</v>

4082
01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:22.750
<v Speaker 7>behavior that you are manifesting in your life.</v>

4083
01:55:23.230 --> 01:55:23.681
<v Speaker 7>Like it,</v>

4084
01:55:23.681 --> 01:55:25.030
<v Speaker 7>all of it comes from something.</v>

4085
01:55:25.031 --> 01:55:29.110
<v Speaker 7>And one of the things about psychedelic experiences is it shut it like it shuts</v>

4086
01:55:29.111 --> 01:55:32.470
<v Speaker 7>the ego off for a second and lets you stand outside of and go look at the things</v>

4087
01:55:32.471 --> 01:55:32.700
<v Speaker 7>new.</v>

4088
01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:34.410
<v Speaker 7>You look at this thing,</v>

4089
01:55:34.411 --> 01:55:34.660
<v Speaker 7>things,</v>

4090
01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:35.720
<v Speaker 7>grubs and alia,</v>

4091
01:55:35.730 --> 01:55:36.640
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't work.</v>

4092
01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:37.331
<v Speaker 7>You know like here's,</v>

4093
01:55:37.331 --> 01:55:38.500
<v Speaker 7>here's the PR for example,</v>

4094
01:55:38.501 --> 01:55:38.771
<v Speaker 7>ego.</v>

4095
01:55:38.771 --> 01:55:39.604
<v Speaker 7>That doesn't work.</v>

4096
01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:40.473
<v Speaker 7>Name dropping.</v>

4097
01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:43.380
<v Speaker 7>Like if you're hanging out with someone and he's like,</v>

4098
01:55:43.381 --> 01:55:43.561
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

4099
01:55:43.561 --> 01:55:45.420
<v Speaker 7>you know Sean Penn was over my house last night.</v>

4100
01:55:45.421 --> 01:55:45.780
<v Speaker 7>Man,</v>

4101
01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:47.050
<v Speaker 7>I'm fucking in Ely.</v>

4102
01:55:47.770 --> 01:55:48.030
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4103
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:51.330
<v Speaker 4>You know what Jeremy Pivot was just telling me about that last week.</v>

4104
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:53.010
<v Speaker 7>Name dropping skinny,</v>

4105
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.073
<v Speaker 7>why that name?</v>

4106
01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:01.200
<v Speaker 7>But like it doesn't really work but everybody knows your name dropping and I'll</v>

4107
01:56:01.201 --> 01:56:01.351
<v Speaker 7>be like,</v>

4108
01:56:01.351 --> 01:56:01.531
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

4109
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:01.671
<v Speaker 7>what?</v>

4110
01:56:01.671 --> 01:56:03.460
<v Speaker 7>I'm Steven Spielberg and are pretty tight.</v>

4111
01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:04.500
<v Speaker 7>Like yeah.</v>

4112
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.030
<v Speaker 7>But it's one thing like if you told me you went over Sean Penn's house,</v>

4113
01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:09.630
<v Speaker 7>I'd be like,</v>

4114
01:56:09.630 --> 01:56:09.871
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

4115
01:56:09.871 --> 01:56:10.704
<v Speaker 7>what's he like?</v>

4116
01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:13.080
<v Speaker 7>Like then it wouldn't be name dropping.</v>

4117
01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:14.221
<v Speaker 7>Like if you did it,</v>

4118
01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:15.054
<v Speaker 7>it wouldn't be namedropping.</v>

4119
01:56:15.150 --> 01:56:18.210
<v Speaker 7>Like if you told me like I was hanging out with Cha with Sean Penn and I'd be</v>

4120
01:56:18.211 --> 01:56:18.390
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

4121
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

4122
01:56:18.810 --> 01:56:19.520
<v Speaker 7>how weird.</v>

4123
01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:21.080
<v Speaker 4>Well because it's the beginning of a story.</v>

4124
01:56:21.110 --> 01:56:21.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4125
01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:22.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm not just going to let that,</v>

4126
01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:24.340
<v Speaker 4>let that hang is a followup.</v>

4127
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.511
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4128
01:56:24.511 --> 01:56:25.620
<v Speaker 7>that's not your whole thing.</v>

4129
01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:26.340
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4130
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:26.641
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4131
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:30.930
<v Speaker 7>So like comedy is like name dropping with stories,</v>

4132
01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:32.400
<v Speaker 7>good stories that go with it.</v>

4133
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:33.321
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

4134
01:56:33.321 --> 01:56:38.321
<v Speaker 4>there are comedians that are really like guileless about just bringing a name in</v>

4135
01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:43.690
<v Speaker 4>or bringing up a project they worked on and you look back at the joke and ego</v>

4136
01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:47.900
<v Speaker 4>could have told that joke without telling me that a Frank Sinatra was in the</v>

4137
01:56:47.901 --> 01:56:48.830
<v Speaker 4>audience that night.</v>

4138
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:49.723
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4139
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:50.623
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4140
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:51.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4141
01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:55.970
<v Speaker 4>And I remember Anthony Clarke used to do that when he was coming up in Boston.</v>

4142
01:56:55.971 --> 01:56:56.840
<v Speaker 4>He was the guy,</v>

4143
01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.070
<v Speaker 4>he was the guy,</v>

4144
01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:00.650
<v Speaker 4>the young hot guy in Boston,</v>

4145
01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:01.533
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

4146
01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:02.870
<v Speaker 4>And I mean that dude,</v>

4147
01:57:02.871 --> 01:57:06.920
<v Speaker 4>you put his name on a marquee and he was fucking one year out of college and he</v>

4148
01:57:06.921 --> 01:57:10.670
<v Speaker 4>was this cute guy with a southern accent and the base of El cap on.</v>

4149
01:57:10.671 --> 01:57:15.560
<v Speaker 4>And he was silly and he would fill up a fucking room and he would just,</v>

4150
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:20.360
<v Speaker 4>and then he started to get some success and it always found his way in his act.</v>

4151
01:57:20.361 --> 01:57:21.111
<v Speaker 4>He would talk about it.</v>

4152
01:57:21.111 --> 01:57:21.351
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4153
01:57:21.351 --> 01:57:21.771
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4154
01:57:21.771 --> 01:57:22.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4155
01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:26.510
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to this act or when I was doing Chicago on Broadway and,</v>

4156
01:57:26.511 --> 01:57:27.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4207
01:58:42.230 --> 01:58:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I was like Anthony,</v>

4208
01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:47.710
<v Speaker 2>he was a murderer or back in Boston and we used to see him at Faneuil hall and</v>

4209
01:58:47.711 --> 01:58:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you'd fill that fucking place,</v>

01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:51.050
<v Speaker 2>you know the comedy connection when they moved,</v>

4211
01:58:51.051 --> 01:58:51.701

01:58:51.701 --> 01:58:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Took over and they moved to the big room and they moved out of that little tiny</v>

4213
01:58:54.671 --> 01:58:56.440
<v Speaker 2>room and put it in Faneuil hall.</v>

4214
01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I remember walking through there one day and Anthony Clark was murder and,</v>

4215
01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:01.990

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4219
01:59:04.710 --> 01:59:05.110
<v Speaker 2>At least,</v>

4220
01:59:05.110 --> 01:59:05.943
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4221
01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:06.790
<v Speaker 2>It's all women.</v>

4222
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4223
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:07.350

4225
01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Guys loved them too.</v>

4226
01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:09.813
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>

4227
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:11.350
<v Speaker 2>But women really loved him.</v>

4228
01:59:11.590 --> 01:59:12.610
<v Speaker 2>He was so cute,</v>

4229
01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.040
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

4230
01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:14.281
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4231
01:59:14.281 --> 01:59:17.700
<v Speaker 4>they say that's the secret to being a draw is appeal to women because they're</v>

4232
01:59:17.701 --> 01:59:18.930
<v Speaker 4>the ones that decide what to do it.</v>

4233
01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4234
01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4235
01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.433
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Like there's not a whole lot of chicks begging to go to slayer.</v>

4237
01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:27.741
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4238
01:59:27.741 --> 01:59:28.574

4240

<v Speaker 2>And to be there while this is all happening.</v>

4447
02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a wild,</v>

4448
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:41.330
<v Speaker 3>that's a wild life.</v>

4449
02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.540
<v Speaker 3>A female fighter is a wild creature.</v>

4450
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:46.220
<v Speaker 3>You gotta think of male fighter.</v>

4451
02:04:46.221 --> 02:04:48.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like almost all boys,</v>

4452
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:53.830
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the back of their head have this ridiculous fantasy of being able</v>

4453
02:04:54.141 --> 02:04:55.220
<v Speaker 3>to fuck everybody up.</v>

4454
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:56.060
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4455
02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:56.893
<v Speaker 3>come on bitch.</v>

4456
02:04:57.110 --> 02:04:57.351
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4457
02:04:57.351 --> 02:05:00.590
<v Speaker 3>fight a bunch of people like Goddamn Chuck Norris Movie Karate Kick People.</v>

4458
02:05:00.591 --> 02:05:01.424
<v Speaker 3>That would be cool.</v>

4459
02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:03.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just the reality of learning how to do that.</v>

4460
02:05:03.211 --> 02:05:03.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4461
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4462
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:04.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that.</v>

4463
02:05:04.671 --> 02:05:05.660
<v Speaker 3>That's too much.</v>

4464
02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:07.400
<v Speaker 3>It's too dangerous to scare.</v>

4465
02:05:07.401 --> 02:05:08.061
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this.</v>

4466
02:05:08.061 --> 02:05:09.170
<v Speaker 3>And most people don't do it.</v>

4467
02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:12.470
<v Speaker 3>But for women to have that,</v>

4468
02:05:12.471 --> 02:05:16.850
<v Speaker 3>it's probably way more rare to have this desire to secretly fuck people up.</v>

4469
02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Probably way more rare.</v>

4470
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like,</v>

4471
02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:22.150
<v Speaker 3>let's be generous and say 20% of the,</v>

4472
02:05:22.151 --> 02:05:26.840
<v Speaker 3>the number that men would want to fuck people are maybe 20% of that is like the</v>

4473
02:05:26.841 --> 02:05:27.920
<v Speaker 3>number that would be women.</v>

4474
02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:30.080
<v Speaker 3>So then how many of them go through with it?</v>

4475
02:05:30.110 --> 02:05:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4476
02:05:30.530 --> 02:05:34.910
<v Speaker 3>How many of them go through with it and get to be like a cat Zingano or get to</v>

4477
02:05:34.911 --> 02:05:37.280
<v Speaker 3>be like an Amanda Nunez like Jesus Christ.</v>

4478
02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.200
<v Speaker 3>If that number is so small,</v>

4479
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:41.720
<v Speaker 3>so small in terms of like general population,</v>

4480
02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:44.330
<v Speaker 3>those are some wild humans.</v>

4481
02:05:44.331 --> 02:05:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4482
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:48.560
<v Speaker 3>If they get to that stage where they're fighting in a fucking cage for a living,</v>

4483
02:05:48.910 --> 02:05:49.690
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

4484
02:05:49.690 --> 02:05:50.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4485
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Someone like Holly Holm,</v>

4486
02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:54.290
<v Speaker 3>like that is a crazy way to make a living.</v>

4487
02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:55.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4488
02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:55.941
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4489
02:05:55.941 --> 02:05:57.420
<v Speaker 8>Now you've got to think if they make it that far,</v>

4490
02:05:57.421 --> 02:05:59.290
<v Speaker 8>they're even more vicious than men because they've,</v>

4491
02:05:59.320 --> 02:05:59.800
<v Speaker 8>they've,</v>

4492
02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:00.131
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4493
02:06:00.131 --> 02:06:00.301
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

4494
02:06:00.301 --> 02:06:02.710
<v Speaker 8>there's such a social taboo for them.</v>

4495
02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:03.431
<v Speaker 8>For men,</v>

4496
02:06:03.431 --> 02:06:03.850
<v Speaker 8>it's like,</v>

4497
02:06:03.850 --> 02:06:03.971
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

4498
02:06:03.971 --> 02:06:04.781
<v Speaker 8>that's bad ass.</v>

4499
02:06:04.781 --> 02:06:05.620
<v Speaker 8>You're an MMA fighter.</v>

4500
02:06:05.621 --> 02:06:06.454
<v Speaker 8>But for women,</v>

4501
02:06:06.610 --> 02:06:09.370
<v Speaker 8>everybody just thinks it's weird and they think there's something wrong with</v>

4502
02:06:09.371 --> 02:06:09.610
<v Speaker 8>you.</v>

4503
02:06:09.610 --> 02:06:09.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4504
02:06:09.791 --> 02:06:11.050
<v Speaker 3>it's become more acceptable,</v>

4505
02:06:11.051 --> 02:06:12.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's still terrifying,</v>

4506
02:06:12.250 --> 02:06:13.810
<v Speaker 3>especially for men that don't train,</v>

4507
02:06:14.110 --> 02:06:17.470
<v Speaker 3>like to wait for a man who doesn't train and he's like around Misha Tate,</v>

4508
02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:18.640
<v Speaker 3>she's really hot.</v>

4509
02:06:18.641 --> 02:06:19.860
<v Speaker 3>And she had also fucked people.</v>

4510
02:06:19.870 --> 02:06:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4511
02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

4512
02:06:21.550 --> 02:06:22.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4513
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:23.140
<v Speaker 3>They get weirded out.</v>

4514
02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Like imagine that girl could fuck you up like she's hot and she could fuck you</v>

4515
02:06:27.311 --> 02:06:28.144
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

4516
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:29.623
<v Speaker 8>That's not nice.</v>

4517
02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.640
<v Speaker 8>Some guys probably love that.</v>

4518
02:06:31.641 --> 02:06:35.660
<v Speaker 8>People like that bondage with are tied up and overpowered.</v>

4519
02:06:35.690 --> 02:06:39.290
<v Speaker 8>But what are the odds that a girl who knows what the fuck people up is looking</v>

4520
02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:39.411
<v Speaker 8>for?</v>

4521
02:06:39.411 --> 02:06:42.260
<v Speaker 8>That kind of guy at almost zero.</v>

4522
02:06:42.290 --> 02:06:42.741
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4523
02:06:42.741 --> 02:06:43.490
<v Speaker 8>that's true.</v>

4524
02:06:43.490 --> 02:06:44.080
<v Speaker 8>Those girls,</v>

4525
02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:47.900
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't line up Luke Rockhold to in and get stuff by another alpha.</v>

4526
02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.700
<v Speaker 8>That would be a good porn movie.</v>

4527
02:06:49.701 --> 02:06:50.520
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4528
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:51.353
<v Speaker 8>Shit,</v>

4529
02:06:52.190 --> 02:06:54.700
<v Speaker 8>I would go for day to do his bank.</v>

4530
02:06:54.701 --> 02:06:55.910
<v Speaker 8>It like Luke Rockhold,</v>

4531
02:06:55.911 --> 02:07:00.620
<v Speaker 8>you chew a lot of porn in bank and then have it released after he's retired from</v>

4532
02:07:00.621 --> 02:07:01.370
<v Speaker 8>his career.</v>

4533
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.690
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4534
02:07:01.690 --> 02:07:01.960
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4535
02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.290
<v Speaker 8>cause right now it's just going to get in the way.</v>

4536
02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:03.710
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4537
02:07:03.710 --> 02:07:04.760
<v Speaker 8>It's going to be a distraction,</v>

4538
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:08.450
<v Speaker 8>but he knows that's his 401k my porn.</v>

4539
02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:11.273
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4540
02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:12.613
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

4541
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.681
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4542
02:07:14.681 --> 02:07:15.514
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

4543
02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:18.790
<v Speaker 3>the numbers of women that become elite fighters.</v>

4544
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:21.160
<v Speaker 3>W I wonder what it is in terms of like the amount,</v>

4545
02:07:21.161 --> 02:07:25.030
<v Speaker 3>the try it and then the amount that become fully successful.</v>

4546
02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's a tiny,</v>

4547
02:07:27.611 --> 02:07:30.340
<v Speaker 3>tiny percentage like to get all the way through.</v>

4548
02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:31.713
<v Speaker 3>Like how many,</v>

4549
02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:33.430
<v Speaker 3>like how many men,</v>

4550
02:07:33.431 --> 02:07:33.851
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

4551
02:07:33.851 --> 02:07:34.601
<v Speaker 3>when you were growing up,</v>

4552
02:07:34.601 --> 02:07:35.434
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>

4553
02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4554
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:40.950
<v Speaker 7>either wanted to learn how to box or wrestle or do some kind of</v>

4555
02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:42.170
<v Speaker 5>a lot of wrestlers.</v>

4556
02:07:42.171 --> 02:07:42.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4557
02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:43.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4558
02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:44.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was a school sport.</v>

4559
02:07:45.110 --> 02:07:47.390
<v Speaker 5>There was taekwondo and there was wrestling.</v>

4560
02:07:47.391 --> 02:07:49.130
<v Speaker 5>Those were pretty much the only forms that I,</v>

4561
02:07:49.190 --> 02:07:49.701
<v Speaker 5>that I saw.</v>

4562
02:07:49.701 --> 02:07:51.140
<v Speaker 5>We didn't have boxing in my town,</v>

4563
02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:53.360
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of kids you knew were into it,</v>

4564
02:07:53.361 --> 02:07:53.540
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4565
02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:54.110
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4566
02:07:54.110 --> 02:07:54.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4567
02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:55.363
<v Speaker 5>How many girls?</v>

4568
02:07:59.110 --> 02:08:00.010
<v Speaker 5>I can't think of any.</v>

4569
02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:01.213
<v Speaker 7>Super rare,</v>

4570
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:04.400
<v Speaker 7>but the martial arts classes did have a lot of girls.</v>

4571
02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:05.630
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of interesting.</v>

4572
02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:06.650
<v Speaker 7>It was a good number.</v>

4573
02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:07.640
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't half,</v>

4574
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.340
<v Speaker 7>but it might've been 20%.</v>

4575
02:08:10.570 --> 02:08:10.791
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4576
02:08:10.791 --> 02:08:14.060
<v Speaker 7>It might be 20% women that were in those classes cause they wanted to learn self</v>

4577
02:08:14.061 --> 02:08:14.720
<v Speaker 7>defense,</v>

4578
02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:15.553
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

4579
02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:16.610
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

4580
02:08:16.610 --> 02:08:21.230
<v Speaker 5>I put my daughter in taekwondo just she wasn't that into it,</v>

4581
02:08:21.231 --> 02:08:22.370
<v Speaker 5>but I go just do a year.</v>

4582
02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:26.930
<v Speaker 5>Just to give you some sense of facing somebody if a fight happens.</v>

4583
02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:27.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4584
02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.860
<v Speaker 7>and some sense of what it's like to struggle with someone physically there</v>

4585
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:31.200
<v Speaker 7>moving.</v>

4586
02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:31.981
<v Speaker 7>You've got to move with them.</v>

4587
02:08:31.981 --> 02:08:32.814
<v Speaker 7>You got to,</v>

4588
02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:34.770
<v Speaker 7>the older you are,</v>

4589
02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:35.830
<v Speaker 7>when you start learning that,</v>

4590
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:38.220
<v Speaker 7>the more difficult it is to incorporate it into your,</v>

4591
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:39.360
<v Speaker 7>the way you think about things.</v>

4592
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:39.770
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4593
02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:40.561
<v Speaker 7>I think when you're young,</v>

4594
02:08:40.561 --> 02:08:42.750
<v Speaker 7>if you have some experience with martial arts,</v>

4595
02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:46.920
<v Speaker 7>you'll be more calm and confident if something happens when you get older.</v>

4596
02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:47.280
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4597
02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:48.480
<v Speaker 7>You're already your bodies.</v>

4598
02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.760
<v Speaker 7>You develop knowing how to move that way.</v>

4599
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:51.420
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4600
02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:55.050
<v Speaker 7>When you were already like kind of set in your ways and you're injured and</v>

4601
02:08:55.051 --> 02:08:57.240
<v Speaker 7>you're old and then someone wants to teach you a wheel kick,</v>

4602
02:08:57.241 --> 02:08:57.450
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

4603
02:08:57.450 --> 02:08:58.140
<v Speaker 7>oh Christ.</v>

4604
02:08:58.140 --> 02:08:58.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4605
02:08:58.660 --> 02:08:59.281
<v Speaker 7>I like this.</v>

4606
02:08:59.281 --> 02:09:00.570
<v Speaker 7>No way my body's going to do that.</v>

4607
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:02.100
<v Speaker 7>My body has move like that.</v>

4608
02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:02.670
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4609
02:09:02.670 --> 02:09:05.590
<v Speaker 7>It's like you being able to do backflips click.</v>

4610
02:09:05.591 --> 02:09:08.010
<v Speaker 7>You could still do a back load your body,</v>

4611
02:09:08.011 --> 02:09:09.810
<v Speaker 7>learn how to do that when you were young.</v>

4612
02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:10.200
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

4613
02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:12.210
<v Speaker 7>It gets in there that programs in there</v>

4614
02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:12.960
<v Speaker 5>and there's a,</v>

4615
02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.100
<v Speaker 5>there's a moment of faith when you do a back flip where when you go up you have</v>

4616
02:09:17.101 --> 02:09:18.990
<v Speaker 5>to go up before you go back.</v>

4617
02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:22.560
<v Speaker 5>And that's the first mistake and the constant mistake is people,</v>

4618
02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:27.270
<v Speaker 5>people go to do a backflip and they lunge backwards and they land in their head,</v>

4619
02:09:27.271 --> 02:09:30.930
<v Speaker 5>but you really have to trust that you have to shoot your hands up,</v>

4620
02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:31.913
<v Speaker 5>not back,</v>

4621
02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:33.870
<v Speaker 5>and then you pull it in,</v>

4622
02:09:34.190 --> 02:09:35.850
<v Speaker 5>go over damn scary.</v>

4623
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:37.230
<v Speaker 5>And that's like that with the,</v>

4624
02:09:37.231 --> 02:09:37.350
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4625
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:40.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure with martial arts is this moves it or does a moment of faith.</v>

4626
02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:41.950
<v Speaker 5>When I don't,</v>

4627
02:09:41.950 --> 02:09:45.730
<v Speaker 7>I mean for a long time then I tried to do a a turning side kick on the heavy</v>

4628
02:09:45.731 --> 02:09:46.300
<v Speaker 7>bag.</v>

4629
02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:47.140
<v Speaker 7>There's like a moment like,</v>

4630
02:09:47.141 --> 02:09:47.441
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

4631
02:09:47.441 --> 02:09:48.161
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to hit this thing.</v>

4632
02:09:48.161 --> 02:09:48.880
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4633
02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:49.713
<v Speaker 7>What am I doing here?</v>

4634
02:09:50.090 --> 02:09:50.560
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

4635
02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:50.920
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4636
02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:53.470
<v Speaker 7>Ready and turn watch drops off.</v>

4637
02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:53.890

02:09:53.890 --> 02:09:54.723

4639
02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.470

4640
02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.320
<v Speaker 7>Shit.</v>

4641
02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:58.570
<v Speaker 7>That's not good to have around right there.</v>

4642
02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:03.220
<v Speaker 7>What am I 12 keep this big giant knife on the table.</v>

4643
02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:04.271
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>

4644
02:10:04.271 --> 02:10:04.720
<v Speaker 7>when I,</v>

4645
02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:05.560
<v Speaker 7>when I do it today,</v>

4646
02:10:05.561 --> 02:10:06.150
<v Speaker 7>to this day,</v>

4647
02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:08.500
<v Speaker 7>I have to do it slow a couple of times and get the feel of it.</v>

4648
02:10:08.501 --> 02:10:08.710
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4649
02:10:08.710 --> 02:10:10.810
<v Speaker 7>I haven't trained in a while and then then,</v>

4650
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:12.010
<v Speaker 7>then it becomes a normal thing.</v>

4651
02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:12.893
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4652
02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:13.271
<v Speaker 7>But man,</v>

4653
02:10:13.271 --> 02:10:14.950
<v Speaker 7>it's hell on your fucking knees.</v>

4654
02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.810
<v Speaker 7>I got a new knee thing going on,</v>

4655
02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:21.040
<v Speaker 7>like the Za the third time I've had to get stem cells injected into this</v>

4656
02:10:21.041 --> 02:10:21.760
<v Speaker 7>meniscus tear.</v>

4657
02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:22.750
<v Speaker 7>I got to school really?</v>

4658
02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:22.910
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

4659
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:27.570
<v Speaker 7>this little tiny meniscus tear and it develops into assist.</v>

4660
02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:28.510
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4661
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.751
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

4662
02:10:28.751 --> 02:10:29.291
<v Speaker 7>the tear,</v>

4663
02:10:29.291 --> 02:10:32.380
<v Speaker 7>we've hit it with stem cells a few times and it doesn't give me any pain</v>

4664
02:10:32.381 --> 02:10:32.801
<v Speaker 7>anymore,</v>

4665
02:10:32.801 --> 02:10:36.230
<v Speaker 7>but assist keeps developing in that area and it assists,</v>

4666
02:10:36.231 --> 02:10:39.740
<v Speaker 7>has to get punctured and drain is getting smaller and smaller.</v>

4667
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:42.740
<v Speaker 7>It happened three different times or how to get it drained.</v>

4668
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:47.750
<v Speaker 7>And the last time was a few days ago and it was the smallest it's ever been,</v>

4669
02:10:47.751 --> 02:10:49.460
<v Speaker 7>but still fucking annoying.</v>

4670
02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:50.870
<v Speaker 7>But you're still running.</v>

4671
02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:52.033
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

4672
02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:53.090
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't hurt when you run.</v>

4673
02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:56.360
<v Speaker 7>I'm taking time off right now and taking a little bit of time off right now.</v>

4674
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:58.390
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to tell you a couple of weeks off and a,</v>

4675
02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to run at a slower pace,</v>

4676
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:02.870
<v Speaker 7>skip the dog some exercise,</v>

4677
02:11:03.170 --> 02:11:05.660
<v Speaker 7>and I'm going to be more just more cautious about it.</v>

4678
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:06.680
<v Speaker 7>Not going to push myself.</v>

4679
02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:11.180
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to figure out what it is I'm doing that's causing this sis to recur.</v>

4680
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:14.920
<v Speaker 7>I think it's just overall pounding of the,</v>

4681
02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:16.130
<v Speaker 7>the hill running,</v>

4682
02:11:16.131 --> 02:11:17.870
<v Speaker 7>kicking the bag and all that shit.</v>

4683
02:11:17.890 --> 02:11:18.260

02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:23.390
<v Speaker 7>let it fully set in before I go back to doing that shit.</v>

4687
02:11:23.391 --> 02:11:25.070
<v Speaker 7>So I'm just doing a bunch of other different stuff.</v>

4688
02:11:25.071 --> 02:11:25.340
<v Speaker 7>Now.</v>

4689

<v Speaker 7>A lot of yoga is the cryogenics help.</v>

4690
02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:28.460
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4693
02:11:29.841 --> 02:11:32.510
<v Speaker 7>what would cryogenics is really good for is first of all,</v>

4694
02:11:32.511 --> 02:11:33.740
<v Speaker 7>it's really good for your mood.</v>

4695
02:11:34.090 --> 02:11:34.400
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4696
02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:35.960
<v Speaker 7>if you've never done it before,</v>

4697
02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:39.350
<v Speaker 7>the best kind are the kind where you get your whole body in there,</v>

4698
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 7>not just your neck down the neck.</v>

4699
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:42.194
<v Speaker 7>Down is okay.</v>

4700
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:43.580

4701
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:48.910
<v Speaker 7>but the real feeling is when your head's under and your whole body is like</v>

4702
02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:53.930
<v Speaker 7>immersed in this air that's cooled by liquid nitrogen,</v>

<v Speaker 7>40 minutes.</v>

4719
02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:10.700
<v Speaker 7>And then I stay out for 10 minutes and then I do another three minutes.</v>

02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:23.173
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

4731
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:24.410
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4732
02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:28.070
<v Speaker 7>that stuff gets radically boosted in your brain.</v>

4733
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:30.080
<v Speaker 7>It helps a lot of people with arthritis.</v>

4734
02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:31.430
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people have,</v>

4735
02:12:31.431 --> 02:12:31.700
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4736
02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.020
<v Speaker 7>a lot of inflammation.</v>

4737
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:34.570
<v Speaker 7>It helps him is that I say I said it right.</v>

4738
02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:35.600
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4739
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:36.500
<v Speaker 7>it ramps that shit up.</v>

4740
02:12:36.501 --> 02:12:38.450
<v Speaker 7>You feel so good when you get out of there like woo.</v>

4741
02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:39.470
<v Speaker 7>It lasts a while to,</v>

4742
02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:41.320
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>

4743
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:42.680
<v Speaker 7>you're just freezing to death.</v>

4744
02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:45.140
<v Speaker 7>You are freezing to death.</v>

4745
02:12:45.141 --> 02:12:46.370
<v Speaker 7>You are on your way to death.</v>

4746
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:47.810
<v Speaker 7>And he stepped out of it and you're like,</v>

4747
02:12:47.811 --> 02:12:48.680
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>

4748
02:12:48.710 --> 02:12:49.071
<v Speaker 7>And it just,</v>

4749
02:12:49.071 --> 02:12:49.940
<v Speaker 7>everything just feels,</v>

4750
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:52.761
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

4751
02:12:52.761 --> 02:12:53.780
<v Speaker 7>it feels good man.</v>

4752
02:12:53.781 --> 02:12:54.650
<v Speaker 7>It feels good.</v>

4753
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:55.550
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4754
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:56.091
<v Speaker 7>I saw him.</v>

4755
02:12:56.091 --> 02:12:58.220
<v Speaker 7>I fucking love swimming in cold water.</v>

4756
02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.460
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing for you the way you feel when you get out too.</v>

4757
02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:02.780
<v Speaker 7>But here's the thing,</v>

4758
02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:03.590
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4759
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:08.590
<v Speaker 7>it's not the best thing to do if you're trying to gain muscle weight.</v>

4760
02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:12.980
<v Speaker 7>You have to wait a while after the exercise.</v>

4761
02:13:12.981 --> 02:13:14.620
<v Speaker 7>Like there's apparently there's,</v>

4762
02:13:14.621 --> 02:13:18.170
<v Speaker 7>there's a bunch of different studies and I know Andy Galpin has been involved in</v>

4763
02:13:18.171 --> 02:13:19.490
<v Speaker 7>a bunch of these studies and Rhonda,</v>

4764
02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:22.010
<v Speaker 7>Patrick has discussed some of this research as well.</v>

4765
02:13:22.250 --> 02:13:22.861
<v Speaker 7>But what,</v>

4766
02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:22.990
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4767
02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:26.030
<v Speaker 7>what happens is there's a window of time after you lift weights.</v>

4768
02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:26.151
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>

4769
02:13:26.151 --> 02:13:31.151
<v Speaker 7>you should just leave your body alone and not ice anything and that this is more</v>

4770
02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:37.371
<v Speaker 7>beneficial to gaining strength and explosiveness and mass and stuff like that.</v>

4771
02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:39.990
<v Speaker 7>But that after a window of time,</v>

4772
02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:45.020
<v Speaker 7>then it's beneficial to get into the fro the ice bath or to do cryo or something</v>

4773
02:13:46.231 --> 02:13:46.740
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

4774
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:51.740
<v Speaker 7>But you want to give yourself your body a period of time to physiologically</v>

4775
02:13:52.501 --> 02:13:53.670
<v Speaker 7>adjust to the work.</v>

4776
02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:56.160
<v Speaker 7>Like your body knows what's happened.</v>

4777
02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:56.701
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4778
02:13:56.701 --> 02:13:58.080
<v Speaker 7>Greg did dead lifts today.</v>

4779
02:13:58.590 --> 02:13:59.190
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4780
02:13:59.190 --> 02:13:59.611
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4781
02:13:59.611 --> 02:13:59.911
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4782
02:13:59.911 --> 02:14:01.650
<v Speaker 7>We got all the way to get everything in place,</v>

4783
02:14:01.651 --> 02:14:01.910
<v Speaker 7>get it.</v>

4784
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:03.540
<v Speaker 7>But if you freeze it right there,</v>

4785
02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:06.250
<v Speaker 7>then it has an effect on the overall,</v>

4786
02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:07.590
<v Speaker 7>and I might be butchering this,</v>

4787
02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:11.430
<v Speaker 7>but I think it has effect on the overall amount of gains that you can make.</v>

4788
02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:12.293
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4789
02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.550
<v Speaker 5>Because your body's not sending the chemicals to the,</v>

4790
02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.760
<v Speaker 7>the way it would see if you could find out.</v>

4791
02:14:16.761 --> 02:14:17.540
<v Speaker 7>That's true.</v>

4792
02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.373
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4793
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:19.243
<v Speaker 7>that's uh,</v>

4794
02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:20.780
<v Speaker 7>figured out how to Google that one.</v>

4795
02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:22.040
<v Speaker 7>How do you agree with that one?</v>

4796
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.271
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4797
02:14:23.271 --> 02:14:24.260
<v Speaker 7>Post workout,</v>

4798
02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:25.010
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4799
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:28.790
<v Speaker 7>cryo therapy and hypertrophy cause that's what they're,</v>

4800
02:14:29.570 --> 02:14:31.200
<v Speaker 7>that's what they're trying to uh,</v>

4801
02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:31.870
<v Speaker 7>Dick,</v>

4802
02:14:31.870 --> 02:14:34.700
<v Speaker 7>they were trying to figure out whether or not it's beneficial or not in that</v>

4803
02:14:34.701 --> 02:14:35.534
<v Speaker 7>case.</v>

4804
02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.880
<v Speaker 7>So they think that it's really good for the mood and it's really good for people</v>

4805
02:14:40.881 --> 02:14:42.410
<v Speaker 7>with joint issues.</v>

4806
02:14:42.411 --> 02:14:44.330
<v Speaker 7>A lot of the folks that go there,</v>

4807
02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:49.540
<v Speaker 7>they have like a back surgery or back issues and it gives them a lot of relief.</v>

4808
02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:51.020
<v Speaker 7>And you can do it every day too.</v>

4809
02:14:51.021 --> 02:14:52.130
<v Speaker 7>Cause it's only three minutes.</v>

4810
02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:54.560
<v Speaker 7>The thing about something like that is it's not,</v>

4811
02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:56.420
<v Speaker 7>it's not like any other kind of therapy.</v>

4812
02:14:56.421 --> 02:14:56.571
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

4813
02:14:56.571 --> 02:14:57.650
<v Speaker 7>you can't do it any longer.</v>

4814
02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:59.510
<v Speaker 7>It's not like you're being a pussy because you're only doing it for three</v>

4815
02:14:59.511 --> 02:15:00.320
<v Speaker 7>minutes.</v>

4816
02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:00.561
<v Speaker 7>Bitch.</v>

4817
02:15:00.561 --> 02:15:03.200
<v Speaker 7>You can't even do three minutes the first time you go in there at two minutes,</v>

4818
02:15:03.201 --> 02:15:03.411
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

4819
02:15:03.411 --> 02:15:04.244
<v Speaker 7>fuck this.</v>

4820
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.990
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4821
02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:06.230
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

4822
02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:06.690
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4823
02:15:06.690 --> 02:15:07.161
<v Speaker 7>Two minutes.</v>

4824
02:15:07.161 --> 02:15:08.120
<v Speaker 7>You're probably ready to bail,</v>

4825
02:15:08.150 --> 02:15:10.430
<v Speaker 7>but then your body will get used to it and then you can do three minutes.</v>

4826
02:15:10.431 --> 02:15:12.230
<v Speaker 7>But it's a,</v>

4827
02:15:12.231 --> 02:15:13.280
<v Speaker 7>it's very controversial,</v>

4828
02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:14.990
<v Speaker 7>especially because a woman died.</v>

4829
02:15:15.650 --> 02:15:16.700
<v Speaker 7>There was [inaudible] Vegas.</v>

4830
02:15:16.701 --> 02:15:17.031
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4831
02:15:17.031 --> 02:15:20.210
<v Speaker 7>A woman in Vegas was operating it herself and uh,</v>

4832
02:15:20.211 --> 02:15:25.211
<v Speaker 7>apparently she was not in the right height and the liquid nitrogen was getting</v>

4833
02:15:26.901 --> 02:15:27.440
<v Speaker 7>into her,</v>

4834
02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:28.011
<v Speaker 7>her lungs.</v>

4835
02:15:28.011 --> 02:15:31.280
<v Speaker 7>She was breathing it in and she passed out and she passed out and froze to</v>

4836
02:15:31.281 --> 02:15:32.060
<v Speaker 7>death.</v>

4837
02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:32.720
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

4838
02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:33.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4839
02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:33.883
<v Speaker 7>Terrifying.</v>

4840
02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:34.430
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

4841
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:35.360
<v Speaker 7>she had,</v>

4842
02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:36.140
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4843
02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:36.500
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

4844
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:40.150
<v Speaker 7>I think the story was that she had worked there and you know,</v>

4845
02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:45.250
<v Speaker 7>she was after hours just doing therapy on herself and she fucking fell asleep in</v>

4846
02:15:45.861 --> 02:15:46.694
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

4847
02:15:47.210 --> 02:15:48.680
<v Speaker 7>He should never do that by herself.</v>

4848
02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:50.400
<v Speaker 7>If you do it at a reputable place.</v>

4849
02:15:50.401 --> 02:15:52.670
<v Speaker 7>So always be someone standing by watching while you're in.</v>

4850
02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:54.530
<v Speaker 7>They stand outside the door.</v>

4851
02:15:54.531 --> 02:15:55.460
<v Speaker 7>While you're inside of it.</v>

4852
02:15:56.450 --> 02:15:57.410
<v Speaker 7>It's scary though,</v>

4853
02:15:57.920 --> 02:15:59.090
<v Speaker 7>because you realize when you're in there,</v>

4854
02:15:59.091 --> 02:15:59.361
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

4855
02:15:59.361 --> 02:16:00.350
<v Speaker 7>this is a,</v>

4856
02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:03.920
<v Speaker 7>this is something you can't survive for that long.</v>

4857
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:05.450
<v Speaker 7>You can survive it for a few minutes,</v>

4858
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:10.400
<v Speaker 7>but you're literally exposing yourself to something that is 100% fatal if you</v>

4859
02:16:10.401 --> 02:16:11.040
<v Speaker 7>stay in it.</v>

4860
02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:11.873
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4861
02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:12.241
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4862
02:16:12.241 --> 02:16:13.170
<v Speaker 5>it's like cold water.</v>

4863
02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:15.360
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to be in freezing cold water.</v>

4864
02:16:15.361 --> 02:16:20.361
<v Speaker 5>They say the amount of hours you can survive in water is like surprisingly warm.</v>

4865
02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:22.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4866
02:16:22.810 --> 02:16:23.251
<v Speaker 5>It fits.</v>

4867
02:16:23.251 --> 02:16:25.290
<v Speaker 5>Like in the forties,</v>

4868
02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:27.810
<v Speaker 5>you can die after a couple hours.</v>

4869
02:16:28.170 --> 02:16:29.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm throwing numbers out,</v>

4870
02:16:29.351 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

4871
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:34.540
<v Speaker 7>not surprising that getting wet is one of the most dangerous things that can</v>

02:17:39.041 --> 02:17:39.880
<v Speaker 7>You're out in the woods.</v>

4910
02:17:40.330 --> 02:17:42.880
<v Speaker 7>There's very specific things that you have to do in order to survive.</v>

4911
02:17:43.450 --> 02:17:46.120
<v Speaker 7>If you don't follow the right steps,</v>

4912
02:17:46.390 --> 02:17:48.010
<v Speaker 7>you absolutely will die.</v>

4913
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:49.510
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4914
02:17:49.510 --> 02:17:54.010
<v Speaker 7>It's really common to kills more people than probably anything in the woods</v>

4915
02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:55.740
<v Speaker 4>freezing to death.</v>

4916
02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:55.861
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4917
02:17:55.861 --> 02:18:00.861
<v Speaker 4>That movie revenant freaked me out just going into the woods up north for three</v>

4918
02:18:01.831 --> 02:18:06.160
<v Speaker 4>months to collect pelts and you're walking through fucking streams and it's</v>

4919
02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:10.080
<v Speaker 4>pouring rain and he got no heat or no electricity.</v>

4920
02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:12.410
<v Speaker 7>Fuck that.</v>

4921
02:18:13.010 --> 02:18:13.251
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4922
02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:14.270
<v Speaker 7>That's how people died.</v>

4923
02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:16.280
<v Speaker 7>Lots of people live that way too.</v>

4924
02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:17.990
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people live that way until they died.</v>

4925
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:20.960
<v Speaker 7>I mean that.</v>

4926
02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:25.010
<v Speaker 7>Do you think about those people that made it across this country and the people</v>

4927
02:18:25.011 --> 02:18:30.011
<v Speaker 7>like Lewis and Clark and all of these pioneers that just didn't even know what</v>

4928
02:18:30.321 --> 02:18:34.180
<v Speaker 7>the fuck was around the next corner and they just walked on through with what</v>

4929
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:36.320
<v Speaker 7>they have like donkeys with shit on their back.</v>

4930
02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:37.370
<v Speaker 7>How much food you have?</v>

4931
02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4932
02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:39.320
<v Speaker 7>Do you even know what the fuck you're going?</v>

4933
02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:39.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:40.490
<v Speaker 4>He hit an impasse.</v>

4935
02:18:40.491 --> 02:18:40.671
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

4936
02:18:40.671 --> 02:18:44.630
<v Speaker 4>you hike for miles and then you come up to a mountain and you got to double back</v>

4937
02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:46.970
<v Speaker 7>and go around Christ.</v>

4938
02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:48.290
<v Speaker 7>No Google Earth,</v>

4939
02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:50.143
<v Speaker 7>no nothing.</v>

4940
02:18:50.390 --> 02:18:50.841
<v Speaker 7>Shit.</v>

4942
02:18:55.401 --> 02:18:56.130
<v Speaker 7>talking about.</v>

4943
02:18:56.130 --> 02:18:56.963
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4944
02:18:57.220 --> 02:18:57.811
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4945
02:18:57.811 --> 02:18:59.600
<v Speaker 7>he'd get maps from native Americans,</v>

4946
02:18:59.601 --> 02:19:02.000
<v Speaker 7>get maps from a sailor and try to figure it out,</v>

4947
02:19:03.870 --> 02:19:07.620
<v Speaker 4>and then you randomly go into the wrong territory and a Indians want to kill</v>

4948
02:19:07.621 --> 02:19:08.030
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

<v Speaker 7>a film that's out on Netflix right now,</v>

4955
02:19:15.890 --> 02:19:16.940
<v Speaker 7>It's all about the old west.</v>

4956
02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:18.410
<v Speaker 7>It's really weird,</v>

<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

4958

<v Speaker 7>It's so weird.</v>

4959
02:19:19.821 --> 02:19:21.320
<v Speaker 7>They're the weirdest guys of all time.</v>

4960
02:19:21.321 --> 02:19:22.420
<v Speaker 7>It turns away the Kahn brothers.</v>

4966
02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:27.524
<v Speaker 7>weird,</v>

02:19:27.590 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 7>but this one's</v>

4968
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:28.790
<v Speaker 3>really weird.</v>

4969
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:30.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like a bunch of non connected stories.</v>

4970
02:19:30.681 --> 02:19:31.580
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were connected,</v>

4971
02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:32.121
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>

4972
02:19:32.121 --> 02:19:35.330
<v Speaker 3>They just all taking place in the same time period and it's called the old west</v>

4973
02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.180
<v Speaker 8>and the end pretty similar late.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Go into it.</v>

4976
02:19:40.681 --> 02:19:42.060
<v Speaker 8>I would highly recommend it,</v>

4977
02:19:42.061 --> 02:19:45.300
<v Speaker 8>but go into it knowing it's going to be fucking dark.</v>

4978
02:19:45.301 --> 02:19:46.200
<v Speaker 8>You've got to go there.</v>

4979
02:19:46.650 --> 02:19:47.483
<v Speaker 8>Just accept it.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I don't want to spoil it.</v>

4996
02:20:06.171 --> 02:20:06.680
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to spoil it,</v>

4997
02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:07.320
<v Speaker 8>but now it's,</v>

5001
02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:10.280
<v Speaker 8>but at the end of it I was like,</v>

5002
02:20:10.281 --> 02:20:11.600
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck did I just watch?</v>

5003
02:20:11.601 --> 02:20:12.434
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5004
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:14.800
<v Speaker 8>Did you ever watch the deadwood?</v>

5005
02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:16.460
<v Speaker 8>They live on Hbo.</v>

5006
02:20:16.461 --> 02:20:17.091
<v Speaker 8>I never did.</v>

5007
02:20:17.091 --> 02:20:17.930
<v Speaker 8>I never saw that</v>

5008
02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:18.640
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

5009
02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:22.730
<v Speaker 3>the thing about deadwood is I watched it once and they were swearing so much</v>

5010
02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:24.740
<v Speaker 3>that my bullshit alarm went off.</v>

5011
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:25.970
<v Speaker 3>That's why I stopped watching.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5013

5014
02:20:26.931 --> 02:20:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people talk like that back then.</v>

5015
02:20:28.761 --> 02:20:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5016
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:32.840
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't talk like that in the 50s and the 60s see like the trend</v>

5017
02:20:32.841 --> 02:20:33.674
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make sense.</v>

5018
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:36.650
<v Speaker 3>If people talked like that in the wild west,</v>

5019
02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:38.290
<v Speaker 3>then what?</v>

5020
02:20:38.291 --> 02:20:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Where did that go?</v>

5021
02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:40.101
<v Speaker 3>Where'd that go?</v>

5022
02:20:40.101 --> 02:20:41.390
<v Speaker 3>That all went into the ether,</v>

5023
02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:42.350
<v Speaker 3>like they had kids,</v>

5024
02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:43.670
<v Speaker 3>they raised their children.</v>

5025
02:20:43.671 --> 02:20:47.510
<v Speaker 3>The children are around this kind of language and somehow or another it escaped</v>

5026
02:20:47.511 --> 02:20:48.740
<v Speaker 3>and it went away and it stopped.</v>

5027
02:20:48.741 --> 02:20:49.760
<v Speaker 3>That's not how the world works.</v>

5028
02:20:49.761 --> 02:20:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5029
02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:51.290
<v Speaker 3>The world doesn't work that way.</v>

5030
02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:55.670
<v Speaker 3>The world works in the way that like you slowly introduced fucked up words and</v>

5031
02:20:55.671 --> 02:20:57.620
<v Speaker 3>then they become like the word fuck.</v>

5032
02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:01.490
<v Speaker 3>If you said the word fuck on television in the 1950s,</v>

5033
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:02.990
<v Speaker 3>you would get arrested.</v>

5034
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5035
02:21:03.470 --> 02:21:04.303
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5036
02:21:04.510 --> 02:21:05.930
<v Speaker 3>How's that Pos staying on stage?</v>

5037
02:21:05.931 --> 02:21:06.710
<v Speaker 3>You get arrested,</v>

5038
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Lenny Bruce,</v>

5039
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:08.323
<v Speaker 3>George Carlin.</v>

5040
02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5041
02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:12.290
<v Speaker 3>how was it possible that that is a hundred years removed from people saying it</v>

5042
02:21:12.350 --> 02:21:14.390
<v Speaker 3>with abandoned constantly?</v>

5043
02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it.</v>

5044
02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5045
02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:21.080
<v Speaker 3>like I think a better example of what it was probably like his,</v>

5046
02:21:21.081 --> 02:21:23.450
<v Speaker 3>like gangs of New York and then it's probably more accurate.</v>

5047
02:21:23.451 --> 02:21:24.284
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5048
02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Like that was probably what people were like.</v>

5049
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.361
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5050
02:21:26.361 --> 02:21:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Then there were probably brutal as fuck,</v>

5051
02:21:28.490 --> 02:21:33.370
<v Speaker 3>but I bet they didn't swear as much as we like to think they did the deadwood</v>

5052
02:21:33.410 --> 02:21:33.541
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

5053
02:21:33.541 --> 02:21:35.150
<v Speaker 3>it was like they were using it as a,</v>

5054
02:21:37.330 --> 02:21:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe I need to go back and watch it before I talk shit.</v>

5055
02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:41.890
<v Speaker 3>But it felt like they were using it.</v>

5056
02:21:41.891 --> 02:21:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Almost like to modernize it.</v>

5057
02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5058
02:21:44.730 --> 02:21:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Well you know they were having these people talk like scallywags would talk</v>

5059
02:21:48.250 --> 02:21:48.940
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

5060
02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:49.773
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

5061
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:51.670
<v Speaker 8>They also say cursing is cultural.</v>

5062
02:21:51.671 --> 02:21:52.570
<v Speaker 8>Like if you,</v>

5063
02:21:52.571 --> 02:21:53.321
<v Speaker 8>if you're in a,</v>

5064
02:21:53.321 --> 02:21:54.154
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5065
02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:54.551
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5066
02:21:54.551 --> 02:21:59.551
<v Speaker 8>they talk about how black people curse versus how Protestants curse coffee.</v>

5067
02:22:00.810 --> 02:22:01.050
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5068
02:22:01.050 --> 02:22:01.883

5072
02:22:05.591 --> 02:22:08.920

5073
02:22:08.921 --> 02:22:11.840
<v Speaker 8>contemporary because people wouldn't have been buying if they're saying</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is</v>

5126
02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:44.251

<v Speaker 5>I think she's fucking great.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5157
02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:28.250
<v Speaker 2>This is what I did.</v>

5158
02:24:28.250 --> 02:24:28.901
<v Speaker 2>I looked up,</v>

5159
02:24:28.901 --> 02:24:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up and started with season two.</v>

5160
02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:32.830
<v Speaker 2>How you did it started with episode one,</v>

5161
02:24:32.831 --> 02:24:33.664
<v Speaker 2>season two,</v>

5162
02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:34.630
<v Speaker 2>got to episode three.</v>

5163
02:24:34.631 --> 02:24:34.901
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5164
02:24:34.901 --> 02:24:35.734
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with those?</v>

5165
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:37.930
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

5166
02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:38.111
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5167
02:24:38.111 --> 02:24:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know.</v>

5168
02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:39.493
<v Speaker 2>Somebody had to tell me.</v>

5169
02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Somebody had to tell me at the store,</v>

5170
02:24:41.170 --> 02:24:41.891
<v Speaker 2>I forget who told me.</v>

5171
02:24:41.891 --> 02:24:42.101
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5172
02:24:42.101 --> 02:24:42.934
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5173
02:24:43.090 --> 02:24:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I went back and watched the first episode of season one.</v>

5174
02:24:46.781 --> 02:24:47.021
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

5175
02:24:47.021 --> 02:24:47.441
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

5176
02:24:47.441 --> 02:24:48.274
<v Speaker 2>this is even better.</v>

5177
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:51.640
<v Speaker 2>But I thought it was good watching the first episode of season two,</v>

5178
02:24:51.641 --> 02:24:54.040
<v Speaker 2>not even knowing how she got there because I knew it was about stand up.</v>

5179
02:24:54.041 --> 02:24:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I knew she was a comic,</v>

5180
02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:57.310
<v Speaker 2>but then going back and watching it from season one,</v>

5181
02:24:57.311 --> 02:24:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5182
02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:58.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5183
02:24:58.691 --> 02:24:59.110
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5184
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5185
02:24:59.291 --> 02:25:00.190
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot,</v>

5186
02:25:00.191 --> 02:25:04.300
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of stuff about how they ha and writing on a show that's similar</v>

5187
02:25:04.301 --> 02:25:07.030
<v Speaker 5>and that it's about a comedian starting out on crashing.</v>

5188
02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:07.900
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

5189
02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:10.030
<v Speaker 5>I think they really capture,</v>

5190
02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:11.230
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5191
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:12.970
<v Speaker 5>the process of somebody brand new,</v>

5192
02:25:12.971 --> 02:25:14.680
<v Speaker 5>finding their voice on stage.</v>

5193
02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:15.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5194
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:16.103
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5195
02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:17.380
<v Speaker 5>And the manager's grade,</v>

5196
02:25:17.381 --> 02:25:18.790
<v Speaker 5>the woman that plays her manager,</v>

5197
02:25:18.970 --> 02:25:21.940
<v Speaker 5>there's always somebody like that that's in your corner that's helping you</v>

5198
02:25:21.941 --> 02:25:23.020
<v Speaker 5>develop yourself.</v>

5199
02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:24.633
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5200
02:25:24.850 --> 02:25:25.331
<v Speaker 2>and she's,</v>

5201
02:25:25.331 --> 02:25:26.770
<v Speaker 2>she's natural on stage.</v>

5202
02:25:26.771 --> 02:25:27.311
<v Speaker 2>I buy it.</v>

5203
02:25:27.311 --> 02:25:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I buy her as a standup on stage by her as being actually funny.</v>

5204
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5205
02:25:31.410 --> 02:25:33.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting seeing Lenny Bruce,</v>

5206
02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:35.050
<v Speaker 2>the guy who plays with Lenny Bruce is very good.</v>

5207
02:25:35.051 --> 02:25:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5208
02:25:35.610 --> 02:25:36.443
<v Speaker 2>Who is that guy?</v>

5209
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Who's the,</v>

5210
02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:38.913
<v Speaker 2>who's her too?</v>

5211
02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Her name and spoil or you get to see her breasts call's fantastic by the way,</v>

5212
02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Lord.</v>

5213
02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>

5214
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Thank you Jesus.</v>

5215
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I had to do a search.</v>

5216
02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Not that I want to sound like,</v>

5217
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:53.911
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

5218
02:25:53.911 --> 02:25:55.220
<v Speaker 2>I did a search on her news.</v>

5219
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:56.063
<v Speaker 2>Just let it go.</v>

5220
02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I did a thing on her nude and</v>

5221
02:25:59.360 --> 02:25:59.760
<v Speaker 2>proud.</v>

5222
02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Put it up.</v>

5223
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:02.970
<v Speaker 2>So you go for that.</v>

5224
02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5225
02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:04.313
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5226
02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:04.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5227
02:26:04.831 --> 02:26:09.831
<v Speaker 2>Rachel Brosnahan and I'm Mike [inaudible] and agile nasal.</v>

5228
02:26:10.261 --> 02:26:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

5229
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:11.670
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5230
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:12.391
<v Speaker 2>who is,</v>

5231
02:26:12.391 --> 02:26:13.224
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5232
02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:15.300
<v Speaker 2>who's playing Lenny Bruce?</v>

5233
02:26:16.930 --> 02:26:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Is that the guy?</v>

5234
02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Luke Kirby.</v>

5235
02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:18.791
<v Speaker 2>Luke Kirby.</v>

5236
02:26:18.791 --> 02:26:19.624
<v Speaker 2>Luke Kirby.</v>

5237
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:21.063
<v Speaker 2>Outstanding.</v>

5238
02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:21.941
<v Speaker 2>He did a great job.</v>

5239
02:26:21.941 --> 02:26:22.051
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5240
02:26:22.051 --> 02:26:23.220
<v Speaker 2>he sounded like,</v>

5241
02:26:23.221 --> 02:26:23.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5242
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5243
02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:24.460
<v Speaker 2>he sounds,</v>

5244
02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:26.890
<v Speaker 2>without doing an obvious impression,</v>

5245
02:26:27.370 --> 02:26:29.860
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like it's got the tone right.</v>

5246
02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:30.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5247
02:26:30.001 --> 02:26:31.180
<v Speaker 2>He's got the inflection,</v>

5248
02:26:31.181 --> 02:26:31.840
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5249
02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:33.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not overly stylized.</v>

5250
02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:33.911
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5251
02:26:33.911 --> 02:26:34.211
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5252
02:26:34.211 --> 02:26:34.421
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5253
02:26:34.421 --> 02:26:34.580
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5254
02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:35.740
<v Speaker 2>and that you believe it.</v>

5255
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:36.450
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5256
02:26:36.450 --> 02:26:36.820
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

5257
02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:37.180
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

5258
02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:41.110
<v Speaker 2>he did a great job of like seeming like a guy doing standup in front of a room.</v>

5259
02:26:41.111 --> 02:26:43.810
<v Speaker 2>People not like an actor playing a stand up.</v>

5260
02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:44.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5261
02:26:44.321 --> 02:26:46.060
<v Speaker 2>the woman that created the show,</v>

5262
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:49.480
<v Speaker 2>apparently her dad was a standup and he knew Lenny Bruce,</v>

5263
02:26:49.481 --> 02:26:53.470
<v Speaker 2>which is why she put him in the series because he's the only historical figure</v>

5264
02:26:53.471 --> 02:26:54.240
<v Speaker 2>in the shell.</v>

5265
02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5266
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:55.450
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5267
02:26:55.450 --> 02:26:55.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5268
02:26:55.601 --> 02:26:55.721
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5269
02:26:55.721 --> 02:26:56.650
<v Speaker 2>it's also the show.</v>

5270
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:58.570
<v Speaker 2>They take some liberties with a history.</v>

5271
02:26:58.810 --> 02:26:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Like there was,</v>

5272
02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was a comedy club back then,</v>

5273
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5274
02:27:02.531 --> 02:27:03.430
<v Speaker 2>this gas light,</v>

5275
02:27:03.431 --> 02:27:04.010
<v Speaker 2>they called it.</v>

5276
02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:04.620
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5277
02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that was real.</v>

5278
02:27:05.890 --> 02:27:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there really was a comedy club back then.</v>

5279
02:27:07.961 --> 02:27:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I think back then people were just doing poetry nights and they were doing,</v>

5280
02:27:12.810 --> 02:27:13.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5281
02:27:13.111 --> 02:27:15.460
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like a musician than a comedian.</v>

5282
02:27:15.461 --> 02:27:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Comedians would host things.</v>

5283
02:27:16.681 --> 02:27:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5284
02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was necessarily a comedy club.</v>

5285
02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5286
02:27:20.930 --> 02:27:22.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that came later.</v>

5287
02:27:22.390 --> 02:27:22.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5288
02:27:22.601 --> 02:27:26.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like catch a rising star came out of being a cabaret and you know,</v>

5289
02:27:26.081 --> 02:27:29.710
<v Speaker 2>people would sing there and then suddenly people started doing stand up there</v>

5290
02:27:29.711 --> 02:27:33.680
<v Speaker 2>and the two existed together for years before it became a comedy club.</v>

5291
02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:34.533
<v Speaker 2>We should,</v>

5292
02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:36.220
<v Speaker 2>we should actually know this.</v>

5293
02:27:36.221 --> 02:27:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Why do we not know what was the very first comedy club?</v>

5294
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Well it was a catch.</v>

5295
02:27:41.050 --> 02:27:43.540
<v Speaker 2>There was the hungry eye in San Francisco.</v>

5296
02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Is that the first night and is the 60s though?</v>

5297
02:27:46.130 --> 02:27:46.761
<v Speaker 2>Was that when it's done?</v>

5298
02:27:46.761 --> 02:27:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5299
02:27:47.470 --> 02:27:49.570
<v Speaker 2>that was the 60s because the ice house,</v>

5300
02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:50.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5301
02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:54.550
<v Speaker 2>is the oldest running comedy club in the world.</v>

5302
02:27:54.730 --> 02:27:55.750
<v Speaker 2>The ice was the oldest.</v>

5303
02:27:55.751 --> 02:27:58.150
<v Speaker 2>All the other old ones are gone except the ice house.</v>

5304
02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:01.510
<v Speaker 2>And the comedy and Magic Club is right on its heels.</v>

5305
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5306
02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:02.440
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5307
02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:03.430
<v Speaker 2>that's probably second.</v>

5308
02:28:04.210 --> 02:28:05.620
<v Speaker 2>But what was the,</v>

5309
02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:09.880
<v Speaker 2>well that place is called The gas light and I think there was a gas light.</v>

5310
02:28:09.980 --> 02:28:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a comedy club though.</v>

5311
02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:12.821
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they,</v>

5312
02:28:12.821 --> 02:28:13.750
<v Speaker 2>the way they did it,</v>

5313
02:28:13.751 --> 02:28:14.770
<v Speaker 2>which was great.</v>

5314
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.431
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

5315
02:28:15.431 --> 02:28:16.264
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give,</v>

5316
02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:17.260
<v Speaker 2>give too much of it away,</v>

5317
02:28:17.261 --> 02:28:19.660
<v Speaker 2>but the way they did it where like people were getting bumped,</v>

5318
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:21.010
<v Speaker 2>like she got bumped.</v>

5319
02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5320
02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:21.621
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5321
02:28:21.621 --> 02:28:26.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that was what guys did where they ran around doing 15 minutes</v>

5322
02:28:26.601 --> 02:28:29.150
<v Speaker 2>and go from one club to another the way in New York comics do it now.</v>

5323
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:30.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's real.</v>

5324
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:31.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5325
02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:33.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's a nit picky thing.</v>

5326
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:35.210
<v Speaker 2>That's more,</v>

5327
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:36.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5328
02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:39.530
<v Speaker 2>it's more indicative I think of how people do it today.</v>

5329
02:28:40.810 --> 02:28:41.210
<v Speaker 2>You'd like,</v>

5330
02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:41.960
<v Speaker 2>do you think they were,</v>

5331
02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:42.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5332
02:28:42.231 --> 02:28:43.064
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows?</v>

5333
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they had a drop in back then and maybe they did have nights,</v>

5334
02:28:46.310 --> 02:28:48.380
<v Speaker 2>like several nights where they had just comedy.</v>

5335
02:28:48.470 --> 02:28:49.190
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5336
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:52.910
<v Speaker 8>This is booked by a cliff nest off about the history of comedy.</v>

5337
02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:53.570
<v Speaker 8>You ever read that?</v>

5338
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:54.200
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5339
02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:54.960
<v Speaker 8>he's great.</v>

5340
02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:55.793
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

5341
02:28:56.450 --> 02:28:57.021
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>

5342
02:28:57.021 --> 02:28:57.854
<v Speaker 8>but it's cliff,</v>

5343
02:28:58.050 --> 02:28:58.520
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5344
02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:00.050
<v Speaker 8>any s t e r o.</v>

5345
02:29:00.051 --> 02:29:01.310
<v Speaker 8>V and A.</v>

5346
02:29:01.311 --> 02:29:02.930
<v Speaker 8>I had him on my podcast a couple of times.</v>

5347
02:29:02.931 --> 02:29:03.471
<v Speaker 8>He's great.</v>

5348
02:29:03.471 --> 02:29:04.300
<v Speaker 8>But they,</v>

5349
02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:06.810
<v Speaker 8>the real first comedy shows in New York were,</v>

5350
02:29:06.811 --> 02:29:07.500
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5351
02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:08.333
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5352
02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:09.620
<v Speaker 8>the Comedians,</v>

5353
02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:10.461
<v Speaker 2>drunks,</v>

5354
02:29:10.461 --> 02:29:10.791
<v Speaker 2>thieves,</v>

5355
02:29:10.791 --> 02:29:11.361
<v Speaker 2>scoundrels,</v>

5356
02:29:11.361 --> 02:29:12.860
<v Speaker 2>and the history of American comedy.</v>

5357
02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5358
02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:16.880
<v Speaker 2>did you find anything about the oldest or the first standup comedy club?</v>

5359
02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:21.420
<v Speaker 8>Arguably in the United Kingdom in 1979,</v>

5360
02:29:21.421 --> 02:29:22.320
<v Speaker 8>it was the comedy store.</v>

5361
02:29:22.321 --> 02:29:26.250
<v Speaker 8>And before that there were just performing English motherfucker got ahold of</v>

5362
02:29:26.251 --> 02:29:27.084
<v Speaker 8>Wikipedia.</v>

5363
02:29:28.170 --> 02:29:30.570
<v Speaker 8>That's just started in United Kingdom and the United States history,</v>

5364
02:29:30.571 --> 02:29:32.970
<v Speaker 8>it goes back into the 19th century and Vaudeville places.</v>

5365
02:29:32.971 --> 02:29:36.300
<v Speaker 8>And so it just depends on when somebody first turned their venue.</v>

5366
02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:39.780
<v Speaker 8>But what I'm saying is who called who was,</v>

5367
02:29:39.781 --> 02:29:41.940
<v Speaker 8>who had the very serious comedy club?</v>

5368
02:29:42.030 --> 02:29:42.251
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5369
02:29:42.251 --> 02:29:42.570
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

5370
02:29:42.570 --> 02:29:44.490
<v Speaker 8>the Hungary I San Francisco.</v>

5371
02:29:44.700 --> 02:29:45.060
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5372
02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:45.661
<v Speaker 8>So the hungry,</v>

5373
02:29:45.661 --> 02:29:47.640
<v Speaker 8>I was a 100% comedy club.</v>

5374
02:29:47.820 --> 02:29:48.240
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5375
02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:49.230
<v Speaker 8>And then the bitter end,</v>

5376
02:29:49.231 --> 02:29:53.280
<v Speaker 8>which was music and comedy interesting in New York.</v>

5377
02:29:53.850 --> 02:29:54.720
<v Speaker 2>So those are the ones in,</v>

5378
02:29:54.721 --> 02:29:55.554
<v Speaker 2>what year is that?</v>

5379
02:29:56.390 --> 02:29:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's just says in the 50s into the 60s it doesn't have this particular year.</v>

5380
02:29:59.761 --> 02:30:00.594
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5381

02:30:03.330 --> 02:30:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I think Mort Saul still around Google that</v>

5383
02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:07.453
<v Speaker 8>I think he is.</v>

5384
02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:08.900
<v Speaker 8>I think he's still doing standup.</v>

5385
02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:09.760
<v Speaker 8>I think Dick [inaudible],</v>

5386
02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:10.690
<v Speaker 8>Dick Gregory's around.</v>

5387
02:30:10.691 --> 02:30:10.990
<v Speaker 8>See,</v>

5388
02:30:10.990 --> 02:30:12.170
<v Speaker 8>I think Dick Gregory died.</v>

5389
02:30:12.410 --> 02:30:12.531
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

5390
02:30:12.531 --> 02:30:13.090
<v Speaker 8>he did?</v>

5391
02:30:13.090 --> 02:30:13.923
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

5392
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Find out that first cause I'm a dick,</v>

5393
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I say died and he didn't.</v>

5394
02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:19.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5395
02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:20.373

<v Speaker 2>he died.</v>

5401
02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:28.260
<v Speaker 8>But I think Lenny Bruce might've started at the hungry eye as well.</v>

5402
02:30:28.261 --> 02:30:29.760
<v Speaker 8>I think he started in San Francisco.</v>

5403
02:30:29.930 --> 02:30:30.763
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5417
02:30:47.001 --> 02:30:48.710
<v Speaker 2>all these guys were the originators.</v>

5418
02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5419
02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:50.360
<v Speaker 2>without them.</v>

5420
02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:51.051
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

5421
02:30:51.051 --> 02:30:54.200
<v Speaker 2>this is the original roots of the tree of standup comedy.</v>

5422
02:30:54.660 --> 02:30:55.880
<v Speaker 2>100% right.</v>

5423
02:30:55.970 --> 02:30:56.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:04.270
<v Speaker 2>going back.</v>

5426
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:07.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy history.</v>

5427
02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:12.700
<v Speaker 2>You really stop and think about the year it starts in the 60s and that before</v>

5428
02:31:13.191 --> 02:31:15.470
<v Speaker 2>that it didn't exist like that.</v>

5429
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Like it was kind of a thing that people did.</v>

5430
02:31:17.121 --> 02:31:18.080
<v Speaker 2>There was court jesters,</v>

5431
02:31:18.081 --> 02:31:19.130
<v Speaker 2>there was funny people,</v>

5432
02:31:19.350 --> 02:31:22.650
<v Speaker 2>there was comedy in various plays and musicals.</v>

5433
02:31:22.651 --> 02:31:24.120
<v Speaker 2>There was comp comedic elements.</v>

5434
02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:25.320
<v Speaker 2>But this cabaret,</v>

5435
02:31:25.410 --> 02:31:26.243
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5436
02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:28.650
<v Speaker 2>And there was MCS people would mc things.</v>

5437
02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:33.860
<v Speaker 2>But in terms of like someone going specifically to see someone say things in a</v>

5438
02:31:34.261 --> 02:31:34.891
<v Speaker 2>funny way,</v>

5439
02:31:34.891 --> 02:31:36.360
<v Speaker 2>just talking in front of a microphone.</v>

5440
02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:38.640
<v Speaker 2>That is really recent.</v>

5441
02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5442
02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:40.243
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5443
02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:43.080
<v Speaker 2>now imagine if we were born a hundred years ago.</v>

5444
02:31:43.081 --> 02:31:44.400
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck would we do?</v>

5445
02:31:46.410 --> 02:31:46.651

5485
02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:54.240
<v Speaker 2>So you got to keep an eye on it.</v>

5486
02:32:54.241 --> 02:32:56.130
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to launch anybody to the parking lot.</v>

5487
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.541
<v Speaker 2>And if you do,</v>

5488
02:32:57.541 --> 02:32:59.380
<v Speaker 2>you just pack up and move to the next town.</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5494
02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:10.950
<v Speaker 2>it was very Jewish because Jews were having a hard time getting hired.</v>

5495
02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:13.080
<v Speaker 2>And so that was one of the few places they could work.</v>

5496
02:33:13.081 --> 02:33:16.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they say comedy was a very Jewish thing.</v>

5497
02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:17.551
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:40.990
<v Speaker 2>dining room at the haunted mansion,</v>

5591
02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Disneyland and all seen where you fly by and you're,</v>

5592
02:35:44.110 --> 02:35:46.910
<v Speaker 2>you're on the little train and you pass by and all the ghosts are dancing</v>

5593
02:35:46.911 --> 02:35:47.150
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

5594
02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:47.401
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

5595
02:35:47.401 --> 02:35:48.020
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>

5596
02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:48.853
<v Speaker 2>It looks just like that.</v>

5597
02:35:49.330 --> 02:35:49.870
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5598
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:50.770
<v Speaker 5>and then it was a zoo.</v>

5599
02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:52.750
<v Speaker 5>All the grounds where a zoo at Hearst castle,</v>

5600
02:35:52.751 --> 02:35:55.420
<v Speaker 5>there was fucking giraffes running around zebras.</v>

5601
02:35:55.750 --> 02:35:57.010
<v Speaker 5>He's like El Chapo.</v>

5602
02:35:57.370 --> 02:35:59.290
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't get rid of his money.</v>

5603
02:35:59.470 --> 02:36:00.970
<v Speaker 5>He has so much fucking money.</v>

5604
02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:02.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a shit image of it.</v>

5605
02:36:02.930 --> 02:36:03.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a good image of it.</v>

5606
02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:05.393
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

5607
02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:06.293
<v Speaker 9>all right.</v>

5608
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:08.343
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

5609
02:36:10.030 --> 02:36:10.960
<v Speaker 2>how's that possible?</v>

5610
02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:12.830
<v Speaker 2>That really supposed to take pictures in there.</v>

5611
02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:13.460
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

5612
02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:14.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

5613
02:36:14.610 --> 02:36:15.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5614
02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:16.031
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5615
02:36:16.031 --> 02:36:16.481
<v Speaker 2>So everybody,</v>

5616
02:36:16.481 --> 02:36:17.620
<v Speaker 2>but everybody does.</v>

5617
02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:19.900
<v Speaker 2>People are always taking pictures of shit.</v>

5618
02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:21.940
<v Speaker 2>You'd take pictures of your kids in there</v>

5619
02:36:23.470 --> 02:36:24.010
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

5620
02:36:24.010 --> 02:36:25.090
<v Speaker 2>It looks real similar to that.</v>

5621
02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:25.901
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

5622
02:36:25.901 --> 02:36:28.030
<v Speaker 2>that guy had way too much money.</v>

5623
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:29.710
<v Speaker 2>He brought over wild boars.</v>

5624
02:36:29.711 --> 02:36:32.320
<v Speaker 2>He's the reason why California has a wild pig problem.</v>

5625
02:36:32.350 --> 02:36:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

5626
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5627
02:36:33.730 --> 02:36:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5628
02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Him that Fuck God damn.</v>

5629
02:36:36.881 --> 02:36:37.714
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5630
02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Wild boars and they didn't,</v>

5631
02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:39.910
<v Speaker 2>they'd go hunt them.</v>

5632
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:40.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5633
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.943
<v Speaker 2>he brought them here.</v>

5634
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5635
02:36:42.610 --> 02:36:43.780
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's a whole like,</v>

5636
02:36:43.810 --> 02:36:45.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not down here.</v>

5637
02:36:45.390 --> 02:36:46.900
<v Speaker 2>So he's not in southern California.</v>

5638
02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:47.913
<v Speaker 2>They're all up there.</v>

5639
02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5640
02:36:48.470 --> 02:36:48.640
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

5641
02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:50.320
<v Speaker 2>they're slowly making their way down here.</v>

5642
02:36:50.890 --> 02:36:52.360
<v Speaker 2>But the ones that are down here,</v>

5643
02:36:52.361 --> 02:36:56.080
<v Speaker 2>the closest they are is to hone ranch to hone ranches,</v>

5644
02:36:56.081 --> 02:36:56.251
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5645
02:36:56.251 --> 02:36:57.610
<v Speaker 2>about an hour and a half from here.</v>

5646
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:58.430
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5647
02:36:58.430 --> 02:36:59.263
<v Speaker 2>they have wild pig.</v>

5648
02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:02.930
<v Speaker 5>Is it that hard to just get a bunch of guys with AK 47 [inaudible] and hunt him</v>

5649
02:37:02.931 --> 02:37:03.764
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

5650
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Stop that hard.</v>

5651
02:37:04.771 --> 02:37:06.210
<v Speaker 2>But you can't do that in California,</v>

5652
02:37:06.690 --> 02:37:07.231
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

5653
02:37:07.231 --> 02:37:11.070
<v Speaker 2>You can get depredation permits and they have gotten depredation permits and</v>

5654
02:37:11.071 --> 02:37:14.550
<v Speaker 2>they hunt them at night with night vision because sometimes the pigs will start</v>

5655
02:37:14.551 --> 02:37:15.950
<v Speaker 2>making their way into agriculture</v>

5656
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:18.160
<v Speaker 7>or they start making their way into the,</v>

5657
02:37:18.170 --> 02:37:22.190
<v Speaker 7>like Dell lay down some fresh sod and put some grass down and these pigs will</v>

5658
02:37:22.191 --> 02:37:25.580
<v Speaker 7>destroy thousands of dollars in landscaping damage.</v>

5659
02:37:25.581 --> 02:37:26.240
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

5660
02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:28.040
<v Speaker 7>when they prove that that's happening,</v>

5661
02:37:28.041 --> 02:37:31.730
<v Speaker 7>then they get a special permit and then they can just start whacking.</v>

5662
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:32.330
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5663
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:35.600
<v Speaker 7>And then they just take out like everything at night and they do it with,</v>

5664
02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:36.530
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5665
02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:37.760
<v Speaker 7>sniper rifles and shit.</v>

5666
02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:39.980
<v Speaker 7>But then when I'm,</v>

5667
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:43.820
<v Speaker 7>a normal person wants to like say if you wanted to kill a wild pig,</v>

5668
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:46.730
<v Speaker 7>you can get as many licenses as you'd like.</v>

5669
02:37:46.970 --> 02:37:48.410
<v Speaker 7>You can get five licenses,</v>

5670
02:37:48.411 --> 02:37:51.410
<v Speaker 7>you can get six so you can go out and shoot six pigs in a day.</v>

5671
02:37:51.411 --> 02:37:52.640
<v Speaker 7>It's totally legal,</v>

5672
02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:55.840
<v Speaker 7>so long as you pay for each individual tag because the,</v>

5673
02:37:56.100 --> 02:37:57.530
<v Speaker 7>the understanding is that it,</v>

5674
02:37:57.531 --> 02:37:58.910
<v Speaker 7>at least in most places,</v>

5675
02:37:58.911 --> 02:38:01.730
<v Speaker 7>California's the only place that treats it like game and most places you don't</v>

5676
02:38:01.731 --> 02:38:03.200
<v Speaker 7>even have to have tags for them.</v>

5677
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:06.800
<v Speaker 7>Most places they're encouraging you to shoot him and that'll probably be the</v>

5678
02:38:06.801 --> 02:38:08.360
<v Speaker 7>case in California eventually.</v>

5679
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:09.980
<v Speaker 7>Like it isn't like Texas,</v>

5680
02:38:09.981 --> 02:38:10.940
<v Speaker 7>France for instance.</v>

5681
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.300
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

5682
02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:14.330
<v Speaker 7>Texas has a real pig problem if they have a giant,</v>

5683
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:15.380
<v Speaker 7>oh shit,</v>

5684
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:17.540
<v Speaker 7>there's millions and millions and millions of pigs.</v>

5685
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:17.841
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

5686
02:38:17.841 --> 02:38:20.720
<v Speaker 7>I remember that from the Friday night late show at the Improv and Houston.</v>

5687
02:38:24.570 --> 02:38:26.090
<v Speaker 7>You said that with,</v>

5688
02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:29.960
<v Speaker 7>you really had me believing that you didn't believe it and you're setting up the</v>

5689
02:38:29.961 --> 02:38:30.860
<v Speaker 7>joke the whole time.</v>

5690
02:38:30.890 --> 02:38:31.520
<v Speaker 7>It's nice.</v>

5691
02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:33.350
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like that with alligators in Florida.</v>

5692
02:38:33.740 --> 02:38:34.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5693
02:38:34.310 --> 02:38:34.941
<v Speaker 7>When I was a kid,</v>

5694
02:38:34.941 --> 02:38:36.860
<v Speaker 7>they were an endangered species.</v>

5695
02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:40.160
<v Speaker 7>They would ask us to please not feed the marshmallows because I lived in</v>

5696
02:38:40.161 --> 02:38:40.994
<v Speaker 7>Gainesville.</v>

5697
02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:41.391
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>

5698
02:38:41.391 --> 02:38:42.710
<v Speaker 7>By this place called Lake Alice.</v>

5699
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:43.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5700
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.520
<v Speaker 7>Lake Alice.</v>

5701
02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:46.520
<v Speaker 7>At alligators fucking 11 years old.</v>

5702
02:38:46.521 --> 02:38:46.611
<v Speaker 7>I was,</v>

5703
02:38:46.611 --> 02:38:48.310
<v Speaker 7>I was in an alligator's was crazy.</v>

5704
02:38:48.311 --> 02:38:48.760
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5705
02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:49.970
<v Speaker 7>it was a goddamn dinosaur.</v>

5706
02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:53.690
<v Speaker 7>But there was a small population of them cause they had been whacked into</v>

5707
02:38:53.691 --> 02:38:56.030
<v Speaker 7>oblivion before and people are making suitcases out of them.</v>

5708
02:38:56.330 --> 02:38:59.810
<v Speaker 7>And then they made it illegal to hunt them and they made him a protected</v>

5709
02:38:59.811 --> 02:39:00.231
<v Speaker 7>species.</v>

5710
02:39:00.231 --> 02:39:01.610
<v Speaker 7>But then they fucked up.</v>

5711
02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:05.240
<v Speaker 7>They overprotected and those God damn super lizards are everywhere.</v>

5712
02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:06.990
<v Speaker 4>Fucking everywhere.</v>

5713
02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:12.300
<v Speaker 4>My mom belongs to a golf course down in Florida where she lives and there's this</v>

5714
02:39:12.301 --> 02:39:15.840
<v Speaker 4>alligator's apparently like this fucking 14 foot alligator.</v>

5715
02:39:15.930 --> 02:39:16.763
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

5716
02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:19.920
<v Speaker 4>that people were playing golf and there was a deer and everybody's on the,</v>

5717
02:39:19.930 --> 02:39:21.180
<v Speaker 4>everybody's standing there going like,</v>

5718
02:39:21.330 --> 02:39:22.060
<v Speaker 4>it's a deer.</v>

5719
02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:22.893
<v Speaker 4>It's a deer.</v>

5720
02:39:23.010 --> 02:39:23.401
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

5721
02:39:23.401 --> 02:39:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

5722
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:25.290
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking alligator,</v>

5723
02:39:25.291 --> 02:39:25.801
<v Speaker 4>comes out,</v>

5724
02:39:25.801 --> 02:39:26.640
<v Speaker 4>grabs it,</v>

5725
02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:28.230
<v Speaker 4>pulls it into the water,</v>

5726
02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:29.760
<v Speaker 4>does that spin move?</v>

5727
02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Takes it to the bottom.</v>

5728
02:39:31.591 --> 02:39:32.670
<v Speaker 4>Fucking done.</v>

5729
02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:35.220
<v Speaker 4>So everyone's talking about it.</v>

5730
02:39:35.221 --> 02:39:36.180
<v Speaker 4>What do we do about it?</v>

5731
02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:39.120
<v Speaker 4>So about three weeks later,</v>

5732
02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:43.530
<v Speaker 4>my mom is out on the course and her ball is right next to the lake where the</v>

5733
02:39:43.531 --> 02:39:48.531
<v Speaker 4>alligator is and she forgets and she goes over and her ball is right on the edge</v>

5734
02:39:49.081 --> 02:39:53.250
<v Speaker 4>and she's standing there and she was standing on some fucking like dead,</v>

5735
02:39:53.550 --> 02:39:58.550
<v Speaker 4>some dead grass and it gave out and she fell in the fucking lake up to her neck.</v>

5736
02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:06.080
<v Speaker 4>And then she remembered and she fucking started scrambling up the mud and</v>

5737
02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:09.090
<v Speaker 4>grabbing if the reeds to get out of there.</v>

5738
02:40:09.091 --> 02:40:11.850
<v Speaker 4>And her and the people that who she was with had left,</v>

5739
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 4>she was by herself for</v>

5740
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:18.060
<v Speaker 8>some reason and she fucking got out of there and got in the cart and,</v>

5741
02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:19.500
<v Speaker 8>and then she just started laughing.</v>

5742
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:20.663
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

5743
02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:23.310
<v Speaker 8>You believe that shit.</v>

5744
02:40:23.430 --> 02:40:24.390
<v Speaker 8>My little mother,</v>

5745
02:40:24.391 --> 02:40:26.130

<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5753
02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:39.990
<v Speaker 8>Corn Fed.</v>

5754
02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:42.391
<v Speaker 8>My mom's corn fed.</v>

5755
02:40:42.391 --> 02:40:43.224
<v Speaker 8>I never told you that.</v>

5756
02:40:43.420 --> 02:40:43.660
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5757
02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:44.190
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5758
02:40:44.190 --> 02:40:45.840
<v Speaker 8>I thought she was organic now.</v>

5759
02:40:45.841 --> 02:40:46.110
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5760
02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:47.160
<v Speaker 8>we let her free range.</v>

5761
02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:48.113
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes</v>

5762
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:51.610
<v Speaker 7>there's a great story about a car chase.</v>

5763
02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:56.470
<v Speaker 7>The cops were chasing this too was stolen car and the guy jumps off a bridge</v>

5764
02:40:56.530 --> 02:40:59.200
<v Speaker 7>into the water and immediately gets eaten by alligators.</v>

5765
02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:00.600
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

5766
02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:03.010
<v Speaker 7>He's like a little overpass over river,</v>

5767
02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:05.320
<v Speaker 7>which is hops out of the fucking car,</v>

5768
02:41:05.321 --> 02:41:07.720
<v Speaker 7>jumps into the river and smash.</v>

5769
02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:10.300
<v Speaker 7>He lands right in front of an alligator.</v>

5770
02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:13.240
<v Speaker 7>No Sheldon Jackson in front of the cops.</v>

5771
02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.880
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

5772
02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:16.993
<v Speaker 8>What do you do</v>

5773
02:41:17.060 --> 02:41:17.691
<v Speaker 7>of your cop?</v>

5774
02:41:17.691 --> 02:41:18.950
<v Speaker 7>Do you shoot at the alligator?</v>

5775
02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:20.900
<v Speaker 7>Do you try to kill the alligator was killing the guy.</v>

5776
02:41:20.930 --> 02:41:21.620
<v Speaker 7>Good point.</v>

5777
02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:21.861
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

5778
02:41:21.861 --> 02:41:25.010
<v Speaker 7>that's a reckless thing to be doing when there's a lot of thrashing around you</v>

5779
02:41:25.011 --> 02:41:26.630
<v Speaker 7>just going to empty your clip.</v>

5780
02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:27.001
<v Speaker 7>Pat,</v>

5781
02:41:27.001 --> 02:41:27.231
<v Speaker 7>Pat,</v>

5782
02:41:27.231 --> 02:41:28.064
<v Speaker 7>pat,</v>

5783
02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:28.410
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5784
02:41:28.410 --> 02:41:28.611
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

5785
02:41:28.611 --> 02:41:31.780
<v Speaker 7>how much distance is there between the bridge and the water would right</v>

5786
02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:32.971
<v Speaker 8>do well,</v>

5787
02:41:32.971 --> 02:41:34.200
<v Speaker 8>you know the guy's going to die.</v>

5788
02:41:34.201 --> 02:41:35.034
<v Speaker 8>So I think it's,</v>

5789
02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:37.200
<v Speaker 8>I think it's a safe bet to take some shots</v>

5790
02:41:37.290 --> 02:41:37.770
<v Speaker 7>anyway.</v>

5791
02:41:37.770 --> 02:41:41.130
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a not safe bet to take some shots because if you're a cop would</v>

5792
02:41:41.131 --> 02:41:42.540
<v Speaker 7>have you hit the guy and they said,</v>

5793
02:41:42.570 --> 02:41:42.691
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

5794
02:41:42.691 --> 02:41:46.380
<v Speaker 7>you shot and trying to cover up by fucking alligators.</v>

5795
02:41:46.381 --> 02:41:47.210
<v Speaker 7>Eat them.</v>

5796
02:41:47.210 --> 02:41:48.043
<v Speaker 8>It's true.</v>

5797
02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:49.310
<v Speaker 8>You got to let the alligator eat them.</v>

5798
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:54.110
<v Speaker 8>Now go save your job here about the guy who was the guy flying a plane from</v>

5799
02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:56.220
<v Speaker 8>Florida to Cuba or,</v>

5800
02:41:56.430 --> 02:41:57.620
<v Speaker 8>or Cuba to Florida,</v>

5801
02:41:57.710 --> 02:42:02.710
<v Speaker 8>and the plain fucking went down and he survived the crash and then got eaten by</v>

5802
02:42:04.791 --> 02:42:05.624
<v Speaker 8>sharks.</v>

5803
02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:12.160
<v Speaker 8>That's so fun.</v>

5804
02:42:12.540 --> 02:42:16.100
<v Speaker 8>Is that that 20 minute period where you're floating in the water,</v>

5805
02:42:16.101 --> 02:42:18.230
<v Speaker 8>but you're thankful and you're almost giddy?</v>

5806
02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:19.250
<v Speaker 8>I did it.</v>

5807
02:42:19.250 --> 02:42:20.540
<v Speaker 8>I fucking survived.</v>

5808
02:42:20.570 --> 02:42:21.403
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

5809

02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.661
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

5812
02:42:23.661 --> 02:42:26.600
<v Speaker 7>you know that story about the World War Two boat that sank and the guys were</v>

5813
02:42:26.601 --> 02:42:29.720
<v Speaker 7>floating around at sea for several days and most of them got eaten by sharks.</v>

5814
02:42:29.810 --> 02:42:30.350
<v Speaker 7>Oof.</v>

5815
02:42:30.350 --> 02:42:33.080
<v Speaker 7>That's the store that they talk about in the beginning of jaws.</v>

5816
02:42:33.550 --> 02:42:34.383
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Spool up jaws to quick.</v>

<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

5839
02:42:56.310 --> 02:42:57.780
<v Speaker 7>Richard Dreyfus was the scientist.</v>

5840
02:42:58.050 --> 02:42:59.580
<v Speaker 7>Roy Scheider was the sheriff.</v>

5841
02:42:59.581 --> 02:43:01.170
<v Speaker 7>Richard Dreyfus was the scientist.</v>

5858
02:43:21.060 --> 02:43:23.370
<v Speaker 3>but he describes what it was like.</v>

5859
02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:23.791
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5860
02:43:23.791 --> 02:43:25.080
<v Speaker 3>that's a different shark attack.</v>

5861
02:43:25.660 --> 02:43:26.700
<v Speaker 3>So typed in World War II.</v>

5862
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:27.541
<v Speaker 3>Show the naval ship.</v>

5863
02:43:27.541 --> 02:43:27.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5864
02:43:27.691 --> 02:43:28.051

<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

5866
02:43:28.411 --> 02:43:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

5867
02:43:28.980 --> 02:43:29.551
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>

5868
02:43:29.551 --> 02:43:29.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5869
02:43:29.850 --> 02:43:31.350
<v Speaker 3>when it says worst shark attack in history,</v>

5870
02:43:31.351 --> 02:43:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking it was that story about New Jersey where the bull sharks killed</v>

5871
02:43:34.771 --> 02:43:35.604
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

5872

<v Speaker 3>Scroll back up so I can see what it says here.</v>

5873
02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:42.870
<v Speaker 3>1945 US naval ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine.</v>

5874
02:43:42.871 --> 02:43:45.450
<v Speaker 3>The ship's sinking was just the beginning of the sailors nightmare.</v>

5875
02:43:45.451 --> 02:43:45.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5876
02:43:45.631 --> 02:43:46.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the boat.</v>

5877
02:43:46.410 --> 02:43:47.243
<v Speaker 3>That's the story.</v>

5878
02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:48.270
<v Speaker 3>How many people died?</v>

5879
02:43:48.330 --> 02:43:48.571

<v Speaker 3>Shit load.</v>

5881
02:43:50.070 --> 02:43:50.903
<v Speaker 3>Let's see,</v>

5882
02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:55.980
<v Speaker 3>that's 200 and oh don't most 300 people died of the 1,196 men aboard 900 made it</v>

5883
02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:01.290
<v Speaker 3>into the water alive.</v>

5884
02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:02.153
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5885
02:44:02.270 --> 02:44:03.210
<v Speaker 3>there are a deal.</v>

5886
02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:04.620
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

5887
02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:07.170
<v Speaker 3>that's how many survived the crash.</v>

5888
02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:10.260
<v Speaker 3>So there's 900 of them that are alive now.</v>

5889
02:44:10.261 --> 02:44:11.880
<v Speaker 3>How many of them make it to the end</v>

5890
02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:17.000
<v Speaker 3>out of 900 scroll and Scroll and Scroll and Scroll up.</v>

5891
02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Data's pass.</v>

5892
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5893
02:44:18.891 --> 02:44:19.311
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

5894
02:44:19.311 --> 02:44:21.680
<v Speaker 3>they're just giving you the full line of the story that not giving you just the</v>

5895
02:44:21.681 --> 02:44:22.640
<v Speaker 3>actual facts.</v>

5896
02:44:23.350 --> 02:44:26.360
<v Speaker 3>317 317 remained.</v>

5897
02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:27.313
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

5898
02:44:28.060 --> 02:44:28.570
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5899
02:44:28.570 --> 02:44:30.850
<v Speaker 3>so almost 600 people got to eat</v>

5900
02:44:31.250 --> 02:44:34.880
<v Speaker 4>estimates of the number who die from shark attacks range from a few dozen to</v>

5901
02:44:34.881 --> 02:44:36.440
<v Speaker 4>almost 150</v>

5902
02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:38.220
<v Speaker 3>so the other people die from other things.</v>

5903
02:44:38.221 --> 02:44:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Starvation probably.</v>

5904
02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5905
02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:41.760
<v Speaker 3>heat stroke being in the water,</v>

5906
02:44:42.030 --> 02:44:42.863
<v Speaker 3>it could be a lot.</v>

5907
02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:44.850
<v Speaker 3>And so I bet when those guys died,</v>

5908
02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:46.800
<v Speaker 3>then the sharks ate them and it got even worse.</v>

5909
02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

5910
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.983
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

5911
02:44:49.050 --> 02:44:50.160
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking crazy.</v>

5912
02:44:50.161 --> 02:44:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine 150 people eaten by sharks,</v>

5913
02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:57.060
<v Speaker 3>the amount of blood in the water fucking Christ</v>

5914
02:44:59.270 --> 02:44:59.900
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

5915
02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:00.720
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

5916
02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:05.610
<v Speaker 3>But when you're around any kind of thing that can eat you and kill you,</v>

5917
02:45:05.730 --> 02:45:07.830
<v Speaker 3>it puts it all into perspective that you're not,</v>

5918
02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:09.270
<v Speaker 3>you're not around that enough.</v>

5919
02:45:09.630 --> 02:45:10.500
<v Speaker 3>And it's not,</v>

5920
02:45:10.650 --> 02:45:12.420
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you should be around it all the time,</v>

5921
02:45:12.421 --> 02:45:13.830
<v Speaker 3>but you should know it's a real thing.</v>

5922
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.970
<v Speaker 3>And when you're around it,</v>

5923
02:45:14.971 --> 02:45:15.450
<v Speaker 3>you go like,</v>

5924
02:45:15.450 --> 02:45:16.283
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5925
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:17.640
<v Speaker 3>oh sharks just,</v>

5926
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:18.720
<v Speaker 3>we'll just eat you.</v>

5927
02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5928
02:45:19.490 --> 02:45:20.670
<v Speaker 3>a bear will just eat you.</v>

5929
02:45:20.970 --> 02:45:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5930
02:45:21.570 --> 02:45:22.201
<v Speaker 3>how bout in line?</v>

5931
02:45:22.201 --> 02:45:23.034
<v Speaker 3>We'll just eat you.</v>

5932
02:45:23.310 --> 02:45:24.143
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5933
02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:26.700
<v Speaker 3>like these people that got killed this year was a,</v>

5934
02:45:26.701 --> 02:45:27.840
<v Speaker 3>or 2018 at least,</v>

5935
02:45:27.841 --> 02:45:28.674
<v Speaker 3>was very rare.</v>

5936
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:30.420
<v Speaker 3>And that two people were documented,</v>

5937
02:45:30.421 --> 02:45:32.490
<v Speaker 3>killed by mountain lions in the Pacific northwest.</v>

5938
02:45:32.700 --> 02:45:33.690
<v Speaker 3>One guy in Portland,</v>

5939
02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:34.621
<v Speaker 3>outside of Portland,</v>

5940
02:45:34.621 --> 02:45:35.790
<v Speaker 3>and one guy outside of Seattle.</v>

5941
02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:38.010
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty rare that mountain lions do that.</v>

5942
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:39.840
<v Speaker 3>But Oh,</v>

5943
02:45:40.170 --> 02:45:41.430
<v Speaker 3>mountain lions would just eat you.</v>

5944
02:45:41.910 --> 02:45:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5945
02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:43.420
<v Speaker 3>that can happen too.</v>

5946
02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Like we think we're so safe</v>

5947
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:46.690
<v Speaker 4>and I think it,</v>

5948
02:45:46.690 --> 02:45:47.251
<v Speaker 4>I think you're ready.</v>

5949
02:45:47.251 --> 02:45:48.220
<v Speaker 4>We'll keep you in the moment.</v>

5950
02:45:48.221 --> 02:45:50.430
<v Speaker 4>I think we should release like grizzly.</v>

5951
02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.040
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

5952
02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.410
<v Speaker 4>in cities just because like you might be worried about,</v>

5953
02:45:54.430 --> 02:45:54.540
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5954
02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:56.590
<v Speaker 4>am I the fucking stock market's down,</v>

5955
02:45:56.591 --> 02:45:58.000
<v Speaker 4>or I think my wife's cheating.</v>

5956
02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:00.700
<v Speaker 4>And you're right back in the,</v>

5957
02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:01.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5958
02:46:01.230 --> 02:46:02.063
<v Speaker 3>you're in the moment,</v>

5959
02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:04.500
<v Speaker 3>but then you're going to have to allow people to be armed to protect themselves.</v>

5960
02:46:04.501 --> 02:46:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Guys going to have open carry,</v>

5961
02:46:06.300 --> 02:46:09.260
<v Speaker 3>fucking ar slung around their shoulders looking out for bears everywhere.</v>

5962
02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:10.341
<v Speaker 3>Taking your kid to school,</v>

5963
02:46:10.341 --> 02:46:11.300
<v Speaker 3>you'd better bring the rifle.</v>

5964
02:46:12.890 --> 02:46:14.300
<v Speaker 3>She's only two blocks away,</v>

5965
02:46:14.750 --> 02:46:15.080
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

5966
02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Bringing the rifle.</v>

5967
02:46:15.870 --> 02:46:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I saw bear here a couple of days ago,</v>

5968
02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:17.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5969
02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Imagine you walk outside your house and you hear a branch snap and you turn and</v>

5970
02:46:21.411 --> 02:46:25.370
<v Speaker 3>you see a 900 pound wild dog like thing,</v>

5971
02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:26.750
<v Speaker 3>and that's not it.</v>

5972
02:46:26.750 --> 02:46:27.570
<v Speaker 3>That's not one shy.</v>

5973
02:46:27.570 --> 02:46:29.690
<v Speaker 3>That's gotta be a pretty good gun to take that thing down.</v>

5974
02:46:30.050 --> 02:46:32.150
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to take it out with like a nine millimeter.</v>

5975
02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5976
02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:34.040
<v Speaker 3>It's just going to eat your bullets.</v>

5977
02:46:34.050 --> 02:46:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5978
02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:35.810
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna kill you anyway.</v>

5979
02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

5980
02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:38.340
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

5981
02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:39.173
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to,</v>

5982
02:46:39.210 --> 02:46:42.960
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to have a perfect shot right in the perfect part of its brain to shut</v>

5983
02:46:42.961 --> 02:46:45.600
<v Speaker 3>it off quick to prevent you from getting mauled.</v>

5984
02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:48.380
<v Speaker 3>The amount of strength that they have to,</v>

5985
02:46:48.381 --> 02:46:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like a water balloon.</v>

5986
02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:52.220
<v Speaker 3>I feel like tearing open a bag.</v>

5987
02:46:52.250 --> 02:46:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Like a Ziploc bag full of Jello.</v>

5988
02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:55.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5989
02:46:55.310 --> 02:46:56.570
<v Speaker 3>They just rip you apart.</v>

5990
02:46:56.830 --> 02:46:58.610
<v Speaker 3>He had gone back to that movie revenant.</v>

5991
02:46:58.790 --> 02:47:01.730
<v Speaker 3>That fucking bear attack was insane.</v>

5992
02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:04.190
<v Speaker 3>My bear tags nothing compared to what really happens.</v>

5993
02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Like if he really got bit by a bear be like that,</v>

5994
02:47:07.221 --> 02:47:09.500
<v Speaker 3>like he probably would be destroyed.</v>

5995
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Like I think the guy that was the,</v>

5996
02:47:12.170 --> 02:47:14.300
<v Speaker 3>that we're really happened to them in real life.</v>

5997
02:47:14.301 --> 02:47:16.700
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of based really loosely on a story.</v>

5998
02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.060
<v Speaker 3>I think he got kind of like a little malt and that was enough.</v>

5999
02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6000
02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:24.080
<v Speaker 3>A little malt leave you like that would that bear was throwing him around for</v>

6001
02:47:24.081 --> 02:47:24.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

6002
02:47:24.330 --> 02:47:25.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6003
02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:26.090
<v Speaker 3>that bear would have killed you.</v>

6004
02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6005
02:47:26.660 --> 02:47:28.130
<v Speaker 3>You'd have no bones left.</v>

6006
02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6007
02:47:28.570 --> 02:47:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Snapped everything into a fine powder.</v>

6008
02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Just crush you and then eat you.</v>

6009
02:47:33.441 --> 02:47:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6010
02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:34.191
<v Speaker 3>I'm fuck,</v>

6011
02:47:34.191 --> 02:47:34.401
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

6012
02:47:34.401 --> 02:47:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Why not eat you?</v>

6013
02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:36.500
<v Speaker 3>Especially when she starts stinking.</v>

6014
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:37.820
<v Speaker 3>They like to bury things,</v>

6015
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:39.080
<v Speaker 3>let them rot for awhile.</v>

6016
02:47:40.580 --> 02:47:41.413
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

6017
02:47:41.420 --> 02:47:46.420
<v Speaker 3>My friend Adam and he shot a moose in Canada and a bear's claimed it and he went</v>

6018
02:47:46.971 --> 02:47:48.020
<v Speaker 3>back and there's a video of it.</v>

6019
02:47:48.021 --> 02:47:49.520
<v Speaker 3>It's so spooky.</v>

6020
02:47:49.610 --> 02:47:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

6021
02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Says buried.</v>

6022
02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:53.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant big ass moose.</v>

6023
02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:54.861
<v Speaker 3>By the time they got,</v>

6024
02:47:54.861 --> 02:47:55.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6025
02:47:55.041 --> 02:47:56.510
<v Speaker 3>they shoot it and then it goes,</v>

6026
02:47:56.570 --> 02:47:58.340
<v Speaker 3>it runs away and then you have to track it.</v>

6027
02:47:58.341 --> 02:47:59.150
<v Speaker 3>You have to let it,</v>

6028
02:47:59.150 --> 02:47:59.983
<v Speaker 3>let it die.</v>

6029
02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:00.801
<v Speaker 3>It takes a little while.</v>

6030
02:48:00.801 --> 02:48:03.980
<v Speaker 3>So the smart thing to do is to sit out for a couple hours.</v>

6031
02:48:04.310 --> 02:48:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It'll be dead for sure.</v>

6032
02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:10.160
<v Speaker 3>But what you don't want to do is spook it while it's injured.</v>

6033
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.401
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

6034
02:48:10.401 --> 02:48:11.630
<v Speaker 3>if it's not a perfect hit,</v>

6035
02:48:11.690 --> 02:48:12.590
<v Speaker 3>if it runs away,</v>

6036
02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:14.480
<v Speaker 3>because then it's gonna just keep running.</v>

6037
02:48:14.481 --> 02:48:16.130
<v Speaker 3>You can run for a long time on adrenaline.</v>

6038
02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:16.941
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

6039
02:48:16.941 --> 02:48:17.151
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6040
02:48:17.151 --> 02:48:19.790
<v Speaker 3>the correct move is if you don't see an animal die,</v>

6041
02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:20.591
<v Speaker 3>you don't see,</v>

6042
02:48:20.591 --> 02:48:21.530
<v Speaker 3>you see it run into the woods.</v>

6043
02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:25.220
<v Speaker 3>You wait and you wait just as a precautionary mother.</v>

6044
02:48:25.370 --> 02:48:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6045
02:48:25.660 --> 02:48:25.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6046
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:29.030
<v Speaker 3>the animal died in seconds and a bear claimed it immediately.</v>

6047
02:48:29.390 --> 02:48:31.160
<v Speaker 3>It died probably right in front of them.</v>

6048
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:32.180
<v Speaker 3>What state was this?</v>

6049
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:33.260
<v Speaker 3>This was in Alaska.</v>

6050
02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:36.020
<v Speaker 3>So the bear is there.</v>

6051
02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:37.490
<v Speaker 3>The Moose dies right in front of them.</v>

6052
02:48:37.491 --> 02:48:37.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

6053
02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:38.593
<v Speaker 3>oh look at that.</v>

6054
02:48:38.810 --> 02:48:39.643
<v Speaker 3>That's mine.</v>

6055
02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:40.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6056
02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:43.010
<v Speaker 3>It starts eating it and he starts covering it up.</v>

6057
02:48:43.370 --> 02:48:44.870
<v Speaker 3>So eat some of it covers it up.</v>

6058
02:48:44.871 --> 02:48:49.130
<v Speaker 3>They come tracking and an hour later or so it's already covered in dirt.</v>

6059
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

6060
02:48:50.330 --> 02:48:50.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

6061
02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:51.740
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

6062
02:48:51.770 --> 02:48:53.600
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

6063
02:48:53.660 --> 02:48:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

6064
02:48:54.980 --> 02:48:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

6065
02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6066
02:48:57.020 --> 02:48:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Fuck No.</v>

6067
02:48:58.371 --> 02:48:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

6068
02:48:59.130 --> 02:49:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Think about what would it take to take fucking frozen ground myself.</v>

6069
02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.770
<v Speaker 3>They might have shot it and taken some of the meat and we're going back to pack</v>

6070
02:49:06.771 --> 02:49:07.470
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>

6071
02:49:07.470 --> 02:49:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Cause sometimes when you hunt you'll hunt with one person,</v>

6072
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:10.391
<v Speaker 3>but when,</v>

6073
02:49:10.391 --> 02:49:12.240
<v Speaker 3>then you go back to pack out a big animal,</v>

6074
02:49:12.241 --> 02:49:14.070
<v Speaker 3>you bring like five or six guys to help you.</v>

6075
02:49:14.430 --> 02:49:15.600
<v Speaker 3>But this is the video of it.</v>

6076
02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:17.040
<v Speaker 3>They'll get this to give me some volume.</v>

6077
02:49:18.970 --> 02:49:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh Moose is very,</v>

6078
02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:27.140
<v Speaker 8>whoa,</v>

6079
02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:28.593
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

6080
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I don't like this.</v>

6081
02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:38.060
<v Speaker 3>So everything is like,</v>

6082
02:49:38.090 --> 02:49:38.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6083
02:49:38.421 --> 02:49:41.390
<v Speaker 3>five and a half feet high grass or you know,</v>

6084
02:49:41.391 --> 02:49:44.600
<v Speaker 3>you see how tall is that grass for four and a half feet at least.</v>

6085
02:49:44.670 --> 02:49:44.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6086
02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:46.580
<v Speaker 3>So bears could be in that shit.</v>

6087
02:49:47.250 --> 02:49:48.590
<v Speaker 3>They could be hunkered down in that shit.</v>

6088
02:49:48.770 --> 02:49:52.490
<v Speaker 3>So I'm seeing the skull on the ground and the skull skinned out.</v>

6089
02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:55.560
<v Speaker 3>So what that means to me is that he had already started butchering the,</v>

6090
02:49:55.580 --> 02:49:57.680
<v Speaker 3>the Moose and probably went back to it.</v>

6091
02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.480
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of correct that whether that was right about that or not,</v>

6092
02:50:02.930 --> 02:50:04.070
<v Speaker 3>but so this is what happened.</v>

6093
02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:04.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6094
02:50:04.850 --> 02:50:07.550
<v Speaker 3>they can only take some of the meat because they were terrified the bear is</v>

6095
02:50:07.551 --> 02:50:10.940
<v Speaker 3>going to come back and I don't even think they had a gun on them and you know,</v>

6096
02:50:10.941 --> 02:50:12.080
<v Speaker 3>they're just scanning the area,</v>

6097
02:50:13.130 --> 02:50:13.681
<v Speaker 3>see how the,</v>

6098
02:50:13.681 --> 02:50:13.951
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6099
02:50:13.951 --> 02:50:17.270
<v Speaker 3>the moots the head is already off of the antlers,</v>

6100
02:50:18.100 --> 02:50:18.680
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

6101
02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:20.090
<v Speaker 3>And so this is the next video.</v>

6102
02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:23.141
<v Speaker 8>That's scary shit,</v>

6103
02:50:23.141 --> 02:50:23.580
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

6104
02:50:23.580 --> 02:50:24.810
<v Speaker 8>So they didn't even see the bear.</v>

6105
02:50:24.830 --> 02:50:25.840
<v Speaker 8>They just know it was a bear.</v>

6106
02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:26.680
<v Speaker 8>Exactly.</v>

6107
02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:27.513
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

6108
02:50:28.450 --> 02:50:33.040
<v Speaker 8>Think about the strength to take frozen earth like that and dig it out.</v>

6109
02:50:33.260 --> 02:50:34.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6110
02:50:34.730 --> 02:50:35.810
<v Speaker 3>What's the type of bear,</v>

6111
02:50:36.170 --> 02:50:36.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6112
02:50:36.411 --> 02:50:37.790
<v Speaker 3>if you run into a black bear,</v>

6113
02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.010
<v Speaker 3>you're more likely to be thought of as food.</v>

6114
02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:40.933
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting,</v>

6115
02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:42.091
<v Speaker 3>like you're more like,</v>

6116
02:50:42.091 --> 02:50:46.190
<v Speaker 3>like predation on humans is more common with black bears.</v>

6117
02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:47.810
<v Speaker 3>They just decide to try to eat you.</v>

6118
02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:49.250
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

6119
02:50:49.310 --> 02:50:50.390
<v Speaker 3>with grizzlies,</v>

6120
02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:52.410
<v Speaker 3>grizzlies are rare.</v>

6121
02:50:52.430 --> 02:50:54.500
<v Speaker 3>It's rare that a grizzly decides to eat.</v>

6122
02:50:54.501 --> 02:50:56.570
<v Speaker 3>You decides to chase you down and eat you.</v>

6123
02:50:56.571 --> 02:51:01.571
<v Speaker 3>It's more common that you fuck up and run into a female or you try to steal his</v>

6124
02:51:01.851 --> 02:51:02.720
<v Speaker 3>food like that.</v>

6125
02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Like they had to get the fuck out of there because if he just decided to run at</v>

6126
02:51:05.331 --> 02:51:05.630
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

6127
02:51:05.630 --> 02:51:07.250
<v Speaker 3>they got a real giant problem.</v>

6128
02:51:07.251 --> 02:51:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time of bear won't though.</v>

6129
02:51:08.571 --> 02:51:09.231
<v Speaker 3>They're cautious.</v>

6130
02:51:09.231 --> 02:51:09.621
<v Speaker 3>They'll stay,</v>

6131
02:51:09.621 --> 02:51:11.600
<v Speaker 3>they'll hang back cause they figured what are you going to do?</v>

6132
02:51:11.601 --> 02:51:12.710
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna eat that whole Moose.</v>

6133
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:13.731
<v Speaker 3>You're going to leave me some.</v>

6134
02:51:13.731 --> 02:51:14.564
<v Speaker 3>I ate a bunch.</v>

6135
02:51:14.690 --> 02:51:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wait a little while,</v>

6136
02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:16.401
<v Speaker 3>see what the fuck you're doing.</v>

6137
02:51:16.401 --> 02:51:17.450
<v Speaker 3>He's probably full anyway,</v>

6138
02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:18.980
<v Speaker 3>but they had to get out of there.</v>

6139
02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:21.560
<v Speaker 3>They only took her a little bit of the meat and they took off like this is too</v>

6140
02:51:21.561 --> 02:51:22.210
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

6141
02:51:22.210 --> 02:51:23.043
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

6142
02:51:25.370 --> 02:51:26.350
<v Speaker 8>They used to be everywhere,</v>

6143
02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:27.750
<v Speaker 3>used to be everywhere in California.</v>

6144
02:51:27.751 --> 02:51:28.920
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's on our flag.</v>

6145
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:30.600
<v Speaker 3>We killed them all,</v>

6146
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:31.500
<v Speaker 3>not we.</v>

6147
02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:32.610
<v Speaker 3>You and I were in Boston.</v>

6148
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:32.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6149
02:51:32.881 --> 02:51:34.260
<v Speaker 3>We didn't kill anybody to kill anybody,</v>

6150
02:51:34.290 --> 02:51:36.840
<v Speaker 3>but they killed all the grizzly bears in California,</v>

6151
02:51:37.410 --> 02:51:38.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's still on under state flag.</v>

6152
02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:40.790
<v Speaker 3>The state flag hasn't a fucking grizzly bear,</v>

6153
02:51:40.791 --> 02:51:42.330
<v Speaker 3>but in California it doesn't have any grizzlies.</v>

6154
02:51:42.390 --> 02:51:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6155
02:51:43.110 --> 02:51:43.770
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

6156
02:51:43.770 --> 02:51:43.951
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

6157
02:51:43.951 --> 02:51:45.690
<v Speaker 8>I was in Alaska once and they were,</v>

6158
02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:47.370
<v Speaker 8>they were like raccoons.</v>

6159
02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:50.100
<v Speaker 8>They were behind restaurants going through dumpsters,</v>

6160
02:51:50.570 --> 02:51:51.540
<v Speaker 8>grizzly walking around,</v>

6161
02:51:51.541 --> 02:51:53.240
<v Speaker 8>or brown bears or black bears.</v>

6162
02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:54.360
<v Speaker 8>I think they were.</v>

6163
02:51:54.361 --> 02:51:54.750
<v Speaker 8>I don't want,</v>

6164
02:51:54.750 --> 02:51:55.160
<v Speaker 8>other than that,</v>

6165
02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:55.550
<v Speaker 8>both,</v>

6166
02:51:55.550 --> 02:51:56.420
<v Speaker 3>they're both up there.</v>

6167
02:51:56.510 --> 02:51:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Black bears become more,</v>

6168
02:51:57.700 --> 02:52:01.010
<v Speaker 3>will they all become a problem if they start getting around garbage cause then</v>

6169
02:52:01.011 --> 02:52:01.580
<v Speaker 3>they're smart.</v>

6170
02:52:01.580 --> 02:52:02.540
<v Speaker 3>They know where the garbage is.</v>

6171
02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:03.593
<v Speaker 3>Just keep returning.</v>

6172
02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:05.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6173
02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:06.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a place called Lovech,</v>

6174
02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:06.761
<v Speaker 2>the vet,</v>

6175
02:52:06.761 --> 02:52:07.530
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

6176
02:52:07.530 --> 02:52:11.110
<v Speaker 2>It's off the five and it's named that way for the last guy to die in a bear</v>

6177
02:52:11.111 --> 02:52:12.160
<v Speaker 2>attack in California.</v>

6178
02:52:12.250 --> 02:52:12.401
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6179
02:52:12.401 --> 02:52:12.970
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

6180
02:52:12.970 --> 02:52:13.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6181
02:52:13.810 --> 02:52:14.171
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

6182
02:52:14.171 --> 02:52:16.780
<v Speaker 2>enough he fuck enough.</v>

6183
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they wound up digging this guy up afterwards to find out the story is</v>

6184
02:52:20.141 --> 02:52:21.520
<v Speaker 2>true and he was just in pieces.</v>

6185
02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:24.393
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

6186
02:52:25.350 --> 02:52:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

6187
02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:28.160
<v Speaker 2>so coastal bear to bear,</v>

6188
02:52:28.420 --> 02:52:29.320
<v Speaker 2>bear attack,</v>

6189
02:52:29.350 --> 02:52:34.350
<v Speaker 2>shark attack or dying in a cryogenics tank dying the crow would be way less</v>

6190
02:52:35.381 --> 02:52:36.100
<v Speaker 2>painful.</v>

6191
02:52:36.100 --> 02:52:36.970
<v Speaker 2>You would just freeze.</v>

6192
02:52:37.060 --> 02:52:37.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to go.</v>

6193
02:52:38.050 --> 02:52:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the way to go though,</v>

6194
02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:41.140
<v Speaker 2>because then you're not going to get eaten.</v>

6195
02:52:41.770 --> 02:52:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Like shouldn't you return to nature?</v>

6196
02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:44.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6197
02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean you really should be eating and I would rather beat and by one of my con,</v>

6198
02:52:48.341 --> 02:52:49.480
<v Speaker 2>which is a ground animal,</v>

6199
02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:51.160
<v Speaker 2>those fucking cons in the water.</v>

6200
02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I get eaten by those heartless assholes and don't even take care of their</v>

6201
02:52:53.951 --> 02:52:54.430
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>

6202
02:52:54.430 --> 02:52:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6203
02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:55.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6204
02:52:55.361 --> 02:52:56.980
<v Speaker 2>a bear at least takes care of their young,</v>

6205
02:52:57.290 --> 02:52:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>

6206
02:52:57.760 --> 02:52:58.300
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

6207
02:52:58.300 --> 02:52:59.133
<v Speaker 2>they're shit eds.</v>

6208
02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:01.810
<v Speaker 2>They eat their babies too and especially males.</v>

6209
02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Males killed babies left and right.</v>

6210
02:53:03.521 --> 02:53:05.620
<v Speaker 2>They actually actively go after them and kill them.</v>

6211
02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:06.640
<v Speaker 2>But sort of sharks,</v>

6212
02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:07.300
<v Speaker 2>sharks,</v>

6213
02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:09.460
<v Speaker 2>sharks have inter wound competition.</v>

6214
02:53:09.970 --> 02:53:11.950
<v Speaker 2>They eat each other inside the womb.</v>

6215
02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh no shit.</v>

6216
02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6217
02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:15.880
<v Speaker 2>You ever see like a,</v>

6218
02:53:15.940 --> 02:53:17.890
<v Speaker 2>an Mri of sharks in the womb?</v>

6219
02:53:17.950 --> 02:53:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a monster movie.</v>

6220
02:53:20.830 --> 02:53:21.940
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

6221
02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:22.833
<v Speaker 2>Is that Real,</v>

6222
02:53:24.130 --> 02:53:24.790
<v Speaker 2>those images?</v>

6223
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:25.623
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

6224
02:53:25.630 --> 02:53:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I've seen those elements that I feel like it might've been from a movie,</v>

6225
02:53:28.271 --> 02:53:29.140
<v Speaker 2>but I'm looking at now,</v>

6226
02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:30.153
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

6227
02:53:30.250 --> 02:53:31.083
<v Speaker 2>I think it's real.</v>

6228
02:53:31.090 --> 02:53:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why I thought it was fake and then I found out it was real.</v>

6229
02:53:34.001 --> 02:53:36.850
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those either I thought it was real and I found out it was fake or I</v>

6230
02:53:36.851 --> 02:53:38.230
<v Speaker 2>thought it was fake and I found out it's real.</v>

6231
02:53:38.530 --> 02:53:39.363
<v Speaker 2>But the image is,</v>

6232
02:53:39.370 --> 02:53:40.091
<v Speaker 2>if it's real,</v>

6233
02:53:40.091 --> 02:53:41.200
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking amazing.</v>

6234
02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:42.880
<v Speaker 2>It's these little monsters inside,</v>

6235
02:53:42.881 --> 02:53:43.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6236
02:53:43.570 --> 02:53:44.980
<v Speaker 2>inside a womb and then you've got to think,</v>

6237
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:46.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6238
02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I guess no one had it.</v>

6239
02:53:47.141 --> 02:53:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

6240
02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Cause they just lay the eggs out in the men just,</v>

6241
02:53:49.451 --> 02:53:50.320
<v Speaker 2>just on the eggs.</v>

6242
02:53:50.860 --> 02:53:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

6243
02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:51.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6244
02:53:51.581 --> 02:53:52.270
<v Speaker 2>That's how it works.</v>

6245
02:53:52.270 --> 02:53:54.370
<v Speaker 2>They don't fuck a terrible life.</v>

6246
02:53:54.450 --> 02:53:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6247
02:53:55.320 --> 02:53:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6248
02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:57.500
<v Speaker 2>The women lay the eggs on the floor.</v>

6249
02:53:57.501 --> 02:53:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I could salmon.</v>

6250
02:53:58.180 --> 02:53:58.871
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens.</v>

6251
02:53:58.871 --> 02:53:59.860
<v Speaker 2>That happens with trout.</v>

6252
02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:03.480
<v Speaker 2>They lay the eggs out in the men come by and shoot loads all over him.</v>

6253
02:54:04.930 --> 02:54:07.120
<v Speaker 2>And then the things pop up and no one takes care of anybody.</v>

6254
02:54:07.540 --> 02:54:08.373
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6255
02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:10.950
<v Speaker 2>All those kids that grow up without parents,</v>

6256
02:54:10.970 --> 02:54:12.250
<v Speaker 2>parents don't give a fuck about them.</v>

6257
02:54:12.270 --> 02:54:13.103
<v Speaker 2>The parents will eat them.</v>

6258
02:54:13.420 --> 02:54:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

6259
02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Happens all the time with a little fish.</v>

<v Speaker 3>How come?</v>

6303
02:55:10.910 --> 02:55:12.200
<v Speaker 3>How come I don't see that.</v>

6304
02:55:12.650 --> 02:55:13.760
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking with kids.</v>

6305
02:55:13.761 --> 02:55:15.080
<v Speaker 3>You're giving kids bad information.</v>

6306
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:19.400
<v Speaker 3>That will be a great movie to do a feature late length animated movie where you</v>

6307
02:55:19.401 --> 02:55:21.020
<v Speaker 3>show how it really works.</v>

6308
02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:21.651

02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Cats are the population control of the world.</v>

6316
02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Those motherfuckers faster than everybody can only eat meat and all they do is</v>

6317
02:55:36.411 --> 02:55:38.870
<v Speaker 3>just run around and try to catch people slipping,</v>

6318
02:55:39.650 --> 02:55:41.030
<v Speaker 3>try to catch animals slipping,</v>

<v Speaker 3>tried to catch it,</v>

6320
02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:42.890

6321
02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:44.090
<v Speaker 3>they're just Darwinism.</v>

6322
02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6323
02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:45.650

<v Speaker 3>That's a bug that he just ate.</v>

6328
02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:49.941
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

6329
02:55:49.941 --> 02:55:50.271
<v Speaker 8>It was like,</v>

6330
02:55:50.271 --> 02:55:50.710
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

02:55:50.710 --> 02:55:53.720
<v Speaker 8>he met Tomato Puma and he showed them how to get grubs or something like that.</v>

6332
02:55:53.770 --> 02:55:55.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's what ends up on me.</v>

6333
02:55:55.450 --> 02:55:55.871
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

6334

<v Speaker 8>I just don't remember them showing that and that movie at all.</v>

6339
02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:12.140
<v Speaker 3>That's how they really see the problem is kids grow up and they see this stuff</v>

6340
02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:13.910
<v Speaker 3>and the soft headed amongst them.</v>

6341
02:56:14.380 --> 02:56:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Well then think that animals are really like that,</v>

6342
02:56:16.820 --> 02:56:19.460
<v Speaker 3>so they'll venture out into the forest to try to make friends.</v>

6343
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:21.800
<v Speaker 3>You just have to be open spiritually.</v>

6344
02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6347
02:56:24.530 --> 02:56:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Open yourself up spiritually and let the forest,</v>

6348
02:56:27.351 --> 02:56:28.184
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6349
02:56:28.820 --> 02:56:29.531

02:56:29.531 --> 02:56:32.840
<v Speaker 3>she was a yoga lady and she was talking about Colorado and she's like,</v>

6351

6352
02:56:33.741 --> 02:56:35.390
<v Speaker 3>I just walk out there and say,</v>

6359
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:43.910
<v Speaker 3>They'd like to see you're having your period get back in the car.</v>

6360
02:56:43.940 --> 02:56:44.151
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

6363
02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:47.210
<v Speaker 3>it's not a morality thing.</v>

6364
02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:48.800
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good or bad thing.</v>

6365
02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:50.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like something's going to get eaten.</v>

6366
02:56:50.990 --> 02:56:52.970
<v Speaker 3>If you're out there and you're the slow thing,</v>

6367
02:56:53.150 --> 02:56:54.500
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get eaten.</v>

6370
02:56:58.310 --> 02:57:00.740
<v Speaker 3>It's just Darwinism that we calf.</v>

6371
02:57:00.770 --> 02:57:00.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6372
02:57:00.891 --> 02:57:01.724
<v Speaker 3>This is not a,</v>

6373
02:57:01.950 --> 02:57:06.950
<v Speaker 3>this is not a discerning organism that's got moral value that it places on,</v>

6374
02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:08.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6375

<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

6381
02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:17.300
<v Speaker 3>they have no language.</v>

6382
02:57:17.330 --> 02:57:17.770
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>

6383
02:57:17.770 --> 02:57:22.770
<v Speaker 3>they're just an organism looking to survive complex set of reinforcements and</v>

6384
02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:28.160
<v Speaker 3>reward systems that are set up for it to be an incredibly efficient predator.</v>

6385
02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:30.693
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

6386
02:57:30.810 --> 02:57:31.270
<v Speaker 3>That's really,</v>

6387
02:57:31.270 --> 02:57:36.270
<v Speaker 3>see male lions the size of that fucking hall dude is the biggest jaws.</v>

6388
02:57:37.180 --> 02:57:38.270

<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

6390
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:40.231
<v Speaker 8>So the shark thing,</v>

6391
02:57:40.231 --> 02:57:44.670
<v Speaker 8>I found articles saying what you were saying could not find a video.</v>

6392
02:57:44.910 --> 02:57:48.510
<v Speaker 8>And I do believe when we found that before it was fake and I'm trying to find</v>

6393
02:57:48.511 --> 02:57:49.410
<v Speaker 8>Google even like fake,</v>

6396
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Just Google Mri image.</v>

6397
02:57:53.490 --> 02:57:55.590
<v Speaker 8>I found something to that kind of contradicts it though.</v>

6398
02:57:55.591 --> 02:58:00.591
<v Speaker 8>This is a dead shark that they performed a c section on and there was 98 live</v>

6399
02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:03.410

02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:03.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6401
02:58:03.841 --> 02:58:04.321
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

6402
02:58:04.321 --> 02:58:06.380
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean that it happens every time.</v>

6403
02:58:06.381 --> 02:58:06.631
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

6404
02:58:06.631 --> 02:58:06.841
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

6405
02:58:06.841 --> 02:58:07.141
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

6406
02:58:07.141 --> 02:58:10.920
<v Speaker 3>What I had read was that it happens often.</v>

6407
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:13.290
<v Speaker 3>This is the only thing I can find of a shark pregnancy.</v>

6408
02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:16.700
<v Speaker 3>That's 98 look at all those sharks has nuts,</v>

6410
02:58:18.750 --> 02:58:20.280
<v Speaker 3>He's pulling them out and saving them.</v>

6411
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:21.660
<v Speaker 3>That is nuts,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>

6415
02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:25.891
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

6416
02:58:25.891 --> 02:58:26.820
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

6417
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that millions,</v>

6418
02:58:28.830 --> 02:58:31.470
<v Speaker 3>literally millions of sharks are hunted and killed every year.</v>

6419
02:58:31.890 --> 02:58:32.431
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

6420
02:58:32.431 --> 02:58:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Off the soup that she mostly,</v>

6421

<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

6422
02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:39.330
<v Speaker 3>You know that's changed people's attitudes on shark fishing because people used</v>

6423
02:58:39.331 --> 02:58:41.760
<v Speaker 3>to catch shark and used to get it at restaurants all the time.</v>

6424
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.631
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

6425
02:58:42.631 --> 02:58:44.760
<v Speaker 3>You remember on the east coast he'd get Maaco Shark.</v>

6426
02:58:44.761 --> 02:58:45.990
<v Speaker 3>You thought you were fucking player,</v>

6427
02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:46.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6428
02:58:46.620 --> 02:58:46.921
<v Speaker 3>Pimp.</v>

6429
02:58:46.921 --> 02:58:49.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting some Sharay little lemon.</v>

6430
02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Some butter.</v>

6431
02:58:49.710 --> 02:58:50.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6432
02:58:50.610 --> 02:58:50.791
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6433
02:58:50.791 --> 02:58:52.650
<v Speaker 3>It was a common thing they'd serve in restaurants.</v>

6434
02:58:53.190 --> 02:58:57.960
<v Speaker 3>How many sharks are fence research indicates that about a hundred million sharks</v>

6435
02:58:57.961 --> 02:58:59.160
<v Speaker 3>are killed each year.</v>

6436
02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

6437
02:59:00.690 --> 02:59:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Roughly 11,000 sharks and hour.</v>

6438
02:59:03.780 --> 02:59:04.613
<v Speaker 3>That is incredible.</v>

6439
02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:06.180
<v Speaker 3>This is by finning.</v>

6440
02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:07.680
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

6441
02:59:09.450 --> 02:59:12.450
<v Speaker 3>It's likely that many sharks are caught without being reported.</v>

6442
02:59:12.700 --> 02:59:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6443
02:59:12.850 --> 02:59:13.683
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

6444
02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:14.760
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

6445
02:59:14.760 --> 02:59:17.760
<v Speaker 3>so this is just what the reporting my God,</v>

6446
02:59:20.040 --> 02:59:23.280
<v Speaker 3>so this is like the first time I can remember in history that people are</v>

6447
02:59:23.281 --> 02:59:26.100
<v Speaker 3>concerned with people fishing for sharks.</v>

6448
02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Because we talked about this was the the governor in New York.</v>

6449
02:59:29.640 --> 02:59:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Who Was it?</v>

6450
02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Who was the cat that got in trouble for legally catching a shark and cooking it</v>

6451
02:59:34.801 --> 02:59:35.340
<v Speaker 3>and eating it?</v>

6452
02:59:35.340 --> 02:59:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was the governor and governor of New York,</v>

6453
02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:39.473
<v Speaker 3>but Cuomo,</v>

6454
02:59:40.040 --> 02:59:40.873
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

6455
02:59:40.970 --> 02:59:41.370
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

6456
02:59:41.370 --> 02:59:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the government son,</v>

6457
02:59:42.780 --> 02:59:43.613
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

6458
02:59:44.300 --> 02:59:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

6459
02:59:44.680 --> 02:59:45.420
<v Speaker 3>you'll find it.</v>

6460
02:59:45.420 --> 02:59:47.130
<v Speaker 3>Andrew Coma tweeted a picture of herself.</v>

6461
02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:47.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6462
02:59:47.730 --> 02:59:49.290
<v Speaker 3>After he caught a shark or something like that.</v>

6463
02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:49.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6464
02:59:49.621 --> 02:59:51.960
<v Speaker 3>so this was all normal when we were kids.</v>

6465
02:59:51.980 --> 02:59:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6466
02:59:52.120 --> 02:59:52.921
<v Speaker 3>This was normal as fuck.</v>

6467
02:59:52.921 --> 02:59:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Like that might as well be a Marlin or a halibut.</v>

6468
02:59:55.820 --> 02:59:56.940
<v Speaker 3>It's just he got a shock like,</v>

6469
02:59:56.941 --> 02:59:57.774
<v Speaker 3>oh cool.</v>

6470
02:59:57.870 --> 02:59:58.591
<v Speaker 3>What's it taste like?</v>

6471
02:59:58.591 --> 02:59:58.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6472
02:59:58.711 --> 02:59:59.190
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

6473
02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.580
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

6474
02:59:59.580 --> 03:00:00.420
<v Speaker 3>You Cook it with lemon,</v>

6475
03:00:00.421 --> 03:00:01.200
<v Speaker 3>like swordfish,</v>

6476
03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:02.970
<v Speaker 3>very similar to something I remember eating shark.</v>

6477
03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:03.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6478
03:00:03.311 --> 03:00:04.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a little tough.</v>

6479
03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:06.570
<v Speaker 3>I 100 Florida ft four pound thresher shark,</v>

6480
03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:07.890
<v Speaker 3>so that's um,</v>

6481
03:00:08.370 --> 03:00:08.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6482
03:00:08.581 --> 03:00:10.740
<v Speaker 3>Maaco particularly delicious.</v>

6483
03:00:10.830 --> 03:00:12.510
<v Speaker 3>It really does taste a lot like swordfish,</v>

6484
03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:18.080
<v Speaker 3>but in our lifetime it's now become taboo because people have this rough idea of</v>

6485
03:00:18.121 --> 03:00:22.110
<v Speaker 3>what a shark is and the sharks are being targeted and sharks are being murdered</v>

6486
03:00:22.111 --> 03:00:24.840
<v Speaker 3>and there's a small amount of sharks left.</v>

6487
03:00:25.110 --> 03:00:28.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's accurate because I think this is just in one part of the</v>

6488
03:00:28.381 --> 03:00:29.010
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

6489
03:00:29.010 --> 03:00:30.450
<v Speaker 3>they're killing off all these sharks.</v>

6490
03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:34.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you say that there's no more grizzly bears left.</v>

6491
03:00:34.591 --> 03:00:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Well if you're talking about California,</v>

6492
03:00:35.971 --> 03:00:36.804
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

6493
03:00:37.050 --> 03:00:39.630
<v Speaker 3>but if you're talking about British Columbia,</v>

6494
03:00:39.750 --> 03:00:40.680
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>

6495
03:00:40.770 --> 03:00:45.270
<v Speaker 3>There is a fuck load of 'em up there and they're scary and they're big.</v>

6496
03:00:45.930 --> 03:00:50.730
<v Speaker 3>They're big and they're fast and they need to eat every day and they berries,</v>

6497
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:51.930
<v Speaker 3>if they find berries,</v>

6498
03:00:51.931 --> 03:00:54.450
<v Speaker 3>they'll eat some berries or the asshole too.</v>

6499
03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I'd present.</v>

6500
03:00:59.140 --> 03:00:59.501
<v Speaker 3>Would you,</v>

6501
03:00:59.501 --> 03:00:59.980
<v Speaker 3>would you say</v>

6502
03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:00.550
<v Speaker 5>this is it,</v>

6503
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:01.181
<v Speaker 5>this is happening,</v>

6504
03:01:01.181 --> 03:01:01.420
<v Speaker 5>is it,</v>

6505
03:01:01.420 --> 03:01:02.121
<v Speaker 5>let's do it right.</v>

6506
03:01:02.121 --> 03:01:02.954
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

6507
03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:05.890
<v Speaker 5>I was in Alaska once and I was in,</v>

6508
03:01:05.891 --> 03:01:06.724
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6509
03:01:07.150 --> 03:01:07.990
<v Speaker 5>I forget what town,</v>

6510
03:01:07.991 --> 03:01:08.770
<v Speaker 5>but there was a,</v>

6511
03:01:08.770 --> 03:01:11.410
<v Speaker 5>an island called Bair Island and I rented,</v>

6512
03:01:11.411 --> 03:01:12.244
<v Speaker 5>this guy had a,</v>

6513
03:01:12.460 --> 03:01:14.230
<v Speaker 5>had a 1948,</v>

6514
03:01:14.231 --> 03:01:17.050
<v Speaker 5>I think it was called us Stenson.</v>

6515
03:01:17.051 --> 03:01:19.960
<v Speaker 5>There's some kind of plane prop plane.</v>

6516
03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:24.100
<v Speaker 5>And I paid him a hundred bucks to take me over bear island in this fucking</v>

6517
03:01:24.101 --> 03:01:25.120
<v Speaker 5>shitty little plane.</v>

6518
03:01:25.510 --> 03:01:30.150
<v Speaker 5>And we went out there and it took him like 30 minutes to get the plane started</v>

6519
03:01:30.190 --> 03:01:31.023
<v Speaker 5>and that was like,</v>

6520
03:01:31.090 --> 03:01:32.560
<v Speaker 5>I should get the fuck outta here.</v>

6521
03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:33.670
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

6522
03:01:33.670 --> 03:01:35.710
<v Speaker 5>so we go up and a,</v>

6523
03:01:35.711 --> 03:01:40.711
<v Speaker 5>and the thing is getting tossed around by wind and uh,</v>

6524
03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:45.490
<v Speaker 5>and we go out and we go over bear island and he's showing me fucking bear all</v>

6525
03:01:45.491 --> 03:01:45.641
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>

6526
03:01:45.641 --> 03:01:49.210
<v Speaker 5>They would be like the highest concentration of bear and to anywhere in Alaska.</v>

6527
03:01:50.830 --> 03:01:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

6528
03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:54.640
<v Speaker 3>those bears are giant tumor.</v>

6529
03:01:54.670 --> 03:01:55.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6530
03:01:55.060 --> 03:01:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

6531
03:01:55.580 --> 03:01:56.650
<v Speaker 3>the coastal bears,</v>

6532
03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:58.000
<v Speaker 3>they're all eating seafood.</v>

6533
03:01:58.001 --> 03:02:01.480
<v Speaker 3>They're eating like fish and salmon and they just get enormous.</v>

6534
03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:01.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6535
03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:02.920
<v Speaker 3>There so big.</v>

6536
03:02:03.550 --> 03:02:06.700
<v Speaker 3>There's so much bigger than bears that are inland like hundreds of pounds.</v>

6537
03:02:06.730 --> 03:02:08.090
<v Speaker 3>But what are the inland bears eat?</v>

6538
03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Wherever the fuck they get ahold of.</v>

6539
03:02:10.140 --> 03:02:11.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat salmon if they find salmon.</v>

6540
03:02:11.651 --> 03:02:12.640
<v Speaker 3>If there's the salmon river,</v>

6541
03:02:12.650 --> 03:02:13.271
<v Speaker 3>they'll eat fish.</v>

6542
03:02:13.271 --> 03:02:14.680
<v Speaker 3>They'll eat berries.</v>

6543
03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6544

6551
03:02:30.550 --> 03:02:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Imagine how much food you would have to eat if you weighed 800 pounds.</v>

6552
03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:35.920
<v Speaker 3>How much food would you have to eat?</v>

6553
03:02:35.980 --> 03:02:36.430

03:02:37.481 --> 03:02:38.231
<v Speaker 5>As much as you eat.</v>

6557
03:02:38.231 --> 03:02:38.600

<v Speaker 3>They're out there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6579
03:02:56.091 --> 03:02:59.540
<v Speaker 3>they do occasionally eat whatever the fuck they want.</v>

6580
03:02:59.541 --> 03:03:00.800
<v Speaker 3>They'll eat roots and berries.</v>

6581
03:03:00.801 --> 03:03:02.240
<v Speaker 3>They'll eat everything else too,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's salmon's a perfect food for them.</v>

6587
03:03:09.631 --> 03:03:10.560
<v Speaker 5>It's all fat.</v>

6588
03:03:10.660 --> 03:03:10.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6589
03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:11.910
<v Speaker 5>You just store it up.</v>

6590
03:03:12.030 --> 03:03:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

6591
03:03:12.690 --> 03:03:15.930
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like it's designed for them too because the salmon die.</v>

6592
03:03:16.290 --> 03:03:18.450
<v Speaker 3>They literally die on the river.</v>

6593
03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't even have to catch him.</v>

6594
03:03:20.650 --> 03:03:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6595
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:21.623
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

6596
03:03:22.170 --> 03:03:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Every year when they have to die,</v>

6597
03:03:24.061 --> 03:03:25.820
<v Speaker 3>they go back up to where the corn,</v>

6598
03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:26.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6599
03:03:26.190 --> 03:03:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6600
03:03:26.970 --> 03:03:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6601
03:03:27.690 --> 03:03:32.690
<v Speaker 3>They say that once the salmon make the trek from the ocean to the fresh water,</v>

6602
03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:35.280
<v Speaker 3>they're already on a path to die.</v>

6603
03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Their clock is already gone over.</v>

6604
03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:40.440
<v Speaker 3>It's already flipped over into no return land.</v>

6605
03:03:40.441 --> 03:03:43.920
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't take them out of there and bring them to like some salmon pawn.</v>

6606
03:03:43.921 --> 03:03:44.760
<v Speaker 3>They live forever.</v>

6607
03:03:45.140 --> 03:03:45.973
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way.</v>

6608
03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:47.220
<v Speaker 3>There they,</v>

6609
03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:48.353
<v Speaker 3>they breed,</v>

6610
03:03:48.570 --> 03:03:49.560
<v Speaker 3>they make the track,</v>

6611
03:03:49.770 --> 03:03:53.430
<v Speaker 3>they breed and when they get to the spot where you know,</v>

6612
03:03:53.431 --> 03:03:53.731
<v Speaker 3>when there,</v>

6613
03:03:53.731 --> 03:03:54.690
<v Speaker 3>where the end of their life,</v>

6614
03:03:54.691 --> 03:03:54.951
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

6615
03:03:54.951 --> 03:03:56.640
<v Speaker 3>their body starts changing color,</v>

6616
03:03:56.880 --> 03:03:58.100
<v Speaker 3>they getting mushy,</v>

6617
03:03:58.540 --> 03:04:02.240
<v Speaker 3>they live rotten and they just fucking wind up like pooling up on the ground.</v>

6618
03:04:02.420 --> 03:04:05.780
<v Speaker 3>And then the bears move in and they eat hundreds of rotten ones.</v>

6619
03:04:06.020 --> 03:04:06.201
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

6620
03:04:06.201 --> 03:04:06.830
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

6621
03:04:06.830 --> 03:04:10.640
<v Speaker 3>this is while the salmon are in the run and these bears are,</v>

6622
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:12.080
<v Speaker 3>they're fighting over territory.</v>

6623
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Look at the size of these motherfuckers.</v>

6624
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

6625
03:04:14.391 --> 03:04:14.840
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

6626
03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:16.400
<v Speaker 3>they're fighting over who gets to salmon.</v>

6627
03:04:16.460 --> 03:04:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6628
03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:19.340
<v Speaker 3>But these are salmon that are still pretty fresh and healthy.</v>

6629
03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:20.030
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

6630
03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.780
<v Speaker 3>they're swimming around,</v>

6631
03:04:20.780 --> 03:04:21.613
<v Speaker 3>they look good.</v>

6632
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:25.370
<v Speaker 3>And so they catch them like that was a perfectly healthy salmon and he catches</v>

6633
03:04:25.371 --> 03:04:29.780
<v Speaker 3>it right in the middle of it or tried Huggies all slow mo and shit.</v>

6634
03:04:29.870 --> 03:04:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Here he goes.</v>

6635
03:04:30.650 --> 03:04:32.120
<v Speaker 3>They try and they catch some of them.</v>

6636
03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6637
03:04:34.490 --> 03:04:35.323
<v Speaker 3>come on bitch.</v>

6638
03:04:36.020 --> 03:04:36.853
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

6639
03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:38.463
<v Speaker 3>get that.</v>

6640
03:04:38.500 --> 03:04:42.640
<v Speaker 3>Imagine just standing in freezing cold water waiting to catch something with</v>

6641
03:04:42.641 --> 03:04:43.474
<v Speaker 3>your mouth.</v>

6642
03:04:43.630 --> 03:04:45.160
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious.</v>

6643
03:04:45.310 --> 03:04:45.521
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6644
03:04:45.521 --> 03:04:46.900
<v Speaker 3>But they figured it out and it works.</v>

6645
03:04:46.930 --> 03:04:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

6646
03:04:47.260 --> 03:04:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Look at the cubs.</v>

6647
03:04:47.930 --> 03:04:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Like come on mom to fuck.</v>

6648
03:04:50.170 --> 03:04:52.390
<v Speaker 3>So mom's probably going to give him some of that.</v>

6649
03:04:52.990 --> 03:04:53.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6650
03:04:53.321 --> 03:04:57.070
<v Speaker 3>see she breaks off pieces of it and so they just keep doing that back and forth.</v>

6651
03:04:57.100 --> 03:04:58.180
<v Speaker 3>And they'll do that all day.</v>

6652
03:04:58.390 --> 03:05:01.590
<v Speaker 3>But then once the salmon are done with their run,</v>

6653
03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:02.710
<v Speaker 3>then they just die.</v>

6654
03:05:02.920 --> 03:05:07.510
<v Speaker 3>And coincidentally when they're dying is probably right when the bears are</v>

6655
03:05:07.511 --> 03:05:09.930
<v Speaker 3>trying to fatten up and get ready for hibernation.</v>

6656
03:05:09.950 --> 03:05:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6657
03:05:10.270 --> 03:05:14.820
<v Speaker 3>So it all like sort of happens together and they're all in the right place at</v>

6658
03:05:14.821 --> 03:05:15.654
<v Speaker 3>the right time.</v>

6659
03:05:16.300 --> 03:05:19.150
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find bears eating rotten salmon.</v>

6660
03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Cause like sometimes they'll pull up and these these rivers and these like</v>

6661
03:05:23.410 --> 03:05:28.410
<v Speaker 3>little ponds and shit and you just see all these bears is chew on these rotting</v>

6662
03:05:28.511 --> 03:05:29.210
<v Speaker 3>carcasses.</v>

6663
03:05:29.210 --> 03:05:30.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6664
03:05:30.140 --> 03:05:30.351
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6665
03:05:30.351 --> 03:05:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Those salmon are endangered now we eat so much more fish.</v>

6666
03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:34.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6667
03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:34.940
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

6668
03:05:34.941 --> 03:05:37.220
<v Speaker 4>I'd have fish once every three weeks.</v>

6669
03:05:37.610 --> 03:05:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Now you,</v>

6670
03:05:38.040 --> 03:05:39.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe it's because we're in la,</v>

6671
03:05:39.291 --> 03:05:41.330
<v Speaker 4>but I have fished a few times a week.</v>

6672
03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:43.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you have some fucking Sushi?</v>

6673
03:05:43.011 --> 03:05:46.460
<v Speaker 4>One day wife will cook some salmon on another day.</v>

6674
03:05:46.990 --> 03:05:48.710
<v Speaker 4>Go get one of those pokie bowls.</v>

6675
03:05:49.690 --> 03:05:51.070
<v Speaker 3>We're constantly eating salmon.</v>

6676
03:05:51.370 --> 03:05:52.360
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of food.</v>

6677
03:05:52.590 --> 03:05:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Think about all those little organisms that have to fuck,</v>

6678
03:05:55.600 --> 03:05:56.291
<v Speaker 3>well not really.</v>

6679
03:05:56.291 --> 03:05:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Shoot loads on eggs.</v>

6680
03:05:57.400 --> 03:05:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6681
03:05:57.700 --> 03:06:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Make new organisms and then all the people with nets scooping them up.</v>

6682
03:06:02.140 --> 03:06:06.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you see us a tuna got sold in Japan for the highest amount ever.</v>

6683
03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:08.590
<v Speaker 3>$3 million for tuna?</v>

6684
03:06:08.980 --> 03:06:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

6685
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:11.800
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea.</v>

6686
03:06:11.870 --> 03:06:12.940
<v Speaker 3>And did you have any idea?</v>

6687
03:06:12.980 --> 03:06:14.170
<v Speaker 3>But a tuner could be 3 million.</v>

6688
03:06:14.171 --> 03:06:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6689
03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:19.250
<v Speaker 4>I know that they wait on the dock and the in Japan and whoever is like certain</v>

6690
03:06:19.251 --> 03:06:22.880
<v Speaker 4>chefs have more cache and they're able to come in first and pick the,</v>

6691
03:06:23.040 --> 03:06:23.870
<v Speaker 4>the tuna.</v>

6692
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:24.703
<v Speaker 4>But then they,</v>

6693
03:06:24.770 --> 03:06:26.330
<v Speaker 4>but then they auctioned them off and yeah,</v>

6694
03:06:26.331 --> 03:06:27.710
<v Speaker 4>they go for crazy money.</v>

6695
03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:28.900
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

6696
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:31.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant fucking fish though.</v>

6697
03:06:31.511 --> 03:06:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it like 600 pounds or something?</v>

6698
03:06:33.041 --> 03:06:36.160
<v Speaker 3>How much it at least 278 kilograms.</v>

6699
03:06:36.190 --> 03:06:39.440
<v Speaker 3>What's that in English 2.2 close to six.</v>

6700
03:06:39.760 --> 03:06:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6701
03:06:40.300 --> 03:06:41.133
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>

6702
03:06:41.140 --> 03:06:41.973
<v Speaker 3>God Damn,</v>

6703
03:06:42.220 --> 03:06:42.761
<v Speaker 3>that's a hard,</v>

6704
03:06:42.761 --> 03:06:43.600
<v Speaker 3>that is to bring in.</v>

6705
03:06:44.290 --> 03:06:45.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6706
03:06:45.490 --> 03:06:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I caught a yell tail and Hawaii.</v>

6707
03:06:46.871 --> 03:06:49.450
<v Speaker 3>That was like 11 pounds a battle.</v>

6708
03:06:49.730 --> 03:06:50.740
<v Speaker 3>What a battle.</v>

6709
03:06:51.070 --> 03:06:51.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6710
03:06:51.550 --> 03:06:52.900
<v Speaker 3>613 pounds.</v>

6711
03:06:52.930 --> 03:06:53.763
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

6712
03:06:54.760 --> 03:06:54.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6713
03:06:54.851 --> 03:06:56.010
<v Speaker 3>we caught up quite a few of them.</v>

6714
03:06:56.270 --> 03:07:00.090
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting to catching ones they're calling Hamachi cause they</v>

6715
03:07:00.091 --> 03:07:04.710
<v Speaker 3>were actually from a Hamachi farm that was on the big island that broke during</v>

6716
03:07:04.711 --> 03:07:05.520
<v Speaker 3>the storm.</v>

6717
03:07:05.520 --> 03:07:06.630
<v Speaker 3>And when they had that storm,</v>

6718
03:07:06.631 --> 03:07:07.650
<v Speaker 3>there are a couple of years back.</v>

6719
03:07:07.740 --> 03:07:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Giant fucking hurricane.</v>

6720
03:07:09.031 --> 03:07:09.864
<v Speaker 3>They did a why?</v>

6721
03:07:10.050 --> 03:07:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Well it destroyed this uh,</v>

6722
03:07:11.810 --> 03:07:15.600
<v Speaker 3>this containment area that they had where they were farm raising Hamachi for</v>

6723
03:07:15.601 --> 03:07:16.620
<v Speaker 3>like Sushi and shit.</v>

6724
03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:20.450
<v Speaker 3>So now this type of yellow tails everywhere in the,</v>

6725
03:07:20.451 --> 03:07:21.120
<v Speaker 3>in the ocean.</v>

6726
03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

6727
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6728
03:07:22.200 --> 03:07:23.790
<v Speaker 3>We caught a caught quite a few of them.</v>

6729
03:07:23.820 --> 03:07:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Did you eat them?</v>

6730
03:07:24.450 --> 03:07:24.631

6733
03:07:26.671 --> 03:07:28.850
<v Speaker 3>you brought it back to the hotel and then they fried it down.</v>

6734
03:07:29.010 --> 03:07:29.581
<v Speaker 3>Pick it for you.</v>

03:07:33.451 --> 03:07:34.284
<v Speaker 3>They made 'em.</v>

6741

<v Speaker 3>they baked it,</v>

6744
03:07:38.610 --> 03:07:40.080
<v Speaker 3>they cooked it a couple of different ways.</v>

6745
03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:41.153
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>A 10 pound one nine pound one or s is so powerful.</v>

6748
03:07:46.600 --> 03:07:48.240
<v Speaker 3>You can't believe how strong they are.</v>

6749
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.991
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

6750
03:07:48.991 --> 03:07:50.070
<v Speaker 3>you're wrestling with them.</v>

6751
03:07:50.071 --> 03:07:51.270
<v Speaker 3>We can try and get him into the bullying.</v>

6752
03:07:53.190 --> 03:07:54.690
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that thing.</v>

6755
03:07:59.991 --> 03:08:00.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6756
03:08:00.190 --> 03:08:01.023
<v Speaker 3>just my youngest,</v>

6757
03:08:01.050 --> 03:08:02.160
<v Speaker 3>youngest daughter loves it.</v>

6758
03:08:02.330 --> 03:08:03.000
<v Speaker 3>She loves it.</v>

6759
03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:03.451
<v Speaker 3>Loves it.</v>

6760
03:08:03.451 --> 03:08:04.284
<v Speaker 3>She loves fishing.</v>

6761
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6762
03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:06.910
<v Speaker 3>We put a video up of,</v>

6763
03:08:06.930 --> 03:08:07.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6764
03:08:07.500 --> 03:08:09.120
<v Speaker 3>the dolphins that were with us.</v>

6765
03:08:09.210 --> 03:08:09.870
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>

6766
03:08:09.870 --> 03:08:10.310
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

6767
03:08:10.310 --> 03:08:11.070
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

6768
03:08:11.070 --> 03:08:13.290
<v Speaker 3>They just never seen that many dolphins swim with a boat.</v>

6769
03:08:14.650 --> 03:08:15.480
<v Speaker 3>It was incredible.</v>

6770
03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:16.313
<v Speaker 3>They just all,</v>

6771
03:08:16.350 --> 03:08:17.700
<v Speaker 3>we just hit the right spot.</v>

6772
03:08:17.730 --> 03:08:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6773
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:20.340
<v Speaker 3>And then they all decided to swim with the boat.</v>

6774
03:08:20.341 --> 03:08:21.190
<v Speaker 3>They just get in the,</v>

6775
03:08:21.250 --> 03:08:24.570
<v Speaker 3>in front of the boat as the boat's pushing the water and they started a surf it,</v>

6776
03:08:25.140 --> 03:08:26.040
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

6777
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.821
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>

6778
03:08:26.821 --> 03:08:28.050
<v Speaker 3>You worry about you're going to hit them.</v>

6779
03:08:28.080 --> 03:08:30.450
<v Speaker 3>You worry that they're going to the right people running the boat.</v>

6780
03:08:30.451 --> 03:08:31.051
<v Speaker 3>They don't worry about it.</v>

6781
03:08:31.051 --> 03:08:32.670
<v Speaker 3>All the dolphins know exactly what they're doing.</v>

6782
03:08:33.180 --> 03:08:34.200
<v Speaker 3>They're smart as shit.</v>

6783
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6784
03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:35.850
<v Speaker 3>It's weird to watch,</v>

6785
03:08:35.851 --> 03:08:36.330
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6786
03:08:36.330 --> 03:08:38.730
<v Speaker 3>It's weird to watch them all coordinate together and then they were done.</v>

6787
03:08:38.731 --> 03:08:39.860
<v Speaker 3>They were done like by,</v>

6788
03:08:40.620 --> 03:08:41.340
<v Speaker 3>they take off.</v>

6789
03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

6790
03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:42.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6791
03:08:42.241 --> 03:08:43.770
<v Speaker 3>My daughter's surfs and they come out.</v>

6792
03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:44.970
<v Speaker 3>They play around a little bit.</v>

6793
03:08:45.270 --> 03:08:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they ride the waves when she surfing.</v>

6794
03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:49.530
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the dark sides of fishing,</v>

6795
03:08:49.531 --> 03:08:50.364
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6796
03:08:50.490 --> 03:08:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Commercial fishing is a,</v>

6797
03:08:52.230 --> 03:08:56.190
<v Speaker 3>what happens in Japan when they take those dolphins and they look at them as</v>

6798
03:08:56.310 --> 03:08:57.143
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>

6799
03:08:57.660 --> 03:08:58.770
<v Speaker 3>they're going to kill their tuna.</v>

6800
03:08:58.771 --> 03:08:59.490
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

6801
03:08:59.490 --> 03:09:00.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6802
03:09:00.030 --> 03:09:01.170
<v Speaker 3>they've been doing that forever.</v>

6803
03:09:01.171 --> 03:09:03.840
<v Speaker 3>The large scale slaughter of them,</v>

6804
03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:05.040
<v Speaker 3>it's scary shit.</v>

6805
03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:06.293
<v Speaker 3>They just shoot him.</v>

6806
03:09:06.480 --> 03:09:07.290
<v Speaker 3>They caught them.</v>

6807
03:09:07.290 --> 03:09:07.710
<v Speaker 3>They bring him.</v>

6808
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:08.760
<v Speaker 3>You've ever seen the documentary,</v>

6809
03:09:08.761 --> 03:09:09.594
<v Speaker 3>the cove?</v>

6810
03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:10.501
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

6811
03:09:10.501 --> 03:09:11.460
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that.</v>

6812
03:09:11.820 --> 03:09:13.050
<v Speaker 3>All full.</v>

6813
03:09:13.120 --> 03:09:15.250
<v Speaker 3>It's all full there.</v>

6814
03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:15.560
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6815
03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:19.170
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're slaughtering water people.</v>

6816
03:09:20.100 --> 03:09:20.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's like.</v>

6817
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:21.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6818
03:09:21.670 --> 03:09:23.400
<v Speaker 3>This is what a dolphin is,</v>

6819
03:09:23.460 --> 03:09:24.990
<v Speaker 3>is some strange,</v>

6820
03:09:24.991 --> 03:09:27.900
<v Speaker 3>super intelligent creature that we don't totally understand.</v>

6821
03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:29.490
<v Speaker 3>And they can talk,</v>

6822
03:09:29.730 --> 03:09:31.740
<v Speaker 3>they can talk to each other and we don't know what they're saying,</v>

6823
03:09:31.890 --> 03:09:32.910
<v Speaker 3>but they know what they're saying.</v>

6824
03:09:33.420 --> 03:09:35.790
<v Speaker 3>And we could train them.</v>

6825
03:09:35.820 --> 03:09:36.690
<v Speaker 3>You could ride them,</v>

6826
03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you can do it,</v>

6827
03:09:37.500 --> 03:09:38.730
<v Speaker 3>flips for fish,</v>

6828
03:09:38.760 --> 03:09:39.510
<v Speaker 3>all this kind of stuff.</v>

6829
03:09:39.510 --> 03:09:40.380
<v Speaker 3>That's all true.</v>

6830
03:09:40.410 --> 03:09:41.243
<v Speaker 3>That's all true.</v>

6831
03:09:41.370 --> 03:09:43.710
<v Speaker 3>But what's also true is they have a giant brain,</v>

6832
03:09:43.940 --> 03:09:45.450
<v Speaker 3>and if they have a huge brain,</v>

6833
03:09:45.570 --> 03:09:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Devin cerebral cortex is 40% larger than a person.</v>

6834
03:09:48.600 --> 03:09:49.330
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

6835
03:09:49.330 --> 03:09:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6836
03:09:49.800 --> 03:09:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

6837
03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.970
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

6838
03:09:50.970 --> 03:09:52.950
<v Speaker 3>it's designed for you,</v>

6839
03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:53.291
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6840
03:09:53.291 --> 03:09:54.250
<v Speaker 3>the movement of his body.</v>

6841
03:09:54.251 --> 03:09:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's a lot,</v>

6842
03:09:54.850 --> 03:09:55.420
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>

6843
03:09:55.420 --> 03:09:56.560
<v Speaker 3>lot larger body,</v>

6844
03:09:57.250 --> 03:10:02.250
<v Speaker 3>but they think it's also got some sort of probably not totally understood are</v>

6845
03:10:03.401 --> 03:10:04.720
<v Speaker 3>measured cognitive ability.</v>

6846
03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:06.940
<v Speaker 3>They don't know like how smart they really are.</v>

6847
03:10:06.970 --> 03:10:07.803
<v Speaker 3>It's been,</v>

6848
03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:08.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6849
03:10:08.261 --> 03:10:09.400
<v Speaker 3>when we're talking about Timothy Leary,</v>

6850
03:10:09.401 --> 03:10:11.230
<v Speaker 3>he used to pal around with John Lilly.</v>

6851
03:10:11.380 --> 03:10:15.460
<v Speaker 3>John Lilly's the guy who invented the isolation tank and he's also a,</v>

6852
03:10:15.461 --> 03:10:17.740
<v Speaker 3>he was a pioneer and interspecies communication.</v>

6853
03:10:17.790 --> 03:10:20.560
<v Speaker 3>You'd give dolphins acid and he would uh,</v>

6854
03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:25.580
<v Speaker 3>he was set the float tank up next to the dolphin tank and take acid and getting</v>

6855
03:10:25.610 --> 03:10:26.443
<v Speaker 3>there with them.</v>

6856
03:10:26.830 --> 03:10:27.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6857
03:10:27.131 --> 03:10:27.730
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

6858
03:10:27.730 --> 03:10:27.911
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

6859
03:10:27.911 --> 03:10:30.940
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to figure out a way to get dolphins to speak.</v>

6860
03:10:31.210 --> 03:10:32.770
<v Speaker 3>He would get them to like make a noise.</v>

6861
03:10:32.771 --> 03:10:34.750
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like how long,</v>

6862
03:10:35.170 --> 03:10:35.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6863
03:10:35.441 --> 03:10:35.951
<v Speaker 3>but they could,</v>

6864
03:10:35.951 --> 03:10:37.810
<v Speaker 3>they don't have the vocal cords.</v>

6865
03:10:37.870 --> 03:10:40.300
<v Speaker 3>They can't make the sounds that we expect,</v>

6866
03:10:40.900 --> 03:10:42.670
<v Speaker 3>but there sounds we don't understand.</v>

6867
03:10:42.690 --> 03:10:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6868
03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:44.770
<v Speaker 3>Which is weird cause they know what you're saying.</v>

6869
03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:45.161
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>

6870
03:10:45.161 --> 03:10:45.551
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

6871
03:10:45.551 --> 03:10:46.390
<v Speaker 3>we're going to jump now.</v>

6872
03:10:46.391 --> 03:10:46.930
<v Speaker 3>We've got a job,</v>

6873
03:10:46.930 --> 03:10:47.860
<v Speaker 3>we're going to give you a fish.</v>

6874
03:10:48.070 --> 03:10:48.640
<v Speaker 3>They know it.</v>

6875
03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:49.473
<v Speaker 3>They know what you're saying.</v>

6876
03:10:49.660 --> 03:10:50.620
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea what they're saying.</v>

6877
03:10:50.700 --> 03:10:51.533
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6878
03:10:52.890 --> 03:10:53.161
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6879
03:10:53.161 --> 03:10:53.761
<v Speaker 5>It's weird when you,</v>

6880
03:10:53.761 --> 03:10:53.961
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

6881
03:10:53.961 --> 03:10:56.820
<v Speaker 5>What is the cutoff for killing an intelligent animal?</v>

6882
03:10:56.880 --> 03:10:57.031
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6883
03:10:57.031 --> 03:10:57.271
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6884
03:10:57.271 --> 03:10:58.710
<v Speaker 5>like you can't kill dogs.</v>

6885
03:10:58.711 --> 03:10:59.544
<v Speaker 5>Cats.</v>

6886
03:11:00.690 --> 03:11:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Dogs aren't nearly as smart as dolphins,</v>

6887
03:11:02.460 --> 03:11:03.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6888
03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:03.953
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6889
03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:05.820
<v Speaker 3>But you can kill dogs in some spots.</v>

6890
03:11:05.821 --> 03:11:06.654
<v Speaker 3>It's cultural.</v>

6891
03:11:06.750 --> 03:11:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6892
03:11:07.290 --> 03:11:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Because pigs are probably the smartest dogs.</v>

6893
03:11:09.660 --> 03:11:09.901
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

6894
03:11:09.901 --> 03:11:10.411
<v Speaker 3>We all exist.</v>

6895
03:11:10.411 --> 03:11:11.244
<v Speaker 3>Really smart.</v>

6896
03:11:11.820 --> 03:11:12.001
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6897
03:11:12.001 --> 03:11:12.834
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

6898
03:11:13.590 --> 03:11:14.423
<v Speaker 3>that's a tricky one.</v>

6899
03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:15.810
<v Speaker 3>All those,</v>

6900
03:11:15.810 --> 03:11:16.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6901
03:11:17.940 --> 03:11:20.400
<v Speaker 3>that is one of our criteria.</v>

6902
03:11:20.490 --> 03:11:22.680
<v Speaker 3>Like even a lot of vegetarians,</v>

6903
03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:24.480
<v Speaker 3>we'll still step on roaches.</v>

6904
03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6905
03:11:25.710 --> 03:11:26.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6906
03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:30.030
<v Speaker 3>our criteria is how smart is the thing.</v>

6907
03:11:30.510 --> 03:11:31.830
<v Speaker 3>How close is it to us?</v>

6908
03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:33.120
<v Speaker 3>The further it's away from us,</v>

6909
03:11:33.121 --> 03:11:34.080
<v Speaker 3>the easy we could just like,</v>

6910
03:11:34.410 --> 03:11:35.850
<v Speaker 3>nobody gives a fuck about oysters.</v>

6911
03:11:36.750 --> 03:11:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6912
03:11:37.100 --> 03:11:37.620
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

6913
03:11:37.620 --> 03:11:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Saben an oyster gets got.</v>

6914
03:11:39.460 --> 03:11:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

6915
03:11:40.290 --> 03:11:41.041
<v Speaker 3>I don't care at all.</v>

6916
03:11:41.041 --> 03:11:41.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel a thing.</v>

6917
03:11:42.230 --> 03:11:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Someone shucks annoy oyster and opens up and scooped it out and swallow.</v>

6918
03:11:45.001 --> 03:11:45.271
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

6919
03:11:45.271 --> 03:11:45.631
<v Speaker 3>how's it?</v>

6920
03:11:45.631 --> 03:11:46.464
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

6921
03:11:46.680 --> 03:11:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6922
03:11:47.010 --> 03:11:47.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like,</v>

6923
03:11:47.460 --> 03:11:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Aww,</v>

6924
03:11:47.940 --> 03:11:48.773
<v Speaker 3>poor little piggy.</v>

6925
03:11:49.170 --> 03:11:51.420
<v Speaker 3>But the poor little piggy that's real.</v>

6926
03:11:51.650 --> 03:11:52.060
<v Speaker 3>That thing.</v>

6927
03:11:52.060 --> 03:11:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

6928
03:11:52.710 --> 03:11:53.191
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6929
03:11:53.191 --> 03:11:53.821
<v Speaker 3>let's say so.</v>

6930
03:11:53.821 --> 03:11:54.301
<v Speaker 3>Scared.</v>

6931
03:11:54.301 --> 03:11:55.110
<v Speaker 3>So terrified.</v>

6932
03:11:55.110 --> 03:11:55.943
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6933
03:11:56.330 --> 03:11:56.700
<v Speaker 5>But it,</v>

6934
03:11:56.700 --> 03:11:57.600
<v Speaker 5>all those things are dumb.</v>

6935
03:11:57.660 --> 03:11:59.520
<v Speaker 5>What about lobsters getting thrown in the pot?</v>

6936
03:11:59.521 --> 03:12:00.354
<v Speaker 5>Can you do that?</v>

6937
03:12:00.360 --> 03:12:01.230
<v Speaker 5>I can't do that.</v>

6938
03:12:01.650 --> 03:12:02.041
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

6939
03:12:02.041 --> 03:12:02.341
<v Speaker 5>I could do.</v>

6940
03:12:02.341 --> 03:12:07.341
<v Speaker 5>It freaks me out that they're like moving around and alive and then you throw</v>

6941
03:12:07.441 --> 03:12:09.990
<v Speaker 5>them in and don't they scream they're bugs.</v>

6942
03:12:10.080 --> 03:12:10.231
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6943
03:12:10.231 --> 03:12:10.680
<v Speaker 5>They scream.</v>

6944
03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:13.600
<v Speaker 5>They sing first and then this little screen,</v>

6945
03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:14.513
<v Speaker 5>they don't know.</v>

6946
03:12:16.170 --> 03:12:17.780
<v Speaker 5>It's not like the frog in Carnegie Hall.</v>

6947
03:12:17.910 --> 03:12:18.790
<v Speaker 5>They could make noise.</v>

6948
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:20.130
<v Speaker 5>I'll leave the big noise.</v>

6949
03:12:20.490 --> 03:12:21.330
<v Speaker 5>Their lobsters.</v>

6950
03:12:21.660 --> 03:12:22.493
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

6951
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.891
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

6952
03:12:22.891 --> 03:12:23.880
<v Speaker 5>But they tasted fuck.</v>

6953
03:12:24.480 --> 03:12:25.650
<v Speaker 5>I'll eat tons of them.</v>

6954
03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:26.060
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

6955
03:12:26.060 --> 03:12:27.960
<v Speaker 5>When I used to work in Boston at the,</v>

6956
03:12:27.961 --> 03:12:28.794
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6957
03:12:29.100 --> 03:12:30.090
<v Speaker 5>the copy Marriott,</v>

6958
03:12:30.091 --> 03:12:32.160
<v Speaker 5>that was my day job for a while in college.</v>

6959
03:12:32.220 --> 03:12:33.810
<v Speaker 5>And then when I first started doing standup,</v>

6960
03:12:34.650 --> 03:12:38.370
<v Speaker 5>and we used to go down and it was the biggest banquet hall in Boston.</v>

6961
03:12:38.371 --> 03:12:39.690
<v Speaker 5>So we used to get all these conventions,</v>

6962
03:12:39.691 --> 03:12:43.800
<v Speaker 5>all these fucking hayseed farmers would come from the Midwest and they'd stay in</v>

6963
03:12:43.801 --> 03:12:45.960
<v Speaker 5>the hotel and they could order any kind of dinner.</v>

6964
03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:47.160
<v Speaker 5>They want it for their banquet.</v>

6965
03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:49.080
<v Speaker 5>But they always wanted the pilgrim,</v>

6966
03:12:49.310 --> 03:12:54.310
<v Speaker 5>the pilgrim banquet and used to have to fucking dress up as pilgrims who would</v>

6967
03:12:54.561 --> 03:12:55.550
<v Speaker 5>serve lobster.</v>

6968
03:12:55.551 --> 03:12:56.720
<v Speaker 5>It didn't even make any sense.</v>

6969
03:12:57.240 --> 03:12:57.580
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

6970
03:12:57.580 --> 03:12:58.220
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

6971
03:12:58.220 --> 03:12:59.180
<v Speaker 5>so they would make,</v>

6972
03:12:59.181 --> 03:13:04.181
<v Speaker 5>and the thing about banquet cooking is you cook 10% more than the amount of</v>

6973
03:13:04.371 --> 03:13:06.260
<v Speaker 5>people you're feeding just in case,</v>

6974
03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:08.300
<v Speaker 5>which meant there was like,</v>

6975
03:13:08.360 --> 03:13:08.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6976
03:13:08.721 --> 03:13:13.370
<v Speaker 5>30 30 college kids all waiting tables and uh,</v>

6977
03:13:13.390 --> 03:13:15.260
<v Speaker 5>and so after we fed them,</v>

6978
03:13:15.261 --> 03:13:19.370
<v Speaker 5>they would usually have like a presentation or whatever comedian or a speaker.</v>

6979
03:13:19.520 --> 03:13:23.060
<v Speaker 5>So we would leave the room for like an hour and a half and we would just fucking</v>

6980
03:13:23.061 --> 03:13:28.061
<v Speaker 5>go to town on like a hundred lobsters could eat like three lobsters if you</v>

6981
03:13:28.730 --> 03:13:29.300
<v Speaker 5>wanted.</v>

6982
03:13:29.300 --> 03:13:30.051
<v Speaker 5>And then our friends,</v>

6983
03:13:30.051 --> 03:13:31.080
<v Speaker 5>we're all working the bars.</v>

6984
03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:33.950
<v Speaker 5>They were all the bartenders so we'd be doing shots,</v>

6985
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:38.300
<v Speaker 5>drinking beer and so is the upside was you live like a king.</v>

6986
03:13:38.301 --> 03:13:41.240
<v Speaker 5>The downside was you were dressed like a fucking asshole.</v>

6987
03:13:45.740 --> 03:13:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I remember clam bakes.</v>

6988
03:13:46.941 --> 03:13:48.050
<v Speaker 2>People would do them on the ball.</v>

6989
03:13:48.051 --> 03:13:48.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6990
03:13:48.501 --> 03:13:49.700
<v Speaker 2>those were good.</v>

6991
03:13:49.701 --> 03:13:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6992
03:13:50.300 --> 03:13:54.210
<v Speaker 2>I like a clam bake where you would burry it and put seaweed over the top and yet</v>

6993
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:57.230
<v Speaker 2>wet seaweed and it would just steam everything.</v>

6994
03:13:57.260 --> 03:13:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it.</v>

6995
03:13:58.580 --> 03:14:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I've only eaten it at a restaurant.</v>

6996
03:14:00.621 --> 03:14:02.690
<v Speaker 2>When you order a clam bake and they give you some,</v>

6997
03:14:02.691 --> 03:14:03.920
<v Speaker 2>I've never done the beach thing.</v>

6998
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I did it with Kevin Flynn and Nantucket.</v>

6999
03:14:05.781 --> 03:14:06.201

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7002
03:14:07.460 --> 03:14:08.030
<v Speaker 2>that's very true.</v>

7003
03:14:08.030 --> 03:14:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

7004

03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:19.550
<v Speaker 2>That's it right there.</v>

7011
03:14:19.850 --> 03:14:21.260
<v Speaker 2>How to make a steam pit.</v>

7012
03:14:22.510 --> 03:14:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Make a nice fuck and steam pit.</v>
