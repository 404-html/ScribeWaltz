<v Speaker 2>So the preserved where he lived,</v>

118
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.160
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's where he killed himself.</v>

119
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.990
<v Speaker 3>I think he was in Cuba when he killed himself.</v>

120
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.663
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>his um,</v>

124
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.180
<v Speaker 2>his style of writing and like that whole bravado that went with him though,</v>

125
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 2>he was a different cat.</v>

126
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.791
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

127

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

129
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.320

130
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Like that's an odd thing.</v>

131
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.904
<v Speaker 2>Like Hemingway,</v>

132

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

135
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even Stephen King for all those most horrific depictions of violence</v>

136
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>and Gore and terror in his books.</v>

137
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>He's not thought of is like I said,</v>

138
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.680
<v Speaker 2>posing physical thing.</v>

139
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Well Hemingway was in the war.</v>

140
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

141

144
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>

145
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 3>he used to go skiing in the winter in a,</v>

146
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Switzerland and they would all,</v>

147
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:22.841

00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 3>there was no chairlifts back then.</v>

149
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:27.420
<v Speaker 3>So you would fucking grab your 50 pounds,</v>

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 2>The kind of exercise like carrying skis up hill in the snow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

164
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 3>And the skis were long back then.</v>

165
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 3>They were like twice as long as they are now.</v>

166
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 3>When did anybody figure out a ski lift?</v>

167
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.463
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

168

176
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:27.801
<v Speaker 3>maybe you do a dozen runs going up a couple miles and this one you do one run.</v>

177
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.083
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 3>That's literally me skiing because I've had knee surgery.</v>

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Three is crazy.</v>

197
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy how quickly you can fuck up your body skiing.</v>

198
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I am so,</v>

199
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 3>I've skied my whole life.</v>

200
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 3>I've never had an injury and I ski hard.</v>

201
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I hit every fucking jump I can find</v>

202
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.350
<v Speaker 2>be the only one that I know that like my friend Matt,</v>

203
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.860
<v Speaker 2>he broke his ankle or he broke his ankle and it happened in the course of like a</v>

204
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 2>just a year.</v>

205
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Two friends at school.</v>

207
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Parents at school blew out their acs.</v>

208
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

209
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do that when you're 43 you don't.</v>

210
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.641
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

211
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is you get to a certain age and you the risk reward because</v>

212
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 3>injuries takes so much longer to heal and you have so much less time to live.</v>

213
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.011
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

214
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 3>the math doesn't work anymore to ski.</v>

215
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>You've got to protect your knees if you can.</v>

216
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

217
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Your knees are so God damn important.</v>

218
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Whenever people have like hurt knees and they keep working out,</v>

219
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I always cringe.</v>

220
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.931
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

221
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:51.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

222
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get it fixed.</v>

223
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to rehab it and like,</v>

224
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 2>what are we talking about?</v>

225
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Rehabbing,</v>

226
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.771
<v Speaker 2>rehabbing.</v>

228
00:06:56.771 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 2>You just going to ignore the fact that you don't have an ACL.</v>

229
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

230
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Like rehabbing.</v>

231
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

232
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.930
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't going to fix,</v>

233
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.763
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to feed,</v>

234
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.440
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the stability in your knee.</v>

235
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of guys who blow it out and they keep exercising and they just</v>

236
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:09.820
<v Speaker 2>show the inside of their knee apart.</v>

237
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

238
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

239
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.331
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

240
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I got something going on in my,</v>

241
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 3>the inside of my left knee for two fucking months.</v>

242
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 3>If I try to squat down,</v>

243
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:17.271
<v Speaker 3>it kills.</v>

244
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 3>There's like a tended on the inside of the knee and uh,</v>

245
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 3>so I'm,</v>

246
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start some physical therapy this week to try to figure it out cause</v>

247
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:25.251
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

248
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 3>I have an exercise and fucking two months just because of this one thing.</v>

249
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

250
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.283
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do?</v>

251
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 3>I do more cardio.</v>

252
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know</v>

253
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.150
<v Speaker 2>lift that much.</v>

254
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about getting like PRP or Regena keen or anything into it?</v>

255
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.461
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

256
00:07:38.461 --> 00:07:39.300
<v Speaker 2>now what's that?</v>

257
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

258
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.020
<v Speaker 2>PRP is platelet rich plasma.</v>

259
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And what they do is they take your blood and there's some sort of a process they</v>

260
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:48.420
<v Speaker 2>do and they separate it.</v>

261
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.370
<v Speaker 2>And then they take this platelet rich plasma and inject it into the wounded area</v>

262
00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:54.570
<v Speaker 2>and accelerates healing.</v>

263
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.640
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have really good results with that.</v>

265
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

266
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.410
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this stuff called Regena keen that's like platelet rich plasma,</v>

267
00:08:01.411 --> 00:08:06.411
<v Speaker 2>but it's apparently the next step up in what they do is they heat your blood and</v>

268
00:08:06.481 --> 00:08:07.290
<v Speaker 2>by heating it,</v>

269
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.250
<v Speaker 2>it produces some.</v>

270
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.511
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

271
00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:10.201
<v Speaker 2>If you're a doctor,</v>

272
00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry that I'm butchering this if you're a scientist,</v>

273
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think it produces some sort of a anti-inflammatory serum because your</v>

274
00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:21.930
<v Speaker 2>blood is reacting to the heat.</v>

275
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.351
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

276
00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Here's the explains.</v>

277
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.610
<v Speaker 2>I've had this done and it was really effective.</v>

278
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.473
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

279
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

280
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Serum removed from the layer and cultured with glass beads so that a white,</v>

281
00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:32.461
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

282
00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:35.340
<v Speaker 2>white blood cells per two s I r a p,</v>

283
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Speaker 2>which is a natural anti inflammatory</v>

284
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.180
<v Speaker 3>glass beads going into your knee.</v>

285
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what that's saying.</v>

286
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 2>It says serum was removed from this layer and cultured with glass beads.</v>

287
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 2>So that's removed after the platelet rich plasma.</v>

288
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 2>So they make platelet rich plasma,</v>

289
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 2>they get the serum and then they,</v>

290
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 2>and then they culture it.</v>

291
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.980
<v Speaker 2>So that the white blood cells produced this natural antiinflammatory.</v>

292
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 2>So they trick the white blood cells,</v>

293
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe,</v>

294
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word.</v>

295
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.031
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

296
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:03.864
<v Speaker 2>so this shit,</v>

297
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 2>it's really good for,</v>

298
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

299
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 2>accelerating your recovery process for an injury.</v>

300
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people like do it like while they,</v>

301
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 2>if they get surgery,</v>

302
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 2>they get surgery and then they have some of this done to,</v>

303
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 2>it accelerates the healing.</v>

304
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

305
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Especially as you get older,</v>

306
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.680
<v Speaker 2>it just provides you with any,</v>

307
00:09:21.681 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 2>it's actually natural to,</v>

308
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry about it,</v>

309
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:28.641
<v Speaker 2>but it provides you with this just an extra boost of healing for weird neck</v>

310
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 2>injuries and back injuries.</v>

311
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:31.940
<v Speaker 2>People like it for,</v>

312
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 2>it's really good.</v>

313
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Really good for lower back injuries.</v>

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:37.450
<v Speaker 3>And so then they,</v>

317
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:37.811
<v Speaker 3>did they,</v>

318
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:38.501

319
00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:40.270
<v Speaker 3>They shoot the blend into the area?</v>

320
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

321
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.560
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

322
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

323
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:42.760
<v Speaker 2>it's freaky.</v>

324
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.550
<v Speaker 2>They put this little needle in you and then they screw the blood cap in there</v>

325
00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:45.851
<v Speaker 2>and it's a,</v>

326
00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:47.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like now it's yellow.</v>

327
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like this yellow senior and they squirted into your back and you're like,</v>

328
00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

329
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 2>damn weird.</v>

330
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

331
00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:54.154
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

332
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.440
<v Speaker 2>I think they would do my cock thicken it up for you,</v>

333
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.190
<v Speaker 2>but I want your blood in my car,</v>

334
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.610
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

335
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's legal.</v>

336
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.150
<v Speaker 2>You can sell all kinds of things.</v>

337
00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:07.331
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

338
00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:09.010
<v Speaker 2>but you can't sell somebody your own blood.</v>

339
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

340
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

341
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he could sell your own blood?</v>

342
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

343
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.170
<v Speaker 2>if you want to walk a blood bank,</v>

344
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

345
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:15.791
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

346
00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:16.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a website you could probably do.</v>

347
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.433
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

348
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

349
00:10:18.791 --> 00:10:19.624
<v Speaker 2>like a dark web.</v>

350
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And that whole myth about selling people's kids.</v>

351
00:10:21.911 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

352
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.461
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

353
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 3>William Shatner would be dealing it if he could.</v>

354
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:24.981
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

355
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:25.130
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

356
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 2>If you could just like,</v>

357
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Speaker 2>if someone was selling blood,</v>

358
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 2>like some,</v>

359
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

360
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.270
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those,</v>

361
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

362
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.610
<v Speaker 2>young enterprising young gals on the internet that smelled like dirty socks.</v>

363
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

364
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.770

365
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.603
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

366
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.760
<v Speaker 2>they sell toenail clippers and share it.</v>

367
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

368
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.343
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

369
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:44.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

370
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

371
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Nothing goes to waste.</v>

372
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

373
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 2>nothing goes full.</v>

374
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Blood for sale is illegal.</v>

375
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:51.361
<v Speaker 2>Red Market.</v>

376
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:51.901
<v Speaker 2>What is this,</v>

377
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

378
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

379
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:53.124
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

380
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.443
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

381
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it like medically though.</v>

382
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.283
<v Speaker 2>In an alleyway.</v>

383
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

384
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 2>But that's how they do it there,</v>

385
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:00.751
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

386
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:01.584
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

387
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Is there still a ban on a</v>

388
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Haitian people and gay people giving blood?</v>

389
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good question because they've,</v>

390
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 2>they've gotten so close to stopping HIV,</v>

391
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 2>they can get it like not it correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

392
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 2>they can get it like to you to the point where you're,</v>

393
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.980
<v Speaker 2>you can't even detect it.</v>

394
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.873
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

395
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.103
<v Speaker 2>Which is incredible.</v>

396
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

397
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.980
<v Speaker 3>And then now in the third world,</v>

398
00:11:26.981 --> 00:11:27.401
<v Speaker 3>because my,</v>

399
00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:27.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

400
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 3>my friend Peter Current,</v>

401
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.740
<v Speaker 3>he lives in a symbolic way and uh,</v>

402
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.330
<v Speaker 3>now Mozambique and he used to work for the health department in La County.</v>

403
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:40.330
<v Speaker 3>He was the guy that was in charge of AIDS prevention.</v>

404
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 3>And so he got a job working over in Africa and he said that you can now cure,</v>

405
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.341
<v Speaker 3>not cure,</v>

406
00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:53.341
<v Speaker 3>but stabilize somebody with HIV with a pill that's like $60 a month</v>

407
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

408
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

409
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>They've got the price way down in Africa now.</v>

411
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

412
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Why is there's so many cases of HIV in Africa?</v>

413
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.893
<v Speaker 5>MMM.</v>

414
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

415
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I think when nutrition is poor but then there's more cutting and bleeding</v>

416
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.300
<v Speaker 1>because I had heard that a lot of what you see in terms of like a,</v>

417
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.910
<v Speaker 1>if they're talking about aids in Africa,</v>

418
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.580
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

419
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.270
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to put aids,</v>

420
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.970
<v Speaker 1>like put like that category aids,</v>

421
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:27.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

422
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.960
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes it's just people with damaged immune systems from a host of</v>

423
00:12:30.961 --> 00:12:35.100
<v Speaker 1>different diseases that it's sometimes the people aren't getting tested.</v>

424
00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I was wondered like how many of those people are tested for HIV?</v>

425
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.071
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

426
00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:38.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

427
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.283
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

428
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:40.161
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

429
00:12:40.161 --> 00:12:43.920
<v Speaker 1>the fact that a guy like magic Johnson has had it since you remember when you</v>

430
00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:46.440
<v Speaker 1>heard Magic Johnson had I was in a panic.</v>

431
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

432
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was a Zombie movie.</v>

433
00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Like it's happened.</v>

434
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.480
<v Speaker 1>It started and then people are just going to get it.</v>

435
00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:52.620
<v Speaker 1>We're all gonna die of AIDS.</v>

436
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Everybody what our generation when you and I were like 21.</v>

437
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody thought.</v>

438
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to die from AIDS right now.</v>

439
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Magic Johnson's looks great.</v>

440
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

441
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:01.970
<v Speaker 1>He's still alive.</v>

442
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I think of how many people have died.</v>

444
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.870
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have HIV and we're worried about this one thing.</v>

445
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I remember he wanted to play in the all star game and all the players were like,</v>

446
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:11.821
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

447
00:13:11.821 --> 00:13:12.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

448
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a slam dunk contest.</v>

449
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.453
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

450
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

451
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.480
<v Speaker 1>But what did,</v>

452
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.720
<v Speaker 1>what did fucking Damon Wayans you used to have a bit about Dennis Rodman</v>

453
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:30.740
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

454
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.070
<v Speaker 1>It's about Dennis Rodman spitting in Magic Johnson's mouth to accelerate his</v>

455
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:35.904
<v Speaker 1>symptoms.</v>

456
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.810
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

457
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.910
<v Speaker 1>if he wanted to try to get hardcore with them,</v>

458
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I hope Damon's,</v>

459
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge Damon Wayans fan,</v>

460
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.120
<v Speaker 1>so I hope I'm not butchering his bid.</v>

461
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

462
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think that was one.</v>

463
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I know that was his line.</v>

464
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll spit your mouth and accelerate your symptom.</v>

465
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

466
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm Damon Wayans.</v>

467
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:03.360
<v Speaker 1>My opinion is like one of the most ignored greats.</v>

468
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100%.</v>

469
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I used to open for him sometimes and uh,</v>

470
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.761
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>

471
00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I remember him coming in on a Thursday night.</v>

472
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.390
<v Speaker 1>It was Thursday to Sunday.</v>

473
00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Faneuil hall comedy connection.</v>

474
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Thursday night he comes in fucking yellow pads.</v>

475
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.490
<v Speaker 1>He goes up and just regurgitates a new hour and gets okay,</v>

476
00:14:23.491 --> 00:14:25.020
<v Speaker 1>laugh for a new hour.</v>

477
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Friday night,</v>

478
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.140
<v Speaker 1>he comes back tighter,</v>

479
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.910
<v Speaker 1>tighter Sunday night.</v>

480
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like he would fucking destroy with a new hour.</v>

481
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.170
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

482
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.270
<v Speaker 1>He's really good,</v>

483
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:36.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

484
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

485
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.650
<v Speaker 1>He would go,</v>

486
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:42.650
<v Speaker 1>he would just go up at the comedy store and literally let whatever thought came</v>

487
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:48.000
<v Speaker 1>into his head and he would take long sets and he would take that stuff and he</v>

488
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:51.030
<v Speaker 1>would turn that stuff into killer closing bits.</v>

489
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

490
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>But for whatever</v>

491
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.371
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

492
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I think he just got into doing sitcoms more.</v>

493
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was going to be the original cast.</v>

634
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I might've been part of the original cast.</v>

635
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.461
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

636
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:30.670
<v Speaker 1>What happened was Jennifer Lopez,</v>

637
00:18:30.671 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 1>do you want to be a fly girl?</v>

<v Speaker 1>she should jump on that shit.</v>

643
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 1>That would be cool if she jumped back in was a fly girl again.</v>

644
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean how much time would it take?</v>

645
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.270
<v Speaker 1>How much time she's there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know who else was a flag around any other famous ones.</v>

654
00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 1>That show was so good.</v>

655
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching it.</v>

656
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I was playing pool in Yonkers,</v>

657
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:00.384
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

658
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.730
<v Speaker 1>and I looked up at this,</v>

659
00:19:01.731 --> 00:19:05.730
<v Speaker 1>this TV set and it was a Jim Carrey doing the,</v>

660
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.863
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

661
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.950

00:19:09.191 --> 00:19:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

664
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.691
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

665
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.220
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

666
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

667
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got a burnt up face.</v>

668
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.343
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

669
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Rosie Perez was the choreograph choreographer for the first four seasons.</v>

670
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

671
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.981
<v Speaker 1>You know Rosie Perez,</v>

672
00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 1>a giant boxing fan.</v>

673
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

674
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Giant boxing,</v>

675
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

676
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

677
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.431
<v Speaker 1>Like people,</v>

678
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>like she's like a boxing expert,</v>

679
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 1>not like an expert.</v>

680
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Like she could train fighters,</v>

681
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 1>but like people asked her questions about boxing.</v>

682
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 1>She's a real enthusiast.</v>

683
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a better term instead of an expert.</v>

684
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:36.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

685
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe she is an expert,</v>

686
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:38.514
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

687
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.011
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

688
00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

689
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.440
<v Speaker 1>she is always around box.</v>

690
00:19:41.441 --> 00:19:42.031
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so,</v>

691
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:46.210
<v Speaker 1>because you always think of her as having that cute voice and you know,</v>

692
00:19:46.211 --> 00:19:49.760
<v Speaker 1>and all those comedies and to see her at like boxing matches a really,</v>

693
00:19:49.761 --> 00:19:50.300
<v Speaker 1>really into it.</v>

694
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

695
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.833
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

696
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.423
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

697
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

698
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:54.871
<v Speaker 1>and Jim Carrey,</v>

699
00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:55.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

700
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

701
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:56.310
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

702
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.971
<v Speaker 1>he would do the,</v>

703
00:19:56.971 --> 00:19:57.570

707
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.950
<v Speaker 1>So different than like,</v>

708
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to go back to Jerry Lewis to think about somebody doing physical</v>

709
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:09.000

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they have a character like this.</v>

737
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.780
<v Speaker 1>It was so over the top.</v>

738
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Jim Carrey or maybe,</v>

739
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.600
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

740
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 6>the one of the Wayne's brothers has bought up the rights for reruns because they</v>

741
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 6>don't want that</v>

742
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.073
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

743
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

744
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:57.540
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

745
00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a different era.</v>

746
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.600
<v Speaker 2>You have to accept as a different era.</v>

747
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.513
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

748
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.503
<v Speaker 2>people were different.</v>

749
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

750
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.370
<v Speaker 2>people are changing and it's a really interesting obvious sign that things that</v>

751
00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:09.630
<v Speaker 2>were super acceptable.</v>

752
00:21:09.631 --> 00:21:11.760
<v Speaker 2>And when was this in living color?</v>

753
00:21:11.761 --> 00:21:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was like 92,</v>

754
00:21:14.101 --> 00:21:15.090
<v Speaker 2>90 to 94.</v>

755
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.230
<v Speaker 2>90 and 94.</v>

756
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

757
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.680
<v Speaker 2>So that the way you could do certain bits and what you'd get away with and put</v>

758
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:23.851
<v Speaker 2>on television,</v>

759
00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:24.684
<v Speaker 2>it was just different.</v>

760
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.240
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's one of the,</v>

761
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.300
<v Speaker 2>like probably one of the least understood things that's happening with us with</v>

762
00:21:32.941 --> 00:21:34.380
<v Speaker 2>social media is,</v>

763
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.770
<v Speaker 2>is the rapid evolution of what's acceptable,</v>

764
00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:38.970
<v Speaker 2>not acceptable anymore.</v>

765
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's changing very quickly in terms of subjects,</v>

766
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.270
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the way you approach things,</v>

767
00:21:45.271 --> 00:21:49.350
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like obvious bigotry or obvious bias.</v>

768
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:51.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's all getting very highlighted.</v>

769
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.411
<v Speaker 6>Well the,</v>

770
00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:57.411
<v Speaker 6>I think the big question is whether or not you see an artist as somebody who's</v>

771
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.620
<v Speaker 6>taking their inner vision.</v>

772
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.620
<v Speaker 6>And putting it out and you go for the ride or you don't,</v>

773
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.150
<v Speaker 6>or is it,</v>

774
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.980
<v Speaker 6>are we supposed to be representing society in our standup or is it all supposed</v>

775
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 6>to be fair,</v>

776
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.860
<v Speaker 6>balanced representations of different ethnic groups and genders,</v>

777
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

778
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:15.821
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

779
00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:16.654
<v Speaker 6>and it's like,</v>

780
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.060
<v Speaker 6>when did it all have to become a morality tale?</v>

781
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 6>When did every depiction of every race have to be fair?</v>

782
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.833
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

783
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.870
<v Speaker 6>can't you have an asshole who's black?</v>

784
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 6>Can't you have a killer who's gay without it becoming a depiction of that</v>

785
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:31.834
<v Speaker 6>entire,</v>

786
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:32.703
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

787
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.603
<v Speaker 6>subgroup?</v>

788
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

789
00:22:34.261 --> 00:22:35.094
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

790
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:35.920
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

791
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.510
<v Speaker 2>what are our real problem is that prejudice does exist.</v>

792
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.800
<v Speaker 2>So when it does exist,</v>

793
00:22:40.801 --> 00:22:43.020
<v Speaker 2>you kind of look for it and things and you say,</v>

794
00:22:43.021 --> 00:22:43.650
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

795
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.780
<v Speaker 2>this has the characteristics of prejudice.</v>

796
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.980
<v Speaker 2>I see this here.</v>

797
00:22:46.981 --> 00:22:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're doing here.</v>

798
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.680
<v Speaker 2>That I think this is prejudice.</v>

799
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.161
<v Speaker 2>We say,</v>

800
00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:50.311
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

801
00:22:50.311 --> 00:22:50.371
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

802
00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:50.581
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

803
00:22:50.581 --> 00:22:52.710
<v Speaker 2>This is making fun of Puerto Rican men.</v>

804
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.360
<v Speaker 2>This is not prejudice.</v>

805
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

806
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

807
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

808
00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:00.990
<v Speaker 2>an account of real occurrences that I've turned into humor.</v>

809
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

810
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:01.620
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

811
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.890
<v Speaker 2>the flamboyant masculinity of Puerto Rican men.</v>

812
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean like in New York,</v>

813
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.630
<v Speaker 2>like that's if you,</v>

814
00:23:09.631 --> 00:23:13.980
<v Speaker 2>if you thought of a type of a Latino sort of,</v>

815
00:23:13.981 --> 00:23:14.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

816
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.870
<v Speaker 2>the bravado,</v>

817
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

818
00:23:16.321 --> 00:23:17.370
<v Speaker 2>the music,</v>

819
00:23:17.371 --> 00:23:18.031
<v Speaker 2>the food,</v>

820
00:23:18.031 --> 00:23:19.260
<v Speaker 2>everything spicy.</v>

821
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Like if you can't make fun of that.</v>

822
00:23:21.331 --> 00:23:21.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

823
00:23:21.511 --> 00:23:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

824
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.560
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>

825
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.080
<v Speaker 6>I Know Collin Quinn does a whole thing about how racist,</v>

826
00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:25.380
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

827
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.330
<v Speaker 6>Puerto Ricans who never inside or outside,</v>

828
00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:28.164
<v Speaker 6>they're always both.</v>

829
00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.130
<v Speaker 6>There's always a window open to people on the inside and outside of dogging.</v>

830
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.080
<v Speaker 6>The car door is always open.</v>

831
00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:35.130
<v Speaker 6>They're half in the car.</v>

832
00:23:35.131 --> 00:23:36.150
<v Speaker 6>They're half right.</v>

833
00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:37.350
<v Speaker 6>This isn't racist.</v>

834
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.670
<v Speaker 6>This is observation.</v>

835
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.070
<v Speaker 6>Can I take an option rate?</v>

836
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.790
<v Speaker 6>Can I tell you that yesterday,</v>

837
00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:42.720
<v Speaker 6>about twice a week,</v>

838
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 6>I go to this Japanese market in Mar Vista and they've got all different</v>

839
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.761
<v Speaker 3>kinds of,</v>

840
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

841
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:47.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

842
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:52.721
<v Speaker 3>you can get Sushi tempura whatever the parking lot for this place,</v>

843
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:58.541
<v Speaker 3>because 80% of the people that are Asian film it and put it on a fucking</v>

844
00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.601
<v Speaker 3>television channel.</v>

845
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:00.320
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

846
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 3>it is just people.</v>

847
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you produce it?</v>

848
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.000
<v Speaker 3>I could announce it like I was Adj Foy.</v>

849
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.810
<v Speaker 2>You're an Emmy award winning writer.</v>

850
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.580
<v Speaker 2>You could actually do something like that.</v>

851
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.050
<v Speaker 2>You're like a legit writer,</v>

852
00:24:11.051 --> 00:24:12.310
<v Speaker 2>you could totally produce that.</v>

853
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine announced it like Nascar?</v>

854
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.090
<v Speaker 3>It's just people like not getting how to get out of a parking spot with us</v>

855
00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:24.091
<v Speaker 3>taking like eight k turns and people on the wrong side of the street and backing</v>

856
00:24:24.251 --> 00:24:27.100
<v Speaker 3>up without looking over the shoulders and they're all Asian and it's fucking</v>

857
00:24:27.101 --> 00:24:27.910
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>

858
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.600
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

859
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.830
<v Speaker 3>I didn't tell them to do it.</v>

860
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.690
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say it was wrong,</v>

861
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:33.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's happening.</v>

862
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:34.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

863
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Dave explained it,</v>

864
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

865
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.210
<v Speaker 2>why it's a stereotype,</v>

866
00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:42.150
<v Speaker 2>but why also why Asian people would,</v>

867
00:24:42.151 --> 00:24:42.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

868
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.720
<v Speaker 2>be more likely to walk straight.</v>

869
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.890
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

870
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.521
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>

871
00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:50.670
<v Speaker 2>if you go to China or if you go to any of those,</v>

872
00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:50.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

873
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Asian company,</v>

874
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:51.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

875
00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Asian countries,</v>

876
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.900
<v Speaker 2>when people walk straight at each other,</v>

877
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.570
<v Speaker 2>they all kind of have this way of touching and they just,</v>

878
00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.590
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people,</v>

879
00:24:58.591 --> 00:25:00.270
<v Speaker 2>they're just grinding past each other,</v>

880
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

881
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

882
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:01.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

883
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

884
00:25:01.411 --> 00:25:04.020
<v Speaker 2>So when you're in China in particular,</v>

885
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.590
<v Speaker 2>people are like indifferent to bumping into you.</v>

886
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.180
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bother them at all.</v>

887
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.350
<v Speaker 2>They just bump into you.</v>

888
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.851
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

889
00:25:10.851 --> 00:25:12.540
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the aisle of a plane,</v>

890
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:13.830
<v Speaker 2>they just bump into you.</v>

891
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

892
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.851
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll do it.</v>

893
00:25:14.851 --> 00:25:16.550
<v Speaker 2>The little kids just walk right through it.</v>

894
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

895
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.491
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

896
00:25:17.491 --> 00:25:18.271
<v Speaker 2>that's how they did.</v>

897
00:25:18.271 --> 00:25:19.104
<v Speaker 2>It's not rude.</v>

898
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Just like how's culturally different?</v>

899
00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:20.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

900
00:25:20.761 --> 00:25:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's more crowded.</v>

901
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you comment on that?</v>

902
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Or couldn't you comment on that?</v>

903
00:25:24.781 --> 00:25:25.614
<v Speaker 2>If that's a real thing,</v>

904
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.610
<v Speaker 2>because that is a real thing.</v>

905
00:25:26.611 --> 00:25:27.450
<v Speaker 2>They do do that.</v>

906
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

907
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.610
<v Speaker 2>They also do a lot of great stuff.</v>

908
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:29.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

909
00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:30.780
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you're not,</v>

910
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a negative judgment on the entire race because they have this one</v>

911
00:25:34.051 --> 00:25:34.884
<v Speaker 2>characteristic.</v>

912
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.920
<v Speaker 2>But to ignore that one characteristic seems crazy.</v>

913
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:38.881
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

914
00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:41.190
<v Speaker 2>why can't I talk about something like,</v>

915
00:25:41.191 --> 00:25:41.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

916
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not mean I'm not a bad person to talk about a real thing that you see.</v>

917
00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:47.010
<v Speaker 2>And I see.</v>

918
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

919
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:48.600
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

920
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.300
<v Speaker 3>I get booed on stage sometimes.</v>

921
00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Now that never used to happen for what?</v>

922
00:25:53.401 --> 00:25:54.234
<v Speaker 3>What'd he say?</v>

923
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.890
<v Speaker 3>I did a joke.</v>

924
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.060
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to say the joke,</v>

925
00:25:57.061 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 3>but just say it.</v>

926
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't care because I don't think it's offensive,</v>

927
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.111
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

928
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:03.510
<v Speaker 3>but this person did and it was uh,</v>

929
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's girl scout cookie season.</v>

933
00:26:06.961 --> 00:26:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Those little horrors are out there popping up their tables wherever you are</v>

934
00:26:10.231 --> 00:26:11.550
<v Speaker 3>selling those stale,</v>

935
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.320
<v Speaker 3>shitty,</v>

936
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.153
<v Speaker 3>overpriced.</v>

937
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.570
<v Speaker 3>But you buy them cause it makes you feel good.</v>

938
00:26:15.571 --> 00:26:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Like you're a good person,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

940
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.250
<v Speaker 3>and then you walk through the parking lot and some black kid comes up with a box</v>

941
00:26:20.251 --> 00:26:21.270

951
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm commenting on a very real thing.</v>

952
00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 3>My entire life I have bought girl scout and I have</v>

953
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 7>not always bought that fucking snickers bar in the subway or the,</v>

954
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.170
<v Speaker 7>sometimes I do.</v>

955
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:51.481
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

956
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:52.970
<v Speaker 7>the girl scout cookies.</v>

957
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 7>It's universally accepted.</v>

958
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:56.850
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

959
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:57.683
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

960
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.360
<v Speaker 7>But they only have like the ones that are like are the ones that,</v>

961
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.020
<v Speaker 7>it's like a coconut one with someone.</v>

962
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 7>I like chocolate on it on that one.</v>

963
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.260
<v Speaker 7>This one's pretty good Karma.</v>

964
00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 7>Allen's pretty as a legit,</v>

965
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.970
<v Speaker 7>but they've got one called</v>

966
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.100
<v Speaker 7>the muff,</v>

969
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:17.490
<v Speaker 7>you don't have to participate.</v>

970
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.980
<v Speaker 7>Like when kids come over with chocolate or candy.</v>

971
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:20.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:24.420
<v Speaker 7>which you kind of have to buy girl scout cookies.</v>

977
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:25.430
<v Speaker 7>You want to support the girls camp,</v>

978
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.760
<v Speaker 7>but you know it's such a scam.</v>

979
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 7>All that money goes to the manufacturer.</v>

980
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:32.370
<v Speaker 7>Apparently the girl scouts make like 20% of the the cookie money.</v>

981
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.821
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>

982
00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:33.001
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 7>some ruthless man.</v>

988
00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:40.650

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 7>With a cold glass of milk.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Why do they have to be so bad for you?</v>

1003
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.823
<v Speaker 7>When I was,</v>

1004
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.410
<v Speaker 7>when I was working on a TV show,</v>

1005
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.520
<v Speaker 7>one of the producers had a daughter who was in the girl scouts and I guess you</v>

1006
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:10.380

1008
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:18.000
<v Speaker 7>So when the audience would stream out after the show is a daily Shell and the</v>

1009
00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:23.001
<v Speaker 7>audience was stream out and the girl had a table set up to sell our cookies and</v>

1010
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:28.071
<v Speaker 7>she was selling a hundred boxes a day and for every day she was there,</v>

1012
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 7>and they would have the audience,</v>

1013
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:38.460
<v Speaker 7>a warm up guy like plug it during the shell,</v>

1014
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:39.241
<v Speaker 7>like after the shit,</v>

1015
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:41.400
<v Speaker 7>like a comedian selling his cds after the show,</v>

1016
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:45.180
<v Speaker 7>he could buy some girl scout cookies on the way out and all these,</v>

1017
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.920
<v Speaker 7>all these fat people from the Midwest,</v>

1018
00:28:46.921 --> 00:28:48.570
<v Speaker 7>they're like Kooky,</v>

1019
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.420
<v Speaker 7>like Marie Callender's died.</v>

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.750
<v Speaker 7>Just have pie.</v>

1021
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 7>Just Pie chess pie.</v>

1022
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.013
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

1023
00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 7>Not even good pie.</v>

1024
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.941
<v Speaker 7>It's good,</v>

1025
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:01.890
<v Speaker 7>but it's not great considering it's all they do.</v>

1026
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.120
<v Speaker 7>I should have eaten there.</v>

1027
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 7>I don't think I've ever eaten there.</v>

1028
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.290
<v Speaker 7>Maybe one.</v>

1029
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.290
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

1030
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 7>I don't think I had their pie.</v>

1031
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.840
<v Speaker 7>That seems a weird thing.</v>

<v Speaker 7>You're going to go broke.</v>

1037
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 7>But they're everywhere.</v>

1038

<v Speaker 7>We know you have an element.</v>

1039

1040
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:26.130

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.860
<v Speaker 7>Like how genius is that company?</v>

1042
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.220
<v Speaker 7>Admins member Edmonds intimates but then they,</v>

1043
00:29:32.221 --> 00:29:32.730
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

1044
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.481
<v Speaker 7>they broke out.</v>

1045
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 7>They started doing cakes and cookies too,</v>

1046
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:35.490
<v Speaker 7>but they all,</v>

1047
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.200
<v Speaker 7>they did just pies for a long time.</v>

1048
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.591
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>

1049
00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 7>They used to have this,</v>

1050
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.780
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1051
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.850
<v Speaker 7>God dammit this pastry.</v>

1052
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of what the hell it was,</v>

1053
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 2>but it had like,</v>

1054
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.750
<v Speaker 2>like hard sugar on the outside of it and then it had some sort of creamy sweet</v>

1055
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 2>stuff on the inside of it.</v>

1056
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1057
00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Was it good?</v>

1058
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

1060
00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 2>We lived off that shit.</v>

1061
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 2>We ain't meds every night.</v>

1062
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:00.964
<v Speaker 2>They had like,</v>

1063
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.450
<v Speaker 2>they had one that had like a chocolate filling in it and it was powdered outsize</v>

1064
00:30:05.451 --> 00:30:07.620
<v Speaker 2>filled mine.</v>

1065
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 2>They went out of business and then they say,</v>

1066
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 2>oh that was the cheese one.</v>

1067
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.580
<v Speaker 2>That was a good one too.</v>

1068
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I remember that cheese filled crumb.</v>

1069
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

1070
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 2>they had some ridiculously delicious shit.</v>

1071
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1072
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.330
<v Speaker 2>What are the other big ones?</v>

1073
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.291
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1074
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I decided to fight in a tournament once because a,</v>

1075
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I had a crazy sugar high from Dunkin donuts.</v>

1076
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I'd hurt myself or hurt,</v>

1077
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1078
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.950
<v Speaker 2>something in my crotch and I couldn't work out for like a week.</v>

1079
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Pulled some sort of a muscle and there was a big tournament that was coming up.</v>

1080
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:37.930
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1081
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:38.300
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1082
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1083
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.031
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

1084
00:30:39.031 --> 00:30:40.060
<v Speaker 2>the guys that are competed with,</v>

1085
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:40.811
<v Speaker 2>we're going to this tournament.</v>

1086
00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 2>It was like I had just fought like a week before.</v>

1087
00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:43.451
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1088
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I can do it.</v>

1089
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:44.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1090
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't feel right.</v>

1091
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna take the whole week off.</v>

1092
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 2>So I decided I'm just going to take off,</v>

1093
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 2>let this thing heal.</v>

1094
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:50.951
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1095
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:51.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1096
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:56.050
<v Speaker 2>delivering my newspapers and I go to Dunkin donuts and I got this powdered lemon</v>

1097
00:30:56.051 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 2>filled donut.</v>

1098
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I got one of those and I got a,</v>

1099
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:00.950
<v Speaker 2>a Boston cream donut,</v>

1100
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.443
<v Speaker 2>one of those.</v>

1101
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.010
<v Speaker 2>And I got a,</v>

1102
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I ate like three donuts cause I'd be exhausted,</v>

1103
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 2>tired,</v>

1104
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:08.800
<v Speaker 2>drinking coffee,</v>

1105
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:10.750
<v Speaker 2>delivering fucking newspapers for three hours.</v>

1106
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 2>And I was so jacked on sugar and coffee that I said,</v>

1107
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:16.271
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1108
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:17.104
<v Speaker 2>I want to fight.</v>

1109
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.250
<v Speaker 2>And so I drove,</v>

1110
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I drove into town like right before everybody was leaving.</v>

1111
00:31:23.371 --> 00:31:23.681
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

1112
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:24.430
<v Speaker 2>why are you here?</v>

1113
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.781
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1114
00:31:24.781 --> 00:31:25.840
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to fight anyway,</v>

1115
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:26.674
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1116
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.050
<v Speaker 2>like Beavis and Butthead,</v>

1117
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.980
<v Speaker 2>I won.</v>

1118
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.873
<v Speaker 2>I won the tournament.</v>

1119
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Giant tournament for me it was big.</v>

1120
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It was the American open.</v>

1121
00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:36.004
<v Speaker 2>It was like a big,</v>

1122
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.053
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal.</v>

1123
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1124
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1125
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't going to do it.</v>

1126
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I got jacked up on sugar and made a rash decision.</v>

1127
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I can see you winning the first match but then,</v>

1128
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.410
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

1129
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 2>then you crash.</v>

1130
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1131
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.010
<v Speaker 2>you got to keep fighting.</v>

1132
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 2>No it didn't.</v>

1133
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.650
<v Speaker 2>It worked out somehow or another,</v>

1134
00:31:50.651 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I guess I ate when I got there too,</v>

1135
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.820
<v Speaker 2>but also the week off I had never done that.</v>

1136
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Like taking a week off.</v>

1137
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when you do something like that where you,</v>

1138
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 2>if you exercise too much,</v>

1139
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:05.800
<v Speaker 2>you really always in a state of recovery and your body doesn't get a chance to</v>

1140
00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:07.600
<v Speaker 2>like fully charged back up again.</v>

1141
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.430
<v Speaker 2>So at the time I was probably 19 and I was going hard like every day,</v>

1142
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.191
<v Speaker 2>every day that I could.</v>

1143
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 2>So I'd never really taken a week off.</v>

1144
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 2>So taking a week off and just be like,</v>

1145
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:16.240
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1146
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:16.800
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1147
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I did take a week off when I started getting laid.</v>

1148
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 2>That is one thing that happened the first time he got late.</v>

1150
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.590
<v Speaker 2>When I first started getting laid,</v>

1152
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 2>I took a long time off and get yelled at.</v>

1153
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I yelled and I wasn't doing any training.</v>

1155
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I came back all tanned and shit.</v>

1156
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 2>All he did was fuck a workout at</v>

1157
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.581
<v Speaker 3>that age.</v>

1158
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:41.414
<v Speaker 3>That's a workout.</v>

1159
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.600
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1160
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 3>Th those weren't 20 minutes sessions.</v>

1161
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.980
<v Speaker 2>It's weird how your,</v>

1162
00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:49.250
<v Speaker 2>your body changes from no,</v>

1163
00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.430
<v Speaker 2>no urge to fuck to like fucking is your whole life.</v>

1164
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're 18 years old,</v>

1165
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.420
<v Speaker 2>it's your whole life.</v>

1166
00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Like you found the craziest drug ever.</v>

1167
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.010
<v Speaker 2>And like two years ago,</v>

1169
00:33:02.011 --> 00:33:02.910
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't in your life.</v>

1170
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden it's in your life and then all of a sudden you're having</v>

1171
00:33:05.851 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 2>sex and you're like,</v>

1172
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that.</v>

1173
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.000
<v Speaker 3>And you can't believe that,</v>

1175
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:14.140
<v Speaker 3>that women are letting you do it because for years they were stopping you and</v>

1176
00:33:14.141 --> 00:33:15.520
<v Speaker 3>now they're initiating.</v>

1177
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1178
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Can't leave.</v>

1179
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:17.221
<v Speaker 2>They want it.</v>

1180
00:33:17.221 --> 00:33:18.510
<v Speaker 2>You actually want me to fuck you.</v>

1181
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.740
<v Speaker 2>This is what you like.</v>

1183
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1185
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1186
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.980
<v Speaker 2>It feels wrong.</v>

1187
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.190
<v Speaker 2>But if you insist it feels wrong that you like it.</v>

1188
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.760
<v Speaker 2>This is a weird mentality that we think it's wrong that they like,</v>

1189
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 2>is that a Christian thing?</v>

1190
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.040
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>

1191
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it has to do with,</v>

1192
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:34.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1193
00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 2>initially if you read sex at dawn a,</v>

1194
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.550
<v Speaker 2>he's got a really interesting series of uh,</v>

1195
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.470
<v Speaker 2>thoughts on the origins of sexual behavior and why,</v>

1196
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:50.310
<v Speaker 2>why we all sort of have adopted this one thing now.</v>

1197
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.480
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

1198
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.313
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you,</v>

1199
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Christian.</v>

1200
00:33:53.651 --> 00:33:54.670
<v Speaker 3>I know it is for me.</v>

1201
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.181
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1202
00:33:55.181 --> 00:33:55.661
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of,</v>

1203
00:33:55.661 --> 00:33:55.840
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1204
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.620
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of shame</v>

1205
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.453
<v Speaker 2>about all that stuff.</v>

1206
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it has to do with people getting pregnant too.</v>

1207
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it had to do with,</v>

1209
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:07.850
<v Speaker 2>it was too easy for a girl to get pregnant and if a girl got pregnant back when</v>

1210
00:34:07.851 --> 00:34:10.820
<v Speaker 2>people were fucking just barely making it out of the caves.</v>

1211
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1212
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.430
<v Speaker 2>It was either really good cause he had food or it was a real burden because you</v>

1213
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 2>had to take care of this baby now,</v>

1214
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.071
<v Speaker 2>now you're,</v>

1215
00:34:18.071 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be gathering food for us.</v>

1216
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1217
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a lot of that going on.</v>

1218
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 2>So if you were going to be with a person and you've decided to make babies,</v>

1219
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.900
<v Speaker 2>you got to be sure that this person is going to be there and take care of</v>

1220
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:30.890
<v Speaker 2>everything and you're,</v>

1221
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you're all set up.</v>

1222
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 2>So you can't just be banging a bunch of guys on the side and having kids with</v>

1224
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:35.361
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

1225
00:34:35.361 --> 00:34:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Then who's going to raise your kids?</v>

1226
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.333
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1227
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Speaker 2>This guy's going to come over and talk to his kid and he's gonna come over and</v>

1228
00:34:40.101 --> 00:34:40.934
<v Speaker 2>talk to his kid.</v>

1229
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 2>That'd becomes a problem.</v>

1231
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1232
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

1233
00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.070
<v Speaker 3>and the amazing thing is that having kids back then for guys,</v>

1234
00:34:48.071 --> 00:34:51.490
<v Speaker 3>the reason why guys stuck around was,</v>

1235
00:34:51.491 --> 00:34:51.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1236
00:34:51.791 --> 00:34:54.460
<v Speaker 3>we have 401k is an IRA accounts back then.</v>

1237
00:34:54.461 --> 00:34:55.294
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you,</v>

1238
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.920
<v Speaker 3>when you couldn't gather anymore,</v>

1239
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:58.870
<v Speaker 3>you are at the mercy of charity.</v>

1240
00:34:58.871 --> 00:35:00.130
<v Speaker 3>And so if you had a lot of kids,</v>

1241
00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:02.740
<v Speaker 3>you had a chance of being able to actually live into your old age.</v>

1242
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1243
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:03.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1244
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.500
<v Speaker 2>They would take care of you.</v>

1245
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:07.800
<v Speaker 2>It's also interesting too,</v>

1247
00:35:07.801 --> 00:35:12.801
<v Speaker 2>because there was so much infant mortality back then that there was a a lot of</v>

1248
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:16.560
<v Speaker 2>places where there's real good evidence that they had fertility cults,</v>

1249
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:21.390
<v Speaker 2>like they were trying to figure out ways to get pregnant more and easier,</v>

1250
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.920
<v Speaker 2>and they're just trying to have a bunch of kids.</v>

1251
00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:23.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Because kids were,</v>

1253
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:24.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1254
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.100
<v Speaker 2>kids tied a lot.</v>

1255
00:35:26.101 --> 00:35:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Then yeah,</v>

1257
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.840
<v Speaker 2>that died from injury and sickness and a lot of people died from sickness,</v>

1258
00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:31.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1259
00:35:31.081 --> 00:35:32.190
<v Speaker 2>no vaccines.</v>

1260
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1261
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.960
<v Speaker 2>When you just at the mercy,</v>

1262
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.810
<v Speaker 2>and then also it's the beginning of agriculture.</v>

1263
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 2>All these diseases are emerging that we don't have immune systems for it because</v>

1264
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:41.334
<v Speaker 2>they're being,</v>

1265
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.600
<v Speaker 2>they're being jumped from like they're there,</v>

1266
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 2>they're jumping from pigs to people.</v>

1267
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 2>They're jumping from chickens and birds to people.</v>

1268
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 2>That's where the source of most of these pandemic diseases come from.</v>

1269
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 2>It comes from large scale agriculture,</v>

1270
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.300
<v Speaker 2>those funky pigs all tucked together in these little cages.</v>

1271
00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't come for free.</v>

1272
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some demons are being brewed in that mix.</v>

1273
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:36:02.461 --> 00:36:02.901
<v Speaker 2>Like this,</v>

1275
00:36:02.901 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1276
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.050
<v Speaker 2>what was this?</v>

1277
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.490
<v Speaker 2>What was the source of,</v>

1278
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:06.324
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1279
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish flu,</v>

1280
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.860
<v Speaker 2>which I think was the most deadly epidemic in u s history.</v>

1281
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:14.931
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1282
00:36:14.931 --> 00:36:15.451
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

1283
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It was international to was international for sure.</v>

1284
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:22.970
<v Speaker 2>I think for sure it was the most deadly epidemic in the u s yeah,</v>

1285
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:24.840
<v Speaker 2>but I think he came,</v>

1286
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it came from Spain.</v>

1287
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I think I want to say it came from somewhere around Virginia does.</v>

1288
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:32.943
<v Speaker 2>Is that bullshit?</v>

1289
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.853
<v Speaker 2>This is going to take time.</v>

1290
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.843
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey.</v>

1291
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it came from some sort of farm situation.</v>

1292
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1293
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.353
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1294
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:42.931
<v Speaker 2>feel like,</v>

1295
00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing no surprises.</v>

1296
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Not more of that now because you see some of these like pig farms and they have</v>

1297
00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:48.654
<v Speaker 2>links.</v>

1298
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 2>There are lakes of waste.</v>

1299
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the drone footage?</v>

1300
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Is that what we're talking about?</v>

1301
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.091
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1302
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Some guy fluid,</v>

1303
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.150
<v Speaker 2>cause they have these ag gag laws,</v>

1305
00:36:57.151 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 2>which apparently one of them just got shot down a,</v>

1306
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 2>somebody sent me an email</v>

1307
00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 2>that when maybe it was Idaho or Iowa,</v>

1308
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:07.681
<v Speaker 2>one of those places.</v>

1309
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:08.000
<v Speaker 2>One was,</v>

1310
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I states that uh,</v>

1311
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1312
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1313
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.160
<v Speaker 2>ag gag laws got shut down to ag.</v>

1314
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Gag laws are safe.</v>

1315
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:19.200
<v Speaker 2>You are working in a slaughterhouse and you saw horrific conditions.</v>

1316
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.670
<v Speaker 2>You got your cell phone out,</v>

1317
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 2>you filmed it,</v>

1318
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 2>you could get prosecuted,</v>

1319
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 2>you would go to jail,</v>

1320
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:26.720
<v Speaker 2>you could be sued because if physically walking,</v>

1321
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.500
<v Speaker 2>all of those documentaries that came out,</v>

1322
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.180
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>

1323
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:29.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1324
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I think those ag gag laws existed as soon as they figured out that people could</v>

1325
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:33.714
<v Speaker 2>film thing.</v>

1326
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.231
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1327
00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:36.900
<v Speaker 2>because a few people released videos of her and it looked,</v>

1328
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 2>those ag gag laws kept,</v>

1329
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1330
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 2>kept people from talking about a lot of creepy shit.</v>

1331
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Like this video,</v>

1332
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.050
<v Speaker 2>if you see this video,</v>

1333
00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 2>this guy decided since no one's going to give him access to film the place</v>

1334
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.173
<v Speaker 2>openly,</v>

1335
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 2>she's going to fly over it.</v>

1336
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 2>So he flew over with a drone Spanish flu thing.</v>

1337
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:56.401
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1338
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:57.031
<v Speaker 2>For many years,</v>

1339
00:37:57.031 --> 00:38:00.930
<v Speaker 2>medical historians and epidemiologists hypothesize that the outbreak could have</v>

1340
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:04.920
<v Speaker 2>started in a British army base in ed place,</v>

1341
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 2>France or at Fort Riley in Kansas,</v>

1342
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 2>where the first American cases of the new strain of flu were recorded in March</v>

1343
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 2>of 1918 more recently,</v>

1344
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:18.630
<v Speaker 2>experts have experts have proposed a third hypothesis.</v>

1345
00:38:18.631 --> 00:38:23.631
<v Speaker 2>The Spanish flu originated somewhere in northern China in late 1917 and swiftly</v>

1346
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:28.230
<v Speaker 2>move to eastern Europe within 140,000 Chinese laborers.</v>

1347
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:29.030
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1348
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1349
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 2>the French and British governments recruited to perform manual labor to free up</v>

1350
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 2>the troops for war time duty.</v>

1351
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1352
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:36.581
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1353
00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 6>I think more people died of that.</v>

1354
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 6>Then they die then died in world war one,</v>

1355
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.240
<v Speaker 6>the fifth.</v>

1356
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 6>So 50 million people</v>

1357
00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.350
<v Speaker 2>were killed because of this damn,</v>

1358
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:46.320
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

1359
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.790
<v Speaker 6>Just think about courses.</v>

1360
00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.010
<v Speaker 6>A 50 million people.</v>

1361
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Well claiming.</v>

1362
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

1363
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.670
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1364
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:57.670
<v Speaker 2>claiming more lives in a single year than either the first world war or the four</v>

1365
00:38:58.671 --> 00:39:00.020
<v Speaker 2>year long black death,</v>

1366
00:39:00.021 --> 00:39:04.640
<v Speaker 2>bubonic plague outbreak that swept Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages.</v>

1367
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.790
<v Speaker 2>And this is one that for whatever reason,</v>

1368
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.230
<v Speaker 2>people talk about the plague.</v>

1369
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.990
<v Speaker 2>They talk about the bubonic plague.</v>

1370
00:39:11.991 --> 00:39:12.111
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1371
00:39:12.111 --> 00:39:12.590
<v Speaker 2>everyone's story,</v>

1372
00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.090
<v Speaker 2>but no one talks about the Spanish flu.</v>

1373
00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a rare,</v>

1374
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:16.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1375
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.600
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get brought up that often.</v>

1376
00:39:17.601 --> 00:39:18.650
<v Speaker 2>If you see this number,</v>

1377
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.060
<v Speaker 2>this number of people die.</v>

1378
00:39:20.061 --> 00:39:23.810
<v Speaker 2>50 million people in a year in a year.</v>

1379
00:39:23.811 --> 00:39:24.644
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1380
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.250
<v Speaker 6>People talk about how bad it is right now,</v>

1381
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:28.084
<v Speaker 6>but that's not what they're saying.</v>

1382
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Speaker 2>They're saying it killed more lives in a single year than either the first world</v>

1383
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:34.600
<v Speaker 2>war or the four year long black death.</v>

1384
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1385
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.620
<v Speaker 6>I may have killed and he may have kept one third of the population was sick with</v>

1386
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:38.741
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1387
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:39.820
<v Speaker 6>At least they didn't all die.</v>

1388
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.650
<v Speaker 6>God Damn.</v>

1389
00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.573
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1390
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 6>people think that the world is in such bad shape.</v>

1391
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.110
<v Speaker 6>We don't have plagues.</v>

1392
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:48.250
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1393
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.040
<v Speaker 6>there is a,</v>

1394
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:49.311
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1395
00:39:49.311 --> 00:39:54.311
<v Speaker 6>the poverty rate for the average poverty rate in the world has gone up for like</v>

1396
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:56.380
<v Speaker 6>the last 10 years.</v>

1397
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.660
<v Speaker 6>There's less poverty,</v>

1398
00:39:57.661 --> 00:39:58.061
<v Speaker 6>there's less.</v>

1399
00:39:58.061 --> 00:40:00.070
<v Speaker 6>Starvation is more education.</v>

1400
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:00.791
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1401
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:01.624
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of,</v>

1402
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of good shit going on too,</v>

1403
00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:04.690
<v Speaker 6>but just think about that.</v>

1404
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.050
<v Speaker 6>We haven't had a world war in what,</v>

1405
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:09.190
<v Speaker 6>70 years?</v>

1406
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:11.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1407
00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1408
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>

1409
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.070
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>

1410
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:13.400
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

1411
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.061
<v Speaker 6>Not to say it,</v>

1412
00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:15.800
<v Speaker 6>not to diminish the wars that are happening now,</v>

1413
00:40:15.801 --> 00:40:17.960
<v Speaker 6>but something that really affected,</v>

1414
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:18.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1415
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.790
<v Speaker 6>the entire population.</v>

1416
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.730
<v Speaker 6>I always feel like even since high school it's always been like around the</v>

1417
00:40:22.731 --> 00:40:23.360
<v Speaker 6>corner.</v>

1418
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.193
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1419
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.550
<v Speaker 6>And when we're in high school,</v>

1420
00:40:25.551 --> 00:40:27.920
<v Speaker 6>was the big fears that we're going to go to war with the Russians.</v>

1421
00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.500
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember going into the coat room and putting your head between your</v>

1422
00:40:30.501 --> 00:40:30.980
<v Speaker 6>knees?</v>

1423
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.850
<v Speaker 6>Did you have to do that?</v>

1424
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we did that and we used to do this.</v>

1425
00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.130
<v Speaker 2>We did the debt get under the desk drill,</v>

1426
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>

1427
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Get Out of the desk.</v>

1428
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.120
<v Speaker 2>So stupid like Mitch,</v>

1429
00:40:42.121 --> 00:40:43.390
<v Speaker 2>this is a nuclear war.</v>

1430
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Do these to tell you you're going to get on your desk like hey,</v>

1431
00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:48.880
<v Speaker 2>as if they had some way to alleviate our stress.</v>

1432
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:49.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1433
00:40:49.661 --> 00:40:51.750
<v Speaker 2>I know attending could get under the desk.</v>

1434
00:40:51.751 --> 00:40:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Can want to give you an answer.</v>

1435
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:53.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1436
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:55.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1437
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew what the fuck to do,</v>

1438
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:58.510
<v Speaker 2>so they just made up some nonsense.</v>

1439
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's get under your desk,</v>

1440
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.383
<v Speaker 2>duck,</v>

1441
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.670
<v Speaker 2>duck and cover nuclear war.</v>

1442
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 2>That linoleum is going to save your life.</v>

1443
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1444
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:07.331
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

1445
00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:08.081
<v Speaker 2>This is the drill.</v>

1446
00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:09.910
<v Speaker 2>All these little kids underneath the tables.</v>

1447
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.120
<v Speaker 2>What a fucked up thing to put in a kid's head,</v>

1448
00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1449
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Just stop and think about how close we were to doing something so stupid that</v>

1450
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:19.420
<v Speaker 2>this could have become a reality.</v>

1451
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.340
<v Speaker 2>And how now think about how this is a reality in certain parts of the world.</v>

1452
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.203
<v Speaker 2>Like in,</v>

1453
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.091
<v Speaker 2>in our place,</v>

1454
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:28.924
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1455
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.490
<v Speaker 2>but in other places it is.</v>

1456
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1457
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:32.403
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1458
00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 2>that's their life.</v>

1459
00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.653
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1460
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to things like drone warfare,</v>

1461
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.650
<v Speaker 2>that freaks me out.</v>

1462
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:41.151
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1463
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 2>It's very effective at shooting terrorist.</v>

1464
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:43.251
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1465
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:43.581
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1466
00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:43.821
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1467
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:44.391
<v Speaker 2>It's excellent.</v>

1468
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 2>It's also super effective at killing civilians.</v>

1469
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Super effective.</v>

1470
00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:49.961
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1471
00:41:49.961 --> 00:41:51.250
<v Speaker 6>And there's something about,</v>

1472
00:41:51.251 --> 00:41:54.670
<v Speaker 6>when you think about how we're being perceived and the rest of the world,</v>

1473
00:41:54.671 --> 00:41:59.560
<v Speaker 6>there's something about not even being present for the accidental killings that</v>

1474
00:41:59.561 --> 00:42:00.490
<v Speaker 6>makes it just,</v>

1475
00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:02.043
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1476
00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:03.840
<v Speaker 2>twice as bad.</v>

1477
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:07.410
<v Speaker 2>It just seems weird and apparently gives him pretty severe PTSD.</v>

1478
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1479
00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1480
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1481
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:09.331
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1482
00:42:09.331 --> 00:42:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm laughing because I'm like thinking like that's so crazy that they don't even</v>

1483
00:42:12.301 --> 00:42:14.820
<v Speaker 2>have to be there and they're getting PTSD.</v>

1484
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Like just the fact that they're doing it from a remote.</v>

1485
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1486
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I heard that pilots are freaking out there.</v>

1487
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.593
<v Speaker 2>Some of them.</v>

1488
00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1489
00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1490
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.400
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1491
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.860
<v Speaker 2>this is just what I'm reading might not even be true now.</v>

1492
00:42:25.861 --> 00:42:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I read that sensationalized,</v>

1493
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.180
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine that would kind of fuck with your head.</v>

1494
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1495
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.791
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1496
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 6>The first couple of times it'd be fun.</v>

1497
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.920
<v Speaker 6>It'd be like a video game and then you,</v>

1498
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 6>and then we'd start to sink in when you heard,</v>

1499
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 6>when you heard the reports later.</v>

1500
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:40.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1501
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:41.264
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to,</v>

1502
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 2>so detach yourself from it that it would be like this growing thing in the back</v>

1503
00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:47.144
<v Speaker 2>of your mind.</v>

1504
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1505
00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.990
<v Speaker 2>He was just launching missiles into apartment buildings</v>

1506
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.190
<v Speaker 2>and they're telling you it's okay.</v>

1507
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Everybody says it's okay.</v>

1508
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1509
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 2>This is what you're supposed to do.</v>

1510
00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1511
00:42:58.850 --> 00:42:59.960
<v Speaker 2>when I talked to,</v>

1512
00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1513
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.870
<v Speaker 2>this gentleman that I know that was in the CIA,</v>

1514
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.840
<v Speaker 2>he said that all those decisions are done by lawyers.</v>

1515
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.490
<v Speaker 2>How really?</v>

1516
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1517
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not they do it or not do it.</v>

1518
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:09.531
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1519
00:43:09.531 --> 00:43:10.071
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>

1520
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:15.071
<v Speaker 2>lawyers are deciding whether or not it's likely to be successful.</v>

1521
00:43:15.111 --> 00:43:16.700
<v Speaker 2>What's the legal ramifications?</v>

1522
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:17.534
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1523
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:18.860
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about that kind of stuff,</v>

1524
00:43:18.861 --> 00:43:19.131
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1525
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:19.880
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

1526
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of us decided by lawyers.</v>

1527
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1528
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1529
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:23.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1530
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:23.880
<v Speaker 6>Because they want to not have,</v>

1531
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.520
<v Speaker 6>if you show her operated the,</v>

1532
00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.810
<v Speaker 6>the siting and</v>

1533
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:27.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1534
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1535
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 2>And they want to make sure that all the ducks are in order.</v>

1536
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1537
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.731
<v Speaker 2>Which I mean,</v>

1538
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 2>is that better or was at worse?</v>

1539
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:33.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1540
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:35.960
<v Speaker 2>is it better to just leave it to the generals to design,</v>

1541
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1542
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:41.600
<v Speaker 2>you get this cartoonish impression of what that would be like some general,</v>

1543
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:43.220
<v Speaker 2>like the fucking guy from Avatar.</v>

1544
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1545
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Go down there.</v>

1546
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Who are going to fuck everybody.</v>

1547
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.720
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody's worried about.</v>

1548
00:43:47.721 --> 00:43:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1549
00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:48.963
<v Speaker 2>The character,</v>

1550
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1551
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.730
<v Speaker 2>the cartoonish out of control.</v>

1552
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Murderous soldier,</v>

1553
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.153
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1554
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.361
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1555
00:43:56.361 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 6>What was the Kubrick movie?</v>

1556
00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.011
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1557
00:43:59.011 --> 00:44:00.060
<v Speaker 2>a full metal jacket.</v>

1558
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.690
<v Speaker 6>Now the one with the,</v>

1559
00:44:01.691 --> 00:44:02.524
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1560
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:05.230
<v Speaker 6>Peter Sally's was in it and it was about how I,</v>

1561
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.230
<v Speaker 6>how I something the new</v>

1562
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:07.830
<v Speaker 2>clear balm.</v>

1563
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1564
00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:09.420
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1565
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.363
<v Speaker 2>Doctor.</v>

1566
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:11.503
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1567
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 6>Like the general on that.</v>

1568
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:12.741
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1569
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:13.180
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1570
00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:13.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1571
00:44:13.511 --> 00:44:14.830
<v Speaker 2>They're always like cartoonish.</v>

1572
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

1573
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.610
<v Speaker 2>You better hope guys like that are on your side.</v>

1574
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.891
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Strange off.</v>

1575
00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:21.010
<v Speaker 2>That was a great movie man.</v>

1576
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.870
<v Speaker 2>It was so weird to watch it today.</v>

1577
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1578
00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I watched it a few years back.</v>

1579
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:25.443
<v Speaker 2>Did you really?</v>

1580
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:25.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1581
00:44:25.751 --> 00:44:28.060
<v Speaker 2>like maybe four or five years back and washed it and I was like,</v>

1582
00:44:28.061 --> 00:44:28.601
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1583
00:44:28.601 --> 00:44:33.601
<v Speaker 2>It's so wild to watch these little captured moments in time where you could see</v>

1584
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 2>like people were different than,</v>

1585
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1586
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 2>like old movies.</v>

1587
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 2>When you watch old movies,</v>

1588
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.500
<v Speaker 2>you know what the biggest indication that something's different is?</v>

1589
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Women didn't work out that.</v>

1590
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1591
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.550
<v Speaker 2>they weren't like fit.</v>

1592
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Like we are used to seeing a lot of actresses that are on TV and then in movies</v>

1593
00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 2>date they all do like crossfit or something.</v>

1594
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 2>They're all working out.</v>

1595
00:44:56.971 --> 00:45:01.920
<v Speaker 2>They're all taking gymnastics or something or they're doing spin classes and and</v>

1596
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 2>they have trainers and doing these box jumps and shit.</v>

1597
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Like girls are built now.</v>

1598
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing.</v>

1599
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.020
<v Speaker 2>If you go look at like King Kong look like Fay Wray and King Kong soft.</v>

1600
00:45:12.021 --> 00:45:12.770
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

1601
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.340
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1602
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 2>They're not even picking up their groceries.</v>

1603
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.990
<v Speaker 2>They're built different.</v>

1604
00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:17.681
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1605
00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:18.580
<v Speaker 7>And they don't last.</v>

1606
00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.900
<v Speaker 7>If they didn't do manual labor,</v>

1607
00:45:19.901 --> 00:45:20.734
<v Speaker 7>they don't last.</v>

1608
00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:23.980
<v Speaker 7>Some of them do when they do,</v>

1609
00:45:23.981 --> 00:45:24.641
<v Speaker 7>it's a shock.</v>

1610
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:25.570
<v Speaker 7>Like Raquel Welch,</v>

1611
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.840
<v Speaker 7>like deep into her sixties like Janice is still hot.</v>

1612
00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.610
<v Speaker 7>So feel around right to the end.</v>

1613
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.210
<v Speaker 7>Jesus.</v>

1614
00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1615
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.570
<v Speaker 7>It's a few of them that were so potent that they're,</v>

1616
00:45:34.571 --> 00:45:36.310
<v Speaker 7>they're spell lasted there.</v>

1617
00:45:36.311 --> 00:45:41.311
<v Speaker 7>Their entire existence is just started this Jane Fonda workout stuff back in the</v>

1618
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.640
<v Speaker 7>day with the doggy thing.</v>

1619
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.361
<v Speaker 7>What was that like?</v>

1620
00:45:43.361 --> 00:45:46.400
<v Speaker 7>1970s to me.</v>

1621
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.333
<v Speaker 7>Damn,</v>

1622
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.990
<v Speaker 7>that was crazy.</v>

1623
00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.810
<v Speaker 7>That was so fucking big.</v>

1624
00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.720
<v Speaker 7>It was the first time women were marketed to for exercise.</v>

1625
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.583
<v Speaker 7>I think so.</v>

1626
00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:00.490
<v Speaker 7>I think so.</v>

1627
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:05.490
<v Speaker 7>I think before that women may be competed in athletic events like [inaudible]</v>

1628
00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.240
<v Speaker 7>and shit like that when they were young.</v>

1629
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.000
<v Speaker 7>But then when they probably got families or moved on to jobs,</v>

1630
00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:10.930
<v Speaker 7>they probably stopped.</v>

1631
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.660
<v Speaker 7>What does this one go?</v>

1632
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:13.900
<v Speaker 7>A robot championship.</v>

1633
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.390
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

1634
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.640
<v Speaker 7>Look at this as a choreographed dance.</v>

1635
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.830
<v Speaker 7>This is so strange.</v>

1636
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1637
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.151
<v Speaker 7>that's right.</v>

1638
00:46:22.151 --> 00:46:23.410
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember aerobics?</v>

1639
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.960
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to take an aerobics class.</v>

1640
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.291
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1641
00:46:26.291 --> 00:46:27.124
<v Speaker 7>you remember that.</v>

1642
00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.021

1643
00:46:28.021 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 7>that was people would just dance around and you would do stuff,</v>

1644
00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:31.110
<v Speaker 7>feel the pop,</v>

1648
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.080

1655
00:46:44.771 --> 00:46:46.600

<v Speaker 2>it is gay.</v>

1658
00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:56.240
<v Speaker 2>He used to make everybody dress up like him because everybody like kids that</v>

1659
00:46:56.241 --> 00:46:58.790
<v Speaker 2>were straight kids that we're huge fans of Judas priest.</v>

1660
00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:03.910
<v Speaker 2>They would wear the cap and the jet wearing gay aesthetic like gay biker looking</v>

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Solve Miami vice doubt.</v>

1744
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:13.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1745
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:14.740
<v Speaker 1>He's got shoulder pads.</v>

1746
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.130
<v Speaker 1>You got up,</v>

1747
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:19.990
<v Speaker 1>you got to get rid of the shoulder pads back then you could have shoulder pads.</v>

1748
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.200
<v Speaker 1>And I remember having shoulder pads and my first jacket.</v>

1749
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.010
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>

1750
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:24.843
<v Speaker 1>It makes you look better.</v>

1751
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.290
<v Speaker 1>It isn't like a stuffed bra for a girl.</v>

1752
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1753
00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1754
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:31.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

1755
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1756
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1757
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 1>But how weird that people,</v>

1758
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.930
<v Speaker 1>so do you remember people actually dressing like that and in a class situation?</v>

1759
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Did they go to classes,</v>

1760
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.220
<v Speaker 1>dress like that grade school?</v>

1761
00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 1>We had uniforms and stuff.</v>

1762
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:43.711
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

1763
00:49:43.711 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I see if I never took it aerobics class.</v>

1764
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.170
<v Speaker 1>But see if you could find video footage of an aerobics class.</v>

1765
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 1>If all the guys that dress like that,</v>

1766
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 1>those dudes got punked.</v>

1767
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1768
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Somebody talked him into dressing like a dancer.</v>

1769
00:49:55.871 --> 00:49:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1770
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:57.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1771
00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And they're not showing the kids this video.</v>

1772
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

1773
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.030
<v Speaker 1>So he used to be stupid.</v>

1774
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:07.690
<v Speaker 1>So what if you're stupid once you're stupid forever.</v>

1775
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

1776
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1777
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Your kids love seeing you looking stupid tip.</v>

1778
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 1>And you should tell him I had a mullet.</v>

1779
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.343
<v Speaker 1>They laugh.</v>

1780
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.750
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I always do when I told my kids would do something wrong if</v>

1781
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 1>they've done something wrong,</v>

1782
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I say I did worse,</v>

1783
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 1>way worse.</v>

1784
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I did exactly what you did and I lied about it.</v>

1785
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I always lied.</v>

1786
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.260
<v Speaker 1>My parents asked me if I did anything wrong,</v>

1787
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.153
<v Speaker 1>always lied.</v>

1788
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1789
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I know if he did something or you didn't do it,</v>

1790
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:30.704
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at you.</v>

1791
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to make you not do it in the future.</v>

1792
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Cause I want you to learn why it's bad.</v>

1793
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.980
<v Speaker 2>And so I would always tell that's good.</v>

1794
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 2>The number one thing I always do.</v>

1795
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1796
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 2>And I get mad sometimes.</v>

1797
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just there's,</v>

1798
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:42.561
<v Speaker 2>there's no way.</v>

1799
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:43.580
<v Speaker 2>You can't sometimes,</v>

1800
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 2>especially as they get older,</v>

1801
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 2>they get upset about things and you got who you got to calm down.</v>

1802
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 2>You gotta like figure out how to calm down and stop screaming at each other.</v>

1803
00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Sisters scream at each other,</v>

1804
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you took my thing,</v>

1805
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.073
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1806
00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 2>You gave it to me.</v>

1807
00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1808
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.350
<v Speaker 2>but I can take it back and like</v>

1809
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.550
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing the pitch they can get.</v>

1810
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Cause usually when people get that hostile to each other,</v>

1811
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.580
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1812
00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:06.911
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1813
00:51:06.911 --> 00:51:08.440
<v Speaker 3>you're worried there's going to be a physical fight.</v>

1814
00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.600
<v Speaker 3>But sisters can take it two,</v>

1815
00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:11.411
<v Speaker 3>three times.</v>

1816
00:51:11.411 --> 00:51:12.244
<v Speaker 3>That level,</v>

1817
00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.870
<v Speaker 3>it makes you so uncomfortable,</v>

1818
00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:15.490
<v Speaker 3>but then they'll cuddle with each other.</v>

1819
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1820
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:17.800
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

1821
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.410
<v Speaker 2>That's suite two years.</v>

1822
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1823
00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.050
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting watching them evolve,</v>

1824
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:28.320
<v Speaker 2>like watching them learn new facts and learn new things and wash their little</v>

1825
00:51:28.721 --> 00:51:30.010
<v Speaker 2>brain filled with information.</v>

1826
00:51:30.011 --> 00:51:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Their vocabulary starts growing and you're like,</v>

1827
00:51:32.471 --> 00:51:33.520
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1828
00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1829
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:34.810
<v Speaker 2>And you realize like,</v>

1830
00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:36.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1831
00:51:36.011 --> 00:51:36.731
<v Speaker 2>I've said this before,</v>

1832
00:51:36.731 --> 00:51:38.140
<v Speaker 2>but it bears repeating.</v>

1833
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.990
<v Speaker 2>We look at people in a static state.</v>

1834
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:45.460
<v Speaker 2>We're always looking at people like if I see a guy and he's 40 years old and</v>

1835
00:51:45.461 --> 00:51:46.294
<v Speaker 2>he's an asshole,</v>

1836
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:46.421
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1837
00:51:46.421 --> 00:51:48.250
<v Speaker 2>that's that 40 year old asshole.</v>

1838
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:49.241
<v Speaker 2>That fucking guy.</v>

1839
00:51:49.241 --> 00:51:50.074
<v Speaker 2>I know that guy.</v>

1840
00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.720
<v Speaker 2>That guy is so annoying.</v>

1841
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:54.730
<v Speaker 2>But you don't think are that was a baby.</v>

1842
00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1843
00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.930
<v Speaker 2>That was a baby with a bunch of shitty data thrown out.</v>

1844
00:51:58.931 --> 00:51:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1845
00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:01.300
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of shitty interactions,</v>

1846
00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:02.650
<v Speaker 2>bad genes,</v>

1847
00:52:02.651 --> 00:52:04.090
<v Speaker 2>bad environment,</v>

1848
00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe some alcoholism.</v>

1849
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1850
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we give you some,</v>

1851
00:52:07.571 --> 00:52:08.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1852
00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.320
<v Speaker 2>throw it in all of it,</v>

1853
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:09.801
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1854
00:52:09.801 --> 00:52:11.120
<v Speaker 3>The lady HD</v>

1855
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.210
<v Speaker 2>bad nutrition,</v>

1856
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.020
<v Speaker 2>throw it all in there,</v>

1857
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:14.621
<v Speaker 2>throw it all in there.</v>

1858
00:52:14.621 --> 00:52:16.360
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of bad breaks in life.</v>

1859
00:52:16.361 --> 00:52:17.194
<v Speaker 2>Throw it all in there,</v>

1860
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:17.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1861
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.470
<v Speaker 2>and that happens to so many people.</v>

1862
00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.090
<v Speaker 2>So you look at him and instead of,</v>

1863
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:23.530
<v Speaker 2>I always like,</v>

1864
00:52:23.531 --> 00:52:24.670
<v Speaker 2>look at what they are now.</v>

1865
00:52:24.671 --> 00:52:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1866
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1867
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:26.103
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

1868
00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.250
<v Speaker 2>what they are,</v>

1869
00:52:27.251 --> 00:52:27.851
<v Speaker 2>all of them,</v>

1870
00:52:27.851 --> 00:52:30.700
<v Speaker 2>including you and me is a baby.</v>

1871
00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.190
<v Speaker 2>That became an older thing.</v>

1872
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:33.971
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1873
00:52:33.971 --> 00:52:38.971
<v Speaker 2>and I've great deal of people whose lives are chaotically fucked up.</v>

1874
00:52:40.631 --> 00:52:42.160
<v Speaker 2>It's through no fault of their own.</v>

1875
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:43.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a great deal of him.</v>

1876
00:52:43.751 --> 00:52:44.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a large number.</v>

1877
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1878
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:46.503
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1879
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:51.870
<v Speaker 2>and as I've gotten older and tried to be more compassionate and more,</v>

1880
00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:53.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1881
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.101
<v Speaker 2>more understanding,</v>

1882
00:52:54.101 --> 00:52:54.934
<v Speaker 2>more patient,</v>

1883
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:58.720
<v Speaker 2>those are the things that I worked on a lot and I still struggle with it.</v>

1884
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.280
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1885
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1886
00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's anything you ever really totally get over,</v>

1887
00:53:03.791 --> 00:53:04.690
<v Speaker 2>but you get better.</v>

1888
00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:05.050
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>

1889
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it a lot over the years here.</v>

1890
00:53:08.861 --> 00:53:09.790
<v Speaker 2>A lot more patient.</v>

1891
00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1892
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:15.900
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of that has to do with just getting better at being a person and</v>

1893
00:53:16.331 --> 00:53:17.290
<v Speaker 2>then when you work on it.</v>

1894
00:53:17.291 --> 00:53:22.180
<v Speaker 2>But I think also a lot of it has to do with my change of my attitude about</v>

1895
00:53:22.181 --> 00:53:24.050
<v Speaker 2>people and that I,</v>

1896
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 2>I started to of them as</v>

1897
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:32.060
<v Speaker 8>a product of a lot of different interactions and that we,</v>

1898
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:32.911
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

1899
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 8>you hear the term white privilege,</v>

1900
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.490
<v Speaker 8>it's a fucked up term,</v>

1901
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1902
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:36.743
<v Speaker 8>It's weird.</v>

1903
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 8>But you have to admit,</v>

1904
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:44.750
<v Speaker 8>if you're a person and nothing completely catastrophic has happened to you and</v>

1905
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:50.120
<v Speaker 8>you became this 50 year old successful comedian,</v>

1906
00:53:50.121 --> 00:53:52.380
<v Speaker 8>it's an Emmy award winning writer and like,</v>

1907
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:53.400
<v Speaker 8>Yay,</v>

1908
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.660
<v Speaker 8>bad things happen to you.</v>

1909
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

1910
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.650
<v Speaker 8>But they could have been fucking way worse.</v>

1911
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 8>It could've been way worse.</v>

1912
00:54:00.331 --> 00:54:03.840
<v Speaker 8>And for some people it is fucking way worse.</v>

1913
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.200
<v Speaker 8>They just got a shit roll of the dice from the jump and it's been bad experience</v>

1914
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:15.441
<v Speaker 8>after bad experience and fucking abuse and violence in jail and the that you</v>

1915
00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:17.281
<v Speaker 8>can't get out.</v>

1916
00:54:17.281 --> 00:54:18.031
<v Speaker 8>There's no way out.</v>

1917
00:54:18.031 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 8>You can't even read.</v>

1918
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:19.570
<v Speaker 8>She's like,</v>

1919
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 8>you're frothing around at sea trying to keep your head above water</v>

1920
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:27.300
<v Speaker 8>and you run into them when they're 32 at a gas station.</v>

1921
00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 8>And it's as much,</v>

1922
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.130
<v Speaker 8>it's a,</v>

1923
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1924
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:37.350
<v Speaker 8>it's not saying it's not their fault because whenever someone does anything to</v>

1925
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:37.680
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

1926
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.520
<v Speaker 8>it's their fault.</v>

1927
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:40.620
<v Speaker 8>Like if someone commits violence on you,</v>

1928
00:54:40.621 --> 00:54:41.700
<v Speaker 8>they shouldn't have done that.</v>

1929
00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:42.380
<v Speaker 8>It's their fault.</v>

1930
00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.213
<v Speaker 8>That's agreed.</v>

1931
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:47.970
<v Speaker 8>But what were the underlying factors that led this to happen?</v>

1932
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 8>And for all this talk that we do in this country about,</v>

1933
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.211
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1934
00:54:54.211 --> 00:54:57.540
<v Speaker 8>about violence and crime and the problem of violence and crime,</v>

1935
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 8>nobody ever looks at it in terms of like,</v>

1936
00:55:00.421 --> 00:55:05.160
<v Speaker 8>how do you stop children from being raised fucked up in violent?</v>

1937
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 8>How do you stop them from being abused?</v>

1938
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.420
<v Speaker 8>How do you step in you that?</v>

1939
00:55:09.421 --> 00:55:11.040
<v Speaker 8>Because that's the root of all of it,</v>

1940
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:11.441
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1941
00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:15.280
<v Speaker 6>And I think early childhood education can make a big difference because if you</v>

1942
00:55:15.281 --> 00:55:18.160
<v Speaker 6>have a kid growing up and you know the dad took off,</v>

1943
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 6>there's no,</v>

1944
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.080
<v Speaker 6>he's living on the streets.</v>

1945
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.210
<v Speaker 6>If you can create an environment for that four year old to come in and have two</v>

1946
00:55:25.211 --> 00:55:26.200
<v Speaker 6>decent meals,</v>

1947
00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:27.460
<v Speaker 6>a nap time,</v>

1948
00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.170
<v Speaker 6>some structured play,</v>

1949
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.740
<v Speaker 6>it makes all the difference in the world because that can become like the family</v>

1950
00:55:32.741 --> 00:55:33.300
<v Speaker 6>to them.</v>

1951
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:33.501
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>

1952
00:55:33.501 --> 00:55:34.350
<v Speaker 8>let me ask you this,</v>

1953
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.233
<v Speaker 8>cause this is the,</v>

1954
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.230
<v Speaker 8>we're in the biggest crisis in terms of immigration,</v>

1955
00:55:40.231 --> 00:55:41.670
<v Speaker 8>in terms of national discussion.</v>

1956
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:45.090
<v Speaker 8>The biggest discussion of it than I can ever remember right now at this wall,</v>

1957
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:48.900
<v Speaker 8>shit where the government is completely shut down and no one's budging on either</v>

1958
00:55:48.901 --> 00:55:51.390
<v Speaker 8>side and all these government workers are not getting paid in psalm because</v>

1959
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 8>Trump wants $5 billion for this wall.</v>

1960
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:55.973
<v Speaker 8>I'm not.</v>

1961
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:57.263
<v Speaker 8>Let's just,</v>

1962
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:59.790
<v Speaker 8>in an ideal world,</v>

1963
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.840
<v Speaker 8>it would be ideal if the way the world worked was the way America works,</v>

1964
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 8>where you can just go wherever you want.</v>

1965
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.380
<v Speaker 8>That'd be the ideal world.</v>

1966
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:09.760
<v Speaker 8>If the whole world was America in the,</v>

1967
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:12.630
<v Speaker 8>in the sense of you can go to New Mexico,</v>

1968
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.550
<v Speaker 8>you didn't have to get paperwork signed,</v>

1969
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:15.450
<v Speaker 8>you don't have to,</v>

1970
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:15.630
<v Speaker 8>did,</v>

1971
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:20.250
<v Speaker 8>no has to tell you whether or not you're allowed to go visit or not go visit.</v>

1972
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.450
<v Speaker 8>He just drive there.</v>

1973
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.330
<v Speaker 8>That's,</v>

1974
00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 8>that's a nice thing about America.</v>

1975
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:25.150
<v Speaker 8>It's almost like Europe,</v>

1976
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.530
<v Speaker 8>but you don't need a passport.</v>

1977
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.161
<v Speaker 8>Not In,</v>

1978
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:27.791
<v Speaker 8>it's like Europe.</v>

1979
00:56:27.791 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 8>I know you guys have been around longer and all that good stuff.</v>

1980
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:30.671
<v Speaker 8>That's not what I mean.</v>

1981
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 8>I mean in terms of there's a bunch of different fields.</v>

1982
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 8>It's all speaking one language,</v>

1983
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 8>but like there's a big difference between visiting Montana and visiting Miami.</v>

1984
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:39.371
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1985
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 8>if you go to billings,</v>

1986
00:56:40.601 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 8>Montana and hang out with the local folk at a coffee shop and then you go to</v>

1987
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 8>some fucking crazy after I already after hours party in Miami and Miami beach at</v>

1988
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:50.820
<v Speaker 8>four in the morning and p did,</v>

1989
00:56:50.821 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 8>he shows up and fucking,</v>

1990
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:53.081
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1991
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 8>and there's all these celebrities and people are doing coke on the floor and</v>

1992
00:56:56.441 --> 00:56:56.591
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

1993
00:56:56.591 --> 00:56:58.540
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck is this?</v>

1994
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:59.950
<v Speaker 8>This is a different world.</v>

1995
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 8>It's a different world and it's a bunch of these different worlds.</v>

1996
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 8>New York City's a different world.</v>

1997
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.941
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1998
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:05.080
<v Speaker 8>La is a different world.</v>

1999
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 8>You're allowed to go there.</v>

2000
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.950
<v Speaker 8>Wouldn't it be great if the whole world was like that?</v>

2001
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:12.460
<v Speaker 8>You can just kind of go wherever you want it to go and it would all sort itself</v>

2002
00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 8>out.</v>

2003
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 8>The idea is you can't because it would fuck up our quality of life and would</v>

2004
00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 8>make us less safe.</v>

2005
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:19.780
<v Speaker 8>And I get the argument,</v>

2006
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:22.450
<v Speaker 8>certainly you don't want to bring in criminals and murderers.</v>

2007
00:57:22.451 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 8>You don't want drug dealers making their way into this country and starting gang</v>

2008
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:26.740
<v Speaker 8>violence and all that stuff.</v>

2009
00:57:26.741 --> 00:57:27.071
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

2010
00:57:27.071 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 8>you're absolutely right.</v>

2011
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 8>And to deny that,</v>

2012
00:57:29.051 --> 00:57:30.490
<v Speaker 8>I think it's pretty fucking foolish.</v>

2013
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:31.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2014
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:34.420
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a matter of like there's a lot to it.</v>

2015
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a fluid.</v>

2016
00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 3>The border is always going to be fluid and it needs to be fluid.</v>

2017
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:38.651
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2018
00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 3>we need MD immigrant spirit of coming in and a lot of them do start small</v>

2019
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 3>businesses when you know,</v>

2020
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:44.531
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2021
00:57:44.531 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 3>when they're brought in legally.</v>

2022
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.153
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2023
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 3>and so how do you,</v>

2024
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.480
<v Speaker 3>how do you create a flow of people that is good for us.</v>

2025
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Cause they say most of the immigrants that come here are the smartest,</v>

2026
00:57:56.201 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 3>sharpest people,</v>

2027
00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.650
<v Speaker 3>most driven and wherever they're from.</v>

2028
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.870
<v Speaker 3>So we're actually drawing a really good,</v>

2029
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:02.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2030
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:02.590
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

2031
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 3>they talk so much about the criminals but the truth is most of them that are</v>

2032
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 3>coming over here are the ones that probably have the most to offer to this</v>

2033
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:10.290
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

2034
00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.780
<v Speaker 8>Well exactly like our parents' generation.</v>

2035
00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.340
<v Speaker 8>Like our grandparents,</v>

2036
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.420
<v Speaker 8>like my grandparents.</v>

2037
00:58:15.421 --> 00:58:16.140
<v Speaker 8>Like when did your,</v>

2038
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.340
<v Speaker 8>your grandparents come over here?</v>

2039
00:58:17.341 --> 00:58:17.720
<v Speaker 8>It was</v>

2040
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.630
<v Speaker 3>grandparents are 1910 my grandparents.</v>

2041
00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2042
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.733
<v Speaker 3>mine as well.</v>

2043
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:26.150
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather was one of 13 and 12 of them came over here and they lived in a</v>

2044
00:58:26.151 --> 00:58:27.860
<v Speaker 3>two room fucking mud hut.</v>

2045
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Somehow they kept finding the money to send one kid over at a time.</v>

2046
00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Like usually when there were about 15 crazy shit.</v>

2047
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2048
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 8>See that kind of shit is what I'm talking about.</v>

2049
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:40.180
<v Speaker 8>Like those kind of people,</v>

2050
00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:42.970
<v Speaker 8>shouldn't they be allowed to come here?</v>

2051
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.170
<v Speaker 8>That's,</v>

2052
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:44.680
<v Speaker 8>that's how this thing got started.</v>

2053
00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:45.410
<v Speaker 8>The,</v>

2054
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 8>the real problem is that there are spots that suck as the real problem.</v>

2055
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:51.510
<v Speaker 8>It's like we were talking about like white privilege.</v>

2056
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.660
<v Speaker 8>White privilege is not the problem.</v>

2057
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:53.770
<v Speaker 8>The problem is racism.</v>

2058
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.980
<v Speaker 8>Racism doesn't exist in everyone's exactly the same.</v>

2059
00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.470
<v Speaker 8>And then we're okay and then we don't need to worry about white privilege.</v>

2060
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:01.660
<v Speaker 8>What the real problem that you're not getting.</v>

2061
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 8>You're not getting racist things thrown at you the way black people are.</v>

2062
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:06.011
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2063
00:59:06.011 --> 00:59:06.790
<v Speaker 8>for sure.</v>

2064
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:07.720
<v Speaker 8>But that's not the problem.</v>

2065
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.090
<v Speaker 8>The problem is racist things being thrown a black people.</v>

2066
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.800
<v Speaker 8>It's not that I don't get it right.</v>

2067
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:16.210
<v Speaker 8>It's say you get it right and it's like it took to highlight the fact that it's</v>

2068
00:59:16.211 --> 00:59:17.290
<v Speaker 8>not happening to me.</v>

2069
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:19.540
<v Speaker 8>I get what you're saying,</v>

2070
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 8>but the real pro,</v>

2071
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.620
<v Speaker 8>I think it's a distraction that the real problem is the racism itself.</v>

2072
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:25.510
<v Speaker 8>The real problem is the,</v>

2073
00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:30.850
<v Speaker 8>when you see actual Nazis in 2018 2019 actual ones,</v>

2074
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.710
<v Speaker 8>real ones like not,</v>

2075
00:59:33.711 --> 00:59:35.600
<v Speaker 8>not just dressing up cause they think it's a hoot.</v>

2076
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 8>We,</v>

2077
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 8>oh mom rebel.</v>

2078
00:59:37.401 --> 00:59:38.790
<v Speaker 8>I'm fucking road.</v>

2079
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.030
<v Speaker 8>I got a piece of tape under my nose.</v>

2080
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 8>The Sec.</v>

2081
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:44.090
<v Speaker 8>There's a fucking people that aren't really Nazis,</v>

2082
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 8>but they're dumb here.</v>

2083
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:45.800
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2084
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 8>But then you see a real Nazi in 2019 you're like,</v>

2085
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:48.501
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2086
00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:50.810
<v Speaker 8>that's real racism.</v>

2087
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.673
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2088
00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Now when they go into a,</v>

2089
00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.680
<v Speaker 3>I was in Portland and they said there's regular clashes like once a month</v>

2090
00:59:58.681 --> 01:00:02.670
<v Speaker 3>there's a demonstration and it's either the alt right having a demonstration and</v>

2091
01:00:02.671 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 3>then the a,</v>

2092
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:03.841
<v Speaker 3>what do they call him?</v>

2093
01:00:03.841 --> 01:00:08.841
<v Speaker 3>The something far Antifa Antifa show up and they have regular fights and it's</v>

2094
01:00:08.941 --> 01:00:09.900
<v Speaker 3>fucking Nazis.</v>

2095
01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.430
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn.</v>

2096
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Oregon's a fucked up state because it was originally,</v>

2097
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:16.440
<v Speaker 3>there were no black people allowed in Oregon.</v>

2098
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.160
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

2099
01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:17.930
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

2100
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:18.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2101
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.110
<v Speaker 3>cause now Portland is,</v>

2102
01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:20.310
<v Speaker 3>is very progressive,</v>

2103
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.150
<v Speaker 3>super progressive harassment,</v>

2104
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:23.580
<v Speaker 3>but there's no black people there.</v>

2105
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:24.770
<v Speaker 3>So it seems you,</v>

2106
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.910
<v Speaker 3>he feels a little hollow that when you're there.</v>

2107
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:29.530
<v Speaker 3>I just did New Year's Eve shows there and they were,</v>

2108
01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:29.941
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

2109
01:00:29.941 --> 01:00:32.100
<v Speaker 3>it was all white.</v>

2110
01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:33.780
<v Speaker 3>It was all white.</v>

2111
01:00:33.781 --> 01:00:34.614
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

2112
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.910
<v Speaker 3>That is weird.</v>

2113
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:36.091
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>

2114
01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>

2115
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.320
<v Speaker 3>If I was black,</v>

2116
01:00:37.321 --> 01:00:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I would go to Portland and a second,</v>

2117
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.890
<v Speaker 3>you'd have so many friends instantly.</v>

2118
01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to high five.</v>

2119
01:00:42.781 --> 01:00:44.700
<v Speaker 3>You have you over for dinner.</v>

2120
01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:47.641
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

2121
01:00:47.641 --> 01:00:48.470
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2122
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.840
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

2123
01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.580
<v Speaker 8>the real problem for sure is any kind of discrimination cause that that also</v>

2124
01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:55.530
<v Speaker 8>fucks with us too because if,</v>

2125
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.210
<v Speaker 8>if people were discriminating against people,</v>

2126
01:00:57.211 --> 01:00:59.680
<v Speaker 8>we can't even make fun of them now we have to leave him alone because it's</v>

2127
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:00.570
<v Speaker 8>punching down like,</v>

2128
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.160
<v Speaker 8>but it's right there.</v>

2129
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.480
<v Speaker 3>The best joke,</v>

2130
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:06.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you think about it as a standup,</v>

2131
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:07.600
<v Speaker 3>what your topics are,</v>

2132
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.830
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>

2133
01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:09.910
<v Speaker 3>racism,</v>

2134
01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:12.160
<v Speaker 3>sexuality,</v>

2135
01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:13.083
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

2136
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.141
<v Speaker 3>it cost.</v>

2137
01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:15.460
<v Speaker 3>People don't see politics.</v>

2138
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:16.050
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2139
01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:16.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2140
01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I would say that the,</v>

2141
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:19.750
<v Speaker 3>the average comic is talking about two topics,</v>

2142
01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.420
<v Speaker 3>racism and sexuality.</v>

2143
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:27.680
<v Speaker 8>You did a great job of co covering politics without actually being political.</v>

2144
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 8>You do a great job with that,</v>

2145
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:32.510
<v Speaker 8>especially that you're,</v>

2146
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.750
<v Speaker 8>you're Hillary Clinton bit.</v>

2147
01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:38.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2148
01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2149
01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.870
<v Speaker 3>I did this thing during the election about her and I didn't mean it to knock</v>

2150
01:01:42.871 --> 01:01:43.141
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

2151
01:01:43.141 --> 01:01:45.660
<v Speaker 3>but it really wasn't about knocking anybody.</v>

2152
01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.300
<v Speaker 3>It was about her having a dry pussy and you know,</v>

2153
01:01:48.301 --> 01:01:50.790
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of political comedy you can expect from me.</v>

2154
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:54.780
<v Speaker 8>It was also about countdown till Trump calls her a con.</v>

2155
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.430
<v Speaker 8>That was my favorite.</v>

2156
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:05.340
<v Speaker 8>It was my favorite line about the election.</v>

2157
01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:05.891
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2158
01:02:05.891 --> 01:02:06.521
<v Speaker 3>I did the,</v>

2159
01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:09.790
<v Speaker 3>I did the jokes about her and then a true,</v>

2160
01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Carrie was in the audience and he came up to me after the show.</v>

2161
01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:16.700
<v Speaker 3>He gave me an entire piece of paper with more jokes on that treadmill.</v>

2162
01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.550
<v Speaker 3>He had tears in his eyes.</v>

2163
01:02:18.551 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the thing I've ever seen</v>

2164
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.161
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

2165
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:20.994
<v Speaker 6>Take these.</v>

2166
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 6>He loves filth.</v>

2167
01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.650
<v Speaker 8>Drew Carey is one of the nicest guys ever.</v>

2168
01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:24.941
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2169
01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:25.570
<v Speaker 8>he's great.</v>

2170
01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:26.860
<v Speaker 8>I met him at the Improv and dude,</v>

2171
01:02:26.861 --> 01:02:28.000
<v Speaker 8>he talks to everybody.</v>

2172
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.670
<v Speaker 8>He was given young comics advice,</v>

2173
01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.050
<v Speaker 8>telling him write a joke a day.</v>

2174
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:32.950
<v Speaker 8>Just one joke a day.</v>

2175
01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:33.460
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2176
01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.450
<v Speaker 8>You get one joke a day.</v>

2177
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:35.980
<v Speaker 8>That's good advice for a week.</v>

2178
01:02:35.981 --> 01:02:36.814
<v Speaker 8>You've got seven jokes.</v>

2179
01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.020
<v Speaker 8>Make yourself write a joke.</v>

2180
01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:38.470
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2181
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:39.100
<v Speaker 8>that's right.</v>

2182
01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:39.370
<v Speaker 8>Honey.</v>

2183
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:40.360
<v Speaker 8>Write a joke yesterday.</v>

2184
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:41.110
<v Speaker 8>Nah,</v>

2185
01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:42.970
<v Speaker 8>I wrote some shit that wasn't funny.</v>

2186
01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.160
<v Speaker 8>That's root some shit.</v>

2187
01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:45.361
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2188
01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:45.850
<v Speaker 8>we did.</v>

2189
01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:47.680
<v Speaker 8>You and I did the store together last night.</v>

2190
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.951
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2191
01:02:47.951 --> 01:02:49.300
<v Speaker 8>And the last night I came home wrote.</v>

2192
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.050
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2193
01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:50.321
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2194
01:02:50.321 --> 01:02:50.801
<v Speaker 8>I'm just,</v>

2195
01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2196
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:51.470
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

2197
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:54.920
<v Speaker 8>I've in this stage of a couple of these bits and I'm working on right now where</v>

2198
01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:55.270
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2199
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:56.103
<v Speaker 8>they're just like,</v>

2200
01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.670
<v Speaker 8>they're on Bambi legs.</v>

2201
01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.020
<v Speaker 8>They'll go south on me,</v>

2202
01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.420
<v Speaker 8>I'll lose the script.</v>

2203
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.313
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2204
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.153
<v Speaker 8>it's um,</v>

2205
01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:07.510
<v Speaker 8>it's interesting because when you go from doing a special and then chuck and</v>

2206
01:03:07.511 --> 01:03:09.190
<v Speaker 8>everything out and starting from scratch,</v>

2207
01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.570
<v Speaker 8>it's the most fun time.</v>

2208
01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:11.020
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:11.630
<v Speaker 8>Cause you're like a,</v>

2210
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.861
<v Speaker 8>you look,</v>

2211
01:03:11.861 --> 01:03:12.880
<v Speaker 8>you're a beginner again.</v>

2212
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 6>You thinking about it all the time.</v>

2213
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:15.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2214
01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.770
<v Speaker 6>I'd like after dinner I've got a half hour,</v>

2215
01:03:16.771 --> 01:03:18.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm like I want to get back to that bit.</v>

2216
01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:19.643
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2217
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:19.900
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.600
<v Speaker 8>You think that you're thinking about it all the time.</v>

2219
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.370
<v Speaker 8>Like you're thinking about bits all the time.</v>

2220
01:03:24.371 --> 01:03:27.070
<v Speaker 8>Whereas once you have an act together and you could do,</v>

2221
01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:27.731
<v Speaker 8>you do an hour,</v>

2222
01:03:27.731 --> 01:03:28.840
<v Speaker 8>20 minutes easy,</v>

2223
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:30.310
<v Speaker 8>then you're not thinking about it that much.</v>

2224
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:31.630
<v Speaker 8>You're thinking about when you do it,</v>

2225
01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.680
<v Speaker 8>are you thinking about it when you're right,</v>

2226
01:03:32.681 --> 01:03:32.920
<v Speaker 8>but you know,</v>

2227
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.060
<v Speaker 8>thinking about it all day?</v>

2228
01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:34.471
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2229
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:35.650
<v Speaker 6>you're tweaking it in,</v>

2230
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:36.451
<v Speaker 6>in motion.</v>

2231
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 6>Like when you're on stage and you've got the hour down.</v>

2232
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:39.970
<v Speaker 6>That's when we,</v>

2233
01:03:39.971 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 6>you and I were talking about a comedian you just told to take a little extra</v>

2234
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 6>time before they did this special and it really is and that extra few months</v>

2235
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.140
<v Speaker 6>that you find emphasizing this syllable makes the joke,</v>

2236
01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:54.390
<v Speaker 6>get an applause break instead of just laughs.</v>

2237
01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.570
<v Speaker 8>It's also one of the most interactive art forms ever.</v>

2238
01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:01.390
<v Speaker 8>Whereas you need other people to do it.</v>

2239
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.610
<v Speaker 8>You need other people to watch.</v>

2240
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.340
<v Speaker 8>There's no way I can do that without you,</v>

2241
01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:07.780
<v Speaker 8>without people listening,</v>

2242
01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:08.980
<v Speaker 8>the watching,</v>

2243
01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:09.670
<v Speaker 8>whatever it is.</v>

2244
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:10.061
<v Speaker 8>I can't,</v>

2245
01:04:10.061 --> 01:04:10.894
<v Speaker 8>you can't do it.</v>

2246
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:14.080
<v Speaker 8>You need them because they help you make it.</v>

2247
01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:18.370
<v Speaker 8>Their reactions to what you're saying tightens up what you're saying right</v>

2248
01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:18.581
<v Speaker 8>there.</v>

2249
01:04:18.581 --> 01:04:22.810
<v Speaker 8>Reactions to make you throw away certain parts of just aren't working right,</v>

2250
01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:23.891
<v Speaker 8>but you think it's funny.</v>

2251
01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:26.470
<v Speaker 8>They don't think it's funny like how many times did they not think it's funny</v>

2252
01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:29.560
<v Speaker 8>before you decided that part might not be that good when he comes to me on this</v>

2253
01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:29.831
<v Speaker 8>part,</v>

2254
01:04:29.831 --> 01:04:31.150
<v Speaker 8>this part seems to have fruit to it.</v>

2255
01:04:31.151 --> 01:04:31.720
<v Speaker 8>This part.</v>

2256
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.800
<v Speaker 8>This is the part that kills,</v>

2257
01:04:32.801 --> 01:04:34.330
<v Speaker 8>I didn't even expect this part to work,</v>

2258
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.690
<v Speaker 8>but this partner and become a bigger part of the bit than the first part and</v>

2259
01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:39.130
<v Speaker 8>then weird stuff starts branching off,</v>

2260
01:04:39.131 --> 01:04:40.930
<v Speaker 8>but I don't think branches off in front of people.</v>

2261
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.440
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2262
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.273
<v Speaker 8>it's weird.</v>

2263
01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:42.731
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2264
01:04:42.731 --> 01:04:44.380
<v Speaker 6>it really is interesting.</v>

2265
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:44.590
<v Speaker 6>If,</v>

2266
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:44.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2267
01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:47.260
<v Speaker 6>if you could track a comedian writing a bit,</v>

2268
01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:50.140
<v Speaker 6>a good comic who really takes on a premise like you do,</v>

2269
01:04:50.141 --> 01:04:54.820
<v Speaker 6>like take on a thought or a philosophy and step it out as far as it can possibly</v>

2270
01:04:54.821 --> 01:04:56.070
<v Speaker 6>go and walk,</v>

2271
01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.480
<v Speaker 6>track that person doing that set for six months,</v>

2272
01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:03.280
<v Speaker 6>it can morph to where this almost nothing left from the original premise all the</v>

2273
01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:03.850
<v Speaker 8>time.</v>

2274
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:04.180
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2275
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:04.421
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2276
01:05:04.421 --> 01:05:07.360
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes I'll take an old joke and I'll use it as a scaffolding.</v>

2277
01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.050
<v Speaker 8>Like when I'm writing again and I've got no luck,</v>

2278
01:05:11.051 --> 01:05:14.210
<v Speaker 8>I'm trapped and I'm like [inaudible] no way to get from this bid to a note,</v>

2279
01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.280
<v Speaker 8>but not going an old joke.</v>

2280
01:05:15.281 --> 01:05:16.510
<v Speaker 8>I'm a shovel old joke in there.</v>

2281
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 8>And then from that,</v>

2282
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 8>like the little bursts that you get out of that,</v>

2283
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:24.280
<v Speaker 8>we'll carry on and make the s the next premise better.</v>

2284
01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:27.700
<v Speaker 8>It's got a little bit more momentum to it and now you can explore it a little</v>

2285
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:28.653
<v Speaker 8>lightheaded,</v>

2286
01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 8>a little lighthearted,</v>

2287
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.120
<v Speaker 8>little little easier,</v>

2288
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:33.010
<v Speaker 8>less tense because the new stuff,</v>

2289
01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.061
<v Speaker 8>think about it.</v>

2290
01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:38.680
<v Speaker 8>That fucks me up the most is that I'm not exactly sure what's the best way to do</v>

2291
01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:38.801
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

2292
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:42.250
<v Speaker 8>So I'm thinking about while I'm saying it instead of just being in the moment,</v>

2293
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 8>right until I,</v>

2294
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 8>until you can just get it to the point where you can be in the moment,</v>

2295
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.110
<v Speaker 8>it's just clunky,</v>

2296
01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 8>but because it's clunky,</v>

2297
01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:49.570
<v Speaker 8>you're nervous and because you're nervous,</v>

2298
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:50.550
<v Speaker 8>you're thinking about it all the time.</v>

2299
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.540
<v Speaker 8>So it becomes like this obsession.</v>

2300
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:55.840
<v Speaker 8>So if I feel like more premises start popping up that way,</v>

2301
01:05:55.841 --> 01:05:56.321
<v Speaker 8>it's weird.</v>

2302
01:05:56.321 --> 01:06:01.321
<v Speaker 8>It's like you have this hyper focus that's way less comfortable than being like</v>

2303
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:06.250
<v Speaker 8>having an hour and 20 down ready to film.</v>

2304
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.750
<v Speaker 8>It's way less comfortable,</v>

2305
01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 8>but it's probably more productive in terms of like creatively</v>

2306
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:11.781
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2307
01:06:11.781 --> 01:06:12.320
<v Speaker 3>But I always,</v>

2308
01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.101
<v Speaker 3>I always think of like,</v>

2309
01:06:13.101 --> 01:06:14.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like learning a new language.</v>

2310
01:06:14.511 --> 01:06:15.650
<v Speaker 3>Every time I have a new bit,</v>

2311
01:06:15.651 --> 01:06:16.340
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2312
01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:20.090
<v Speaker 3>how do I translate this thought in my head into like you said,</v>

2313
01:06:20.091 --> 01:06:20.990
<v Speaker 3>what's my approach?</v>

2314
01:06:20.991 --> 01:06:23.840
<v Speaker 3>What's my strategy to get that idea across?</v>

2315
01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.840
<v Speaker 3>And so you're thinking about that and it slows down you.</v>

2316
01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2317
01:06:27.111 --> 01:06:28.370
<v Speaker 3>You're not in the moment as much.</v>

2318
01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.280
<v Speaker 8>I think I'm going to start doing some real late night sets too.</v>

2319
01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:32.540
<v Speaker 8>That's a good idea.</v>

2320
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:34.460
<v Speaker 8>When you got to do tired people,</v>

2321
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2322
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.350
<v Speaker 8>Like 13 people in the room,</v>

2323
01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:37.730
<v Speaker 8>you got to try those,</v>

2324
01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.790
<v Speaker 8>those little spots out to do.</v>

2325
01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:44.030
<v Speaker 8>You can get a little too used to do and crowds and if you're a little too used</v>

2326
01:06:44.031 --> 01:06:45.350
<v Speaker 8>to and crowds,</v>

2327
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:48.380
<v Speaker 8>what happens is people want to laugh.</v>

2328
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:49.850
<v Speaker 8>They want to laugh.</v>

2329
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:51.230
<v Speaker 8>The dare to have a good time.</v>

2330
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:53.300
<v Speaker 8>When you get at one o'clock in the morning,</v>

2331
01:06:53.330 --> 01:06:54.740
<v Speaker 8>they've already laughed.</v>

2332
01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:00.040
<v Speaker 8>They've laughed and laughed and laughed and they've laughed for hours.</v>

2333
01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:00.650
<v Speaker 8>Some of them,</v>

2334
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:04.050
<v Speaker 8>some of them get there at nine and they stay till two.</v>

2335
01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:04.500
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2336
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.130
<v Speaker 8>They just get up to pee or another drink,</v>

2337
01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:07.911
<v Speaker 8>have another seat,</v>

2338
01:07:07.911 --> 01:07:11.900
<v Speaker 8>and you're watching a crazy lineup of comedians you get on at one o'clock in the</v>

2339
01:07:11.901 --> 01:07:12.260
<v Speaker 8>morning.</v>

2340
01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.790
<v Speaker 8>I'm like the dawn Barris hour,</v>

2341
01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.020
<v Speaker 8>that fucking you're,</v>

2342
01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:19.520
<v Speaker 8>you're getting in front of people that have seen everything.</v>

2343
01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.880
<v Speaker 8>So if you make them laugh like that,</v>

2344
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:24.200
<v Speaker 8>that's a legit bit.</v>

2345
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.980
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2346
01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.850
<v Speaker 8>If you can get through to these people when they've probably heard everything,</v>

2347
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:33.230
<v Speaker 3>well then it gets you in your voice more because when there's only 15 people out</v>

2348
01:07:33.231 --> 01:07:37.370
<v Speaker 3>there versus 300 couple hours earlier,</v>

2349
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:42.110
<v Speaker 3>at 300 you're performing something out to the back of the room.</v>

2350
01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.260
<v Speaker 3>They talk about playing to the back of the room.</v>

2351
01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:45.110
<v Speaker 3>In bigger rooms,</v>

2352
01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:46.910
<v Speaker 3>you have to be more physical,</v>

2353
01:07:46.911 --> 01:07:48.980
<v Speaker 3>you have to slow down and,</v>

2354
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:50.270
<v Speaker 3>and then when you have 15 people,</v>

2355
01:07:50.271 --> 01:07:52.410
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you're in your human being,</v>

2356
01:07:52.411 --> 01:07:54.050
<v Speaker 3>talking to human beings voice.</v>

2357
01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:58.400
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes that's where you can find really the flow of the joke a lot better</v>

2358
01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.300
<v Speaker 3>because you're not,</v>

2359
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.830
<v Speaker 3>you're not pumping it up.</v>

2360
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:02.030
<v Speaker 3>You're just saying it.</v>

2361
01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

2362
01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2363
01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.393
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2364
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.730
<v Speaker 8>But I think you have to do those larger places too,</v>

2365
01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.280
<v Speaker 8>just to know how to do them.</v>

2366
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:12.780
<v Speaker 8>Like there are different things.</v>

2367
01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.130
<v Speaker 8>You can do a big theater,</v>

2368
01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.110
<v Speaker 8>a big theater,</v>

2369
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:19.160
<v Speaker 8>you need to be comfortable with the fact that there's x amount of thousands of</v>

2370
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:20.860
<v Speaker 8>people in that room and in,</v>

2371
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:22.430
<v Speaker 8>unless you do a bunch of those,</v>

2372
01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.930
<v Speaker 8>like you and I have done a few of them together.</v>

2373
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:24.800
<v Speaker 8>They're fun.</v>

2374
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.160
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.000
<v Speaker 8>But you have a time.</v>

2376
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 8>There's a timing thing that's different so you have to like wait a little</v>

2377
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:30.741
<v Speaker 8>longer.</v>

2378
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:31.350
<v Speaker 8>You can't,</v>

2379
01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:34.370
<v Speaker 8>can't beat your punchlines like one after the other.</v>

2380
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:37.520
<v Speaker 8>Like you can in a club and the club you could just keep,</v>

2381
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:40.420
<v Speaker 8>you can keep hammering because there's only so many people in the room.</v>

2382
01:08:40.421 --> 01:08:42.190
<v Speaker 8>It won't overpower the sound system.</v>

2383
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's why for so long comedy central,</v>

2384
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.280
<v Speaker 3>the mandate was always,</v>

2385
01:08:46.281 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 3>they want the special shot in a nice theater,</v>

2386
01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:49.370
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2387
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2388
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:53.330
<v Speaker 3>1500 2000 seat or where they can get that big,</v>

2389
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.050
<v Speaker 3>the crane camera shooting down.</v>

2390
01:08:56.051 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2391
01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.010
<v Speaker 3>And the truth is for most,</v>

2392
01:08:58.011 --> 01:08:58.910
<v Speaker 3>including myself,</v>

2393
01:08:58.911 --> 01:09:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a theater comic,</v>

2394
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.081
<v Speaker 3>I'm a club comic.</v>

2395
01:09:01.081 --> 01:09:06.020
<v Speaker 3>So all of a sudden I shoot my special in a room that holds 1600 people and it</v>

2396
01:09:06.021 --> 01:09:06.680
<v Speaker 3>was in,</v>

2397
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't look back at it and go,</v>

2398
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:09.890
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly how I want it to be.</v>

2399
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.843
<v Speaker 3>Sane.</v>

2400
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:12.230
<v Speaker 3>I was slower,</v>

2401
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:13.031
<v Speaker 3>I was project,</v>

2402
01:09:13.031 --> 01:09:16.700
<v Speaker 3>I was bigger and it's like I would have rather done it in a like a nice little</v>

2403
01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 3>400 seat club</v>

2404
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.501
<v Speaker 8>also.</v>

2405
01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:21.290
<v Speaker 8>You weren't doing a lot of those places so we weren't comfortable with it.</v>

2406
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.120
<v Speaker 8>Like when you do those really big places,</v>

2407
01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 8>once you get comfortable with it,</v>

2408
01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:25.580
<v Speaker 8>you start treating it like your club.</v>

2409
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.180
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2410
01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.260
<v Speaker 8>Like one of my most comfortable sets was one of the biggest places ever did the</v>

2411
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:31.900
<v Speaker 8>Scotia Bank arena in,</v>

2412
01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.710
<v Speaker 8>in Toronto at the end of my tour,</v>

2413
01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.150
<v Speaker 8>but is at the end of the tour.</v>

2414
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:38.210
<v Speaker 8>The very last spot before the Netflix special came out.</v>

2415
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.560
<v Speaker 8>So I had,</v>

2416
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:44.670
<v Speaker 8>I had been doing stand up like real regular in these big giant ass places for</v>

2417
01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:45.860
<v Speaker 8>months.</v>

2418
01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 8>So when I got there it felt like the store felt like doing the main room.</v>

2419
01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:51.080
<v Speaker 8>It was just a bigger main room.</v>

2420
01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:51.740
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2421
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:51.951
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2422
01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:52.430
<v Speaker 8>you just,</v>

2423
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 8>it was just fun.</v>

2424
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.110
<v Speaker 8>Just have a good time.</v>

2425
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:54.830
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2426
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 8>It's just doing a lot of those you got to do 'em but you really do have to do</v>

2427
01:09:58.821 --> 01:10:00.230
<v Speaker 8>the little tiny shitty ones.</v>

2428
01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 8>You've got to do those 1:00 AM spots.</v>

2429
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:03.950
<v Speaker 8>You've got to do those belly rooms spots.</v>

2430
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.430
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2431
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.180
<v Speaker 8>That's a big one.</v>

2432
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.230
<v Speaker 8>The peli rooms a big one.</v>

2433
01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.450
<v Speaker 3>That's him right there.</v>

2434
01:10:07.451 --> 01:10:07.961
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2435
01:10:07.961 --> 01:10:10.330
<v Speaker 3>If you are not connected to them,</v>

2436
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:12.910
<v Speaker 3>they do not laugh and a few are connected.</v>

2437
01:10:12.911 --> 01:10:15.660
<v Speaker 3>It's the greatest crowd cause there's only what,</v>

2438
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.710
<v Speaker 3>60 people in there.</v>

2439
01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:17.780
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

2440
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.613
<v Speaker 8>something like that.</v>

2441
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:20.460
<v Speaker 3>I also like doing alternative room.</v>

2442
01:10:20.461 --> 01:10:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I go to Largo.</v>

2443
01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:24.710
<v Speaker 3>How do you go up there in front of the cool kids and you know,</v>

2444
01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 3>have to be a little more PC and</v>

2445
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:30.760
<v Speaker 8>you should have a fake act that you do only for Largo,</v>

2446
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:32.350
<v Speaker 8>like put together.</v>

2447
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.990
<v Speaker 8>Actually I did Largo with a Whitney a lot.</v>

2448
01:10:34.991 --> 01:10:35.650
<v Speaker 8>I like Largo,</v>

2449
01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:36.483
<v Speaker 8>Florida just,</v>

2450
01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.080
<v Speaker 8>and Hardwick was on that show too.</v>

2451
01:10:38.081 --> 01:10:38.530
<v Speaker 8>And um,</v>

2452
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:39.100
<v Speaker 8>someone else,</v>

2453
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:39.933
<v Speaker 8>maybe Adam Ray.</v>

2454
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.930
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2455
01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:41.201
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2456
01:10:41.201 --> 01:10:43.610
<v Speaker 8>Adam divine and uh,</v>

2457
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:45.160
<v Speaker 8>it was a fun time and it was really fun.</v>

2458
01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.500
<v Speaker 8>Largo is a really interesting old place too,</v>

2459
01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:48.550
<v Speaker 8>but all those,</v>

2460
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:53.140
<v Speaker 8>those are all seen things like I would love if somebody did,</v>

2461
01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:56.350
<v Speaker 8>they put an act together that's only for like that crowd,</v>

2462
01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:59.890
<v Speaker 8>but it's like just onion ask enough that sneaks through,</v>

2463
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:01.833
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>

2464
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:02.470
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2465
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.771
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

2466
01:11:02.771 --> 01:11:07.771
<v Speaker 8>Just a really like a guy who plays like the strongest ally possible for</v>

2467
01:11:09.611 --> 01:11:12.250
<v Speaker 8>everything for Trans Rights,</v>

2468
01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 8>gay rights rights,</v>

2469
01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 8>women's</v>

2470
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.203
<v Speaker 7>rights.</v>

2471
01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:18.050
<v Speaker 7>It's like the ultimate ally and</v>

2472
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

2473
01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:21.810
<v Speaker 7>Birkenstock whatever.</v>

2474
01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:26.811
<v Speaker 7>We can do whatever you do to make them a character and then write really good</v>

2475
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:28.284
<v Speaker 7>jokes.</v>

2476
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:28.710
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2477
01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:29.431
<v Speaker 7>Really good.</v>

2478
01:11:29.431 --> 01:11:31.130
<v Speaker 7>Jokes like that would be an interesting project.</v>

2479
01:11:31.131 --> 01:11:33.030
<v Speaker 7>Almost like a Burra type project.</v>

2480
01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 7>Like create an all comic who's like,</v>

2481
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:38.160
<v Speaker 7>who's really calculated,</v>

2482
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.170
<v Speaker 7>who's really probably just trying to get pussy.</v>

2483
01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:40.531
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

2484
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:40.770
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2485
01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:41.420
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2486
01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.710
<v Speaker 7>but puts together the right words,</v>

2487
01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:44.011
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2488
01:11:44.011 --> 01:11:49.011
<v Speaker 7>if you don't support intersectionality then get the fuck out of my face</v>

2489
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:55.220
<v Speaker 7>and then he should try to get laid after every show as part of the care course.</v>

2490
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:55.441
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 7>It'd be just super sleazy with coke and needles.</v>

2492
01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:00.390
<v Speaker 7>Fucking syringes evil today</v>

2493
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 7>he's got shaky bottles of bills.</v>

2494
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.550
<v Speaker 7>It takes the pussy hat off his head and starts fucking it backstage.</v>

2495
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.130
<v Speaker 7>He's good flashlight for a pussyhat.</v>

2496
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:12.570
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

2497
01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:14.850
<v Speaker 7>There'll be a hilarious character.</v>

2498
01:12:14.851 --> 01:12:15.890
<v Speaker 7>Because the thing</v>

2499
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:19.100
<v Speaker 8>about people is who are you really?</v>

2500
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:22.190
<v Speaker 8>And when you're like,</v>

2501
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:23.390
<v Speaker 8>when you talking to people,</v>

2502
01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:24.620
<v Speaker 8>do you know who you are?</v>

2503
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.040
<v Speaker 8>Do you,</v>

2504
01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.450
<v Speaker 8>you sure you know who you are?</v>

2505
01:12:26.451 --> 01:12:26.661
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

2506
01:12:26.661 --> 01:12:29.870
<v Speaker 8>are you 100% certain and cool and calm?</v>

2507
01:12:29.871 --> 01:12:30.950
<v Speaker 8>I don't think most of us are.</v>

2508
01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:36.160
<v Speaker 8>Like most of us are like constantly evolving the way we behave in think,</v>

2509
01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.580
<v Speaker 8>constantly thinking about it.</v>

2510
01:12:37.581 --> 01:12:39.260
<v Speaker 8>Maybe things went wrong last night.</v>

2511
01:12:39.261 --> 01:12:40.130
<v Speaker 8>I got to stop drinking.</v>

2512
01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.720
<v Speaker 8>There's always like something like,</v>

2513
01:12:41.721 --> 01:12:41.871
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

2514
01:12:41.871 --> 01:12:43.010
<v Speaker 8>I gotta get my ass to the gym.</v>

2515
01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:43.731
<v Speaker 8>There's always something.</v>

2516
01:12:43.731 --> 01:12:45.650
<v Speaker 8>There's always something you're trying to improve and move around.</v>

2517
01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:49.610
<v Speaker 8>So if you are a person who is,</v>

2518
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.541
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2519
01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:54.140
<v Speaker 8>if you don't know exactly where you're coming from,</v>

2520
01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:56.120
<v Speaker 8>but you want to sell that,</v>

2521
01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:57.200
<v Speaker 8>you know where you're coming from.</v>

2522
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:59.570
<v Speaker 8>He wanted people to believe you know where you're coming from,</v>

2523
01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.150
<v Speaker 8>then you,</v>

2524
01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:05.150
<v Speaker 8>then you get all this momentum behind you and you almost can't get away from it.</v>

2525
01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:06.951
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2526
01:13:06.951 --> 01:13:07.784
<v Speaker 8>like you're,</v>

2527
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:08.751
<v Speaker 8>you're like,</v>

2528
01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:09.111
<v Speaker 8>you're like,</v>

2529
01:13:09.111 --> 01:13:11.420
<v Speaker 8>you see this a lot with people that are trying to be spiritual</v>

2530
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:16.160
<v Speaker 8>or they're always trying to sell you on the idea that they're spiritual.</v>

2531
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:17.210
<v Speaker 8>They're always pushing.</v>

2532
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.140
<v Speaker 8>There's,</v>

2533
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:18.801
<v Speaker 8>this is me,</v>

2534
01:13:18.801 --> 01:13:19.190
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

2535
01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:19.790
<v Speaker 8>this is me.</v>

2536
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:20.623
<v Speaker 8>Are you sure?</v>

2537
01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:21.873
<v Speaker 8>Are you sure?</v>

2538
01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.420
<v Speaker 8>I can think who we are.</v>

2539
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.470
<v Speaker 8>All of us is,</v>

2540
01:13:24.471 --> 01:13:29.270
<v Speaker 8>a lot of it is like who we've encountered and how we've interacted with those</v>

2541
01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:30.104
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>

2542
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:31.041
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2543
01:13:31.041 --> 01:13:32.970
<v Speaker 7>And then the uniform comes along with it.</v>

2544
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:33.790
<v Speaker 7>And the Diet,</v>

2545
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 7>there's like a whole follow this manual that,</v>

2546
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:37.021
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2547
01:13:37.021 --> 01:13:38.040
<v Speaker 7>they talk about hipsters,</v>

2548
01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 7>which,</v>

2549
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.653
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2550
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.710
<v Speaker 7>it's a pretty wide umbrella about what kind of hipsters there are.</v>

2551
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:48.600
<v Speaker 7>But just the idea of wearing a uniform always kind of puts me off on people.</v>

2552
01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:49.590
<v Speaker 7>Like you stopped,</v>

2553
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:53.340
<v Speaker 7>you stopped growing if you're going to put on what all the other people that you</v>

2554
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:54.480
<v Speaker 7>want to be like are wearing.</v>

2555
01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:54.921
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2556
01:13:54.921 --> 01:13:55.760
<v Speaker 8>This is the thing,</v>

2557
01:13:55.761 --> 01:14:00.761
<v Speaker 8>it's like the opinions aren't necessarily wrong because they're your opinions.</v>

2558
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.440
<v Speaker 8>But the thing of the,</v>

2559
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:04.340
<v Speaker 8>the thing of any kind of ideology,</v>

2560
01:14:04.341 --> 01:14:09.110
<v Speaker 8>whether it's a hipster all ideology or if it's a fucking conservative,</v>

2561
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 8>right wing farm worker ideology,</v>

2562
01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 8>like when people adopt those,</v>

2563
01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.490
<v Speaker 8>it's very little deviation.</v>

2564
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 8>And a lot of times they're not even really thinking entirely about what they're</v>

2565
01:14:18.551 --> 01:14:18.970
<v Speaker 8>saying.</v>

2566
01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:19.361
<v Speaker 8>They just,</v>

2567
01:14:19.361 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 8>they just know what is going to get the right positive reaction from their clan.</v>

2568
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:24.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2569
01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:25.361
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad.</v>

2570
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:25.961
<v Speaker 3>My Mom,</v>

2571
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:26.650
<v Speaker 3>who is,</v>

2572
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:26.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2573
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:29.440
<v Speaker 3>we grew up a pretty liberal family in New York.</v>

2574
01:14:29.441 --> 01:14:33.280
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was in radio and he talked politics on the air and it was pretty far left</v>

2575
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.930
<v Speaker 3>reading that,</v>

2576
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:35.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2577
01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 3>my mom worked at the New York Times,</v>

2578
01:14:36.971 --> 01:14:38.320
<v Speaker 3>he can't get any more liberal in that.</v>

2579
01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:38.990
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

2580
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 3>then she moved down to Florida where everybody watches Fox News in her building</v>

2581
01:14:44.951 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 3>and they all sit around the pool and they fucking berate her because they don't</v>

2582
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:49.354
<v Speaker 3>agree with them.</v>

2583
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.141
<v Speaker 3>And I just say,</v>

2584
01:14:50.141 --> 01:14:50.951
<v Speaker 3>good for you mom.</v>

2585
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:51.640
<v Speaker 3>You haven't.</v>

2586
01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of people go down there and they were,</v>

2587
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.510
<v Speaker 3>they changed their views because they are so,</v>

2588
01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:56.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2589
01:14:56.141 --> 01:14:58.280
<v Speaker 3>intimidated by not fitting in with the,</v>

2590
01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:00.930
<v Speaker 3>it's your social group to different country.</v>

2591
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Florida's different kinds of saying American Europe,</v>

2592
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:05.583
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2593
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:07.380
<v Speaker 3>You go to Florida does a different country.</v>

2594
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:08.111
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2595
01:15:08.111 --> 01:15:08.560
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

2596
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.350
<v Speaker 3>it's two different countries because if not three,</v>

2597
01:15:11.351 --> 01:15:13.360
<v Speaker 3>because you've got the locals,</v>

2598
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:18.010
<v Speaker 3>which I'd put them against Mississippi and Alabama for being deep south.</v>

2599
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.590
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got the retirement people,</v>

2600
01:15:20.591 --> 01:15:22.180
<v Speaker 3>which is old Jews from New York,</v>

2601
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 3>and then you've got the Latino Element of Florida.</v>

2602
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:26.230
<v Speaker 3>It's V it's three different,</v>

01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:34.130
<v Speaker 8>What are we doing?</v>

2611
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.160
<v Speaker 8>And get in the boat</v>

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:39.610
<v Speaker 3>can sit down as hard as your fucking ads cunt.</v>

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:44.841
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>

2617
01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:45.291
<v Speaker 8>you're right.</v>

2618
01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:46.340
<v Speaker 8>The upper part of it,</v>

2619
01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:46.941
<v Speaker 8>especially,</v>

2620
01:15:46.941 --> 01:15:48.600
<v Speaker 8>that's like all that I,</v>

2621
01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:50.630
<v Speaker 8>it might as well be any other southern state.</v>

2622
01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.470
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2623
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:53.570
<v Speaker 8>And then at the bottom it's Cubans.</v>

2624
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:53.850
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2625

<v Speaker 8>no running shit and Miami.</v>

2626
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.870
<v Speaker 8>Miami's just international.</v>

2627
01:15:56.871 --> 01:15:58.520
<v Speaker 8>Miami is like an international city.</v>

2628
01:15:58.521 --> 01:16:00.890
<v Speaker 8>It's like an international city that's in America.</v>

2629
01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:01.641
<v Speaker 8>That'd be that.</v>

2630
01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:03.500
<v Speaker 8>It's so different than Seattle.</v>

2631
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:06.380
<v Speaker 8>Like in terms of feel and like the way you're walking around,</v>

2632
01:16:06.381 --> 01:16:11.381
<v Speaker 8>everybody's like thin and in tight clothes and partying and fucking dancing and</v>

2633

2637
01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.170
<v Speaker 3>it's alive and it's going to be under water soon.</v>

2638
01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:19.650
<v Speaker 3>When they get a suit,</v>

2639
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:22.130
<v Speaker 3>when the moon is in certain positions in Florida,</v>

2640
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:24.500
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even matter what tide is the fucking,</v>

2641
01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.620
<v Speaker 3>if there's a high tide and no storm,</v>

2642
01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.680
<v Speaker 3>they still streets still flood in Miami.</v>

2643
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:31.850
<v Speaker 3>It's getting bad.</v>

2644
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>

2645
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2646
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.500
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2647
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.280
<v Speaker 8>here's what they gotta do.</v>

2648
01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.380
<v Speaker 8>They're gotta dig under the city and then lift it up.</v>

2649
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:38.570
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2650
01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:39.403
<v Speaker 8>that's right.</v>

2651
01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:41.200
<v Speaker 8>Go all the way under Elon Musk.</v>

2652
01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:46.150
<v Speaker 8>Use that title machine thing and you want to put some giant metal bars and just</v>

2653
01:16:46.151 --> 01:16:47.290
<v Speaker 8>jack it up to chick,</v>

2654
01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:47.531
<v Speaker 8>chick,</v>

2655
01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 8>chick,</v>

2656
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:48.041
<v Speaker 8>chick,</v>

2657
01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:48.874
<v Speaker 8>chick.</v>

2658
01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:52.240
<v Speaker 8>He got the Italian down there.</v>

2659
01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:53.200
<v Speaker 8>They do construction,</v>

2660
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 8>but what if they do a New Orleans deal where they put up a levee?</v>

2661
01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.251
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2662
01:16:57.251 --> 01:16:58.390
<v Speaker 8>That's what they're gonna need to do.</v>

2663
01:16:58.450 --> 01:16:59.410
<v Speaker 8>Jesus Christ.</v>

2664
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:01.750
<v Speaker 8>I think the problem with that though,</v>

2665
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:06.610
<v Speaker 8>what I read was that there's something about the porous nature of the soil in</v>

2666
01:17:06.611 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 8>Miami that the waters are going to come to the ground.</v>

2667
01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:09.260
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2668
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 8>The ground under the cities of south Florida's larceny for the IRD,</v>

2669
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:12.970
<v Speaker 8>it's largely poorest live.</v>

2670
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:13.873
<v Speaker 8>Jamie's on the ball,</v>

2671
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 8>largely porous limestone,</v>

2672
01:17:15.801 --> 01:17:18.740
<v Speaker 8>which means water will eventually rise up through it,</v>

2673
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:20.443
<v Speaker 8>so they're fucked.</v>

2674
01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.440
<v Speaker 8>They're fucked no matter what.</v>

2675
01:17:21.441 --> 01:17:22.790
<v Speaker 8>Even with a levy there fucked that.</v>

2676
01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 8>Water's just going to get through the ground right up.</v>

2677
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:28.610
<v Speaker 8>You know how like you're on the beach and you could dig a hole in the sand and</v>

2678
01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:29.600
<v Speaker 8>eventually you hit water.</v>

2679
01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:30.453
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2680
01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:31.940
<v Speaker 8>That always freaked me out.</v>

2681
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:32.331
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2682
01:17:32.331 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 8>I know.</v>

2683
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.883
<v Speaker 8>I now</v>

2684
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.193
<v Speaker 8>wait a minute.</v>

2685
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 8>This water under here,</v>

2686
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:38.150
<v Speaker 8>how much water?</v>

2687
01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.590
<v Speaker 6>My kid was sitting in one of those holes and I'm like,</v>

2688
01:17:40.591 --> 01:17:42.540
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get fucking sucked underground.</v>

2689
01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:42.761
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2690
01:17:42.761 --> 01:17:43.594
<v Speaker 8>I didn't like it.</v>

2691
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:44.620
<v Speaker 8>I didn't like it.</v>

2692
01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:45.453
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2693
01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:48.940
<v Speaker 8>I was listening to a radio lab podcast on quicksand.</v>

2694
01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:52.570
<v Speaker 8>It was really cool podcasts because it made me think I went,</v>

2695
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:53.560
<v Speaker 8>oh yeah.</v>

2696
01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.990
<v Speaker 8>Nobody worries about quicksand anymore.</v>

2697
01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.810
<v Speaker 8>Is that a real thing when we kids,</v>

2698
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:58.271
<v Speaker 8>dude?</v>

2699
01:17:58.271 --> 01:17:58.491
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2700
01:17:58.491 --> 01:17:58.610
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2701
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:59.620
<v Speaker 8>Quicksand is a real thing.</v>

2702
01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:00.250
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2703
01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:00.910
<v Speaker 8>It's a real thing.</v>

2704
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:03.100
<v Speaker 8>You can fall into this soupy,</v>

2705
01:18:03.101 --> 01:18:04.510
<v Speaker 8>watery sandy shit,</v>

2706
01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:06.670
<v Speaker 8>and if you don't try to swim out of it,</v>

2707
01:18:06.671 --> 01:18:07.780
<v Speaker 8>you try to walk out of it.</v>

2708
01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:08.763
<v Speaker 8>You could drown.</v>

2709
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:09.100
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2710
01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:09.933
<v Speaker 8>You could die in there.</v>

2711
01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.940
<v Speaker 8>People have definitely died and you might not even get out if you try to swim</v>

2712
01:18:12.941 --> 01:18:13.360
<v Speaker 8>out,</v>

2713
01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.560
<v Speaker 8>but that's how you handle it.</v>

2714
01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.450
<v Speaker 8>You handle it the same way you handle water,</v>

2715
01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.700
<v Speaker 8>and if you try walking through it,</v>

2716
01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:19.140
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

2717
01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:20.900
<v Speaker 8>like people just get sucked into the Merck.</v>

2718
01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:21.341
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2719
01:18:21.341 --> 01:18:21.461
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>

2720
01:18:21.461 --> 01:18:21.940
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>

2721
01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:22.541
<v Speaker 8>if you think about it,</v>

2722
01:18:22.541 --> 01:18:25.990
<v Speaker 8>there's like a certain amount of density to what you need to stand on.</v>

2723
01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:26.261
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2724
01:18:26.261 --> 01:18:27.220
<v Speaker 8>That's why mud,</v>

2725
01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.061
<v Speaker 8>it's not hard.</v>

2726
01:18:28.061 --> 01:18:28.830
<v Speaker 8>You use,</v>

2727
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:30.910
<v Speaker 8>you just go in there and you can get really stuck.</v>

2728
01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:31.570
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2729
01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:31.781
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2730
01:18:31.781 --> 01:18:33.670
<v Speaker 8>if it's more watery than that,</v>

2731
01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:34.750
<v Speaker 8>then what happens?</v>

2732
01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:37.690
<v Speaker 8>Well then you can't even stand then you</v>

2733
01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.210
<v Speaker 8>people just panicked.</v>

2734
01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.140
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

2735
01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:41.910
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2736
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:42.743
<v Speaker 8>You've got to swim.</v>

2737
01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.593
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2738
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.433
<v Speaker 8>If you can,</v>

2739
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:45.790
<v Speaker 8>because there's all this weight on you too.</v>

2740
01:18:45.791 --> 01:18:47.530
<v Speaker 8>You have to realize that that stuff's dense.</v>

2741
01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:48.581
<v Speaker 8>So it's watery,</v>

2742
01:18:48.581 --> 01:18:51.430
<v Speaker 8>but it's also heavy and then your clothes are covered in it.</v>

2743
01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:51.850
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2744
01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:53.530
<v Speaker 8>So your clothes become really heavy</v>

2745
01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:55.920
<v Speaker 6>and so nobody can save you because if they get close,</v>

2746
01:18:55.921 --> 01:18:56.754
<v Speaker 6>they're going to fall in.</v>

2747
01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.593
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

2748
01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2749
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.440
<v Speaker 8>If,</v>

2750
01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:58.921
<v Speaker 8>if they,</v>

2751
01:18:58.921 --> 01:18:59.370
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2752
01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:00.660
<v Speaker 8>if you're going to drag them down,</v>

2753
01:19:00.661 --> 01:19:01.210
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

2754
01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:01.400
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

2755
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.670
<v Speaker 8>it's hard to swim with somebody.</v>

2756
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:04.320
<v Speaker 8>You know that as well as anybody.</v>

2757
01:19:04.321 --> 01:19:05.190
<v Speaker 8>You saved somebody.</v>

2758
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2759
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.450
<v Speaker 6>I was in Costa Rica and uh,</v>

2760
01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.740
<v Speaker 6>we were down at this Ga,</v>

2761
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:10.371
<v Speaker 6>this water,</v>

2762
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:11.930
<v Speaker 6>it was the biggest waterfall I've ever seen.</v>

2763
01:19:11.931 --> 01:19:15.590
<v Speaker 6>It was like hundreds of feet high and Atlanta did in this lagoon,</v>

2764
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.840
<v Speaker 6>this round lagoon and the water,</v>

2765
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.790
<v Speaker 6>they told you don't go near the water.</v>

2766
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:22.730
<v Speaker 6>And so there's these Japanese girls sitting on the edge,</v>

2767
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:27.500
<v Speaker 6>they got their feet in and then one of them like jumps in and the water fucking</v>

2768
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.690
<v Speaker 6>sucks her down immediately.</v>

2769
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:31.200
<v Speaker 6>And I dove owl,</v>

2770
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.701
<v Speaker 6>I have,</v>

2771
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:35.270
<v Speaker 6>I have a lifeguarding to Greg from when I was stoned and 16.</v>

2772
01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:39.680
<v Speaker 6>And so I dove into the water and I grabbed her and luckily I was checking them</v>

2773
01:19:39.681 --> 01:19:41.300
<v Speaker 6>out because they were these beautiful Japanese,</v>

2774
01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.250
<v Speaker 6>so I had my eyes on them.</v>

2775
01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:44.091
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2776
01:19:44.091 --> 01:19:45.530
<v Speaker 6>so I dive in and I grabbed,</v>

2777
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.810
<v Speaker 6>I grabbed her and I pulled it to the surface.</v>

2778
01:19:47.811 --> 01:19:50.420
<v Speaker 6>I do the cross arm carry and I've pulled our polar out.</v>

2779
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:52.640
<v Speaker 6>And you know what she did just turned,</v>

2780
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:53.690
<v Speaker 6>turned to her friends.</v>

2781
01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.950
<v Speaker 6>They all like console there.</v>

2782
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:56.120
<v Speaker 6>Nobody said thank you,</v>

2783
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:57.320
<v Speaker 6>I fucking saved her life.</v>

2784
01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.040
<v Speaker 6>So anyway.</v>

2785
01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.060
<v Speaker 6>I think she was Japanese.</v>

2792
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.270
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2793
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.430
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2794
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:09.151
<v Speaker 6>they were Japanese.</v>

2795
01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:09.670
<v Speaker 6>Japanese,</v>

2796
01:20:09.670 --> 01:20:10.050
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2797
01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:11.850
<v Speaker 6>She probably thought you were a lifeguard.</v>

2798
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2799
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.530

2800
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2801
01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:14.431
<v Speaker 6>And then I,</v>

2802
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:16.950
<v Speaker 6>and then I left and I'm with my family and uh,</v>

2803
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 6>they didn't see it happen,</v>

2804
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 6>so I was so fucking bummed.</v>

2805
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 6>Then we get to the parking lot and uh,</v>

2806
01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 6>there's this busload of kids from some school and they had seen the whole thing</v>

2807
01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:28.340
<v Speaker 6>and they started chanting hero</v>

2808
01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.293
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

2809

<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be a great feeling.</v>

2812
01:20:37.431 --> 01:20:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Even if they didn't say thank you,</v>

2813
01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:39.830
<v Speaker 1>saved him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2819
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:46.303
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2820
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:47.961
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

2821

<v Speaker 1>not directly.</v>

2822
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:50.800
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you did this podcast.</v>

2823
01:20:50.801 --> 01:20:51.634
<v Speaker 6>Probably did directly.</v>

2824
01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.390
<v Speaker 6>I bet there's people that have been suicidal that heard this and the cheer and</v>

2825
01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:55.040
<v Speaker 6>the mob</v>

2826
01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:55.970
<v Speaker 1>ruined a few people too.</v>

2827
01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:57.853
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>

2828
01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:03.493
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

2829
01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:04.341
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to me.</v>

2830

2831
01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:06.710
<v Speaker 1>What are you listening to me?</v>

2832
01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Because when people say I changed their life,</v>

2833
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:12.231
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2834

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2835
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.780

2836
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:16.370
<v Speaker 1>then I have to accept it on the negative too.</v>

2837
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.950
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2838

<v Speaker 1>Antisemetic is a judo,</v>

2889
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:17.060
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is what if you do like for sure some people have smoked too much</v>

2890
01:22:17.061 --> 01:22:18.770
<v Speaker 1>pot and blown a fucking gasket.</v>

2891
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2892
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:20.000
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest.</v>

2893
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2894
01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:21.890
<v Speaker 1>It has to have happen.</v>

2895
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:24.200
<v Speaker 6>They say that actually they're finding,</v>

2896
01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.030
<v Speaker 6>my wife just told me this yesterday,</v>

2897
01:22:26.031 --> 01:22:30.410
<v Speaker 6>she read this article about people with schizophrenia are getting older and</v>

2898
01:22:30.411 --> 01:22:33.790
<v Speaker 6>they're smoking pot more because it's legal and uh,</v>

2899
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:38.830
<v Speaker 6>they're finding people are coming in with a schizophrenia episodes from smoking</v>

2900
01:22:39.531 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 6>too much pot</v>

2901
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.530
<v Speaker 1>that worst gets a phrenic already or became schizophrenia from the pot.</v>

2902
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:45.543
<v Speaker 1>Not sure.</v>

2903
01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I think when you,</v>

2904
01:22:46.901 --> 01:22:48.550
<v Speaker 1>especially when you get too high,</v>

2905
01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.800
<v Speaker 1>it feels exactly like being crazy.</v>

2906
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2907
01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think when,</v>

2908
01:22:53.171 --> 01:22:53.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2909
01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:58.420
<v Speaker 1>there's been moments for sure that I smoke too much pot and I freaked the fuck</v>

2910
01:22:58.421 --> 01:22:59.110
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2911
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.681
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2912
01:22:59.681 --> 01:23:01.480
<v Speaker 1>when that happens,</v>

2913
01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.880
<v Speaker 1>it almost always feels like,</v>

2914
01:23:03.881 --> 01:23:04.151
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2915
01:23:04.151 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 1>if I had to live like this,</v>

2916
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 8>and it's one of the things that I tried to take any consideration when I,</v>

2917
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:12.250
<v Speaker 8>when I think about people having something wrong with the way their brain</v>

2918
01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:17.251
<v Speaker 8>processes information or the way they talk is like thinking about how you feel</v>

2919
01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:21.400
<v Speaker 8>when you're on like a 200 milligram edible and you're like,</v>

2920
01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:21.791
<v Speaker 8>oh my God,</v>

2921
01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:22.630
<v Speaker 8>I just can't do this.</v>

2922
01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:23.411
<v Speaker 8>This is just too much.</v>

2923
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:27.700
<v Speaker 8>Everything is anxiety and the freak out and life and death and all of your</v>

2924
01:23:27.701 --> 01:23:31.430
<v Speaker 8>memories pouring back into your head like a waterfall and you can't collect</v>

2925
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.261
<v Speaker 8>circles.</v>

2926
01:23:32.261 --> 01:23:37.261
<v Speaker 8>They're spinning plates and all you want is for it to end please.</v>

2927
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:38.940
<v Speaker 8>And a lie down here.</v>

2928
01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.540
<v Speaker 8>I hear when you take a shower,</v>

2929
01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 8>it helps you get in the shower.</v>

2930
01:23:42.311 --> 01:23:47.311
<v Speaker 8>You still freaked out if that was your whole life and you got to think what is,</v>

2931
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:48.430
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2932
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:51.310
<v Speaker 8>what's your state of consciousness versus another person's?</v>

2933
01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:52.240
<v Speaker 8>You have to guess.</v>

2934
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.170
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

2935
01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:54.730
<v Speaker 8>I've never been in your mind.</v>

2936
01:23:54.731 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how your mind works.</v>

2937
01:23:56.291 --> 01:24:00.370
<v Speaker 8>I have to guess that your mind is some reasonable.</v>

2938
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.820
<v Speaker 8>It's got something like the way my mind works,</v>

2939
01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.160
<v Speaker 8>the way you look at life and we talk about so many things.</v>

2940
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:07.510
<v Speaker 8>We agree on so many things.</v>

2941
01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 8>I've got to think you're processing is very similar to mine,</v>

2942
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.820
<v Speaker 8>but there's gotta be people out there where it's chaos,</v>

2943
01:24:12.821 --> 01:24:14.830
<v Speaker 8>where it's just like you would the 200 milligram edible.</v>

2944
01:24:14.831 --> 01:24:16.660
<v Speaker 8>You just like fuck all day.</v>

2945
01:24:16.661 --> 01:24:17.201
<v Speaker 8>It's just so like,</v>

2946
01:24:17.201 --> 01:24:17.500
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>

2947
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.550
<v Speaker 8>who's who's doing that?</v>

2948
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:19.121
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2949
01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:19.691
<v Speaker 8>people do.</v>

2950
01:24:19.691 --> 01:24:22.750
<v Speaker 8>Just people watching the man from the is a building near us and just people</v>

2951
01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:23.584
<v Speaker 8>watching me like,</v>

2952
01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:24.790
<v Speaker 8>and they can't escape,</v>

2953
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:26.020
<v Speaker 8>can escape the Kennys can't,</v>

2954
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:31.050
<v Speaker 8>they're trapped in this is fucking constant snow ball effect of anxiety and</v>

2955
01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.001
<v Speaker 8>chaos.</v>

2956
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:34.660
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

2957
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:35.680
<v Speaker 8>and you've got a wondered like,</v>

2958
01:24:35.681 --> 01:24:36.280
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>

2959
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 8>how much of that is brain chemistry?</v>

2960
01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:42.460
<v Speaker 8>How much of that is brain chemistry that's been adjusted by nature and by life</v>

2961
01:24:42.461 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 8>experiences and abuse and all these different factors that happen to people that</v>

2962
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.730
<v Speaker 8>make them lose their grip?</v>

2963
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:49.703
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

2964
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:50.420
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

2965
01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.310
<v Speaker 6>I mean you see them on the street and he just,</v>

2966
01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:52.460
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

2967
01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:52.761
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2968
01:24:52.761 --> 01:24:54.950
<v Speaker 6>there's a woman that is near my house.</v>

2969
01:24:54.951 --> 01:24:59.951
<v Speaker 6>She's at a bus stop and she's been at this bus stop for three years and I have</v>

2970
01:25:00.501 --> 01:25:00.981
<v Speaker 6>never,</v>

2971
01:25:00.981 --> 01:25:03.530
<v Speaker 6>and I pass her two or three times a day and I check,</v>

2972
01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:06.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm kind of obsessed with checking on her every time I drive by.</v>

2973
01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.293
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2974
01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.770
<v Speaker 6>she's never not been in that bus stop sitting down.</v>

2975
01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:16.580
<v Speaker 6>She's either reading or just under a blanket.</v>

2976
01:25:16.581 --> 01:25:17.660
<v Speaker 6>She's chain smokes.</v>

2977
01:25:17.661 --> 01:25:19.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't know where she gets a cigarettes.</v>

2978
01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.240
<v Speaker 6>She's got a cell phone.</v>

2979
01:25:20.241 --> 01:25:21.680
<v Speaker 6>Don't know how she charges it,</v>

2980
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.080
<v Speaker 6>but I guess she goes to the bathroom at the gas station.</v>

2981
01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:24.740
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

2982
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.210
<v Speaker 6>Maybe people give her money and she goes,</v>

2983
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:27.290
<v Speaker 6>doesn't beg,</v>

2984
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:28.250
<v Speaker 6>doesn't engage,</v>

2985
01:25:28.251 --> 01:25:29.120
<v Speaker 6>just sits at this.</v>

2986
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:30.080
<v Speaker 6>And it's a,</v>

2987
01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:30.420
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>

2988
01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.080
<v Speaker 6>she's in front of a gas station and a busy road.</v>

2989
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:33.940
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2990
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.500
<v Speaker 6>it's the worst spot to say pouring rain.</v>

2991
01:25:36.501 --> 01:25:38.940
<v Speaker 6>She's out there cold winter.</v>

2992
01:25:38.941 --> 01:25:39.980
<v Speaker 6>She's out there.</v>

2993
01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.240
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

2994
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:42.283
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2995
01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:43.650

2998
01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:47.123
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2999
01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:48.120
<v Speaker 6>But not,</v>

3000
01:25:48.121 --> 01:25:48.601
<v Speaker 6>not like,</v>

3001
01:25:48.601 --> 01:25:49.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3002
01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:50.560
<v Speaker 6>the sides are not there.</v>

3003
01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:52.320
<v Speaker 6>So on driving rain,</v>

3004
01:25:52.321 --> 01:25:52.561
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3005
01:25:52.561 --> 01:25:53.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3006
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:53.581
<v Speaker 6>so she's just,</v>

3007
01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:54.390
<v Speaker 6>she's soaked.</v>

3008
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:55.223
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3009
01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.680
<v Speaker 6>And you see her talking to herself a little bit and you just think Jesus Christ.</v>

3010
01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:00.360
<v Speaker 6>And so I looked her up online,</v>

3011
01:26:00.361 --> 01:26:03.270
<v Speaker 6>I researched her and it turns out she's from Venice.</v>

3012
01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 6>She went to Venice high and she's got,</v>

3013
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 6>she's got parents in the neighborhood and they know she's there.</v>

3014
01:26:09.471 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 6>They can't get her to leave.</v>

3015
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:14.800
<v Speaker 6>Social workers come by and they just realized she's happy there.</v>

3016
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:15.071
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3017
01:26:15.071 --> 01:26:15.681
<v Speaker 6>we're not happy,</v>

3018
01:26:15.681 --> 01:26:16.880
<v Speaker 6>but she's safe there.</v>

3019
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 6>Something about that spot maybe cause it's like the busiest spot round.</v>

3020
01:26:21.171 --> 01:26:22.430
<v Speaker 6>It makes her feel safe.</v>

3021
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

3022
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:24.163
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3023
01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 8>Imagine that your kid,</v>

3024
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.730
<v Speaker 8>I know.</v>

3025
01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:30.443
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3026
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 8>As you kid blows a gasket and you've got to let go at a certain point.</v>

3027
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:36.103
<v Speaker 8>Fuck.</v>

3028
01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:39.690
<v Speaker 6>You can't make them take their medication after the age of 18 and for some</v>

3029
01:26:39.691 --> 01:26:43.110
<v Speaker 6>reason a lot of schizophrenia don't like taking their medication because of the</v>

3030
01:26:43.111 --> 01:26:44.010
<v Speaker 6>way it makes them feel.</v>

3031
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:45.840
<v Speaker 8>God dammit man.</v>

3032
01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.370
<v Speaker 8>What are the other options?</v>

3033
01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:49.260
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

3034
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:52.170
<v Speaker 8>well I think lithium has the main drug and then there's a couple other ones that</v>

3035
01:26:52.171 --> 01:26:52.740
<v Speaker 8>work.</v>

3036
01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:57.200
<v Speaker 8>Is there any behavioral therapy or physical therapy?</v>

3037
01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:57.601
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah,</v>

3038
01:26:57.601 --> 01:26:58.380
<v Speaker 8>definitely.</v>

3039
01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3040
01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.930
<v Speaker 6>I think it's about replacing thoughts.</v>

3041
01:27:00.931 --> 01:27:02.580
<v Speaker 6>It's cognitive behavioral therapy.</v>

3042
01:27:02.581 --> 01:27:03.031
<v Speaker 6>They have to,</v>

3043
01:27:03.031 --> 01:27:04.620
<v Speaker 6>when they start thinking something,</v>

3044
01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:08.190
<v Speaker 6>they have to replace it with another thought and they have to train in that</v>

3045
01:27:08.191 --> 01:27:09.790
<v Speaker 6>until they can stop the,</v>

3046
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:10.771
<v Speaker 6>the voices.</v>

3047
01:27:10.771 --> 01:27:11.150
<v Speaker 6>But I,</v>

3048
01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:13.470
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's mostly medication.</v>

3049
01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:14.543
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3050
01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:15.210
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

3051
01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:18.910
<v Speaker 8>I think we have an aversion to treating the brain.</v>

3052
01:27:18.911 --> 01:27:21.180
<v Speaker 8>The say when we treat other things that get broken.</v>

3053
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.750
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3054
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:22.580
<v Speaker 8>Like a,</v>

3055
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:22.900
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3056
01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:23.733
<v Speaker 8>a few,</v>

3057
01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:24.860
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

3058
01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.150
<v Speaker 8>you have something wrong with your liver.</v>

3059
01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:27.380
<v Speaker 8>They go,</v>

3060
01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:27.651
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

3061
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:28.850
<v Speaker 8>you've got liver disease.</v>

3062
01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:29.260
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3063
01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:31.040
<v Speaker 8>we're going to give you medication for the liver.</v>

3064
01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.420
<v Speaker 8>Or there's something wrong with your brain,</v>

3065
01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:33.254
<v Speaker 8>like are you sure?</v>

3066
01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.180
<v Speaker 8>You sure the sunrise brain,</v>

3067
01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:36.543
<v Speaker 8>you know what's wrong,</v>

3068
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.430
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3069
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:39.860
<v Speaker 8>Like your brain's really not producing enough chemicals.</v>

3070
01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:40.694
<v Speaker 8>Is that it?</v>

3071
01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:42.980
<v Speaker 8>Or is it just the way you look at things?</v>

3072
01:27:43.150 --> 01:27:44.240
<v Speaker 8>They look at it as a weakness.</v>

3073
01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3074
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 8>That's all.</v>

3075
01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:45.890
<v Speaker 8>This is a weakness.</v>

3076
01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:46.753
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3077
01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:47.960
<v Speaker 8>That's a weird thing.</v>

3078
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:50.090
<v Speaker 8>It's a weird thing because sometimes it is,</v>

3079
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 8>sometimes people are weak,</v>

3080
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:54.290
<v Speaker 8>but sometimes that's not it.</v>

3081
01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.910
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes there's something wrong.</v>

3082
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.360
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3083
01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 8>And so if you are a person who's got something wrong and people were telling</v>

3084
01:27:59.511 --> 01:27:59.601
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

3085
01:27:59.601 --> 01:28:00.434
<v Speaker 8>you just week,</v>

3086
01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:01.400
<v Speaker 8>they're like,</v>

3087
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:01.561
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3088
01:28:01.561 --> 01:28:01.601
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3089
01:28:01.601 --> 01:28:01.820
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

3090
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.140
<v Speaker 8>This is fucked up.</v>

3091
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 8>Like this is this.</v>

3092
01:28:04.431 --> 01:28:07.970
<v Speaker 8>This is a terrible feeling and this is everyday for me all day.</v>

3093
01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:08.360
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3094
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.920
<v Speaker 8>There's just something wrong going on in there.</v>

3095
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:14.030
<v Speaker 8>Like it has to be that there's variables to the way your brain works.</v>

3096
01:28:14.031 --> 01:28:14.570
<v Speaker 8>Just why.</v>

3097
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:18.590
<v Speaker 8>Like there's variables to the way your eyes function or any other part of your</v>

3098
01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:19.090
<v Speaker 8>body.</v>

3099
01:28:19.090 --> 01:28:19.480
<v Speaker 8>This is very,</v>

3100
01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:19.620
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

3101
01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:20.240
<v Speaker 8>it just,</v>

3102
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 8>it's not equal.</v>

3103
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 8>Everybody doesn't get the same dose.</v>

3104
01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:23.251
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3105
01:28:23.251 --> 01:28:23.461
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3106
01:28:23.461 --> 01:28:25.590
<v Speaker 6>depression is something that,</v>

3107
01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.320
<v Speaker 6>it's funny because I think I've asked you and you don't have depression.</v>

3108
01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.010
<v Speaker 6>And My,</v>

3109
01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:29.430
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

3110
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:30.750
<v Speaker 6>my buddy Mike Givens,</v>

3111
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:34.770
<v Speaker 6>he's my best friend and we connect like you and me on everything.</v>

3112
01:28:34.771 --> 01:28:37.620
<v Speaker 6>But I have so much fucking depression that I,</v>

3113
01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:38.850
<v Speaker 6>I deal with it every day.</v>

3114
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:39.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3115
01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:39.751
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3116
01:28:39.751 --> 01:28:40.291
<v Speaker 6>and I can't,</v>

3117
01:28:40.291 --> 01:28:41.340
<v Speaker 6>I have to meditate.</v>

3118
01:28:41.341 --> 01:28:42.510
<v Speaker 6>I got an exercise.</v>

3119
01:28:42.511 --> 01:28:43.230
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3120
01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:43.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

3121
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:44.423
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3122
01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:46.940
<v Speaker 6>medicate everything.</v>

3123
01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.071
<v Speaker 8>Do you,</v>

3124
01:28:48.071 --> 01:28:48.580
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3125
01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:48.941

01:28:48.941 --> 01:28:49.240
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

3127
01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.350
<v Speaker 8>while you're injured right now,</v>

3128
01:28:50.351 --> 01:28:51.161
<v Speaker 8>you can't work out.</v>

3129
01:28:51.161 --> 01:28:51.550
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>

3130
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:51.940
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

3131
01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:54.090
<v Speaker 8>And then does that affect you when you,</v>

3132
01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:55.053
<v Speaker 8>the to help you?</v>

3133
01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:55.241
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3134
01:28:55.241 --> 01:28:57.190
<v Speaker 8>I've been in a Rut with not exercising.</v>

3135
01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.870
<v Speaker 8>When you do exercise a lot,</v>

3136
01:28:58.900 --> 01:28:59.381
<v Speaker 8>does it,</v>

3137
01:28:59.381 --> 01:28:59.670
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Very</v>

3140
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:02.521

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3143
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.463
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3144
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:05.640
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing this thing now.</v>

3145
01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:09.450
<v Speaker 6>I think Neil Brennan recommended it and a magnet thing.</v>

3146
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.020
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3147
01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:10.853
<v Speaker 6>TMS,</v>

3148
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:13.290
<v Speaker 6>transcranial magnetic stimulation.</v>

3149
01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3150
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.251
<v Speaker 6>He said it was amazing.</v>

3151
01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 6>I've done it for 10 weeks.</v>

3152
01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:16.500
<v Speaker 6>Every single day.</v>

3153
01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.220
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

3154
01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:17.491
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3155
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:18.420
<v Speaker 6>Just did it this morning.</v>

3156
01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:19.680
<v Speaker 6>Do you do it to yourself?</v>

3157
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:20.041
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3158
01:29:20.041 --> 01:29:20.910
<v Speaker 6>You go in first,</v>

3159
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:23.100
<v Speaker 6>you get an Mri and they map out your brain.</v>

3160
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:28.370
<v Speaker 6>And the whole theory behind it is that they can use magnetic stimulation to sort</v>

3161
01:29:28.741 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 6>of like waking up one of the lobes in your brain that's associated with</v>

3162
01:29:32.161 --> 01:29:32.994
<v Speaker 6>depression.</v>

3163
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.260
<v Speaker 6>And so you go in and first they map out your brain and then you go in and for</v>

3164
01:29:37.261 --> 01:29:38.250
<v Speaker 6>like a half hour,</v>

3165
01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:42.870
<v Speaker 6>they just pulse this magnetic thing onto your head.</v>

3166
01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:43.711
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3167
01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:46.080
<v Speaker 6>I'll very low grade MRI almost.</v>

3168
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:47.731
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3169
01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:50.970
<v Speaker 6>I've had amazing results and it lasts forever.</v>

3170
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.241
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3171
01:29:51.241 --> 01:29:53.040
<v Speaker 6>you go through this cycle of it and then,</v>

3172
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:53.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3173
01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

3174
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 6>Neil said the same experience.</v>

3175
01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.130
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

3176
01:29:56.130 --> 01:29:56.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3177
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 6>Highly won't last forever.</v>

3178
01:29:58.130 --> 01:29:58.570
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

3179
01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 6>Well they say some people have to come in and,</v>

3180
01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:01.501
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3181
01:30:01.501 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 6>get a,</v>

3182
01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:02.723
<v Speaker 6>get a tune up.</v>

3183
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:04.860
<v Speaker 6>But generally it's one time,</v>

3184
01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.000
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3185
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.350
<v Speaker 8>there's a woman named cats and gone,</v>

3186
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:07.531
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

3187
01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:10.950
<v Speaker 8>she's one of the UFC top bantamweights and she,</v>

3188
01:30:10.951 --> 01:30:11.460
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3189
01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:15.450
<v Speaker 8>fought UFC champion Amanda Nunez back in the day and actually beat her before</v>

3190
01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:16.284
<v Speaker 8>she won the title.</v>

3191
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.420
<v Speaker 8>But in that fight she got hurt real bad.</v>

3192
01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:22.590
<v Speaker 8>And she talked about it on the podcast that she developed a bunch of brain</v>

3193
01:30:22.591 --> 01:30:24.120
<v Speaker 8>issues after that fight.</v>

3194
01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.600
<v Speaker 8>Cause like her cortisol levels were all fucked up at homeless.</v>

3195
01:30:27.601 --> 01:30:28.500
<v Speaker 8>We're all fucked up.</v>

3196
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.210
<v Speaker 8>She developed thyroid problem.</v>

3197
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:31.223
<v Speaker 8>She had hit in the head.</v>

3198
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:32.543
<v Speaker 6>She is,</v>

3199
01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.170
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3200
01:30:34.170 --> 01:30:35.430
<v Speaker 8>She couldn't keep weight off.</v>

3201
01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.930
<v Speaker 8>Just trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with her.</v>

3202
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.970
<v Speaker 8>And one of the things that helped her the best,</v>

3203
01:30:38.971 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 8>she talked about it really openly and in depth on the podcast.</v>

3204
01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:44.820
<v Speaker 8>But one of the things that helped her the best was they have this,</v>

3205
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:48.660
<v Speaker 8>I think it's a different kind of magnetic therapy then this one,</v>

3206
01:30:48.661 --> 01:30:50.120
<v Speaker 8>cause I think this is only,</v>

3207
01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:55.370
<v Speaker 8>the center only exists around San Diego and a lot of military guys come back and</v>

3208
01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:56.340
<v Speaker 8>use it.</v>

3209
01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:57.180
<v Speaker 8>Football players,</v>

3210
01:30:57.181 --> 01:31:00.270
<v Speaker 8>people with head injuries and someone recommended it to her and it helped her.</v>

3211
01:31:00.271 --> 01:31:00.911
<v Speaker 8>Tremendous.</v>

3212
01:31:00.911 --> 01:31:01.470
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3213
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:02.520
<v Speaker 8>Really brought it back.</v>

3214
01:31:02.970 --> 01:31:03.241
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3215
01:31:03.241 --> 01:31:05.640
<v Speaker 6>There's some real breakthroughs going on because um,</v>

3216
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.181
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3217
01:31:06.181 --> 01:31:07.150
<v Speaker 6>people are and they,</v>

3218
01:31:07.151 --> 01:31:07.530
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3219
01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:07.771
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3220
01:31:07.771 --> 01:31:11.250
<v Speaker 6>they still use like electric shock therapy and it,</v>

3221
01:31:11.251 --> 01:31:11.551
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3222
01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:11.781
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

3223
01:31:11.781 --> 01:31:14.220
<v Speaker 6>with pretty good results but a lot of side effects.</v>

3224
01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 6>Did you get hit in the head a lot when you were a kid?</v>

3225
01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:18.503
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes,</v>

3226
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.370
<v Speaker 6>but does.</v>

3227
01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:22.960
<v Speaker 6>Was there any like moments where did get knocked down?</v>

3228
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.240
<v Speaker 6>I don't think I ever got knocked out.</v>

3229
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:25.740
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever get hit with a bat or,</v>

3230
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:26.761
<v Speaker 6>I played hockey,</v>

3231
01:31:26.761 --> 01:31:28.320
<v Speaker 6>so I used to check people a lot.</v>

3232
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:29.310
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever get down?</v>

3233
01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.140
<v Speaker 6>Did you get really hurt doing that?</v>

3234
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.870
<v Speaker 6>Nah,</v>

3235
01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:33.960
<v Speaker 6>never that my neck,</v>

3236
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:35.910
<v Speaker 6>my neck is still fucked up to this day from a,</v>

3237
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:36.810
<v Speaker 6>from a check,</v>

3238
01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:38.100
<v Speaker 6>a head check that I made.</v>

3239
01:31:38.101 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 6>But now I don't think I ever had any concussions.</v>

3240
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.710
<v Speaker 6>My friend Mark [inaudible] sorry,</v>

3241
01:31:43.711 --> 01:31:44.910
<v Speaker 6>my mind runs in the family.</v>

3242
01:31:44.911 --> 01:31:45.421
<v Speaker 6>My Mom,</v>

3243
01:31:45.421 --> 01:31:46.290
<v Speaker 6>my dad's got it.</v>

3244
01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:46.471
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3245
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:47.040
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3246
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.750
<v Speaker 6>it's very genetic depression.</v>

3247
01:31:48.751 --> 01:31:48.930
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3248
01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:49.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it is is,</v>

3249
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:51.510
<v Speaker 8>but I think it's accentuated by trauma.</v>

3250
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:52.050
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3251
01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:53.430
<v Speaker 8>And that's why I was asking you because,</v>

3252
01:31:53.431 --> 01:31:53.820
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3253
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.320
<v Speaker 8>even though you probably,</v>

3254
01:31:55.321 --> 01:31:55.561
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

3255
01:31:55.561 --> 01:31:56.970
<v Speaker 8>I know you played a lot of hockey.</v>

3256
01:31:57.410 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 8>He knew that you probably don't think about it like every time you collide and</v>

3257
01:32:00.311 --> 01:32:01.510
<v Speaker 8>even falling down,</v>

3258
01:32:01.511 --> 01:32:02.470
<v Speaker 8>slamming into the wall.</v>

3259
01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:03.560
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3260
01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.420
<v Speaker 8>There's a lot of that.</v>

3261
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.860
<v Speaker 8>All that stuff rattles your brain.</v>

3262
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:06.851
<v Speaker 8>Believe it or not,</v>

3263
01:32:06.851 --> 01:32:09.490
<v Speaker 8>people get concussions from getting hit in the chest sometimes.</v>

3264
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.000
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>

3265
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:10.360
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3266
01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.171
<v Speaker 8>Here's cats and gone.</v>

<v Speaker 8>you can find this on cats and Ganos Twitter page.</v>

3283
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 8>She's got a picture of her with this apparatus on her head,</v>

3284
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:34.690
<v Speaker 8>but I know it helped her.</v>

3285
01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:34.901
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3286
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:35.731
<v Speaker 8>I've heard of Emj.</v>

3287
01:32:35.731 --> 01:32:35.981
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

3288
01:32:35.981 --> 01:32:37.030
<v Speaker 8>it's really effective.</v>

3289
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:37.960
<v Speaker 8>It helped her a lot.</v>

3290
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.621
<v Speaker 8>He helped it.</v>

3291
01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:39.070
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

3292
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.401
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3293
01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:43.700
<v Speaker 8>she could talk about what sparring was like before and afterwards.</v>

3294
01:32:43.701 --> 01:32:44.540
<v Speaker 8>So she just shared,</v>

3295
01:32:44.541 --> 01:32:45.790
<v Speaker 8>her coordination was off.</v>

3296
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:46.683
<v Speaker 8>She was,</v>

3297
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:49.540
<v Speaker 8>that's one of the things that happens to people when they get brain damage.</v>

3298
01:32:49.541 --> 01:32:51.270
<v Speaker 8>If they get knocked out or you know,</v>

3299
01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.780
<v Speaker 8>bad concussions is your,</v>

3300
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.240
<v Speaker 8>your system's not firing correctly.</v>

3301
01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:57.250
<v Speaker 8>So you'll see their body's not moving right.</v>

3302
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.910
<v Speaker 8>So it almost resets,</v>

3303
01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.090
<v Speaker 8>resets to hard,</v>

3304
01:33:00.091 --> 01:33:00.370
<v Speaker 8>dry,</v>

3305
01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:01.203
<v Speaker 8>damaged,</v>

3306
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:02.120
<v Speaker 8>damaged,</v>

3307
01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:02.330
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

3308
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

3309
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 8>the signals aren't getting to the muscles correctly.</v>

3310
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:05.743
<v Speaker 8>So QC,</v>

3311
01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:09.790
<v Speaker 8>one of the things that you see in older boxers when they've taken too many</v>

3312
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.210
<v Speaker 8>horrible fights and they're,</v>

3313
01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 8>they're really starting to lose it,</v>

3314
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:15.250
<v Speaker 8>is there steps look shorter,</v>

3315
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.750
<v Speaker 8>their legs or look closer together.</v>

3316
01:33:16.751 --> 01:33:17.040
<v Speaker 8>They have it.</v>

3317
01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:17.290
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

3318
01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:18.970
<v Speaker 8>they're having a harder time moving.</v>

3319
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.100
<v Speaker 8>They don't have the confidence to have the balanced move around and their,</v>

3320
01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:23.450
<v Speaker 8>their,</v>

3321
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.950
<v Speaker 8>their,</v>

3322
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:26.330
<v Speaker 8>their systems short circuiting.</v>

3323
01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:26.790
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3324
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:27.070
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

3325
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:28.660
<v Speaker 8>and you're seeing it in their coordination.</v>

3326
01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 8>It's a weird thing to see too.</v>

3327
01:33:30.011 --> 01:33:34.000
<v Speaker 8>I've seen it in fighters where I remember them in their prime and then I see</v>

3328
01:33:34.001 --> 01:33:34.781
<v Speaker 8>them now and I'm like,</v>

3329
01:33:34.781 --> 01:33:35.614
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

3330
01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.410
<v Speaker 8>there's too,</v>

3331
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:37.300
<v Speaker 8>it's two possibilities.</v>

3332
01:33:37.301 --> 01:33:38.140
<v Speaker 8>It could be an injury,</v>

3333
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:39.370
<v Speaker 8>they could be dealing with an injury,</v>

3334
01:33:39.371 --> 01:33:41.250
<v Speaker 8>but if you find that there's no injury and like,</v>

3335
01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.760
<v Speaker 8>oh this is not good.</v>

3336
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.941
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3337
01:33:42.941 --> 01:33:46.040
<v Speaker 8>just look at Ben Roethlisberger out there and the pocket when he fell,</v>

3338
01:33:46.050 --> 01:33:47.230
<v Speaker 8>he tries to run.</v>

3339
01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.120
<v Speaker 8>It's like little steps,</v>

3340
01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:50.680
<v Speaker 8>no movement in the shell days.</v>

3341
01:33:50.681 --> 01:33:52.540
<v Speaker 8>And that guy used to be fast back there,</v>

3342
01:33:52.541 --> 01:33:53.830
<v Speaker 8>but he's gotten hit a lot.</v>

3343
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.480
<v Speaker 8>Does no getting away from it,</v>

3344
01:33:55.481 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

3345
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:56.951
<v Speaker 8>It is what it is.</v>

3346
01:33:56.951 --> 01:33:57.650
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3347
01:33:57.650 --> 01:33:57.891
<v Speaker 8>Have you,</v>

3348
01:33:57.891 --> 01:33:59.320
<v Speaker 8>had you ever been knocked out?</v>

3349
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3350
01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:00.790
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3351
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:01.810
<v Speaker 8>not unconscious.</v>

3352
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.760
<v Speaker 8>I've got stopped and a kickboxing match.</v>

3353
01:34:03.761 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 8>I got hit with a big left hook boom and my legs went out from under me.</v>

3354
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:08.680
<v Speaker 8>It was crazy.</v>

3355
01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:08.831
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3356
01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:09.580
<v Speaker 8>it didn't even hurt.</v>

3357
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:10.530
<v Speaker 8>It was like like,</v>

3358
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:11.841
<v Speaker 8>because you're,</v>

3359
01:34:11.841 --> 01:34:16.180
<v Speaker 8>you're full of adrenaline so you don't feel it in terms of like a ouchy.</v>

3360
01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:18.160
<v Speaker 8>It's not like [inaudible] but it's like,</v>

3361
01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.140
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't like a painful thing.</v>

3362
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:22.900
<v Speaker 8>It was like being and then my legs just stopped working.</v>

3363
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.231
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

3364
01:34:23.231 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

3365
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:24.940
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck?</v>

3366
01:34:25.450 --> 01:34:28.600
<v Speaker 8>That was the hardest I ever been hit because it was just on the button.</v>

3367
01:34:28.630 --> 01:34:30.820
<v Speaker 8>It was a perfect Isaac Duane.</v>

3368
01:34:30.821 --> 01:34:31.091
<v Speaker 8>I should,</v>

3369
01:34:31.091 --> 01:34:32.770
<v Speaker 8>as I was exhausted already,</v>

3370
01:34:32.771 --> 01:34:33.080
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't.</v>

3371
01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:38.080
<v Speaker 8>The third fight of a day in a kickboxing tournament and just crank and my legs</v>

3372
01:34:39.131 --> 01:34:42.940
<v Speaker 8>just went woopsies really lucky with all the fighting you did that you never got</v>

3373
01:34:42.941 --> 01:34:43.774
<v Speaker 8>knocked out.</v>

3374
01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.680
<v Speaker 8>Super Lucky.</v>

3375
01:34:44.681 --> 01:34:48.310
<v Speaker 8>But I definitely got hit in the head a bunch and even though I didn't get</v>

3376
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:49.060
<v Speaker 8>knocked out,</v>

3377
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:50.290
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of sparring.</v>

3378
01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.600
<v Speaker 8>There was a lot of getting punched in the face.</v>

3379
01:34:52.630 --> 01:34:54.040
<v Speaker 8>There was a lot of getting kicked in the head,</v>

3380
01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:55.510
<v Speaker 8>less kicked in the head,</v>

3381
01:34:55.511 --> 01:34:56.081
<v Speaker 8>believe it or not.</v>

3382
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:56.891
<v Speaker 8>Cause I was terrified.</v>

3383
01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 8>I was always moving fast.</v>

3384
01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.180
<v Speaker 8>She wear helmets.</v>

3385
01:34:59.240 --> 01:34:59.690
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3386
01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:00.950
<v Speaker 8>we wear these things.</v>

3387
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:04.400
<v Speaker 8>The first tournaments we used to wear these things on the back of the head and</v>

3388
01:35:04.401 --> 01:35:04.491
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

3389
01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:08.810
<v Speaker 8>that was so when you get knocked out your fucking head doesn't bounce too hard</v>

3390
01:35:08.811 --> 01:35:09.321
<v Speaker 8>off the ground.</v>

3391
01:35:09.321 --> 01:35:11.360
<v Speaker 8>I'm not bullshitting you pick one spot.</v>

3392
01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.430
<v Speaker 8>There's a video of me fighting with one of those on.</v>

3393
01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 8>It's a video of me on youtube.</v>

3394
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:19.490
<v Speaker 8>I've got this spot in the back of my head that it looks like a,</v>

3395
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.311
<v Speaker 8>like a bald spot.</v>

3396
01:35:20.311 --> 01:35:22.640
<v Speaker 8>Like I would have if I had hair now,</v>

3397
01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:24.050
<v Speaker 8>but it's a Yamaka.</v>

3398
01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:24.441
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3399
01:35:24.441 --> 01:35:24.801
<v Speaker 8>like a,</v>

3400
01:35:24.801 --> 01:35:26.180
<v Speaker 8>it's a red plastic thing.</v>

3401
01:35:26.181 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 8>It's hard to tell cause it's a shitty video.</v>

3402
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 8>But that red plastic thing was basically like a spongy thing that these to use</v>

3403
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:33.140
<v Speaker 8>in taekwondo terms.</v>

3404
01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:37.490
<v Speaker 8>Cause when it was first it was no padding and then eventually they made people</v>

3405
01:35:37.491 --> 01:35:40.480
<v Speaker 8>start wearing these helmets and they basically like these Cushnie,</v>

3406
01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:41.030
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3407
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:42.740
<v Speaker 8>helmets that go over the top of the head.</v>

3408
01:35:42.741 --> 01:35:43.930
<v Speaker 8>And you've got to strap them out underneath.</v>

3409
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.320
<v Speaker 8>See how that guy's wearing it?</v>

3410
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:46.693
<v Speaker 8>The White Guy,</v>

3411
01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:49.730
<v Speaker 8>the see the guy in the background or the right side that's wearing the white</v>

3412
01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:50.210
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>

3413
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:51.140
<v Speaker 8>That's the standard one.</v>

3414
01:35:51.141 --> 01:35:51.680
<v Speaker 8>What I'm wearing,</v>

3415
01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.030
<v Speaker 8>just a pat on the back of my head.</v>

3416
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:53.250
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3417
01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:55.850
<v Speaker 8>See that there's like a red thing in the back of my head.</v>

3418
01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.680
<v Speaker 8>But that's in case I got Kod.</v>

3419
01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Speaker 8>Cause when we're fighting on a fucking,</v>

3420
01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:02.360
<v Speaker 8>this is a basketball court.</v>

3421
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:04.610
<v Speaker 8>This is wood floor protection.</v>

3422
01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.440
<v Speaker 8>That was me knocking that guy out.</v>

3423
01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.271
<v Speaker 8>That was me.</v>

3424
01:36:08.271 --> 01:36:11.210
<v Speaker 8>This is me when I'm 19 so these,</v>

3425
01:36:11.211 --> 01:36:12.770
<v Speaker 8>this was where we fought all the time.</v>

3426
01:36:12.771 --> 01:36:14.270
<v Speaker 8>We always fought on hardwood floors.</v>

3427
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:17.150
<v Speaker 8>One time I fought crazy way crazier from this.</v>

3428
01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:17.984
<v Speaker 8>Ready for this?</v>

3429
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:19.340
<v Speaker 8>The Bay State Games.</v>

3430
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:21.260
<v Speaker 8>I find the bay state games.</v>

3431
01:36:21.261 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 8>We fought on a tarp that was laid out over a cement floor.</v>

3432
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:25.430
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

3433
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:26.000
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3434
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 8>And I knocked a guy out in his head,</v>

3435
01:36:27.831 --> 01:36:29.000
<v Speaker 8>bounced off the cement.</v>

3436
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:30.180
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

3437
01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.850
<v Speaker 8>Kicked this dude in the head and his head bounced off somewhere.</v>

3438
01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.310
<v Speaker 8>I'll never forget that sound.</v>

3439
01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:34.790
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

3440
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 8>So I was 19 I didn't know what the fuck to do.</v>

3441
01:36:37.701 --> 01:36:39.380
<v Speaker 8>This is where the tournament was,</v>

3442
01:36:39.381 --> 01:36:40.190
<v Speaker 8>is okay.</v>

3443
01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:40.701
<v Speaker 8>It's okay.</v>

3444
01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:41.534
<v Speaker 8>We're going to do this.</v>

3445
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:42.620
<v Speaker 8>We're going to fight here.</v>

3446
01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:43.940
<v Speaker 8>Like if that was today,</v>

3447
01:36:43.941 --> 01:36:44.420
<v Speaker 8>I would like,</v>

3448
01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:46.910
<v Speaker 8>are you guys out of your fucking mind?</v>

3449
01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:47.430
<v Speaker 8>I would.</v>

3450
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:51.020
<v Speaker 8>I would be screaming if I went with my kid and he was supposed to fight in a</v>

3451
01:36:51.021 --> 01:36:55.850
<v Speaker 8>tournament and I got there and there was a thin plastic tarp stretch out over a</v>

3452
01:36:55.851 --> 01:36:57.080
<v Speaker 8>smooth concrete floor.</v>

3453
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:57.651
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

3454
01:36:57.651 --> 01:36:59.300
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3455
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 8>Are you crazy?</v>

3456
01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:00.710
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3457
01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:01.880
<v Speaker 8>Like you need pads.</v>

3458
01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.010
<v Speaker 8>You need people to make sure they don't go out of bounds.</v>

3459
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:06.740
<v Speaker 8>Tarp laid down over concrete.</v>

3460
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:07.380
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

3461
01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.213
<v Speaker 8>He was so,</v>

3462
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:09.470
<v Speaker 8>so dangerous.</v>

3463
01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.450
<v Speaker 8>So I definitely got my noggin.</v>

3464
01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.450
<v Speaker 8>Rattled a gang at times.</v>

3465
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.990
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3466
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how many times</v>

3467
01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.470
<v Speaker 6>I said do a gymnastics for like six years.</v>

3468
01:37:19.471 --> 01:37:22.030
<v Speaker 6>Starting when I was like six I backflip.</v>

3469
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.621
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

3470
01:37:22.621 --> 01:37:23.250
<v Speaker 6>I could do,</v>

3471
01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:24.570
<v Speaker 6>I used to do double backs.</v>

3472
01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:24.960
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3473
01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.111
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3474
01:37:25.111 --> 01:37:25.471
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>

3475
01:37:25.471 --> 01:37:25.731
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3476
01:37:25.731 --> 01:37:27.120
<v Speaker 6>I trained for like six years.</v>

3477
01:37:27.121 --> 01:37:27.901
<v Speaker 6>Hard way.</v>

3478
01:37:27.901 --> 01:37:28.860
<v Speaker 6>How do I not know this?</v>

3479
01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:29.131
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3480
01:37:29.131 --> 01:37:30.530
<v Speaker 6>So I used to do a,</v>

3481
01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:30.751
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3482
01:37:30.751 --> 01:37:31.531
<v Speaker 6>I could do round off,</v>

3483
01:37:31.531 --> 01:37:33.150
<v Speaker 6>back handspring into a double back.</v>

3484
01:37:33.151 --> 01:37:34.020
<v Speaker 6>And you still do that?</v>

3485
01:37:34.110 --> 01:37:34.943
<v Speaker 6>I can,</v>

3486
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:37.020
<v Speaker 6>I haven't tried a single back in a while,</v>

3487
01:37:37.021 --> 01:37:37.800
<v Speaker 6>but I could do,</v>

3488
01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.960
<v Speaker 6>I could do standing back flips until a few years ago.</v>

3489
01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.220
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

3490
01:37:41.250 --> 01:37:41.610
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3491
01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:42.510
<v Speaker 8>no shit.</v>

3492
01:37:42.511 --> 01:37:43.344
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3493
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:44.271
<v Speaker 6>So I,</v>

3494
01:37:44.271 --> 01:37:45.740
<v Speaker 6>so I just wanted to learn how to do that.</v>

3495
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:46.530
<v Speaker 6>I did a,</v>

3496
01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:50.420
<v Speaker 6>I over rotated a flip one time and I fucking slammed my head in the maths back</v>

3497
01:37:50.421 --> 01:37:50.870
<v Speaker 6>then.</v>

3498
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:52.820
<v Speaker 6>When you see floor exercise today,</v>

3499
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:54.530
<v Speaker 6>it's not even the same sport.</v>

3500
01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:55.910
<v Speaker 6>It's all springboard.</v>

3501
01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:56.341
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3502
01:37:56.341 --> 01:37:58.020
<v Speaker 6>With like two inches of padding.</v>

3503
01:37:58.170 --> 01:37:58.321
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3504
01:37:58.321 --> 01:37:58.951
<v Speaker 6>When we did it,</v>

3505
01:37:58.951 --> 01:38:00.720
<v Speaker 6>it was those fucking rubber,</v>

3506
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:01.411
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3507
01:38:01.411 --> 01:38:04.980
<v Speaker 6>half inch thick mats that you roll out and the corners come popping up.</v>

3508
01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:06.330
<v Speaker 6>That's what we used to do it.</v>

3509
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:08.040
<v Speaker 6>Oh yes,</v>

3510
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 6>you were fucking twisting your ankle all the time,</v>

3511
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 6>landing on that shit.</v>

3512
01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:13.530
<v Speaker 6>How bad you fuck your head up when you landed.</v>

3513
01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:14.640
<v Speaker 6>It was bad.</v>

3514
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.250
<v Speaker 6>My injuries or my ankle.</v>

3515
01:38:16.251 --> 01:38:17.330
<v Speaker 6>So I used to fuck up my yeah.</v>

3516
01:38:17.331 --> 01:38:17.851
<v Speaker 6>And then you know,</v>

3517
01:38:17.851 --> 01:38:18.331
<v Speaker 6>you can't,</v>

3518
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:19.890
<v Speaker 6>then you can't do anything for a little while.</v>

3519
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:20.930
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

3520
01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:21.360
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

3521
01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.140
<v Speaker 8>the reason why I keep asking you about head trauma is cause my friend Mark</v>

3522
01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:25.620
<v Speaker 8>Gordon,</v>

3523
01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.960
<v Speaker 8>he's an expert in traumatic brain injury.</v>

3524
01:38:27.961 --> 01:38:31.200
<v Speaker 8>He's an endocrinologist and he studies a lot of soldiers and he's written a</v>

3525
01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:33.810
<v Speaker 8>bunch of papers on soldiers,</v>

3526
01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:34.830
<v Speaker 8>former football players,</v>

3527
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:35.371
<v Speaker 8>fighters.</v>

3528
01:38:35.371 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 8>He's worked with a bunch of people that have had brain injuries and his</v>

3529
01:38:39.571 --> 01:38:40.261
<v Speaker 8>conclusion,</v>

3530
01:38:40.261 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 8>like in a lot of them that were suicidal,</v>

3531
01:38:41.911 --> 01:38:43.440
<v Speaker 8>a lot of them that are severely depressed.</v>

3532
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:46.650
<v Speaker 8>And his conclusion is that for a lot of them,</v>

3533
01:38:46.651 --> 01:38:50.490
<v Speaker 8>what happened was damaged to the pituitary gland that stopped them from</v>

3534
01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:52.050
<v Speaker 8>producing hormones correctly.</v>

3535
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:54.720
<v Speaker 8>And it leads to severe lack of energy,</v>

3536
01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:55.554
<v Speaker 8>depression.</v>

3537
01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:00.600
<v Speaker 8>And it's almost always correlated with head trauma and oftentimes head trauma</v>

3538
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:01.530
<v Speaker 8>that people forgot about.</v>

3539
01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 8>Why didn't think of that big of a deal.</v>

3540
01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:07.530
<v Speaker 8>But it could be literally wiping out on a jet ski,</v>

3541
01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.470
<v Speaker 8>slamming into the water and yeah,</v>

3542
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:12.690
<v Speaker 8>and then you're fucked up for years and you don't know why.</v>

3543
01:39:12.691 --> 01:39:13.680
<v Speaker 8>Skiing for sure,</v>

3544
01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.251
<v Speaker 8>falling down,</v>

3545
01:39:14.251 --> 01:39:16.200
<v Speaker 8>hitting your head snowboarding is really common.</v>

3546
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:19.470
<v Speaker 8>I've never snowboarded but apparently when the s the board kicks up,</v>

3547
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.570
<v Speaker 8>your feet go up in the air and the fucking head comes down.</v>

3548
01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:22.080
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3549
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.250
<v Speaker 8>That's how people get got</v>

3550
01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.100
<v Speaker 6>well and you got to wear a helmet.</v>

3551
01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:25.490
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3552
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:26.500
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of kids don't.</v>

3553
01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:27.800
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3554
01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.410
<v Speaker 8>I've heard of kids getting fucked up so yeah.</v>

3555
01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:34.040
<v Speaker 8>But so all those things contribute to the foot.</v>

3556
01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.110
<v Speaker 8>Your brain is super delicate,</v>

3557
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.711
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3558
01:39:36.711 --> 01:39:38.180
<v Speaker 8>it's really complicated machinery.</v>

3559
01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:39.800
<v Speaker 8>It's like when you drop your iPhone,</v>

3560
01:39:39.801 --> 01:39:40.790
<v Speaker 8>maybe you drop at once,</v>

3561
01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.620
<v Speaker 8>how many times to drop your iPhone,</v>

3562
01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.790
<v Speaker 8>you drop to three times to hey,</v>

3563
01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:44.001
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

3564
01:39:44.001 --> 01:39:44.420
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

3565
01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:45.770
<v Speaker 8>put a fucking case on that thing.</v>

3566
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:46.663
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3567
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:50.450
<v Speaker 8>I mean they do these drop tests,</v>

3568
01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:50.960
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3569
01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:54.050
<v Speaker 8>They do drop tests where they drop it over concrete and see how good it is.</v>

3570
01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:57.270
<v Speaker 8>Your head is similar in that you,</v>

3571
01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.570
<v Speaker 8>you can get away with getting racked in the head.</v>

3572
01:39:59.571 --> 01:40:02.950
<v Speaker 8>But I was in Hawaii recently and I dropped my phone the last time that,</v>

3573
01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:03.620
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3574
01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:04.610
<v Speaker 8>you drop your phone and you know,</v>

3575
01:40:04.611 --> 01:40:08.090
<v Speaker 8>it's getting a little wonky and then you drop it the last time and it's just</v>

3576
01:40:08.091 --> 01:40:08.571
<v Speaker 8>gone.</v>

3577
01:40:08.571 --> 01:40:09.500
<v Speaker 8>So it's gone.</v>

3578
01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.570
<v Speaker 8>Ceville it was just calling people.</v>

3579
01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:12.140
<v Speaker 8>I would,</v>

3580
01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:12.630
<v Speaker 8>I was,</v>

3581
01:40:12.630 --> 01:40:13.280
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

3582
01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.150
<v Speaker 8>I was showing a,</v>

3583
01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:14.780
<v Speaker 8>so when I was,</v>

3584
01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:15.230
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3585
01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:16.820
<v Speaker 8>had the phone open and I was like,</v>

3586
01:40:16.821 --> 01:40:17.061
<v Speaker 8>watch,</v>

3587
01:40:17.061 --> 01:40:17.331
<v Speaker 8>watch,</v>

3588
01:40:17.331 --> 01:40:18.081
<v Speaker 8>it's on the context.</v>

3589
01:40:18.081 --> 01:40:20.630
<v Speaker 8>So like it's just going to start calling people and just started calling people</v>

3590
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:24.200
<v Speaker 8>and I'd hang up and they would just call somebody else to hang up and it would</v>

3591
01:40:24.201 --> 01:40:24.800
<v Speaker 8>just cost,</v>

3592
01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.480
<v Speaker 8>it was just falling apart.</v>

3593
01:40:26.690 --> 01:40:28.430
<v Speaker 8>It wouldn't let me log in anymore.</v>

3594
01:40:28.431 --> 01:40:29.091
<v Speaker 8>Like it wasn't,</v>

3595
01:40:29.091 --> 01:40:33.110
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't sensing my fingers touching the screen to put in the key code.</v>

3596
01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.460
<v Speaker 8>Here's your shit all backed up.</v>

3597
01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:34.871
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3598
01:40:34.871 --> 01:40:35.360
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

3599
01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:35.601
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

3600
01:40:35.601 --> 01:40:36.231
<v Speaker 8>It was all backed up,</v>

3601
01:40:36.231 --> 01:40:36.621
<v Speaker 8>but it was like,</v>

3602
01:40:36.621 --> 01:40:37.420
<v Speaker 8>God damn.</v>

3603
01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:37.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3604
01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:38.440
<v Speaker 6>Goddammit.</v>

3605
01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.273
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

3606
01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:40.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3607
01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.640
<v Speaker 6>I smashed my screen.</v>

3608
01:40:41.641 --> 01:40:41.970
<v Speaker 6>I didn't,</v>

3609
01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:42.803
<v Speaker 6>I didn't give a fuck</v>

3610
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:43.663
<v Speaker 8>your heads like that.</v>

3611
01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:44.540
<v Speaker 8>That's my point.</v>

3612
01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:44.760
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3613
01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.530
<v Speaker 8>Heads like that.</v>

3614
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:47.210
<v Speaker 8>Like if I didn't get that one last drop,</v>

3615
01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:48.950
<v Speaker 8>maybe a phone would've been all right.</v>

3616
01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:49.400
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3617
01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:50.510
<v Speaker 8>They would have kept that phone today.</v>

3618
01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:51.221
<v Speaker 8>You know what?</v>

3619
01:40:51.221 --> 01:40:52.540
<v Speaker 8>Maybe be able to look through the new phones went,</v>

3620
01:40:52.541 --> 01:40:53.170
<v Speaker 8>I don't need that.</v>

3621
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.520
<v Speaker 8>It's basically the same phone,</v>

3622
01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:55.453
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3623
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:56.323
<v Speaker 6>Nope.</v>

3624
01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.560
<v Speaker 6>Draak smack.</v>

3625
01:40:58.190 --> 01:41:00.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm reading this book now about,</v>

3626
01:41:00.021 --> 01:41:00.650
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3627
01:41:00.650 --> 01:41:01.910
<v Speaker 6>speaking of changing your brain,</v>

3628
01:41:01.911 --> 01:41:02.840
<v Speaker 6>it's called a,</v>

3629
01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:04.310
<v Speaker 6>how to change your mind.</v>

3630
01:41:04.590 --> 01:41:06.050
<v Speaker 6>God is Michael Pollan.</v>

3631
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3632
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:07.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3633
01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:08.480
<v Speaker 6>He's been on the podcast talking about,</v>

3634
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.601
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3635
01:41:08.601 --> 01:41:09.231
<v Speaker 6>no shit.</v>

3636
01:41:09.231 --> 01:41:09.521
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3637
01:41:09.521 --> 01:41:09.811
<v Speaker 6>that's great.</v>

3638
01:41:09.811 --> 01:41:10.430
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3639
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:11.720
<v Speaker 6>Did he talk about his new book,</v>

3640
01:41:11.721 --> 01:41:12.261
<v Speaker 6>about the,</v>

3641
01:41:12.261 --> 01:41:13.080
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3642
01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:13.330
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3643
01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:13.611
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3644
01:41:13.611 --> 01:41:14.990
<v Speaker 6>it's basically about,</v>

3645
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:16.363
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3646
01:41:16.450 --> 01:41:16.910
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3647
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:20.330
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics and LSD and mushrooms in particular,</v>

3648
01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.340
<v Speaker 6>trace of the whole fucking history of it.</v>

3649
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:26.780
<v Speaker 6>I had no idea how much research was done back in the fifties and sixties.</v>

3650
01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:27.351
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3651
01:41:27.351 --> 01:41:31.280
<v Speaker 6>they had conclusive studies that were showing with,</v>

3652
01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:32.133
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3653
01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:33.740
<v Speaker 6>alcoholism.</v>

3654
01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:38.860
<v Speaker 6>People were 70% of people that underwent these treatments with psychedelics got</v>

3655
01:41:39.471 --> 01:41:40.120
<v Speaker 6>sober,</v>

3656
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:40.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3657
01:41:40.730 --> 01:41:41.570
<v Speaker 6>depression,</v>

3658
01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:42.673
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes,</v>

3659
01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:43.790
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes.</v>

3660
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.811
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3661
01:41:44.811 --> 01:41:48.350
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing and all that shit just got fucking thrown away.</v>

3662
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:53.340
<v Speaker 8>Corrupt people kept that information away from folks.</v>

3663
01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:55.290
<v Speaker 8>The studies that Nixon funded,</v>

3664
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:58.830
<v Speaker 8>like Nixon funded a bunch of studies that showed positive benefits of marijuana.</v>

3665
01:41:59.310 --> 01:41:59.731
<v Speaker 8>How is that?</v>

3666
01:41:59.731 --> 01:42:00.030
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3667
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.450
<v Speaker 8>And they,</v>

3668
01:42:00.450 --> 01:42:00.870
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3669
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:01.920
<v Speaker 8>the Nixon administration,</v>

3670
01:42:01.921 --> 01:42:02.754
<v Speaker 8>just fucking,</v>

3671
01:42:02.770 --> 01:42:06.260
<v Speaker 6>can I get out of here with this shit not releasing this one.</v>

3672
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 6>The other thing he mentioned is that it got squashed by,</v>

3673
01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:13.420
<v Speaker 6>by shrinks because they had a vested interest in people not going into the woods</v>

3674
01:42:13.421 --> 01:42:16.150
<v Speaker 6>for a weekend and coming back without their depression.</v>

3675
01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:17.321
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

3676
01:42:17.321 --> 01:42:17.861
<v Speaker 6>so they,</v>

3677
01:42:17.861 --> 01:42:19.870
<v Speaker 6>so they disqualified all the studies.</v>

3678
01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:20.561
<v Speaker 6>Oh fuck.</v>

3679
01:42:20.561 --> 01:42:21.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3680
01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:24.880
<v Speaker 6>What psychiatrists were like horrified that there was the these kind of results,</v>

3681
01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:25.021
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

3682
01:42:25.021 --> 01:42:25.854
<v Speaker 6>we're coming back.</v>

3683
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:27.350
<v Speaker 8>Was it that for sure?</v>

3684
01:42:27.351 --> 01:42:32.210
<v Speaker 8>Or was it people who've never taken psychedelics horrified that people were out</v>

3685
01:42:32.211 --> 01:42:33.710
<v Speaker 8>there experimenting with their consciousness?</v>

3686
01:42:33.711 --> 01:42:37.000
<v Speaker 8>Because I think a lot of these psychiatrists are probably really straight laced</v>

3687
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.730
<v Speaker 8>guys.</v>

3688
01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:38.870
<v Speaker 8>And so in their mind,</v>

3689
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:43.810
<v Speaker 8>especially in the shadows of reefer madness and all the propaganda that they'd</v>

3690
01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.660
<v Speaker 8>heard in the 30s and forties and when you look at those people and they're out</v>

3691
01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:51.050
<v Speaker 8>there in the fucking desert or wherever they're going dancing around and taking</v>

3692
01:42:51.051 --> 01:42:52.130
<v Speaker 8>mushrooms under the moonlight,</v>

3693
01:42:52.131 --> 01:42:52.311
<v Speaker 8>you like,</v>

3694
01:42:52.311 --> 01:42:53.690
<v Speaker 8>they're blowing their brains out here.</v>

3695
01:42:53.691 --> 01:42:54.530
<v Speaker 8>You got to stop this.</v>

3696
01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:57.080
<v Speaker 8>If they're straight laced people that have ever done psychedelics,</v>

3697
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:58.940
<v Speaker 8>they might not be in cahoots.</v>

3698
01:42:58.970 --> 01:43:03.320
<v Speaker 8>It might more likely be a bunch of people to think it's a fucking terrible idea</v>

3699
01:43:03.321 --> 01:43:04.220
<v Speaker 8>to let people run around.</v>

3700
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:05.000
<v Speaker 8>Taken acid.</v>

3701
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.210
<v Speaker 6>Well there was just some of the medical journals came out with,</v>

3702
01:43:08.211 --> 01:43:13.070
<v Speaker 6>with pieces saying that none of these studies are valid because there wasn't a,</v>

3703
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:17.030
<v Speaker 6>I forget what it is about studies that have to be consistent.</v>

3704
01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.140
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3705
01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:22.250
<v Speaker 6>but the other thing is it was political and you had Timothy leary who is,</v>

3706
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:23.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3707
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:27.590
<v Speaker 6>the worst thing to happen to this kind of testing because he was saying was it</v>

3708
01:43:27.591 --> 01:43:27.911
<v Speaker 6>dropped,</v>

3709
01:43:27.911 --> 01:43:29.930
<v Speaker 6>dropped down in turn on,</v>

3710
01:43:29.931 --> 01:43:30.261
<v Speaker 6>drop,</v>

3711
01:43:30.261 --> 01:43:31.094
<v Speaker 6>drop out.</v>

3712
01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:32.270
<v Speaker 6>And that whole idea,</v>

3713
01:43:32.271 --> 01:43:32.661
<v Speaker 6>they said,</v>

3714
01:43:32.661 --> 01:43:32.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3715
01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:36.380
<v Speaker 6>were people taking LSD are not going to fight your wars.</v>

3716
01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:40.070
<v Speaker 6>And so that became a threat to the status quo.</v>

3717
01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:41.570
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3718
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:43.250
<v Speaker 6>And that's when the law is starting to come out.</v>

3719
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:45.743
<v Speaker 6>Huh.</v>

3720
01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:46.520
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting</v>

3721
01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.770
<v Speaker 8>cause he also got a lot of people to get excited about it.</v>

3722
01:43:48.771 --> 01:43:49.380
<v Speaker 8>That's</v>

3723
01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:50.213
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3724
01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:50.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3725
01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:51.653
<v Speaker 6>But he got,</v>

3726
01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.700
<v Speaker 3>he took it away from it being a,</v>

3727
01:43:54.730 --> 01:43:55.563
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3728
01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:59.420
<v Speaker 1>a medical process and he made it about,</v>

3729
01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:00.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3730
01:44:00.521 --> 01:44:01.271
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment,</v>

3731
01:44:01.271 --> 01:44:02.940
<v Speaker 3>but in a kind of fluffy spirit,</v>

3732
01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.793
<v Speaker 1>joy away.</v>

3733
01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:04.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3734
01:44:04.061 --> 01:44:05.380
<v Speaker 1>he made it a big movement.</v>

3735
01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3736
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:08.770
<v Speaker 1>I think you saw that he was probably going to change the world with that</v>

3737
01:44:08.771 --> 01:44:09.490
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

3738
01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:09.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3739
01:44:09.731 --> 01:44:12.760
<v Speaker 1>he kinda did definitely had a big impact.</v>

3740
01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:13.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3741
01:44:13.121 --> 01:44:14.500
<v Speaker 1>all those people that took acid,</v>

3742
01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:19.770
<v Speaker 1>like think about if you really stop and think about apple and you really look at</v>

3743
01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.740
<v Speaker 1>the fact that apple,</v>

3744
01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs said that taken acid.</v>

3745
01:44:26.271 --> 01:44:28.140
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of the greatest things that's ever happened to.</v>

3746
01:44:28.210 --> 01:44:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3747
01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:29.051
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

3748
01:44:29.051 --> 01:44:30.970
<v Speaker 1>as it was famously talked about it.</v>

3749
01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:32.891
<v Speaker 1>And who knows what a,</v>

3750
01:44:32.891 --> 01:44:37.891
<v Speaker 1>what an impact that had on him deciding to start apple and what would an impact</v>

3751
01:44:38.051 --> 01:44:40.240
<v Speaker 1>apple has had in the technology world.</v>

3752
01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

3753
01:44:40.710 --> 01:44:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Pollen talks about it in the book.</v>

3754
01:44:42.031 --> 01:44:45.810
<v Speaker 3>He draws a straight line from people starting to take all this stuff because it</v>

3755
01:44:45.811 --> 01:44:47.760
<v Speaker 3>was happening in Silicon Valley.</v>

3756
01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:50.880
<v Speaker 3>This whole psychedelic movement was like right in that area.</v>

3757
01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:52.310
<v Speaker 3>And he says that it,</v>

3758
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3759
01:44:52.681 --> 01:44:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Bill,</v>

3760
01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates apparently took it once,</v>

3761
01:44:55.410 --> 01:44:58.170
<v Speaker 3>but that all those guys were coming in and they were,</v>

3762
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3763
01:44:58.621 --> 01:44:58.821
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3764
01:44:58.821 --> 01:45:01.050
<v Speaker 3>there were these people that would lead.</v>

3765
01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.270
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy named,</v>

3766
01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.193
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3767
01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:06.733
<v Speaker 3>no Hubbard,</v>

3768
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:08.670
<v Speaker 3>well Ron doss has mentioned also,</v>

3769
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.610
<v Speaker 3>but there was a guy name Hubbard who was really like,</v>

3770
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:12.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3771
01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:14.430
<v Speaker 3>a corporate version of LSD.</v>

3772
01:45:14.431 --> 01:45:19.431
<v Speaker 3>He was going to companies and he was taking the CEO's of companies and taking</v>

3773
01:45:19.741 --> 01:45:24.060
<v Speaker 3>them in for these three day drop acid experiences.</v>

3774
01:45:24.570 --> 01:45:25.403
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3775
01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Corporate acid.</v>

3776
01:45:28.071 --> 01:45:28.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3777
01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:29.810
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of doing that at burning man.</v>

3778
01:45:30.670 --> 01:45:30.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3779
01:45:30.831 --> 01:45:31.341
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

3780
01:45:31.341 --> 01:45:32.174
<v Speaker 1>Some corporations,</v>

3781
01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3782
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 1>not a lot,</v>

3783
01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:36.440
<v Speaker 1>but there's some cool companies and go to burning man.</v>

3784
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3785
01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.053
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3786
01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:41.560
<v Speaker 1>what's this Alfred Matthew Hubbard,</v>

3787
01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.320
<v Speaker 1>he's an early proponent of the drug LSD.</v>

3788
01:45:44.321 --> 01:45:45.460
<v Speaker 1>During the 1950s,</v>

3789
01:45:45.461 --> 01:45:49.930
<v Speaker 1>he is reputed to be the Johnny Appleseed of Lsd and the first person to</v>

3790
01:45:49.931 --> 01:45:54.931
<v Speaker 1>emphasize led lsds potential as a visionary or trends and dental truck.</v>

3791
01:45:56.410 --> 01:45:58.780
<v Speaker 3>But this guy had on a fucking life,</v>

3792
01:45:58.781 --> 01:46:00.610
<v Speaker 3>somebody's got to do a movie about his life.</v>

3793
01:46:00.611 --> 01:46:00.831
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3794
01:46:00.831 --> 01:46:04.540
<v Speaker 3>he was like working for the government.</v>

3795
01:46:04.570 --> 01:46:06.130
<v Speaker 3>He was a double agent.</v>

3796
01:46:06.131 --> 01:46:06.810
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

3797
01:46:06.810 --> 01:46:07.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3798
01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:08.560
<v Speaker 3>while he was dropping acid.</v>

3799
01:46:08.710 --> 01:46:09.543
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

3800
01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:10.150
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3801
01:46:10.150 --> 01:46:11.380
<v Speaker 3>he started with nothing.</v>

3802
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.891
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3803
01:46:11.891 --> 01:46:12.760
<v Speaker 3>I think before,</v>

3804
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:13.841
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

3805
01:46:13.841 --> 01:46:14.680
<v Speaker 3>during and after.</v>

3806
01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:19.710
<v Speaker 3>He had like eight different careers and he was like a spy and he bought it.</v>

3807
01:46:20.501 --> 01:46:24.250
<v Speaker 3>He started with nothing and ended up with like a bunch of airplanes that he was</v>

3808
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:25.420
<v Speaker 3>leasing out,</v>

3809
01:46:25.421 --> 01:46:29.200
<v Speaker 3>became a millionaire and then spent it all trying to educate people on Lsd.</v>

3810
01:46:29.201 --> 01:46:33.040
<v Speaker 3>He was worth like tens of millions of dollars and he ended up broke at the end.</v>

3811
01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3812
01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:36.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3813
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:37.143
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3814
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:39.790
<v Speaker 1>All for the LSD,</v>

3815
01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:43.930
<v Speaker 3>he believed in it so strongly that said it was going to change the world and it</v>

3816
01:46:43.931 --> 01:46:44.764
<v Speaker 3>would have,</v>

3817
01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:46.120
<v Speaker 3>it may still now there's,</v>

3818
01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.390
<v Speaker 3>now it's coming back back.</v>

3819
01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3820
01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 1>there was a hiccup or several</v>

3821
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.170
<v Speaker 8>generations had a pass before people started understanding that there's,</v>

3822
01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:54.060
<v Speaker 8>there's,</v>

3823
01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.340
<v Speaker 8>there's a risk to everything.</v>

3824
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:58.380
<v Speaker 8>There's a risk to sports.</v>

3825
01:46:58.381 --> 01:47:02.430
<v Speaker 8>There's a risk to every fucking thing you do driving your cars are at risk.</v>

3826
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 8>There's a risk with psychedelics,</v>

3827
01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:07.110
<v Speaker 8>but there's also a reward and I think if you're going to be honest,</v>

3828
01:47:07.111 --> 01:47:08.250
<v Speaker 8>do you have to look at both of them?</v>

3829
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:09.840
<v Speaker 8>You have to look at the potential risk.</v>

3830
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:14.150
<v Speaker 8>You have to look at the reward and they're not looking at the reward to try to,</v>

3831
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:17.640
<v Speaker 8>there's too many people out there that are trying to deny the reward and you got</v>

3832
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:18.474
<v Speaker 8>to find out why.</v>

3833
01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:21.630
<v Speaker 8>And in this day and age it might be a conspiracy,</v>

3834
01:47:21.631 --> 01:47:26.070
<v Speaker 8>it might be some pharmaceutical industry that doesn't want it to be legal</v>

3835
01:47:26.071 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 8>because it would undermine their profits.</v>

3836
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:28.410
<v Speaker 8>It might be,</v>

3837
01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:32.970
<v Speaker 8>it might be some law enforcement unions that think it's a bad idea to make less</v>

3838
01:47:32.971 --> 01:47:33.960
<v Speaker 8>things illegal.</v>

3839
01:47:33.961 --> 01:47:34.794
<v Speaker 8>It will take,</v>

3840
01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:35.730
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3841
01:47:35.730 --> 01:47:36.480
<v Speaker 8>prisons.</v>

3842
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:36.731
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3843
01:47:36.731 --> 01:47:38.220
<v Speaker 8>It will take people away,</v>

3844
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:38.461
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3845
01:47:38.461 --> 01:47:40.590
<v Speaker 8>in terms of the amount of people that they need for the job,</v>

3846
01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:41.580
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3847
01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:44.220
<v Speaker 8>which I think that's another story.</v>

3848
01:47:44.221 --> 01:47:46.530
<v Speaker 8>But when you,</v>

3849
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.393
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3850
01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:52.790
<v Speaker 8>and people look at that kind of stuff and you look at like the,</v>

3851
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000
<v Speaker 8>the underlying sort of patterns that we follow in this country,</v>

3852
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.321
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3853
01:48:00.321 --> 01:48:01.370
<v Speaker 8>the patterns that we like,</v>

3854
01:48:01.371 --> 01:48:05.180
<v Speaker 8>are you happy or not happy with the way things go?</v>

3855
01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:06.500
<v Speaker 8>The way things are run.</v>

3856
01:48:07.450 --> 01:48:07.910
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

3857
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:08.960
<v Speaker 8>In what sense?</v>

3858
01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:11.330
<v Speaker 8>Just in any sense in all of it,</v>

3859
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:16.830
<v Speaker 6>I trust that we do have the best system out there.</v>

3860
01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:19.620
<v Speaker 6>And we challenge it every day.</v>

3861
01:48:19.621 --> 01:48:24.621
<v Speaker 6>And I still think that we live in a place where the tenants of our society are</v>

3862
01:48:26.131 --> 01:48:28.530
<v Speaker 6>in place for sure they swing one way or the other,</v>

3863
01:48:28.531 --> 01:48:31.380
<v Speaker 6>but I still believe in democracy.</v>

3864
01:48:31.381 --> 01:48:32.400
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3865
01:48:32.401 --> 01:48:37.401
<v Speaker 6>I think the internet as an as an overall thing has been positive for people</v>

3866
01:48:38.131 --> 01:48:39.900
<v Speaker 6>getting their voices out and for,</v>

3867
01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.070
<v Speaker 6>for information period</v>

3868
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.173
<v Speaker 8>being distributed.</v>

3869
01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.680
<v Speaker 8>But the I,</v>

3870
01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:47.160
<v Speaker 8>the idea that we're faced with that in this day and age,</v>

3871
01:48:47.161 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 8>there's grown adults telling other grown adults what they can and can't put in</v>

3872
01:48:50.611 --> 01:48:51.444
<v Speaker 8>their body.</v>

3873
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.840
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3874
01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 8>And then not being honest about the benefits.</v>

3875
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3876
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:55.650
<v Speaker 8>That's where it gets squirrely.</v>

3877
01:48:55.651 --> 01:48:57.210
<v Speaker 8>That's where the whole thing falls apart.</v>

3878
01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 8>Like you're just a guy.</v>

3879
01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 8>Like if you and I are the only two people on the planet and he only came out,</v>

3880
01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:02.400
<v Speaker 8>I'm not going to let you take that acid.</v>

3881
01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:03.121
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

3882
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:03.954
<v Speaker 8>why?</v>

3883
01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:04.891
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3884
01:49:04.891 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 8>because it's illegal.</v>

3885
01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:06.451
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

3886
01:49:06.451 --> 01:49:07.284
<v Speaker 8>I wrote it down.</v>

3887
01:49:07.570 --> 01:49:08.610
<v Speaker 8>Can you take the acid?</v>

3888
01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:08.840
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3889
01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:08.930
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3890
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:10.110
<v Speaker 8>that would be preposterous.</v>

3891
01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:10.530
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3892
01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:11.311
<v Speaker 8>But somehow or another,</v>

3893
01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:15.030
<v Speaker 8>it works when there's a million people that a person could tell.</v>

3894
01:49:15.031 --> 01:49:15.390
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

3895
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:16.950
<v Speaker 8>if you're a fucking grown adult,</v>

3896
01:49:16.951 --> 01:49:20.610
<v Speaker 8>you can't tell me what I can take that stupid.</v>

3897
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.473
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3898
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.800
<v Speaker 8>If,</v>

3899
01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 8>if you can't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that what I'm going to take is</v>

3900
01:49:26.491 --> 01:49:27.630
<v Speaker 8>gonna fuck with you.</v>

3901
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:29.010
<v Speaker 8>If you can't prove that,</v>

3902
01:49:29.011 --> 01:49:29.670
<v Speaker 8>then stop.</v>

3903
01:49:29.670 --> 01:49:30.503
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3904
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.991
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

3905
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:32.160
<v Speaker 8>if someone does something,</v>

3906
01:49:32.161 --> 01:49:35.610
<v Speaker 8>if takes something and does and they take PCP and they run face first through a</v>

3907
01:49:35.611 --> 01:49:37.890
<v Speaker 8>fucking seven 11 window that's on them,</v>

3908
01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:39.150
<v Speaker 8>it's on their actions.</v>

3909
01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to try PCP and I don't think you should</v>

3910
01:49:42.421 --> 01:49:43.254
<v Speaker 8>try PCP.</v>

3911
01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:46.500
<v Speaker 8>I think when enough enough people smashed through windows and go crazy,</v>

3912
01:49:46.501 --> 01:49:46.621
<v Speaker 8>you go,</v>

3913
01:49:46.621 --> 01:49:46.831
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

3914
01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 8>maybe that's a drug I should fucking avoid.</v>

3915
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:50.350
<v Speaker 8>But that's how you find out about that.</v>

3916
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:51.100
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3917
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 8>You lit grown adults make their own decisions and if you're the one who's making</v>

3918
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:56.890
<v Speaker 8>the decisions for all the grown adults,</v>

3919
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 8>you better have some real fucking logic to what you're saying.</v>

3920
01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:00.760
<v Speaker 8>It turns out they don't</v>

3921
01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:04.710
<v Speaker 6>and this is the same society that allows the pharmaceuticals to peddle opiates</v>

3922
01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.700
<v Speaker 6>to people for the last 30 years saying that it was the greatest thing you could</v>

3923
01:50:08.701 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

3924
01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 8>Exactly.</v>

3925
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:13.750
<v Speaker 8>I think it's good that they make money because they make medicine that helps a</v>

3926
01:50:13.751 --> 01:50:14.584
<v Speaker 8>lot of people.</v>

3927
01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.060
<v Speaker 8>They're not all bad.</v>

3928
01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.890
<v Speaker 8>I think in general,</v>

3929
01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:21.550
<v Speaker 8>pharmaceuticals have helped people in tremendous ways,</v>

3930
01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:25.030
<v Speaker 8>but you can't deny that if there's some way,</v>

3931
01:50:25.031 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 8>shape or form that people are influencing other people having access to</v>

3932
01:50:29.861 --> 01:50:33.130
<v Speaker 8>beneficial things because it would impact their profit line.</v>

3933
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 8>That's,</v>

3934
01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 8>that's evil.</v>

3935
01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:36.880
<v Speaker 8>That's evil.</v>

3936
01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 8>You have a lot of fucking money.</v>

3937
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:43.390
<v Speaker 8>If you really going out of your way to hire lobbyists to make sure that</v>

3938
01:50:43.391 --> 01:50:45.130
<v Speaker 8>mushrooms don't get on the table,</v>

3939
01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:47.411
<v Speaker 8>come on,</v>

3940
01:50:47.411 --> 01:50:48.200
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

3941
01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:49.033
<v Speaker 8>You're you are.</v>

3942
01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.980
<v Speaker 8>You're a fucking real problem.</v>

3943
01:50:50.981 --> 01:50:52.120
<v Speaker 8>That's a real problem.</v>

3944
01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:53.740
<v Speaker 8>If you look at Yin and Yang,</v>

3945
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.371
<v Speaker 8>this is,</v>

3946
01:50:54.371 --> 01:50:59.371
<v Speaker 8>this is the opposing forces that were battling to try to get total complete</v>

3947
01:50:59.741 --> 01:51:01.060
<v Speaker 8>freedom of your consciousness.</v>

3948
01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:02.830
<v Speaker 8>These are the opposing forces.</v>

3949
01:51:02.831 --> 01:51:05.050
<v Speaker 8>Their ignorance like these psychiatry,</v>

3950
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.650
<v Speaker 8>I guarantee you the psychiatrists were worried about correlations between</v>

3951
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:11.920
<v Speaker 8>psychotic episodes and psychedelic drug use.</v>

3952
01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:15.490
<v Speaker 8>And they're worried about people falling apart and they're right.</v>

3953
01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 8>They're right.</v>

3954
01:51:16.210 --> 01:51:17.370
<v Speaker 8>This are the ones that wanted to get it.</v>

3955
01:51:17.371 --> 01:51:17.951
<v Speaker 8>Illegal debt.</v>

3956
01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:18.784
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3957
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:22.330
<v Speaker 8>It's like working on backflips when there's a fucking thin pad under you.</v>

3958
01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:22.631
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3959
01:51:22.631 --> 01:51:23.620
<v Speaker 8>You could fall in your head.</v>

3960
01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.513
<v Speaker 8>You're right.</v>

3961
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:24.941
<v Speaker 8>And we say,</v>

3962
01:51:24.941 --> 01:51:26.680
<v Speaker 8>don't do gymnastics.</v>

3963
01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:28.000
<v Speaker 8>People fall in their head.</v>

3964
01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:30.160
<v Speaker 8>One out of 10 falls on their head.</v>

3965
01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:32.530
<v Speaker 8>You're not doing Jimmy not falling on your fucking head.</v>

3966
01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:33.180
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3967
01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:34.013
<v Speaker 8>This is the same thing.</v>

3968
01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:35.013
<v Speaker 8>It's the same thing.</v>

3969
01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.950
<v Speaker 8>So people worried about it that don't really have experience in it.</v>

3970
01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:42.820
<v Speaker 8>I guarantee you most of those psychiatrists just didn't have experience in it.</v>

3971
01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:44.770
<v Speaker 8>Or we're super cautious folks is,</v>

3972
01:51:44.771 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 8>if they did have experienced with it,</v>

3973
01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:48.400
<v Speaker 8>maybe they try a little mushroom dose and they'd be like,</v>

3974
01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:49.234
<v Speaker 8>wow,</v>

3975
01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:51.080
<v Speaker 6>this is amazing.</v>

3976
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.910
<v Speaker 6>His screen.</v>

3977
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:53.390
<v Speaker 6>And also controlling,</v>

3978
01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:54.253
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3979
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:55.783
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3980
01:51:55.850 --> 01:51:56.780
<v Speaker 6>set and setting.</v>

01:51:56.781 --> 01:51:57.950
<v Speaker 6>They keep talking about,</v>

3982
01:51:58.340 --> 01:51:58.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3983
01:51:58.701 --> 01:52:00.330
<v Speaker 6>and realizing that the,</v>

3984
01:52:00.331 --> 01:52:01.130

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3986
01:52:02.150 --> 01:52:06.530
<v Speaker 6>occurrence of a psychotic episode is so much lower when it's,</v>

3987
01:52:06.531 --> 01:52:06.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3988
01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.380
<v Speaker 6>when you're,</v>

3989
01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.430
<v Speaker 6>when it's being dispensed the right way so much lower.</v>

3990
01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.340
<v Speaker 6>You ever been led through it by somebody.</v>

<v Speaker 8>like a infinite cyte clone of geometric patterns in impossible colors.</v>

4017
01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:10.150
<v Speaker 8>Just blasting in your brain instantaneously and you'll have like going into it</v>

4018
01:53:10.731 --> 01:53:15.230
<v Speaker 8>with the intention of letting go is probably one of the best pieces of advice</v>

4019
01:53:15.231 --> 01:53:18.200
<v Speaker 8>you could give people to avoid a freak out,</v>

4020
01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:18.980
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4021
01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:19.813
<v Speaker 8>Go with it.</v>

4022
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.930
<v Speaker 8>Let it go.</v>

4023
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:21.920
<v Speaker 8>Just let yourself go.</v>

4024
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:25.670
<v Speaker 8>And it's what's trying to do is your ego is trying to wrestle with this grizzly</v>

4025
01:53:25.671 --> 01:53:26.420
<v Speaker 8>bear.</v>

4026
01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:30.110
<v Speaker 8>This enormous short face bear on steroids is trying to,</v>

4027
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:33.590
<v Speaker 8>your ego's trying to wrestle with is impossible to resist force.</v>

4028
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:36.230
<v Speaker 8>And that's what leads to a lot of people freaking out.</v>

4029
01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:37.280
<v Speaker 8>So Iga,</v>

4030
01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:40.970
<v Speaker 8>losing your ego is the ultimate goal of it.</v>

4031
01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:42.463
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4032
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.230
<v Speaker 8>I don't think anybody ever really loses their ego.</v>

4033
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:46.391
<v Speaker 8>I think you,</v>

4034
01:53:46.391 --> 01:53:47.480
<v Speaker 8>you keep it in check.</v>

4035
01:53:47.481 --> 01:53:48.710
<v Speaker 8>You lose some of it.</v>

4036
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:51.080
<v Speaker 8>You keep some of it because that's,</v>

4037
01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:52.760
<v Speaker 8>it's part of your survival mechanism.</v>

4038
01:53:52.761 --> 01:53:52.911
<v Speaker 8>And there,</v>

4039
01:53:52.911 --> 01:53:54.980
<v Speaker 8>the real problem is like having a healthy ego.</v>

4040
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.970
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4041
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:56.361
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

4042
01:53:56.361 --> 01:53:57.194
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4043
01:53:58.510 --> 01:54:00.870
<v Speaker 8>like if your wife looks good and she's looking at herself in the mirror,</v>

4044
01:54:00.871 --> 01:54:00.931
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

4045
01:54:00.931 --> 01:54:01.271
<v Speaker 8>she was like,</v>

4046
01:54:01.271 --> 01:54:01.810
<v Speaker 8>I look good.</v>

4047
01:54:01.810 --> 01:54:02.860
<v Speaker 8>You look fucking great.</v>

4048
01:54:02.890 --> 01:54:03.730
<v Speaker 8>I do look good.</v>

4049
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:04.731
<v Speaker 8>Like she feels good.</v>

4050
01:54:04.731 --> 01:54:05.291
<v Speaker 8>It feels everybody.</v>

4051
01:54:05.291 --> 01:54:06.124
<v Speaker 8>That's ego,</v>

4052
01:54:06.130 --> 01:54:06.341
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4053
01:54:06.341 --> 01:54:07.090
<v Speaker 8>You want to know you,</v>

4054
01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:07.840
<v Speaker 8>you look good,</v>

4055
01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.160
<v Speaker 8>but it's not a bad ego.</v>

4056
01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:10.160
<v Speaker 8>It's fun.</v>

4057
01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:10.750
<v Speaker 8>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4058
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:11.583
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4059
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.480
<v Speaker 8>The real problem is when it gets out of control and toxic than it,</v>

4060
01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:18.280
<v Speaker 8>like other people see it,</v>

4061
01:54:18.281 --> 01:54:19.200
<v Speaker 8>they're like [inaudible],</v>

4062
01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:19.961
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4063
01:54:19.961 --> 01:54:21.460
<v Speaker 8>you see gross,</v>

4064
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:24.460
<v Speaker 8>just gross behavior,</v>

4065
01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:25.570
<v Speaker 8>grow selfishness.</v>

4066
01:54:25.571 --> 01:54:26.770
<v Speaker 8>You see that and you go,</v>

4067
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:27.041
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

4068
01:54:27.041 --> 01:54:28.720
<v Speaker 8>that's the bad part of the ego.</v>

4069
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:29.580
<v Speaker 8>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4070
01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:30.413
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4071
01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:33.400
<v Speaker 8>But the key is to know which is which,</v>

4072
01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:34.450
<v Speaker 8>and that's hard.</v>

4073
01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:35.560
<v Speaker 8>It's hard to know which is which.</v>

4074
01:54:35.561 --> 01:54:38.680
<v Speaker 8>Which one is the overwhelming force inside your mind?</v>

4075
01:54:38.890 --> 01:54:42.790
<v Speaker 8>Which one is the one that's controlling your consciousness and your behavior in</v>

4076
01:54:42.791 --> 01:54:43.280
<v Speaker 8>which is,</v>

4077
01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:43.910
<v Speaker 8>is it the good one,</v>

4078
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:44.440
<v Speaker 8>the bad one?</v>

4079
01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:47.820
<v Speaker 8>Is it the fun healthy one or is it the one that is a,</v>

4080
01:54:47.821 --> 01:54:48.640
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4081
01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:50.950
<v Speaker 8>completely obsessed with yourself and only yourself?</v>

4082
01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:51.520
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4083
01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:53.530
<v Speaker 8>You don't know until you have these experiences.</v>

4084
01:54:53.531 --> 01:54:54.364
<v Speaker 8>And then the,</v>

4085
01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.150
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

4086
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:57.260
<v Speaker 8>the nature of them gets exposed.</v>

4087
01:54:57.261 --> 01:55:00.290
<v Speaker 8>It like takes him down to the roots and you start thinking about,</v>

4088
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:01.690
<v Speaker 8>well where did all this come from?</v>

4089
01:55:01.691 --> 01:55:02.440
<v Speaker 8>Like is it,</v>

4090
01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:02.951
<v Speaker 8>where's all,</v>

4091
01:55:02.951 --> 01:55:04.120
<v Speaker 8>what's the source of all this?</v>

4092
01:55:04.121 --> 01:55:04.330
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

4093
01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:04.810
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

4094
01:55:04.810 --> 01:55:06.160
<v Speaker 8>there's a validation issue.</v>

4095
01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:07.060
<v Speaker 8>There's a this issue,</v>

4096
01:55:07.061 --> 01:55:07.960
<v Speaker 8>there's a trust issue,</v>

4097
01:55:07.961 --> 01:55:08.710
<v Speaker 8>there's a,</v>

4098
01:55:08.710 --> 01:55:09.110
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4099
01:55:09.110 --> 01:55:10.390
<v Speaker 8>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

4100
01:55:10.391 --> 01:55:15.391
<v Speaker 8>It's swirling out of that in this unnatural form to create the negative behavior</v>

4101
01:55:18.671 --> 01:55:22.750
<v Speaker 8>that you are manifesting in your life.</v>

4102
01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:23.681
<v Speaker 8>Like it,</v>

4103
01:55:23.681 --> 01:55:25.000
<v Speaker 8>all of it comes from something.</v>

4104
01:55:25.001 --> 01:55:28.290
<v Speaker 8>And one of the things about psychedelic experiences is it shut it,</v>

4105
01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:32.080
<v Speaker 8>like it shuts the ego off for a second and lets you stand outside of and go look</v>

4106
01:55:32.081 --> 01:55:34.420
<v Speaker 8>with the things Dunia look at this thing.</v>

4107
01:55:34.421 --> 01:55:34.660
<v Speaker 8>Things,</v>

4108
01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:35.750
<v Speaker 8>grubs and alia,</v>

4109
01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.593
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't work.</v>

4110
01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:36.911
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4111
01:55:36.911 --> 01:55:37.331
<v Speaker 8>like here's,</v>

4112
01:55:37.331 --> 01:55:38.500
<v Speaker 8>here's a prep for example,</v>

4113
01:55:38.501 --> 01:55:39.430
<v Speaker 8>ego that doesn't work.</v>

4114
01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:40.633
<v Speaker 8>Namedropping</v>

4115
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:41.703
<v Speaker 9>okay.</v>

4116
01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:43.380
<v Speaker 8>Like if you're hanging out with someone and he's like,</v>

4117
01:55:43.381 --> 01:55:43.561
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

4118
01:55:43.561 --> 01:55:43.831
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4119
01:55:43.831 --> 01:55:45.390
<v Speaker 8>Sean Penn was over my house last night,</v>

4120
01:55:45.391 --> 01:55:45.650
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

4121
01:55:45.650 --> 01:55:45.810
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4122
01:55:45.810 --> 01:55:47.050
<v Speaker 8>I'm fucking in Ealing</v>

4123
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:47.941
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4124
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:51.330
<v Speaker 3>You know what Jeremy Pivot was just telling me about that last week.</v>

4125
01:55:51.650 --> 01:55:52.483
<v Speaker 8>Name dropping,</v>

4126
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.073
<v Speaker 8>why that name</v>

4127
01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:58.890
<v Speaker 8>but like it doesn't really work.</v>

4128
01:55:58.940 --> 01:55:59.120
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4129
01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:03.480
<v Speaker 8>but everybody knows your name dropping Steven Spielberg and are pretty tight.</v>

4130
01:56:03.481 --> 01:56:04.020
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

4131
01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:04.853
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

4132
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:05.791
<v Speaker 8>But it's one thing,</v>

4133
01:56:05.791 --> 01:56:09.030
<v Speaker 8>like if you told me you went over Sean Penn's house,</v>

4134
01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:09.630
<v Speaker 8>I'd be like,</v>

4135
01:56:09.630 --> 01:56:09.871
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

4136
01:56:09.871 --> 01:56:10.704
<v Speaker 8>what's he like?</v>

4137
01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:13.080
<v Speaker 8>Like then it wouldn't be name dropping.</v>

4138
01:56:13.530 --> 01:56:14.221
<v Speaker 8>Like if you did it,</v>

4139
01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:15.180
<v Speaker 8>it wouldn't be namedropping dropping.</v>

4140
01:56:15.181 --> 01:56:17.960
<v Speaker 8>Like if you told me like I was hanging out with Cha with Sean Penn,</v>

4141
01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:18.390
<v Speaker 8>I'd be like,</v>

4142
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:19.320
<v Speaker 8>oh how weird.</v>

4143
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.661
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4144
01:56:19.661 --> 01:56:21.100
<v Speaker 3>because it's the beginning of a story.</v>

4145
01:56:21.130 --> 01:56:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4146
01:56:21.370 --> 01:56:22.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just going to let that,</v>

4147
01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:24.310
<v Speaker 3>let that hang is a followup.</v>

4148
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.511
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4149
01:56:24.511 --> 01:56:25.620
<v Speaker 8>that's not your whole thing.</v>

4150
01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:26.340
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4151
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:26.641
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4152
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:30.930
<v Speaker 8>So like comedy is like name dropping with stories,</v>

4153
01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:32.390
<v Speaker 8>good stories that go with it.</v>

4154
01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:33.321
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

4155
01:56:33.321 --> 01:56:38.321
<v Speaker 3>there are comedians that are really like guileless about just bringing a name in</v>

4156
01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:43.690
<v Speaker 3>or bringing up a project they worked on and you look back at the joke and ego.</v>

4157
01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Could it told that joke without telling me that a Frank Sinatra was in the</v>

4158
01:56:47.901 --> 01:56:48.830
<v Speaker 3>audience that night?</v>

4159
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:49.723
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4162
01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:55.970

4163
01:56:55.971 --> 01:56:56.840
<v Speaker 3>He was the guy,</v>

4164
01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.070
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy,</v>

4165
01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:00.650
<v Speaker 3>the young hot guy in Boston.</v>

01:57:00.670 --> 01:57:01.503
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

4167
01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:02.870
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that dude,</v>

4168
01:57:02.871 --> 01:57:06.920
<v Speaker 3>you put his name on a marquee and he was fucking one year out of college and he</v>

4169
01:57:06.921 --> 01:57:10.670
<v Speaker 3>was this cute guy with a southern accent and the baseball cap on.</v>

4170
01:57:10.671 --> 01:57:15.560
<v Speaker 3>And he was silly and he would fill up a fucking room and he would just,</v>

4171
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:20.360
<v Speaker 3>and then he started to get some success and it always found his way in his act.</v>

4172
01:57:20.361 --> 01:57:21.110
<v Speaker 3>He would talk about,</v>

4173
01:57:21.110 --> 01:57:21.351

<v Speaker 3>did like three river Phoenix movies and he was fucking good.</v>

4186
01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:49.620
<v Speaker 3>And then somehow he got into the TV route and didn't follow the film.</v>

4187
01:57:49.730 --> 01:57:50.180
<v Speaker 3>But he's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4224
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I was like Anthony,</v>

4225
01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:47.710
<v Speaker 1>he was a murderer or back in Boston and it used to see him at Faneuil hall and</v>

4226
01:58:47.711 --> 01:58:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you'd fill that fucking place.</v>

4227
01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.050
<v Speaker 1>You know the comedy connection when they moved,</v>

4228
01:58:51.051 --> 01:58:51.701
<v Speaker 1>when Bloomin' right.</v>

4229
01:58:51.701 --> 01:58:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Took over and they moved to the big room and they moved out of that little tiny</v>

4230
01:58:54.671 --> 01:58:56.440
<v Speaker 1>room and put it in Faneuil hall.</v>

4231
01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I remember walking through there one day and Anthony Clark was murder and,</v>

4232
01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:01.990
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

4233
01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:03.220
<v Speaker 1>this is 90% women.</v>

4234
01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:04.513
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

4235
01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4236
01:59:04.710 --> 01:59:05.543
<v Speaker 1>At least hat right.</v>

4237
01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I saw women.</v>

4238
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4239
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.991
<v Speaker 1>I'll come and see him.</v>

4240
01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Guys loved them too.</v>

4241
01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:09.813
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

4242
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:11.350
<v Speaker 1>But women really loved him.</v>

4243
01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Thought he was so cute,</v>

4244
01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.040
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4245
01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:17.550
<v Speaker 6>Well they say that's the secret to being a draw is appeal to women because</v>

4246
01:59:17.551 --> 01:59:18.830
<v Speaker 6>they're the ones that decide what to do,</v>

4247
01:59:18.831 --> 01:59:19.100
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4248
01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4249
01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4250
01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.433
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4251
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not a whole lot of chicks begging to go to [inaudible].</v>

4252
01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:27.741
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4253
01:59:27.741 --> 01:59:28.574
<v Speaker 1>And if they are,</v>

4254
01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:29.390
<v Speaker 1>take them.</v>

4255
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.751
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

4256
01:59:29.751 --> 01:59:30.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

4257
01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4258
01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:32.720

4259
01:59:33.410 --> 01:59:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's like probably a disproportionate number of chicks going to see</v>

4260
01:59:36.381 --> 01:59:37.214
<v Speaker 1>aqua man.</v>

01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:44.830
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at the number of women that want to go see a superhero movie and</v>

02:04:19.071 --> 02:04:19.401
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4449
02:04:19.401 --> 02:04:23.030
<v Speaker 1>and his wife was a boxer and I was reading the story about him,</v>

4450
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:25.130
<v Speaker 1>like his experience,</v>

4451
02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.800
<v Speaker 1>like bringing her to the ring,</v>

4452
02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>like getting her,</v>

4453
02:04:28.630 --> 02:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>his wife is in there and she's going to knuckle up with some other chicken shit</v>

4454
02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.880
<v Speaker 1>and maybe get really fucking hurt.</v>

4455
02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4456
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:37.280
<v Speaker 1>And to be there while this is all happening.</v>

4457
02:04:38.570 --> 02:04:39.200
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

4458
02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a wild,</v>

4459
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:41.330
<v Speaker 2>that's a wild life.</v>

4460
02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:44.540
<v Speaker 2>A female fighter is a wild creature.</v>

4461
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:46.220
<v Speaker 2>You gotta think of male fighter.</v>

4462
02:04:46.221 --> 02:04:48.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like almost all boys,</v>

4463
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:53.830
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the back of their head have this ridiculous fantasy of being able</v>

4464
02:04:54.141 --> 02:04:55.220
<v Speaker 2>to fuck everybody up.</v>

4465
02:04:55.410 --> 02:04:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Like come on bitch.</v>

4466
02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:57.351
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4467
02:04:57.351 --> 02:05:00.590
<v Speaker 2>fight a bunch of people like Goddamn Chuck Norris movie and Karate Kick People.</v>

4468
02:05:00.591 --> 02:05:01.424
<v Speaker 2>That would be cool.</v>

4469
02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:03.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just the reality of learning how to do that.</v>

4470
02:05:03.221 --> 02:05:03.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4471
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4472
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>

4473
02:05:04.671 --> 02:05:05.660
<v Speaker 2>That's too much.</v>

4474
02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:08.060
<v Speaker 2>It's too dangerous to scare fuck this,</v>

4475
02:05:08.061 --> 02:05:09.170
<v Speaker 2>and most people don't do it.</v>

4476
02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:12.470
<v Speaker 2>But for women to have that,</v>

4477
02:05:12.471 --> 02:05:16.850
<v Speaker 2>it's probably way more rare to have this desire to secretly fuck people up.</v>

4478
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Probably way more rare.</v>

4479
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe like let's be generous and say 20% of the,</v>

4480
02:05:22.131 --> 02:05:26.840
<v Speaker 2>the number that men would want to fuck people are maybe 20% of that is like the</v>

4481
02:05:26.841 --> 02:05:27.920
<v Speaker 2>number that would be women.</v>

4482
02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:30.050
<v Speaker 2>So then how many of them go through with it?</v>

4483
02:05:30.110 --> 02:05:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4484
02:05:30.530 --> 02:05:34.910
<v Speaker 2>How many of them go through with it and get to be like a cat Zingano or get to</v>

4485
02:05:34.911 --> 02:05:37.280
<v Speaker 2>be like an Amanda Nunez like Jesus Christ.</v>

4486
02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:39.200
<v Speaker 2>If that number is so small,</v>

4487
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:41.720
<v Speaker 2>so small in terms of like general population,</v>

4488
02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:44.330
<v Speaker 2>those are some wild humans.</v>

4489
02:05:44.331 --> 02:05:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4490
02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:48.560
<v Speaker 2>If they get to that stage where they're fighting in a fucking cage for a living,</v>

4491
02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:49.700
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

4492
02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4493
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Someone like Holly Holm,</v>

4494
02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:54.290
<v Speaker 2>like that is a crazy way to make a living.</v>

4495
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:55.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4496
02:05:55.630 --> 02:05:55.931
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4497
02:05:55.931 --> 02:05:57.500
<v Speaker 7>Now you've got to think if they make it that far,</v>

4498
02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:59.260
<v Speaker 7>even more vicious than men because they've,</v>

4499
02:05:59.320 --> 02:05:59.800
<v Speaker 7>they've,</v>

4500
02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:00.131
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4501
02:06:00.131 --> 02:06:00.311
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

4502
02:06:00.311 --> 02:06:02.710
<v Speaker 7>there's such a social taboo for them.</v>

4503
02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:03.431
<v Speaker 7>For men,</v>

4504
02:06:03.431 --> 02:06:03.850
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

4505
02:06:03.850 --> 02:06:03.971
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

4506
02:06:03.971 --> 02:06:04.781
<v Speaker 7>that's bad ass.</v>

4507
02:06:04.781 --> 02:06:05.620
<v Speaker 7>You're an MMA fighter.</v>

4508
02:06:05.621 --> 02:06:06.454
<v Speaker 7>But for women,</v>

4509
02:06:06.610 --> 02:06:09.370
<v Speaker 7>everybody just thinks it's weird and they think there's something wrong with</v>

4510
02:06:09.371 --> 02:06:09.610
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>

4511
02:06:09.610 --> 02:06:09.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4512
02:06:09.791 --> 02:06:11.050
<v Speaker 2>it's become more acceptable,</v>

4513
02:06:11.051 --> 02:06:12.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's still terrifying,</v>

4514
02:06:12.250 --> 02:06:13.810
<v Speaker 2>especially for men that don't train,</v>

4515
02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:17.470
<v Speaker 2>like to wait for a man who doesn't train and he's like around Misha Tate,</v>

4516
02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:19.870
<v Speaker 2>she's really hot and she had also fuck people.</v>

4517
02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Like Ooh,</v>

4518
02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:22.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4519
02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:23.140
<v Speaker 2>they get weirded out.</v>

4520
02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Like imagine that girl could fuck you up like she's hot and she could fuck you</v>

4521
02:06:27.311 --> 02:06:28.144
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

4522
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:29.623
<v Speaker 7>That's not nice.</v>

4523
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:34.410
<v Speaker 7>Some guys probably love that people like that bondage with are tied up and</v>

4524
02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:34.880
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

4525
02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:35.690
<v Speaker 7>Overpowered.</v>

4526
02:06:35.690 --> 02:06:39.260
<v Speaker 7>But what are the odds that a girl who knows what the fuck people up is looking</v>

4527
02:06:39.261 --> 02:06:39.411
<v Speaker 7>for?</v>

4528
02:06:39.411 --> 02:06:42.260
<v Speaker 7>That kind of guy at almost zero.</v>

4529
02:06:42.290 --> 02:06:42.741
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4530
02:06:42.741 --> 02:06:43.490
<v Speaker 7>that's true.</v>

4531
02:06:43.490 --> 02:06:44.080
<v Speaker 7>Those girls will,</v>

4532
02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:44.960
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't line up.</v>

4533
02:06:44.961 --> 02:06:47.900
<v Speaker 7>Luke Rockhold looked at and get stuffed by another alpha.</v>

4534
02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.700
<v Speaker 7>That would be a good porn movie,</v>

4535
02:06:49.701 --> 02:06:50.534
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4536
02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:54.690
<v Speaker 7>Shit Day to do his bank.</v>

4537
02:06:54.691 --> 02:06:55.910
<v Speaker 7>It like Luke Rockhold,</v>

4538
02:06:55.911 --> 02:07:00.380
<v Speaker 7>you chew a lot of porn and bank it and then have it released after he's retired</v>

4539
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:01.243
<v Speaker 7>from his career.</v>

4540
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.670
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4541
02:07:01.670 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4542
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:03.290
<v Speaker 7>cause right now it's just going to get in the way.</v>

4543
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.710
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4544
02:07:03.710 --> 02:07:04.760
<v Speaker 7>Excuse me to be a distraction.</v>

4545
02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:05.613
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4546
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:08.450
<v Speaker 7>But he knows that's his 401k my porn.</v>

4547
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:11.263
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4548
02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:12.613
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

4549
02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:14.701
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4550
02:07:14.701 --> 02:07:15.534
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

4551
02:07:15.630 --> 02:07:18.780
<v Speaker 2>the numbers of a women that become elite fighters.</v>

4552
02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what it is in terms of like the amount,</v>

4553
02:07:21.151 --> 02:07:25.050
<v Speaker 2>the try it and then the amount that become fully successful.</v>

4554
02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's a tiny,</v>

4555
02:07:27.611 --> 02:07:30.340
<v Speaker 2>tiny percentage like to get all the way through.</v>

4556
02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:31.713
<v Speaker 2>Like how many,</v>

4557
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:33.430
<v Speaker 2>like how many men,</v>

4558
02:07:33.431 --> 02:07:33.851
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

4559
02:07:33.851 --> 02:07:34.601
<v Speaker 2>when you were growing up,</v>

4560
02:07:34.601 --> 02:07:35.434
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

4561
02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4562
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:41.010
<v Speaker 8>either wanted to learn how to box or wrestle or do some kind of marsh.</v>

4563
02:07:41.121 --> 02:07:42.160
<v Speaker 8>A lot of wrestlers.</v>

4564
02:07:42.161 --> 02:07:42.550
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4565
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:43.220
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4566
02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:44.590
<v Speaker 8>I mean it was a school sport.</v>

4567
02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:47.400
<v Speaker 6>There was taekwondo and there was wrestling.</v>

4568
02:07:47.401 --> 02:07:49.140
<v Speaker 6>Those are pretty much the only forms that I,</v>

4569
02:07:49.170 --> 02:07:49.711
<v Speaker 6>that I saw.</v>

4570
02:07:49.711 --> 02:07:51.150
<v Speaker 6>We didn't have boxing in my town,</v>

4571
02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:53.360
<v Speaker 8>but a lot of kids you knew were into it,</v>

4572
02:07:53.361 --> 02:07:53.570
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4573
02:07:53.570 --> 02:07:54.110
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>

4574
02:07:54.110 --> 02:07:54.530
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4575
02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:55.363
<v Speaker 8>How many girls?</v>

4576
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:58.263
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

4577
02:07:59.110 --> 02:08:00.010
<v Speaker 8>I can't think of any.</v>

4578
02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:01.233
<v Speaker 8>Super rare,</v>

4579
02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:04.420
<v Speaker 8>but the martial arts classes did have a lot of girls.</v>

4580
02:08:04.690 --> 02:08:05.650
<v Speaker 8>It was kind of interesting.</v>

4581
02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:06.670
<v Speaker 8>It was a good number.</v>

4582
02:08:06.671 --> 02:08:07.630
<v Speaker 8>It wasn't half,</v>

4583
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:10.780
<v Speaker 8>but it might've been 20% yeah.</v>

4584
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:14.050
<v Speaker 8>It might be 20% women that were in those classes cause they wanted to learn self</v>

4585
02:08:14.051 --> 02:08:14.710
<v Speaker 8>defense,</v>

4586
02:08:14.710 --> 02:08:15.543
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>

4587
02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:16.610
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

4588
02:08:16.610 --> 02:08:21.230
<v Speaker 6>I put my daughter in taekwondo just she wasn't that into it,</v>

4589
02:08:21.231 --> 02:08:22.370
<v Speaker 6>but I go just do a year.</v>

4590
02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:26.900
<v Speaker 6>Just to give you some sense of facing somebody if a fight happens.</v>

4591
02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:27.830
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4592
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:30.870
<v Speaker 8>And some sense of what it's like to struggle with someone physically there</v>

4593
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:31.191
<v Speaker 8>moving.</v>

4594
02:08:31.191 --> 02:08:32.001
<v Speaker 8>You got to move with them.</v>

4595
02:08:32.001 --> 02:08:32.834
<v Speaker 8>You got to,</v>

4596
02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:34.760
<v Speaker 8>the older you are,</v>

4597
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:35.860
<v Speaker 8>when you start learning that,</v>

4598
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:38.210
<v Speaker 8>the more difficult it is to incorporate it into your,</v>

4599
02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:39.350
<v Speaker 8>the way you think about things.</v>

4600
02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:39.760
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4601
02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:40.581
<v Speaker 8>I think when you're young,</v>

4602
02:08:40.581 --> 02:08:42.770
<v Speaker 8>if you have some experience with martial arts,</v>

4603
02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:46.940
<v Speaker 8>you'll be more calm and confident if something happens when you get older.</v>

4604
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:47.300
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4605
02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:48.480
<v Speaker 8>You're already your bodies.</v>

4606
02:08:48.710 --> 02:08:50.780
<v Speaker 8>You develop knowing how to move that way.</v>

4607
02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:51.440
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4608
02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:55.070
<v Speaker 8>When you were already like kind of set in your ways and you're injured and</v>

4609
02:08:55.071 --> 02:08:57.440
<v Speaker 8>you're old and then someone wants to teach you a wheel kick like,</v>

4610
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:58.131
<v Speaker 8>oh Christ.</v>

4611
02:08:58.131 --> 02:08:58.850
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4612
02:08:58.850 --> 02:09:00.560
<v Speaker 8>Like there's no way my body is going to do that.</v>

4613
02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:00.980
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4614
02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:02.090
<v Speaker 8>My body has move like that.</v>

4615
02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:02.690
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4616
02:09:02.690 --> 02:09:05.560
<v Speaker 8>It's like you being able to do backflips click.</v>

4617
02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:06.770
<v Speaker 8>You could still do a backflip,</v>

4618
02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:09.830
<v Speaker 8>your body learn how to do that when you were young.</v>

4619
02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:10.240
<v Speaker 8>Yup.</v>

4620
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:12.220
<v Speaker 8>It gets in there that programs in there</v>

4621
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:12.970
<v Speaker 6>and there's a,</v>

4622
02:09:12.970 --> 02:09:17.110
<v Speaker 6>there's a moment of faith when you do a back flip where when you go up you have</v>

4623
02:09:17.111 --> 02:09:21.250
<v Speaker 6>to go up before you go back and that's the first mistake and the constant</v>

4624
02:09:21.251 --> 02:09:22.570
<v Speaker 6>mistake is people,</v>

4625
02:09:22.630 --> 02:09:27.250
<v Speaker 6>people go to do a backflip and they lunge backwards and they land in their head,</v>

4626
02:09:27.251 --> 02:09:30.910
<v Speaker 6>but you really have to trust that you have to shoot your hands up,</v>

4627
02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:31.900
<v Speaker 8>not back,</v>

4628
02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:33.880
<v Speaker 8>and then you pull it in,</v>

4629
02:09:34.210 --> 02:09:35.860
<v Speaker 8>go over damn scary.</v>

4630
02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:37.280
<v Speaker 6>And that's like that with the,</v>

4631
02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:40.630
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure with martial arts is this moves it or does a moment of faith.</v>

4632
02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.930
<v Speaker 8>When I don't train for a long time,</v>

4633
02:09:42.931 --> 02:09:46.140
<v Speaker 8>then I try to do a turning side kick on the heavy bag.</v>

4634
02:09:46.290 --> 02:09:47.160
<v Speaker 8>There's like a moment like,</v>

4635
02:09:47.161 --> 02:09:47.431
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

4636
02:09:47.431 --> 02:09:48.151
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to hit this thing.</v>

4637
02:09:48.151 --> 02:09:48.870
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4638
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:49.700
<v Speaker 8>What am I doing here?</v>

4639
02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:50.200
<v Speaker 8>I'm still rolling.</v>

4640
02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:50.550
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

4641
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.941
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4642
02:09:50.941 --> 02:09:52.260
<v Speaker 8>Ready and turn.</v>

4643
02:09:52.570 --> 02:09:53.403
<v Speaker 8>Let's drop something.</v>

4644
02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:53.880
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

4645
02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:56.490
<v Speaker 8>I just dropped this big ass knife.</v>

4646
02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:57.300
<v Speaker 8>Shit.</v>

4647
02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:58.560
<v Speaker 8>That's not good to have around right there.</v>

4648
02:09:59.910 --> 02:10:03.210
<v Speaker 8>What am I 12 keep this big giant knife on the table.</v>

4649
02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:04.261
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>

4650
02:10:04.261 --> 02:10:04.710
<v Speaker 8>when I,</v>

4651
02:10:04.710 --> 02:10:06.030
<v Speaker 8>when I do it today to this day,</v>

4652
02:10:06.031 --> 02:10:06.261
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>

4653
02:10:06.261 --> 02:10:08.520
<v Speaker 8>I have to do it slow a couple times and get the feel of it.</v>

4654
02:10:08.521 --> 02:10:08.710
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4655
02:10:08.710 --> 02:10:10.830
<v Speaker 8>I haven't trained in a while and then all right then,</v>

4656
02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:12.000
<v Speaker 8>then it becomes a normal thing.</v>

4657
02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:12.860
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4658
02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:13.291
<v Speaker 8>But man,</v>

4659
02:10:13.291 --> 02:10:14.940
<v Speaker 8>it's hell on your fucking knees.</v>

4660
02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:16.800
<v Speaker 8>I've got a new knee thing going on,</v>

4661
02:10:17.070 --> 02:10:17.903
<v Speaker 8>like the zoo.</v>

4662
02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:21.780
<v Speaker 8>The third time I've had to get stem cells injected into this meniscus tear.</v>

4663
02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:26.760
<v Speaker 8>I couldn't really hear this little tiny meniscus tear and it develops into</v>

4664
02:10:26.761 --> 02:10:27.594
<v Speaker 8>assist,</v>

4665
02:10:28.250 --> 02:10:28.530
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4666
02:10:28.530 --> 02:10:28.741
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

4667
02:10:28.741 --> 02:10:29.311
<v Speaker 8>the tear,</v>

4668
02:10:29.311 --> 02:10:32.370
<v Speaker 8>we've hit it with stem cells a few times and it doesn't give me any pain</v>

4669
02:10:32.371 --> 02:10:32.840
<v Speaker 8>anymore.</v>

4670
02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.230
<v Speaker 8>But assist keeps developing in that area and it assists,</v>

4671
02:10:36.231 --> 02:10:37.700
<v Speaker 8>has to get punctured and drain.</v>

4672
02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:39.740
<v Speaker 8>It's getting smaller and smaller.</v>

4673
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:41.970
<v Speaker 8>It happened three different times where I,</v>

4674
02:10:41.971 --> 02:10:42.770
<v Speaker 8>how to get it drained.</v>

4675
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:47.750
<v Speaker 8>And the last time was a few days ago and it was the smallest it's ever been,</v>

4676
02:10:47.751 --> 02:10:49.460
<v Speaker 8>but still fucking annoying.</v>

4677
02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:50.870
<v Speaker 8>But you're still running.</v>

4678
02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:52.033
<v Speaker 8>Yup.</v>

4679
02:10:52.110 --> 02:10:53.090
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't hurt when you run.</v>

4680
02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:56.360
<v Speaker 8>I'm taking time off right now and taking a little bit of time off right now.</v>

4681
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:58.380
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to tell you a couple of weeks off and a,</v>

4682
02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to run at a slower pace,</v>

4683
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:05.660
<v Speaker 8>skip the dog some exercise and I'm going to be more just more cautious about it.</v>

4684
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:06.680
<v Speaker 8>Not going to push myself.</v>

4685
02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:11.180
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to figure out what it is I'm doing that's causing this sis to recur.</v>

4686
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:16.130
<v Speaker 8>I think it's just overall pounding of the hill running,</v>

4687
02:11:16.131 --> 02:11:17.870
<v Speaker 8>kicking the bag and all that shit.</v>

4688
02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:18.260
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4689
02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:19.041
<v Speaker 8>I need to,</v>

4690
02:11:19.041 --> 02:11:19.430
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4691
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:23.390
<v Speaker 8>let it fully set in before I go back to doing that shit.</v>

4692
02:11:23.391 --> 02:11:25.310
<v Speaker 8>So I'm just doing a bunch of other different stuff now.</v>

4693
02:11:25.311 --> 02:11:27.440
<v Speaker 8>A lot of yoga is the cryogenics help.</v>

4694
02:11:27.970 --> 02:11:28.471
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4695
02:11:28.471 --> 02:11:29.540
<v Speaker 8>it'll help someone,</v>

4696
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:29.841
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4697
02:11:29.841 --> 02:11:32.510
<v Speaker 8>what would cryogenics is really good for is first of all,</v>

4698
02:11:32.511 --> 02:11:33.740
<v Speaker 8>it's really good for your mood.</v>

4699
02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:34.401
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

4700
02:11:34.401 --> 02:11:35.960
<v Speaker 8>if you've never done it before,</v>

4701
02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:37.940
<v Speaker 8>the best kind are the kind where you're,</v>

4702
02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.350
<v Speaker 8>you get your whole body in there,</v>

4703
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:42.170
<v Speaker 8>not just your neck down the neck down is okay.</v>

4704
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:43.580
<v Speaker 8>It's definitely better than nothing,</v>

4705
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:48.910
<v Speaker 8>but the real feeling is when your head's under and your whole body is like</v>

4706
02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:53.930
<v Speaker 8>immersed in this air that's cooled by liquid nitrogen,</v>

4707
02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:56.300
<v Speaker 8>it's fucking for raising dude.</v>

<v Speaker 8>40 minutes.</v>

4720
02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:10.700
<v Speaker 8>And then I sit down for 10 minutes and then I do another three minutes.</v>

4721
02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:12.020
<v Speaker 8>Damn.</v>

4722

<v Speaker 8>It'll reduce inflammation now,</v>

4727
02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 8>but nor epinephrin that's what it's called,</v>

4729
02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:21.290
<v Speaker 8>Is that the word?</v>

4730
02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:23.173
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>

4731
02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:24.410
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4732
02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:28.070
<v Speaker 8>that stuff gets radically boosted in your brain.</v>

4733
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:30.080
<v Speaker 8>It helps a lot of people with arthritis.</v>

4734
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:31.430
<v Speaker 8>A lot of people who have,</v>

4735
02:12:31.431 --> 02:12:31.700
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

4736
02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.020
<v Speaker 8>a lot of inflammation.</v>

4737
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:34.580
<v Speaker 8>It helps them is that I say I said it right.</v>

4738
02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:35.600
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4739
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:36.500
<v Speaker 8>it ramps that shit up.</v>

4740
02:12:36.501 --> 02:12:38.450
<v Speaker 8>You feel so good when you get out of there like woo.</v>

4741
02:12:38.451 --> 02:12:41.360
<v Speaker 8>It lasts a while to Ah,</v>

4742
02:12:41.410 --> 02:12:42.710
<v Speaker 8>you're just freezing to death.</v>

4743
02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:45.140
<v Speaker 8>You are freezing to death.</v>

4744
02:12:45.141 --> 02:12:47.810
<v Speaker 8>You were on your way to death and he step out of it and you're like,</v>

4745
02:12:47.811 --> 02:12:48.680
<v Speaker 8>wow.</v>

4746
02:12:48.710 --> 02:12:49.071
<v Speaker 8>And it just,</v>

4747
02:12:49.071 --> 02:12:51.620
<v Speaker 8>everything just feels woo la.</v>

4748
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:52.761
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4749
02:12:52.761 --> 02:12:53.780
<v Speaker 8>It feels good man.</v>

4750
02:12:53.781 --> 02:12:54.650
<v Speaker 8>It feels good.</v>

4751
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:55.520
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4752
02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.090
<v Speaker 8>I saw him.</v>

4753
02:12:56.090 --> 02:12:58.220
<v Speaker 8>I fucking love swimming in cold water.</v>

4754
02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.460
<v Speaker 8>It's amazing for you the the way you feel when you get out too.</v>

4755
02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:02.780
<v Speaker 8>But here's the thing.</v>

4756
02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:03.590
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4757
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:08.590
<v Speaker 8>it's not the best thing to do if you're trying to gain muscle weight.</v>

4758
02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:12.980
<v Speaker 8>You have to wait a while after the exercise.</v>

4759
02:13:12.981 --> 02:13:13.700
<v Speaker 8>Like there's,</v>

4760
02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:14.610
<v Speaker 8>apparently there's,</v>

4761
02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:18.170
<v Speaker 8>there's a bunch of different studies and I know Andy Galpin has been involved in</v>

4762
02:13:18.171 --> 02:13:19.490
<v Speaker 8>a bunch of these studies and Rhonda,</v>

4763
02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:22.010
<v Speaker 8>Patrick has discussed some of this research as well.</v>

4764
02:13:22.250 --> 02:13:22.861
<v Speaker 8>But what,</v>

4765
02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:22.970
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4766
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:26.030
<v Speaker 8>what happens is there's a window of time after you lift weights.</v>

4767
02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:26.161
<v Speaker 8>We,</v>

4768
02:13:26.161 --> 02:13:31.161
<v Speaker 8>you should just leave your body alone and not ice anything and that this is more</v>

4769
02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:37.371
<v Speaker 8>beneficial to gaining strength and explosiveness and mass and stuff like that.</v>

4770
02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:39.990
<v Speaker 8>But that after a window of time,</v>

4771
02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:45.020
<v Speaker 8>then it's beneficial to get into the fro the ice bath or to do cryo or something</v>

4772
02:13:46.231 --> 02:13:46.740
<v Speaker 8>like that.</v>

4773
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:48.990
<v Speaker 8>But you want to give yourself your body,</v>

4774
02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:49.400
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4775
02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:53.670
<v Speaker 8>a period of time to physiologically adjust to the work.</v>

4776
02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:56.160
<v Speaker 8>Like your body knows what's happened.</v>

4777
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:58.080
<v Speaker 8>Oh Greg did dead lifts today.</v>

4778
02:13:58.590 --> 02:13:59.190
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

4779
02:13:59.190 --> 02:13:59.611
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

4780
02:13:59.611 --> 02:13:59.911
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>

4781
02:13:59.911 --> 02:14:01.650
<v Speaker 8>We got all the way to get everything in place,</v>

4782
02:14:01.651 --> 02:14:01.900
<v Speaker 8>get it.</v>

4783
02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:03.540
<v Speaker 8>But if you freeze it right there,</v>

4784
02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:06.270
<v Speaker 8>then it has an effect on the overall,</v>

4785
02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:07.590
<v Speaker 8>and I might be butchering this,</v>

4786
02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:11.430
<v Speaker 8>but I think it has effect on the overall amount of gains that you can make.</v>

4787
02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:12.293
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4788
02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.800
<v Speaker 6>Cause your body's not sending the chemicals to the muscle.</v>

4789
02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:14.891
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4790
02:14:14.891 --> 02:14:16.790
<v Speaker 8>the way it would see if he could find out.</v>

4791
02:14:16.791 --> 02:14:17.540
<v Speaker 8>That's true.</v>

4792
02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.373
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4793
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:19.243
<v Speaker 8>that's uh,</v>

4794
02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:20.780
<v Speaker 8>figured out how to Google that one.</v>

4795
02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:22.040
<v Speaker 8>How do you agree with that one?</v>

4796
02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:23.270
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4797
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:24.180
<v Speaker 8>Post workout.</v>

4798
02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:24.970
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4799
02:14:24.970 --> 02:14:28.790
<v Speaker 8>cryo therapy and hypertrophy cause that's what they're,</v>

4800
02:14:29.570 --> 02:14:31.220
<v Speaker 8>that's what they're trying to uh,</v>

4801
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:31.870
<v Speaker 8>Dick,</v>

4802
02:14:31.870 --> 02:14:34.700
<v Speaker 8>they were trying to figure out whether or not it's beneficial or not in that</v>

4803
02:14:34.701 --> 02:14:35.534
<v Speaker 8>case.</v>

4804
02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.880
<v Speaker 8>So they think that it's really good for the mood and it's really good for people</v>

4805
02:14:40.881 --> 02:14:42.410
<v Speaker 8>with joint issues.</v>

4806
02:14:42.411 --> 02:14:44.330
<v Speaker 8>A lot of the folks that go there,</v>

4807
02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:49.540
<v Speaker 8>they have like a back surgery or back issues and it gives them a lot of relief.</v>

4808
02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:51.020
<v Speaker 8>And you can do it every day too,</v>

4809
02:14:51.021 --> 02:14:52.130
<v Speaker 8>cause it's only three minutes.</v>

4810
02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:54.560
<v Speaker 8>The thing about something like that as it's not,</v>

4811
02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:56.390
<v Speaker 8>it's not like any other kind of therapy.</v>

4812
02:14:56.391 --> 02:14:57.650
<v Speaker 8>Like you can't do it any longer.</v>

4813
02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:59.510
<v Speaker 8>It's not like you're being a pussy because you're only doing it for three</v>

4814
02:14:59.511 --> 02:15:00.320
<v Speaker 8>minutes.</v>

4815
02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:00.561
<v Speaker 8>Bitch,</v>

4816
02:15:00.561 --> 02:15:03.200
<v Speaker 8>you can't even do three minutes the first time you go in there at two minutes</v>

4817
02:15:03.201 --> 02:15:03.411
<v Speaker 8>you're like,</v>

4818
02:15:03.411 --> 02:15:04.244
<v Speaker 8>fuck this.</v>

4819
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.940
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4820
02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:06.230
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

4821
02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:06.531
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4822
02:15:06.531 --> 02:15:08.120
<v Speaker 8>At two minutes you're probably ready to bail.</v>

4823
02:15:08.150 --> 02:15:10.430
<v Speaker 8>But then your body will get used to it and then you can do three minutes.</v>

4824
02:15:10.431 --> 02:15:12.230
<v Speaker 8>But it's a,</v>

4825
02:15:12.231 --> 02:15:13.280
<v Speaker 8>it's very controversial,</v>

4826
02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.990
<v Speaker 8>but especially because a woman died,</v>

4827
02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:16.220
<v Speaker 8>there was war.</v>

4828
02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:16.701
<v Speaker 8>Vegas.</v>

4829
02:15:16.701 --> 02:15:17.031
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4830
02:15:17.031 --> 02:15:20.200
<v Speaker 8>A woman in Vegas was operating it herself and uh,</v>

4831
02:15:20.210 --> 02:15:25.210
<v Speaker 8>apparently she was not in the right height and the liquid nitrogen was getting</v>

4832
02:15:26.901 --> 02:15:27.440
<v Speaker 8>into her,</v>

4833
02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:28.011
<v Speaker 8>her lungs.</v>

4834
02:15:28.011 --> 02:15:31.280
<v Speaker 8>She was breathing it in and she passed out and she passed out and froze to</v>

4835
02:15:31.281 --> 02:15:32.060
<v Speaker 8>death.</v>

4836
02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:32.720
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

4837
02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:33.050
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4838
02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:33.883
<v Speaker 8>Terrifying.</v>

4839
02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:34.440
<v Speaker 8>They,</v>

4840
02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:35.360
<v Speaker 8>she had,</v>

4841
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:36.160
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4842
02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:36.500
<v Speaker 8>again,</v>

4843
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:40.240
<v Speaker 8>I think the story was that she had worked there and you know,</v>

4844
02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:45.250
<v Speaker 8>she was after hours just doing therapy on herself and she fucking fell asleep in</v>

4845
02:15:45.861 --> 02:15:46.694
<v Speaker 8>there.</v>

4846
02:15:47.210 --> 02:15:48.680
<v Speaker 8>He should never do that by herself.</v>

4847
02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:50.410
<v Speaker 8>If you do it at a reputable place,</v>

4848
02:15:50.411 --> 02:15:52.670
<v Speaker 8>will always be someone standing by watching while you're in.</v>

4849
02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:55.460
<v Speaker 8>They stand outside the door while you're inside of it.</v>

4850
02:15:56.730 --> 02:15:57.563
<v Speaker 8>Scary though,</v>

4851
02:15:57.920 --> 02:15:59.330
<v Speaker 8>because you realize when you're in there you're like,</v>

4852
02:15:59.331 --> 02:16:00.350
<v Speaker 8>this is a,</v>

4853
02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:03.920
<v Speaker 8>this is something you can't survive for that long.</v>

4854
02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:05.450
<v Speaker 8>You can survive it for a few minutes,</v>

4855
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.530
<v Speaker 8>but you,</v>

4856
02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:10.670
<v Speaker 8>you're literally exposing yourself to something that is 100% fatal if you stay</v>

4857
02:16:10.671 --> 02:16:11.030
<v Speaker 8>in it.</v>

4858
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.863
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4859
02:16:12.150 --> 02:16:12.241
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4860
02:16:12.241 --> 02:16:13.170
<v Speaker 6>it's like cold water.</v>

4861
02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:15.360
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to be in freezing cold water.</v>

4862
02:16:15.361 --> 02:16:20.361
<v Speaker 6>They say the amount of hours you can survive in water is like surprisingly warm.</v>

4863
02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:22.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4864
02:16:22.850 --> 02:16:25.290
<v Speaker 6>It fits like in the forties,</v>

4865
02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:27.810
<v Speaker 6>you can die after a couple hours.</v>

4866
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:28.170
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

4867
02:16:28.170 --> 02:16:29.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm throwing numbers out but</v>

4868
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:30.930
<v Speaker 3>no surprising.</v>

4869
02:16:30.970 --> 02:16:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4870
02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:35.180
<v Speaker 8>The getting wet is one of the most dangerous things that can ever happen to you</v>

4871

4894
02:17:20.601 --> 02:17:24.020
<v Speaker 8>they go all the way under and then they come out with their soap down and all</v>

4897
02:17:27.861 --> 02:17:28.221
<v Speaker 8>tent,</v>

4898
02:17:28.221 --> 02:17:28.680
<v Speaker 8>the climate,</v>

4899
02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:31.880
<v Speaker 8>their sleeping bags and they try to heat themselves up.</v>

4900
02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:32.953
<v Speaker 8>If you have,</v>

4901

4902
02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:35.510
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4903
02:17:35.510 --> 02:17:36.410
<v Speaker 8>a building,</v>

4904
02:17:36.411 --> 02:17:37.220
<v Speaker 8>a house,</v>

4905
02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:38.060
<v Speaker 8>no shower,</v>

4906
02:17:38.061 --> 02:17:38.151
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

4907
02:17:38.151 --> 02:17:38.360

<v Speaker 8>you're fucked.</v>

4909
02:17:39.051 --> 02:17:39.890
<v Speaker 8>You're out in the woods.</v>

4910
02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:42.890
<v Speaker 8>There's very specific things that you have to do in order to survive.</v>

4911
02:17:43.430 --> 02:17:46.130
<v Speaker 8>If you don't follow the right steps,</v>

4912
02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:47.990
<v Speaker 8>you absolutely will die.</v>

4913
02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:49.520
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4914
02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:54.020
<v Speaker 8>It's really common to kills more people than probably anything in the woods</v>

4915
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:55.650
<v Speaker 8>freezing it.</v>

4916
02:17:55.650 --> 02:17:55.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4917
02:17:55.861 --> 02:18:00.861
<v Speaker 3>That movie revenant freaked me out just going into the woods up north for three</v>

4918
02:18:01.831 --> 02:18:06.140
<v Speaker 3>months to collect pelts and you're walking through fucking streams and it's</v>

4919
02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:10.140
<v Speaker 3>pouring rain and he got no heat or no electricity.</v>

4920
02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:12.440
<v Speaker 8>Fuck that.</v>

4921
02:18:13.010 --> 02:18:13.251
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4922
02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:14.270
<v Speaker 8>That's how people died.</v>

4923
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:16.280
<v Speaker 8>A lot of people live that way too.</v>

4924
02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:17.990
<v Speaker 8>A lot of people live that way until they died.</v>

4925
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:20.960
<v Speaker 8>I mean that.</v>

4926
02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:25.010
<v Speaker 8>Do you think about those people that made it across this country and the people</v>

4927
02:18:25.011 --> 02:18:30.011
<v Speaker 8>like Lewis and Clark and all of these pioneers that just didn't even know what</v>

4928
02:18:30.321 --> 02:18:34.190
<v Speaker 8>the fuck was around the next corner and they just walked on through with what</v>

4929
02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:36.320
<v Speaker 8>they have like donkeys with shit on their back.</v>

4930
02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:37.370
<v Speaker 8>How much food do you have?</v>

4931
02:18:37.390 --> 02:18:38.060
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4932
02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:39.320
<v Speaker 8>Do you even know what the fuck you're going?</v>

4933
02:18:39.410 --> 02:18:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4934
02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:40.490
<v Speaker 3>he hit an impasse.</v>

4935
02:18:40.491 --> 02:18:40.661
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

4936
02:18:40.661 --> 02:18:44.690
<v Speaker 3>you hike for miles and then you come up to a mountain and you got to double back</v>

4937
02:18:44.691 --> 02:18:45.560
<v Speaker 3>and go around</v>

4938
02:18:45.690 --> 02:18:46.950
<v Speaker 8>Jesus Christ.</v>

4939
02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:48.300
<v Speaker 8>No Google Earth,</v>

4940
02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:50.153
<v Speaker 8>no nothing.</v>

4941
02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:55.380
<v Speaker 8>Shit maps dog shit maps written by people you hope knew what the fuck they were</v>

4942
02:18:55.381 --> 02:18:56.100
<v Speaker 8>talking about.</v>

4943
02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:56.933
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4944
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.820
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4945
02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:59.610
<v Speaker 8>he'd get maps from native Americans,</v>

4946
02:18:59.611 --> 02:19:00.990
<v Speaker 8>get maps from a sailor,</v>

4947
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:02.010
<v Speaker 8>try to figure it out,</v>

4948
02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:07.630
<v Speaker 3>and then you randomly go into the wrong territory and a Indians want to kill</v>

4949
02:19:07.631 --> 02:19:08.010
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

4950
02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:08.281
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4951
02:19:08.281 --> 02:19:09.210
<v Speaker 8>there's an interesting,</v>

4952
02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:11.430
<v Speaker 8>a film that's out on Netflix right now,</v>

4953
02:19:11.431 --> 02:19:12.930
<v Speaker 8>the ballot of Buster Scruggs,</v>

<v Speaker 8>and it's all about that.</v>

4956
02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:16.920
<v Speaker 8>It's all about the old west.</v>

4957
02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:18.420
<v Speaker 8>It's really weird,</v>

4958
02:19:18.421 --> 02:19:18.750
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

4959
02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:19.830
<v Speaker 8>It's so weird.</v>

4960
02:19:19.831 --> 02:19:21.300
<v Speaker 8>They're the weirdest guys of all time.</v>

4961
02:19:21.301 --> 02:19:21.820
<v Speaker 8>It turns blue.</v>

4962
02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.770
<v Speaker 8>The Kahn brothers big Lebowski.</v>

4963
02:19:23.771 --> 02:19:25.050
<v Speaker 8>You one of my all time favorites.</v>

<v Speaker 8>They've just made so many cool,</v>

4965
02:19:26.701 --> 02:19:27.534
<v Speaker 8>weird,</v>

4966
02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 8>but this one's</v>

4967
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:28.790
<v Speaker 2>really weird.</v>

4968
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:30.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like a bunch of non connected stories.</v>

4969
02:19:30.681 --> 02:19:31.580
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were connected,</v>

4970
02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:32.121
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>

4971
02:19:32.121 --> 02:19:35.330
<v Speaker 2>They just all taking place in the same time period and it's called the old west</v>

4972
02:19:35.430 --> 02:19:37.190
<v Speaker 7>and the end pretty similar late.</v>

4973
02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:39.960
<v Speaker 7>They're all fucking dark and you got to go.</v>

4974
02:19:39.961 --> 02:19:40.681
<v Speaker 7>Go into it.</v>

4975
02:19:40.681 --> 02:19:42.060
<v Speaker 7>I would highly recommend it,</v>

4976
02:19:42.061 --> 02:19:45.300
<v Speaker 7>but go into it knowing it's going to be fucking dark.</v>

4977
02:19:45.301 --> 02:19:46.200
<v Speaker 7>You've got to go there.</v>

4978
02:19:46.650 --> 02:19:47.483
<v Speaker 7>Just accept it.</v>

4979
02:19:47.610 --> 02:19:50.600
<v Speaker 7>But Tom waits his one is fucking amazing.</v>

4984
02:19:53.191 --> 02:19:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was Dick Nolton for a second.</v>

4985
02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>The singer guy who was really good.</v>

5002
02:20:09.431 --> 02:20:10.270
<v Speaker 7>But at the end of it I was like,</v>

5003

5009
02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:22.760
<v Speaker 2>the thing about deadwood is I watched it once and they were swearing so much</v>

5010
02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:24.740
<v Speaker 2>that my bullshit alarm went off.</v>

5011
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:25.970
<v Speaker 2>That's why I stopped watching.</v>

5014
02:20:26.901 --> 02:20:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people talk like that back then.</v>

5015
02:20:28.771 --> 02:20:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5016
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:32.840
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't talk like that in the 50s and the 60s see like the trend</v>

5017
02:20:32.841 --> 02:20:33.674
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make sense.</v>

5018
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:36.650
<v Speaker 2>If people talked like that in the wild west,</v>

5019
02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:38.300
<v Speaker 2>then what?</v>

5020
02:20:38.301 --> 02:20:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Where did that go?</v>

5021
02:20:39.470 --> 02:20:40.101
<v Speaker 2>Where'd that go?</v>

5022
02:20:40.101 --> 02:20:41.390
<v Speaker 2>That all went into the ether.</v>

5023
02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Like they had kids,</v>

5024
02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:43.640
<v Speaker 2>they raised their children,</v>

5025
02:20:43.641 --> 02:20:47.630
<v Speaker 2>the children around this kind of language and somehow or another it escaped and</v>

5026
02:20:47.631 --> 02:20:48.740
<v Speaker 2>it went away and it stopped.</v>

5027
02:20:48.741 --> 02:20:49.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not how the world works.</v>

5028
02:20:49.761 --> 02:20:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5029
02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:51.290
<v Speaker 2>The world doesn't work that way.</v>

5030
02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:52.760
<v Speaker 2>The world works and the way that,</v>

5031
02:20:52.761 --> 02:20:57.290
<v Speaker 2>like you slowly introduced fucked up words and then they become like the word</v>

5032
02:20:57.291 --> 02:20:57.920
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

5033
02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:02.920
<v Speaker 2>If you said the word fuck on television in the 1950s you would get arrested,</v>

5034
02:21:03.330 --> 02:21:03.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5035
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5036
02:21:04.510 --> 02:21:06.590
<v Speaker 2>How's that Pasta and on stage you get arrested,</v>

5037
02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Lenny Bruce,</v>

5038
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:08.323
<v Speaker 2>George Carlin.</v>

5039
02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:12.290
<v Speaker 2>How was it possible that that is a hundred years removed from people saying it</v>

5040
02:21:12.350 --> 02:21:14.390
<v Speaker 2>with abandoned constantly?</v>

5041
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it.</v>

5042
02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5043
02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:21.050
<v Speaker 2>like I think a better example of what it was probably like his,</v>

5044
02:21:21.051 --> 02:21:23.450
<v Speaker 2>like gangs of New York and then it's probably more accurate.</v>

5045
02:21:23.451 --> 02:21:24.284
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5046
02:21:24.310 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Like that was probably what people were like.</v>

5047
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Right then.</v>

5048
02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5049
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:28.340
<v Speaker 2>There were probably brutal as fuck,</v>

5050
02:21:28.490 --> 02:21:31.470
<v Speaker 2>but I bet they didn't swear as much as we like to think they did.</v>

5051
02:21:32.470 --> 02:21:35.150
<v Speaker 2>The dead wood thing was like they were using it as a,</v>

5052
02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I need to go back and watch it before I talk shit.</v>

5053
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:43.460
<v Speaker 2>But it felt like they were using it almost like to modernize it.</v>

5054
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5055
02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5056
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5057
02:21:45.381 --> 02:21:48.740
<v Speaker 2>they were having these people talk like scallywags would talk today.</v>

5058
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:49.743
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

5059
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:51.670
<v Speaker 7>They also say cursing is cultural.</v>

5060
02:21:51.671 --> 02:21:52.570
<v Speaker 7>Like if you,</v>

5061
02:21:52.571 --> 02:21:53.321
<v Speaker 7>if you're in a,</v>

5062
02:21:53.321 --> 02:21:54.154
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5063
02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:54.551
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5064
02:21:54.551 --> 02:21:59.551
<v Speaker 7>they talk about how black people curse versus how Protestants curse his coffee.</v>

5065
02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:01.051
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5066
02:22:01.051 --> 02:22:01.884
<v Speaker 7>I'll have some more of that.</v>

5067
02:22:02.290 --> 02:22:02.951
<v Speaker 7>Did you have any,</v>

5068
02:22:02.951 --> 02:22:04.150

5069
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:06.230

5070
02:22:06.310 --> 02:22:10.120
<v Speaker 7>they purposely changed the words because to make it more contemporary because</v>

5071
02:22:10.121 --> 02:22:13.510
<v Speaker 7>people wouldn't have been buying if they're saying tarnation and Gold Darren and</v>

5072
02:22:13.511 --> 02:22:14.170
<v Speaker 7>shit like that.</v>

02:22:39.061 --> 02:22:39.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

5094
02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:39.901
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so I'm not wrong.</v>

5096
02:22:41.810 --> 02:22:42.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5097
02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:42.853
<v Speaker 1>they did it on purpose.</v>

5098
02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:44.130
<v Speaker 6>I bet they're bringing it back.</v>

5099
02:22:44.131 --> 02:22:47.790
<v Speaker 6>They're making a movie or something or other.</v>

5100
02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:51.270
<v Speaker 6>I'd bring the series back cause it ended in the middle of season two when that</v>

5101
02:22:51.271 --> 02:22:52.090
<v Speaker 6>writer's strike happened.</v>

5102
02:22:52.090 --> 02:22:52.920
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5103
02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I heard there's a dope viking one that's on Netflix now.</v>

5104
02:22:56.310 --> 02:22:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a comedy,</v>

5105
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.870
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

5106
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5107
02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Eight Norse Norse gods or something like that.</v>

5108
02:23:02.130 --> 02:23:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

5109
02:23:02.281 --> 02:23:02.671
<v Speaker 1>That's not the,</v>

5110
02:23:02.671 --> 02:23:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the one somebody else told me about one.</v>

5111
02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll put it on my phone.</v>

5112
02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:08.850
<v Speaker 1>North Smith Norseman does that it,</v>

5113
02:23:08.851 --> 02:23:09.684
<v Speaker 1>that might be it.</v>

5114
02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

5115
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:11.070
<v Speaker 1>is that a comedy?</v>

5116
02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:12.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5117
02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:13.091
<v Speaker 6>it's weird.</v>

5118
02:23:13.091 --> 02:23:17.410
<v Speaker 6>My kids fucking curse and I never cursed around the house.</v>

5119
02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:18.760
<v Speaker 6>My wife crystal little,</v>

5127
02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's like a full on.</v>

5128
02:23:34.830 --> 02:23:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5131
02:23:43.430 --> 02:23:44.000
<v Speaker 1>just based off</v>

5132
02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:44.240
<v Speaker 6>for that.</v>

5133
02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:44.571
<v Speaker 6>I saw it.</v>

5134
02:23:44.571 --> 02:23:44.840
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

5135
02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:44.931
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

5136
02:23:44.931 --> 02:23:46.400

02:23:48.610 --> 02:23:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5138
02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:49.231

02:23:49.231 --> 02:23:50.064
<v Speaker 1>I heard it's good though,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I haven't,</v>

5141
02:23:50.761 --> 02:23:51.070
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

5142
02:23:51.070 --> 02:23:51.870
<v Speaker 1>this might be it.</v>

5143
02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:52.703
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5144
02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I was just too many new shells.</v>

5145
02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:55.081
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep it.</v>

5146
02:23:55.081 --> 02:23:55.914
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5147
02:23:55.930 --> 02:23:56.763
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep up.</v>

5148
02:23:57.220 --> 02:23:58.053
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

5149
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.501
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5150
02:24:00.501 --> 02:24:01.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5151
02:24:01.310 --> 02:24:02.030
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

5152
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.863
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

5153
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:05.720
<v Speaker 1>This such high quality and things are so good,</v>

5154
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:08.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's not great in that you can't keep up.</v>

5155
02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you started watching the marvelous Mrs Maizel?</v>

5156
02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:11.881
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5157
02:24:11.881 --> 02:24:15.960
<v Speaker 6>I saw the first season and then maybe one or two of the second season,</v>

5158
02:24:15.961 --> 02:24:16.794
<v Speaker 6>but it just,</v>

5159
02:24:17.130 --> 02:24:17.941
<v Speaker 6>I really liked it.</v>

5160
02:24:17.941 --> 02:24:19.260
<v Speaker 6>I think she's fucking great.</v>

5161
02:24:19.290 --> 02:24:24.290
<v Speaker 6>Obviously the cast Tony Shalhoub but it just got so Jewish.</v>

5162
02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Don't say anything because I'm just starting it.</v>

5163
02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:27.531
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5164
02:24:27.531 --> 02:24:28.240
<v Speaker 1>This is what I did.</v>

5165
02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:28.911
<v Speaker 1>I lucked up.</v>

5166
02:24:28.911 --> 02:24:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up and started with season two.</v>

5167
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:32.810
<v Speaker 1>How you did started with episode one.</v>

5168
02:24:32.811 --> 02:24:33.644
<v Speaker 1>Season two,</v>

5169
02:24:33.690 --> 02:24:34.640
<v Speaker 1>got to episode three.</v>

5170
02:24:34.641 --> 02:24:34.881
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5171
02:24:34.881 --> 02:24:35.714
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with those?</v>

5172
02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:37.910
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

5173
02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:38.091
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5174
02:24:38.091 --> 02:24:38.661
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know.</v>

5175
02:24:38.661 --> 02:24:39.494
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had to tell me.</v>

5176
02:24:39.850 --> 02:24:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had to tell me at the store,</v>

5177
02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:41.901
<v Speaker 1>I forget who told me.</v>

5178
02:24:41.901 --> 02:24:42.734
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

5179
02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I went back and watched the first episode of season one.</v>

5180
02:24:46.781 --> 02:24:47.031
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

5181
02:24:47.031 --> 02:24:47.451
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

5182
02:24:47.451 --> 02:24:48.284
<v Speaker 1>this is even better.</v>

5183
02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>But I thought it was good watching the first episode of season two,</v>

5184
02:24:51.651 --> 02:24:54.000
<v Speaker 1>not even knowing how she got there because I knew it was about standup.</v>

5185
02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I knew she was a comic,</v>

5186
02:24:55.310 --> 02:24:57.320
<v Speaker 1>but then going back and watching it from season one,</v>

5187
02:24:57.321 --> 02:24:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5188
02:24:57.680 --> 02:24:58.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5189
02:24:58.671 --> 02:24:59.110
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

5190
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.321
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5191
02:24:59.321 --> 02:25:00.160
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a lot,</v>

5192
02:25:00.190 --> 02:25:04.300
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of stuff about how they ha and writing on a show that's similar</v>

5193
02:25:04.301 --> 02:25:07.030
<v Speaker 6>and that it's about a comedian starting out on crashing.</v>

5194
02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:07.900
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

5195
02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:10.030
<v Speaker 6>I think they really capture,</v>

5196
02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:11.230
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5197
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:12.970
<v Speaker 6>the process of somebody brand new,</v>

5198
02:25:12.971 --> 02:25:14.680
<v Speaker 6>finding their voice on stage.</v>

5199
02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:15.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5200
02:25:15.250 --> 02:25:16.083
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5201
02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:17.380
<v Speaker 6>And the manager's great.</v>

5202
02:25:17.381 --> 02:25:18.790
<v Speaker 6>The woman that plays her manager,</v>

5203
02:25:18.970 --> 02:25:21.940
<v Speaker 6>there's always somebody like that that's in your corner that's helping you</v>

5204
02:25:21.941 --> 02:25:23.020
<v Speaker 6>develop yourself.</v>

5205
02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:24.633
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5206
02:25:24.850 --> 02:25:25.331
<v Speaker 1>and she's,</v>

5207
02:25:25.331 --> 02:25:26.770
<v Speaker 1>she's natural on stage.</v>

5208
02:25:26.771 --> 02:25:27.311
<v Speaker 1>I buy it.</v>

5209
02:25:27.311 --> 02:25:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I buy her as a standup on stage buyers being actually funny.</v>

5210
02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5211
02:25:31.470 --> 02:25:33.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting seeing Lenny Bruce,</v>

5212
02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:34.263
<v Speaker 1>the guy who plays [inaudible].</v>

5213
02:25:34.270 --> 02:25:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Bruce is very good.</v>

5214
02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5215
02:25:35.610 --> 02:25:36.443
<v Speaker 1>Who is that guy?</v>

5216
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Who's the,</v>

5217
02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:38.913
<v Speaker 1>who's her too?</v>

5218
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Her name and spoil or you get to see her breasts call's fantastic,</v>

5219
02:25:45.881 --> 02:25:46.540
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

5220
02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Lord.</v>

5221
02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

5222
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Jesus.</v>

5223
02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.373
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5224
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I had to do a search.</v>

5225
02:25:52.130 --> 02:25:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Not that I want to sound like,</v>

5226
02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:53.911
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

5227
02:25:53.911 --> 02:25:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I did a search on her news.</v>

5228
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:56.063
<v Speaker 1>Just let it go.</v>

5229
02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I did a thing on her nude and</v>

5230
02:25:59.360 --> 02:25:59.760
<v Speaker 1>proud,</v>

5231
02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.211
<v Speaker 1>put it up.</v>

5232
02:26:00.211 --> 02:26:02.010
<v Speaker 1>So she won the gold one.</v>

5233
02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:02.993
<v Speaker 1>Gold go for that.</v>

5234
02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5235
02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:04.313
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5236
02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:04.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5237
02:26:04.831 --> 02:26:09.831
<v Speaker 1>Rachel Brosnahan and I'm Michael's Egan and agile nasal.</v>

5238
02:26:10.261 --> 02:26:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

5239
02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:11.670
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5240
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:12.391
<v Speaker 1>who is,</v>

5241
02:26:12.391 --> 02:26:13.224
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5242
02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:15.300
<v Speaker 1>who's playing Lenny Bruce?</v>

5243
02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:17.421
<v Speaker 1>Is that the guy?</v>

5244
02:26:17.421 --> 02:26:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Luke Kirby.</v>

5245
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.771
<v Speaker 1>Luke Kirby.</v>

5246
02:26:18.771 --> 02:26:19.604
<v Speaker 1>Luke Kirby.</v>

5247
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:21.043
<v Speaker 1>Outstanding.</v>

5248
02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:21.951
<v Speaker 1>He did a great job.</v>

5249
02:26:21.951 --> 02:26:22.061
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

5250
02:26:22.061 --> 02:26:23.480
<v Speaker 1>he sounded like him.</v>

5251
02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:23.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5252
02:26:23.810 --> 02:26:24.440
<v Speaker 1>he sounds,</v>

5253
02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:26.870
<v Speaker 1>without doing an obvious impression,</v>

5254
02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:29.870
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like it's got the tone right.</v>

5255
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.160
<v Speaker 1>He's got the inflection,</v>

5256
02:26:31.161 --> 02:26:31.850
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5257
02:26:31.850 --> 02:26:33.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not overly stylized.</v>

5258
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5259
02:26:33.921 --> 02:26:34.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5260
02:26:34.191 --> 02:26:34.401
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5261
02:26:34.401 --> 02:26:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It's saying that you believe it.</v>

5262
02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:36.830
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

5263
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:37.190
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

5264
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:41.120
<v Speaker 1>he did a great job of like seeming like a guy doing standup in front of a room.</v>

5265
02:26:41.121 --> 02:26:43.790
<v Speaker 1>People not like an actor playing a stand up.</v>

5266
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5267
02:26:44.331 --> 02:26:46.070
<v Speaker 1>the woman that created the show,</v>

5268
02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:49.490
<v Speaker 1>apparently her dad was a standup and he knew Lenny Bruce,</v>

5269
02:26:49.491 --> 02:26:53.480
<v Speaker 1>which is why she put them in the series because he's the only historical figure</v>

5270
02:26:53.481 --> 02:26:54.150
<v Speaker 1>and the shell.</v>

5271
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

5272
02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:55.460
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5273
02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:55.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5274
02:26:55.581 --> 02:26:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also the show.</v>

5275
02:26:57.050 --> 02:26:58.580
<v Speaker 1>They take some liberties with a history.</v>

5276
02:26:58.760 --> 02:26:59.511
<v Speaker 1>Like there was,</v>

5277
02:26:59.511 --> 02:27:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there was a comedy club back then.</v>

5278
02:27:02.210 --> 02:27:03.440
<v Speaker 1>You know this gas light,</v>

5279
02:27:03.441 --> 02:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>they called it.</v>

5280
02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:04.620
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

5281
02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that was real.</v>

5282
02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there really was a comedy club back then.</v>

5283
02:27:07.971 --> 02:27:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I think back then people were just doing poetry nights and there were doing,</v>

5284
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5285
02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.470
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like a musician than a comedian.</v>

5286
02:27:15.471 --> 02:27:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Comedians would host things.</v>

5287
02:27:16.671 --> 02:27:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5288
02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there was necessarily a comedy club.</v>

5289
02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5290
02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that came later.</v>

5291
02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:22.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5292
02:27:22.611 --> 02:27:26.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like catch a rising star came out of being a cabaret and you know,</v>

5293
02:27:26.091 --> 02:27:29.690
<v Speaker 1>people would sing there and then suddenly people started doing stand up there</v>

5294
02:27:29.691 --> 02:27:33.530
<v Speaker 1>and the two existed together for years before it became a comedy.</v>

5295
02:27:33.531 --> 02:27:33.861
<v Speaker 1>Can we,</v>

5296
02:27:33.861 --> 02:27:36.200
<v Speaker 1>should we should actually know this?</v>

5297
02:27:36.201 --> 02:27:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Why do we not know?</v>

5298
02:27:37.041 --> 02:27:38.750
<v Speaker 1>What was the very first comedy club?</v>

5299
02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:40.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5300
02:27:40.071 --> 02:27:40.904
<v Speaker 1>it was a catch.</v>

5301
02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:43.520
<v Speaker 1>There was the hungry eye in San Francisco.</v>

5302
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Was that the first might,</v>

5303
02:27:44.841 --> 02:27:46.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is the 60s though.</v>

5304
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Is that when it's done?</v>

5305
02:27:46.770 --> 02:27:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5306
02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:49.580
<v Speaker 1>that was the 60s because the ice house,</v>

5307
02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:50.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5308
02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:54.560
<v Speaker 1>is the oldest running comedy club in the world.</v>

5309
02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:55.760
<v Speaker 1>The Ice House was the oldest.</v>

5310
02:27:55.761 --> 02:27:58.160
<v Speaker 1>All the other old ones are gone except the ice house.</v>

5311
02:27:59.150 --> 02:28:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And the comedy and Magic Club was right on its heels.</v>

5312
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5313
02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:02.480
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

5314
02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:03.440
<v Speaker 1>that's probably second.</v>

5315
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:05.630
<v Speaker 1>But what was the,</v>

5316
02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:10.150
<v Speaker 1>well that place is called The gas light and I think there was a gas light back</v>

5317
02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:10.341
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

5318
02:28:10.341 --> 02:28:11.660
<v Speaker 1>It was a comedy club though.</v>

5319
02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they,</v>

5320
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:13.760
<v Speaker 1>the way they did it,</v>

5321
02:28:13.761 --> 02:28:14.780
<v Speaker 1>which was great,</v>

5322
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:15.441
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

5323
02:28:15.441 --> 02:28:16.274
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give,</v>

5324
02:28:16.370 --> 02:28:17.260
<v Speaker 1>give too much of it away,</v>

5325
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but the way they did it where like people were getting bumped,</v>

5326
02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:21.020
<v Speaker 1>like she got bumped.</v>

5327
02:28:21.410 --> 02:28:21.621
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5328
02:28:21.621 --> 02:28:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that was what guys did where they ran around doing 15 minutes</v>

5329
02:28:26.601 --> 02:28:29.150
<v Speaker 1>and go from one club to another the way in New York comics do it now.</v>

5330
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:29.511
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5331
02:28:29.511 --> 02:28:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's real.</v>

5332
02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:31.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5333
02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:33.320
<v Speaker 1>but that's a nit picky thing.</v>

5334
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:34.450
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

5335
02:28:34.450 --> 02:28:35.283
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>

5336
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:36.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5337
02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:39.530
<v Speaker 1>it's more indicative I think of how people do it today.</v>

5338
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You'd like,</v>

5339
02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:41.960
<v Speaker 1>do you think they were,</v>

5340
02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:42.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5341
02:28:42.231 --> 02:28:43.064
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows?</v>

5342
02:28:43.090 --> 02:28:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they had a drop in back then and maybe they did have nights,</v>

5343
02:28:46.310 --> 02:28:48.410
<v Speaker 1>like several nights where they had just comedy.</v>

5344
02:28:48.470 --> 02:28:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5345
02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:52.910
<v Speaker 1>This is booked by a cliff or off about the history of comedy.</v>

5346
02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:53.570
<v Speaker 1>You ever read that?</v>

5347
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:54.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5348
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:55.080
<v Speaker 1>he just called me,</v>

5349
02:28:56.460 --> 02:28:57.031
<v Speaker 12>I don't know,</v>

5350
02:28:57.031 --> 02:28:58.500
<v Speaker 12>but it's cliff a.</v>

5351
02:28:58.501 --> 02:29:00.450
<v Speaker 12>N.</v>

5352
02:29:00.450 --> 02:29:00.450
<v Speaker 12>E.</v>

5353
02:29:00.450 --> 02:29:00.450
<v Speaker 12>S.</v>

5354
02:29:00.450 --> 02:29:00.450
<v Speaker 12>T.</v>

5355
02:29:00.450 --> 02:29:00.450
<v Speaker 12>E.</v>

5356
02:29:00.450 --> 02:29:00.450
<v Speaker 12>R.</v>

5357
02:29:00.450 --> 02:29:00.450
<v Speaker 12>O.</v>

5358
02:29:00.450 --> 02:29:00.900
<v Speaker 12>V.</v>

5359
02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:01.321
<v Speaker 12>And A.</v>

5360
02:29:01.321 --> 02:29:02.940
<v Speaker 12>I had him on my podcast a couple of times.</v>

5361
02:29:02.941 --> 02:29:03.451
<v Speaker 12>He's great.</v>

5362
02:29:03.451 --> 02:29:07.350
<v Speaker 12>But the real first comedy shows in New York were um,</v>

5363
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:08.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5364
02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:09.610
<v Speaker 1>the Comedians,</v>

5365
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:10.451
<v Speaker 1>drunks,</v>

5366
02:29:10.451 --> 02:29:10.781
<v Speaker 1>thieves,</v>

5367
02:29:10.781 --> 02:29:12.850
<v Speaker 1>scoundrels in the history of American comedy.</v>

5368
02:29:13.210 --> 02:29:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5369
02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:16.900
<v Speaker 1>did you find anything about the oldest or the first standup comedy club?</v>

5370
02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:19.511
<v Speaker 12>Arguably,</v>

5371
02:29:19.511 --> 02:29:22.320
<v Speaker 12>it was in the United Kingdom in 1979 it was the comedy store.</v>

5372
02:29:22.321 --> 02:29:26.250
<v Speaker 12>And before that they were just performing English motherfucker got ahold of</v>

5373
02:29:26.251 --> 02:29:27.084
<v Speaker 12>Wikipedia.</v>

5374
02:29:28.170 --> 02:29:30.570
<v Speaker 12>That's just started in United Kingdom and the United States history,</v>

5375
02:29:30.571 --> 02:29:32.970
<v Speaker 12>it goes back into the 19th century and Vaudeville places.</v>

5376
02:29:32.971 --> 02:29:36.300
<v Speaker 12>And so it just depends on when somebody first turned their venue.</v>

5377
02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:38.770
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is who called,</v>

5378
02:29:38.771 --> 02:29:39.760
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

5379
02:29:39.790 --> 02:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>who had the very serious comedy club.</v>

5380
02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:42.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5381
02:29:42.251 --> 02:29:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5382
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:44.500
<v Speaker 1>the hungry I San Francisco.</v>

5383
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5384
02:29:45.070 --> 02:29:45.671
<v Speaker 1>So the hungry,</v>

5385
02:29:45.671 --> 02:29:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I was a 100% comedy club.</v>

5386
02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5387
02:29:48.250 --> 02:29:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And then the bitter end,</v>

5388
02:29:49.241 --> 02:29:50.950
<v Speaker 1>which was music and comedy.</v>

5389
02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

5390
02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

5391
02:29:52.390 --> 02:29:53.260
<v Speaker 1>In New York.</v>

5392
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:55.430
<v Speaker 1>So those are the ones and what years that,</v>

5393
02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:58.450
<v Speaker 1>let's just says in the 50s into the 60s.</v>

5394
02:29:58.451 --> 02:29:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have this particular year.</v>

5395
02:29:59.741 --> 02:30:00.574
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5396
02:30:00.970 --> 02:30:02.110

02:30:03.340 --> 02:30:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I think Mort Saul still around Google that I think he is.</v>

5398
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still doing stand up.</v>

5399
02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I think Dick Dick,</v>

5400
02:30:09.730 --> 02:30:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Dick Gregory's around.</v>

5401
02:30:10.970 --> 02:30:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I think Dick Gregory died.</v>

5402
02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:12.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh he did?</v>

5403
02:30:12.851 --> 02:30:13.684
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

5404
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Find out that first cause I'm a dick.</v>

5405
02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:17.870
<v Speaker 1>I say died.</v>

5406
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:18.280
<v Speaker 1>He didn't.</v>

5407
02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:19.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5408
02:30:19.570 --> 02:30:20.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5409
02:30:20.650 --> 02:30:20.861
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5410
02:30:20.861 --> 02:30:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Dick Gregory.</v>

5411
02:30:21.610 --> 02:30:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5412
02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:23.113
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

02:30:25.150 --> 02:30:25.690
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>

5415
02:30:25.690 --> 02:30:28.270
<v Speaker 1>But I think Lenny Bruce might've started at the hungry eye as well.</v>

5416
02:30:28.271 --> 02:30:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I think he started in San Francisco.</v>

5417
02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:30.753
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

5432
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5433
02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:50.350
<v Speaker 1>without them.</v>

5434
02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:51.041
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

5435
02:30:51.041 --> 02:30:54.190
<v Speaker 1>this is the original roots of the tree of standup comedy.</v>

5436
02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:55.870
<v Speaker 1>100% right?</v>

02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:56.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We do know James,</v>

5439
02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:01.213
<v Speaker 1>Google and shit.</v>

5440
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I just go back and look,</v>

5441
02:31:05.050 --> 02:31:07.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy history.</v>

5442
02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:08.171
<v Speaker 1>You really stop.</v>

5443
02:31:08.171 --> 02:31:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And think about the,</v>

5444
02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:14.500
<v Speaker 1>the year it starts in the 60s and that before that it didn't exist like that.</v>

5445
02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Like it was kind of a thing that people did.</v>

5504
02:32:54.241 --> 02:32:57.540
<v Speaker 7>You don't want to launch anybody to the parking lot and if you do,</v>

5505
02:32:57.541 --> 02:32:59.380
<v Speaker 7>you just pack up and move to the next town.</v>

<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

5512
02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:10.950
<v Speaker 7>it was very Jewish because Jews were having a hard time getting hired.</v>

5513
02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:13.080
<v Speaker 7>And so that was one of the few places they could work.</v>

5514
02:33:13.081 --> 02:33:16.620
<v Speaker 7>And that's why they say comedy was a very Jewish thing.</v>

02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:17.551
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>o'clock in one room and giant fireplaces.</v>

5591
02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:12.270
<v Speaker 6>And they've set dinners with fucking servants.</v>

5592
02:35:12.271 --> 02:35:14.400
<v Speaker 6>And if you've got an invite to that,</v>

5593
02:35:14.430 --> 02:35:17.070
<v Speaker 6>he went for you go for like three weeks.</v>

5594
02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:17.660
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

5595
02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:18.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5596
02:35:18.291 --> 02:35:20.210
<v Speaker 1>You can look at that dining hall.</v>

5597
02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:21.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what that looks like?</v>

5598
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:24.740
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the haunted dining hall in the Disney Rod.</v>

5599
02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:25.790
<v Speaker 1>The haunted mansion.</v>

5600
02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:26.711
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5601
02:35:26.711 --> 02:35:27.200

<v Speaker 1>you ever seen that?</v>

5603
02:35:28.810 --> 02:35:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

5604
02:35:29.691 --> 02:35:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Got Inspired from something,</v>

5605
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee that's what they got inspired by.</v>

5606
02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:34.400
<v Speaker 1>It looks so much like that.</v>

5607
02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:38.330
<v Speaker 1>So look at that image right now and now Google the,</v>

5608
02:35:38.331 --> 02:35:38.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5609
02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:40.980
<v Speaker 1>dining room at the haunted mansion,</v>

5610
02:35:41.010 --> 02:35:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland and all seen when you fly by and you're,</v>

5611
02:35:44.121 --> 02:35:46.910
<v Speaker 1>you're on the little train and you pass by and all the ghosts are dancing</v>

5612
02:35:46.911 --> 02:35:47.150
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:47.401
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

5614
02:35:47.401 --> 02:35:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

5615
02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:48.853
<v Speaker 1>It looks just like that.</v>

5616
02:35:49.330 --> 02:35:49.870
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5617
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:50.770
<v Speaker 6>and then it was a zoo.</v>

5618
02:35:50.771 --> 02:35:52.750
<v Speaker 6>All the grounds were a zoo at Hearst castle.</v>

5619
02:35:52.751 --> 02:35:55.420
<v Speaker 6>There was fucking giraffes running around zebras.</v>

5620
02:35:55.810 --> 02:35:57.010
<v Speaker 6>He's like El Chapo.</v>

5621
02:35:57.370 --> 02:35:59.290
<v Speaker 6>He couldn't get rid of his money.</v>

5622
02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:01.000
<v Speaker 6>He had so much fucking money.</v>

5623
02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:02.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a shit image of it.</v>

5624
02:36:02.930 --> 02:36:03.890
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a good image of it.</v>

5625
02:36:04.580 --> 02:36:05.413
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

5626
02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:06.273
<v Speaker 10>all right.</v>

5627
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:08.343
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

5628
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.940
<v Speaker 10>how is that possible?</v>

5629
02:36:11.550 --> 02:36:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Not really supposed to take pictures in there.</v>

5630
02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5631
02:36:13.490 --> 02:36:14.430
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

5632
02:36:15.690 --> 02:36:16.051
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5633
02:36:16.051 --> 02:36:16.471
<v Speaker 1>So everybody,</v>

5634
02:36:16.471 --> 02:36:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but everybody does.</v>

5635
02:36:18.330 --> 02:36:19.890
<v Speaker 1>People are always taking pictures of shit.</v>

5636
02:36:20.490 --> 02:36:22.030
<v Speaker 1>You take pictures of your kids in there.</v>

5637
02:36:23.490 --> 02:36:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

5638
02:36:24.030 --> 02:36:25.080
<v Speaker 1>it looks real similar to that.</v>

5639
02:36:25.290 --> 02:36:25.891
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

5640
02:36:25.891 --> 02:36:28.020
<v Speaker 1>that guy had way too much money.</v>

5641
02:36:28.140 --> 02:36:29.700
<v Speaker 1>He brought over wild boars.</v>

5642
02:36:29.701 --> 02:36:32.310
<v Speaker 1>He's the reason why California has a wild pig problem.</v>

5643
02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

5644
02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5645
02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5646
02:36:34.650 --> 02:36:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Him that Fuck God damn.</v>

5647
02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:37.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5648
02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Wild Boars.</v>

5649
02:36:38.761 --> 02:36:39.170
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't,</v>

5650
02:36:39.170 --> 02:36:39.900
<v Speaker 1>they'd go hunt them.</v>

5651
02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:40.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5652
02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:41.933
<v Speaker 1>he brought them here.</v>

5653
02:36:42.090 --> 02:36:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5654
02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:43.500
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's a whole,</v>

5655
02:36:43.501 --> 02:36:43.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

5656
02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:45.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not down here.</v>

5657
02:36:45.390 --> 02:36:46.890
<v Speaker 1>So he's not in southern California.</v>

5658
02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:47.933
<v Speaker 1>They're all up there.</v>

5659
02:36:48.010 --> 02:36:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5660
02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.661
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

5661
02:36:48.661 --> 02:36:50.310
<v Speaker 1>they're slowly making their way down here.</v>

5662
02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:52.350
<v Speaker 1>But the ones that are down here,</v>

5663
02:36:52.351 --> 02:36:56.070
<v Speaker 1>the closest they are is to hone ranch to hone ranches,</v>

5664
02:36:56.071 --> 02:36:56.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5665
02:36:56.251 --> 02:36:57.600
<v Speaker 1>about an hour and a half from here.</v>

5666
02:36:57.930 --> 02:36:59.190
<v Speaker 1>And they have wild pig.</v>

5667
02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:02.930
<v Speaker 6>Is it that hard to just get a bunch of guys with AK 47 [inaudible] and hunt him</v>

5668
02:37:02.931 --> 02:37:03.764
<v Speaker 6>down?</v>

5669
02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Stop that hard.</v>

5670
02:37:04.781 --> 02:37:06.220
<v Speaker 1>But you can't do that in California,</v>

5671
02:37:06.670 --> 02:37:07.241
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

5672
02:37:07.241 --> 02:37:11.080
<v Speaker 1>You can get depredation permits and they have gotten depredation permits and</v>

5673
02:37:11.081 --> 02:37:14.530
<v Speaker 1>they hunt them at night with night vision because sometimes the pigs will start</v>

5674
02:37:14.531 --> 02:37:15.950
<v Speaker 1>making their way into agriculture</v>

5675
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:18.170
<v Speaker 8>or they start making their way into the,</v>

5676
02:37:18.171 --> 02:37:22.190
<v Speaker 8>like they'll lay down some fresh sod and put some grass down and these pigs will</v>

5677
02:37:22.191 --> 02:37:25.580
<v Speaker 8>destroy thousands of dollars in landscaping damage.</v>

5678
02:37:25.581 --> 02:37:26.240
<v Speaker 8>So yeah,</v>

5679
02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:28.040
<v Speaker 8>when they prove that that's happening,</v>

5680
02:37:28.041 --> 02:37:31.730
<v Speaker 8>then they get a special permit and then they could just start whacking.</v>

5681
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:32.330
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5682
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:35.600
<v Speaker 8>And then they just take out like everything at night and they do it with,</v>

5683
02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:36.530
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5684
02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:37.760
<v Speaker 8>sniper rifles and shit.</v>

5685
02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:43.060
<v Speaker 8>But then when I'm a normal person wants to like say if you wanted to kill a wild</v>

5686
02:37:43.461 --> 02:37:44.294
<v Speaker 8>pig,</v>

5687
02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:46.730
<v Speaker 8>you can get as many licenses as you like.</v>

5688
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.410
<v Speaker 8>You can get five licenses,</v>

5689
02:37:48.411 --> 02:37:51.410
<v Speaker 8>you can get six so you can go out and shoot six pigs in a day.</v>

5690
02:37:51.411 --> 02:37:52.640
<v Speaker 8>It's totally legal,</v>

5691
02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:55.850
<v Speaker 8>so long as you pay for each individual tag because the,</v>

5692
02:37:56.130 --> 02:37:57.530
<v Speaker 8>the understanding is that it,</v>

5693
02:37:57.531 --> 02:37:58.910
<v Speaker 8>at least in most places,</v>

5694
02:37:58.911 --> 02:38:00.650
<v Speaker 8>California is the only place that treats it like game.</v>

5695
02:38:00.890 --> 02:38:04.020
<v Speaker 8>And most places you don't even have to have tags for them most place.</v>

5696
02:38:04.021 --> 02:38:05.570
<v Speaker 8>They're encouraging you to shoot him.</v>

5697
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:08.360
<v Speaker 8>And that'll probably be the case in California eventually.</v>

5698
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:09.980
<v Speaker 8>Like it isn't like Texas,</v>

5699
02:38:09.981 --> 02:38:10.940
<v Speaker 8>France for instance.</v>

5700
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.300
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

5701
02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:13.250
<v Speaker 8>Texas has a real pig problem.</v>

5702
02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:14.520
<v Speaker 8>They have a giant problem.</v>

5703
02:38:14.530 --> 02:38:15.380
<v Speaker 8>Oh Shit,</v>

5704
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:17.430
<v Speaker 8>there's millions and millions and millions of pigs.</v>

5705
02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:17.841
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5706
02:38:17.841 --> 02:38:20.670
<v Speaker 3>I remember that from the Friday night late show at the Improv and Houston</v>

5707
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:23.130
<v Speaker 8>that while I'm asking about,</v>

5708
02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:26.070
<v Speaker 8>you said that with,</v>

5709
02:38:26.130 --> 02:38:28.560
<v Speaker 8>you really had me believing that you didn't believe it.</v>

5710
02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:30.810
<v Speaker 8>And you're setting up the joke the whole time.</v>

5711
02:38:31.050 --> 02:38:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

5712
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:33.340
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like that with alligators in Florida.</v>

5713
02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:34.310
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5714
02:38:34.310 --> 02:38:34.941
<v Speaker 8>When I was a kid,</v>

5715
02:38:34.941 --> 02:38:35.400
<v Speaker 8>they were,</v>

5716
02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:35.750
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5717
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:36.860
<v Speaker 8>an endangered species.</v>

5718
02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:40.160
<v Speaker 8>They would ask us to please not feed them marshmallows cause I lived in</v>

5719
02:38:40.161 --> 02:38:41.390
<v Speaker 8>Gainesville all right.</v>

5720
02:38:41.391 --> 02:38:42.710
<v Speaker 8>By this place called Lake Alice.</v>

5721
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:43.100
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5722
02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:46.520
<v Speaker 8>Lake at alligators fucking 11 years old.</v>

5723
02:38:46.521 --> 02:38:46.631
<v Speaker 8>I was,</v>

5724
02:38:46.631 --> 02:38:48.290
<v Speaker 8>I was in an alligator's was crazy.</v>

5725
02:38:48.291 --> 02:38:48.730
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5726
02:38:48.730 --> 02:38:49.970
<v Speaker 8>it was a goddamn dinosaur.</v>

5727
02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:53.720
<v Speaker 8>But there was a small population of them cause they had been whacked into</v>

5728
02:38:53.721 --> 02:38:56.030
<v Speaker 8>oblivion before and people are making suitcases out of them.</v>

5729
02:38:56.330 --> 02:38:59.810
<v Speaker 8>And then they made it illegal to hunt them and they made him a protected</v>

5730
02:38:59.811 --> 02:39:00.231
<v Speaker 8>species,</v>

5731
02:39:00.231 --> 02:39:01.610
<v Speaker 8>but then they fucked up.</v>

5732
02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:05.240
<v Speaker 8>They overprotected and those God damn super lizards are everywhere.</v>

5733
02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Fucking everywhere.</v>

5734
02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:12.300
<v Speaker 3>My mom belongs to a golf course down in Florida where she lives and there's this</v>

5735
02:39:12.301 --> 02:39:15.840
<v Speaker 3>alligator's apparently like this fucking 14 foot alligator.</v>

5736
02:39:15.930 --> 02:39:16.763
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

5737
02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:19.920
<v Speaker 3>the people were playing golf and there was a deer and everybody's on the,</v>

5738
02:39:19.930 --> 02:39:21.180
<v Speaker 3>everybody's standing there going like,</v>

5739
02:39:21.330 --> 02:39:22.060
<v Speaker 3>it's a deer.</v>

5740
02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:22.893
<v Speaker 3>It's a deer.</v>

5741
02:39:23.010 --> 02:39:23.401
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

5742
02:39:23.401 --> 02:39:23.761
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

5743
02:39:23.761 --> 02:39:25.290
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking alligator,</v>

5744
02:39:25.291 --> 02:39:25.801
<v Speaker 3>comes out,</v>

5745
02:39:25.801 --> 02:39:26.640
<v Speaker 3>grabs it,</v>

5746
02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:28.230
<v Speaker 3>pulls it into the water,</v>

5747
02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:29.760
<v Speaker 3>does that spin move,</v>

5748
02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:31.590
<v Speaker 3>takes it to the bottom.</v>

5749
02:39:31.591 --> 02:39:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Fucking done.</v>

5750
02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:35.220
<v Speaker 3>So everyone's talking about it.</v>

5751
02:39:35.221 --> 02:39:36.180
<v Speaker 3>What do we do about it?</v>

5752
02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:39.120
<v Speaker 3>So about three weeks later,</v>

5753
02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:43.530
<v Speaker 3>my mom is out on the course and her ball is right next to the lake where the</v>

5754
02:39:43.531 --> 02:39:48.531
<v Speaker 3>alligator is and she forgets and she goes over and her ball is right on the edge</v>

5755
02:39:49.081 --> 02:39:53.250
<v Speaker 3>and she's standing there and she was standing on some fucking like dead,</v>

5756
02:39:53.550 --> 02:39:58.550
<v Speaker 3>some dead grass and it gave out and she fell in the fucking lake up to her neck.</v>

5757
02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:06.080
<v Speaker 3>And then she remembered and she fucking started scrambling up the mud and</v>

5758
02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:09.090
<v Speaker 3>grabbing if the reeds to get out of there.</v>

5759
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:11.850
<v Speaker 3>And her and the people that who she was with had left,</v>

5760
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 3>she was by herself for</v>

5761
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:18.060
<v Speaker 7>some reason and she fucking got out of there and got in the cart and,</v>

5762
02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:19.500
<v Speaker 7>and then she just started laughing.</v>

5763
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:20.663
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

5764
02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:23.310
<v Speaker 7>You believe that shit.</v>

5765
02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:24.390
<v Speaker 7>My little mother,</v>

5766
02:40:24.391 --> 02:40:26.130
<v Speaker 7>my little five foot two mother,</v>

5767
02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:31.160
<v Speaker 7>oh my God would have been a tasty meal happen so quick.</v>

5768
02:40:33.210 --> 02:40:35.070
<v Speaker 7>Better than a dear old lady.</v>

5769
02:40:35.071 --> 02:40:35.311

5773
02:40:37.890 --> 02:40:38.723
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5774
02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:39.990
<v Speaker 7>Corn Fed.</v>

5775
02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:42.391
<v Speaker 7>My mom's corn fed.</v>

5776
02:40:42.391 --> 02:40:43.224
<v Speaker 7>I never told you that.</v>

5777
02:40:43.410 --> 02:40:43.670
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5778
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:44.190
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5779
02:40:44.190 --> 02:40:45.840
<v Speaker 7>I thought she was organic now.</v>

5780
02:40:45.841 --> 02:40:47.970
<v Speaker 7>Now we let her free range sometimes.</v>

5781
02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:51.630
<v Speaker 8>Great story about a car chase.</v>

5782
02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:56.790
<v Speaker 8>The cops are chasing this too with Solon car and the guy jumps off a bridge into</v>

5783
02:40:56.791 --> 02:40:59.220
<v Speaker 8>the water and immediately gets eaten by alligators.</v>

5784
02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:00.630
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

5785
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:03.000
<v Speaker 8>He's like a little overpass over river,</v>

5786
02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:05.310
<v Speaker 8>which is hops out of the fucking car.</v>

5787
02:41:05.340 --> 02:41:07.710
<v Speaker 8>Jumps into the river and smash.</v>

5788
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:10.290
<v Speaker 8>He lands right in front of an alligator.</v>

5789
02:41:10.470 --> 02:41:10.921
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5790
02:41:10.921 --> 02:41:13.230
<v Speaker 8>she'll get Jackson in front of the cops.</v>

5791
02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:14.930
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

5792
02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:16.993
<v Speaker 7>What do you do</v>

5793
02:41:17.060 --> 02:41:17.691
<v Speaker 8>of your cop?</v>

5794
02:41:17.691 --> 02:41:18.291
<v Speaker 8>Do you shoot it?</v>

5795
02:41:18.291 --> 02:41:18.980
<v Speaker 8>The alligator?</v>

5796
02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:20.900
<v Speaker 8>Do you try to kill the alligator was calling the guy.</v>

5797
02:41:20.930 --> 02:41:21.620
<v Speaker 8>Good point.</v>

5798
02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:21.861
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

5799
02:41:21.861 --> 02:41:24.950
<v Speaker 8>that's a reckless thing to be doing when there's a lot of thrashing around.</v>

5800
02:41:24.951 --> 02:41:26.630
<v Speaker 8>You just let it get to empty your clip.</v>

5801
02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:27.560
<v Speaker 8>Pap Pap pap,</v>

5802
02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:28.410
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5803
02:41:28.410 --> 02:41:28.611
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

5804
02:41:28.611 --> 02:41:31.490
<v Speaker 8>how much distance is there between the bridge and the water would,</v>

5805
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:32.623
<v Speaker 8>what can the cop did it?</v>

5806
02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:32.951
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

5807
02:41:32.951 --> 02:41:34.180
<v Speaker 7>you know the guy's going to die.</v>

5808
02:41:34.181 --> 02:41:35.014
<v Speaker 7>So I think it's a,</v>

5809
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:37.690
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a safe bet to take some shots anyway.</v>

5810
02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:41.000
<v Speaker 8>I think it's a not safe bet to take some shots because if you're a cop,</v>

5811
02:41:41.001 --> 02:41:42.530
<v Speaker 8>what have you hit the guy and they said,</v>

5812
02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:42.711
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

5813
02:41:42.711 --> 02:41:46.370
<v Speaker 8>you shot and trying to cover up by fucking alligators.</v>

5814
02:41:46.371 --> 02:41:47.204
<v Speaker 8>Eat them.</v>

5815
02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:48.053
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>

5816
02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:49.290
<v Speaker 7>You got to let the alligator eat them.</v>

5817
02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:53.640
<v Speaker 7>Now you got to save your job here about the guy who was the guy flying a plane</v>

5818
02:41:53.641 --> 02:41:56.420
<v Speaker 7>from a Florida to Cuba or,</v>

5819
02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:57.600
<v Speaker 7>or Cuba to Florida,</v>

5820
02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:02.720
<v Speaker 7>and the plain fucking went down and he survived the crash and then got eaten by</v>

5821
02:42:04.801 --> 02:42:05.634
<v Speaker 7>sharks.</v>

5822
02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:15.750
<v Speaker 7>That's so fucked up and said that 20 minute period where you're floating in the</v>

5823
02:42:15.751 --> 02:42:16.111
<v Speaker 7>water,</v>

5824
02:42:16.111 --> 02:42:18.240
<v Speaker 7>but you're thankful and you're almost giddy.</v>

5825
02:42:18.450 --> 02:42:19.260
<v Speaker 7>I did it.</v>

5826
02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:20.550
<v Speaker 7>I fucking survived.</v>

5827
02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:21.413
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

5828
02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:22.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5829
02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:23.393
<v Speaker 7>Bad Day.</v>

5830
02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:23.661
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5831
02:42:23.661 --> 02:42:26.600
<v Speaker 8>you know that story about the World War II boat that sank and the guys were</v>

5832
02:42:26.601 --> 02:42:29.720
<v Speaker 8>floating around at sea for several days and most of them got eaten by sharks.</v>

5833
02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:30.350
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

5834
02:42:30.350 --> 02:42:33.080
<v Speaker 8>that's the story that they talk about in the beginning of jaws.</v>

5835
02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:34.393
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5836
02:42:34.830 --> 02:42:36.240
<v Speaker 8>Remember where the captain,</v>

5837
02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:40.320
<v Speaker 8>the captains at the fucking scars and he starts talking about his,</v>

5838
02:42:40.321 --> 02:42:40.531
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5839
02:42:40.531 --> 02:42:41.490
<v Speaker 8>his time on the boat.</v>

02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:42.770
<v Speaker 8>Do you remember that scenery?</v>

<v Speaker 8>not Roy Scheider.</v>

5843
02:42:44.251 --> 02:42:45.480
<v Speaker 8>The guy was talking to Roy Scheider.</v>

5844
02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:46.373
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

5845
02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:47.370

<v Speaker 8>Spool up jaws.</v>

5850
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.990

<v Speaker 3>so what was the opening scene?</v>

5876
02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Not the opening scene,</v>

5877
02:43:21.070 --> 02:43:23.380
<v Speaker 2>but he describes what it was like.</v>

5878
02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:23.771
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5879
02:43:23.771 --> 02:43:25.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a different shark attack.</v>

5880
02:43:25.690 --> 02:43:26.680
<v Speaker 2>So typed in World War II.</v>

5881
02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:27.551
<v Speaker 2>Show the naval ship.</v>

5882
02:43:27.551 --> 02:43:27.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5883
02:43:27.701 --> 02:43:28.061
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

5884
02:43:28.061 --> 02:43:28.421
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

5885
02:43:28.421 --> 02:43:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

5886
02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking when I said the worst shark attack in history,</v>

5887
02:43:31.331 --> 02:43:34.750
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking it was that story about New Jersey with a bull sharks killed</v>

5888
02:43:34.751 --> 02:43:35.584
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

5889
02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Scroll back up so I can see what it says here.</v>

5890
02:43:39.490 --> 02:43:42.850
<v Speaker 2>1945 US naval ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine.</v>

5891
02:43:42.851 --> 02:43:45.460
<v Speaker 2>The ship's sinking was just the beginning of the sailors nightmare.</v>

5892
02:43:45.461 --> 02:43:45.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5893
02:43:45.611 --> 02:43:46.420
<v Speaker 2>that's the boat.</v>

5894
02:43:46.420 --> 02:43:47.253
<v Speaker 2>That's the story.</v>

5895
02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:48.250
<v Speaker 3>How many people died?</v>

5896
02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:48.581
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

5897
02:43:48.581 --> 02:43:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Shit load.</v>

5898
02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:50.913
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

5899
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

5900
02:43:52.890 --> 02:43:53.140
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

5901
02:43:53.140 --> 02:43:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Most 300 people died of the 1,196 men aboard 900 made it into the water alive.</v>

5902
02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:02.133
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5903
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:03.220
<v Speaker 2>there are a deal.</v>

5904
02:44:03.650 --> 02:44:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5905
02:44:03.970 --> 02:44:04.601
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

5906
02:44:04.601 --> 02:44:07.180
<v Speaker 2>that's how many survived the crash.</v>

5907
02:44:07.210 --> 02:44:10.270
<v Speaker 2>So there's 900 of them that are alive now.</v>

5908
02:44:10.271 --> 02:44:11.860
<v Speaker 2>How many of them make it to the end</v>

5909
02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:17.000
<v Speaker 2>out of 900 scroll and Scroll and Scroll and Scroll it.</v>

5910
02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Days Pass.</v>

5911
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5912
02:44:18.891 --> 02:44:19.310
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

5913
02:44:19.310 --> 02:44:21.340
<v Speaker 2>they're just giving you the full line of the story than I giving you.</v>

5914
02:44:21.350 --> 02:44:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Just the actual facts.</v>

5915
02:44:23.350 --> 02:44:26.360
<v Speaker 2>317 317 remained.</v>

5916
02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:27.313
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5917
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.570
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

5918
02:44:28.570 --> 02:44:30.850
<v Speaker 2>so almost 600 people got to eat</v>

5919
02:44:31.250 --> 02:44:34.880
<v Speaker 3>estimates of the number who die from shark attacks range from a few dozen to</v>

5920
02:44:34.881 --> 02:44:36.440
<v Speaker 3>almost 150</v>

5921
02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:39.240
<v Speaker 2>so the other people die from other things probably.</v>

5922
02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5923
02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:41.760
<v Speaker 2>heat stroke being in the water.</v>

5924
02:44:42.030 --> 02:44:42.863
<v Speaker 2>It could be a lot.</v>

5925
02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:44.850
<v Speaker 2>And so I bet when those guys died,</v>

5926
02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:46.800
<v Speaker 2>then the sharks ate them and it got even worse.</v>

5927
02:44:46.890 --> 02:44:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

5928
02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:48.893
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

5929
02:44:49.050 --> 02:44:50.160
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking crazy.</v>

5930
02:44:50.161 --> 02:44:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Just imagine 150 people eaten by sharks,</v>

5931
02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:55.440
<v Speaker 2>the amount of blood in the water,</v>

5932
02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:57.060
<v Speaker 2>fucking Christ,</v>

5933
02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:00.673
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5934
02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:05.610
<v Speaker 2>But when you're around any kind of thing that can eat you and kill you,</v>

5935
02:45:05.730 --> 02:45:07.830
<v Speaker 2>it puts it all into perspective that you're not,</v>

5936
02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:09.270
<v Speaker 2>you're not around that enough.</v>

5937
02:45:09.790 --> 02:45:10.623
<v Speaker 2>And it's not,</v>

5938
02:45:10.650 --> 02:45:12.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you should be around it all the time,</v>

5939
02:45:12.421 --> 02:45:13.830
<v Speaker 2>but you should know it's a real thing.</v>

5940
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And when you're around it,</v>

5941
02:45:15.001 --> 02:45:15.480
<v Speaker 2>you go like,</v>

5942
02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:16.313
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5943
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:17.640
<v Speaker 2>oh sharks just,</v>

5944
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:18.421
<v Speaker 2>we'll just eat.</v>

5945
02:45:18.421 --> 02:45:20.670
<v Speaker 2>You owe a bear will just eat you.</v>

5946
02:45:20.970 --> 02:45:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5947
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:22.920
<v Speaker 2>a mountain lion will just eat you.</v>

5948
02:45:23.310 --> 02:45:24.143
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

5949
02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Like these people that got killed this year was a,</v>

5950
02:45:26.701 --> 02:45:27.840
<v Speaker 2>or 2018 at least,</v>

5951
02:45:27.841 --> 02:45:28.674
<v Speaker 2>was very rare.</v>

5952
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:30.420
<v Speaker 2>And that two people were documented,</v>

5953
02:45:30.421 --> 02:45:32.490
<v Speaker 2>killed by mountain lions and the Pacific northwest.</v>

5954
02:45:32.700 --> 02:45:34.590
<v Speaker 2>One guy in Portland outside of Portland,</v>

5955
02:45:34.591 --> 02:45:35.790
<v Speaker 2>and one guy outside of Seattle.</v>

5956
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:38.010
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rare that mountain lions do that.</v>

5957
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:39.840
<v Speaker 2>But Oh,</v>

5958
02:45:40.170 --> 02:45:41.430
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions would just eat you.</v>

5959
02:45:41.910 --> 02:45:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5960
02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:43.321
<v Speaker 2>that can happen too.</v>

5961
02:45:43.321 --> 02:45:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Like we think we're so safe</v>

5962
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:46.690
<v Speaker 3>and I think it,</v>

5963
02:45:46.690 --> 02:45:47.161
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

5964
02:45:47.161 --> 02:45:48.220
<v Speaker 3>It will keep you in the moment.</v>

5965
02:45:48.221 --> 02:45:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I think we should release like grizzly.</v>

5966
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5967
02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.410
<v Speaker 3>In cities just because like you might be worried about,</v>

5968
02:45:54.430 --> 02:45:54.541
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5969
02:45:54.541 --> 02:45:54.761
<v Speaker 3>am my,</v>

5970
02:45:54.761 --> 02:45:56.590
<v Speaker 3>the fucking stock market's down,</v>

5971
02:45:56.591 --> 02:45:58.000
<v Speaker 3>or I think my wife's cheating.</v>

5972
02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:00.710
<v Speaker 3>And you're right back in the,</v>

5973
02:46:00.990 --> 02:46:01.231
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5974
02:46:01.231 --> 02:46:02.064
<v Speaker 2>you're in the moment.</v>

5975
02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:04.500
<v Speaker 2>But then you're going to have to allow people to be armed to protect themselves.</v>

5976
02:46:04.501 --> 02:46:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Guys going to have open carry,</v>

5977
02:46:06.300 --> 02:46:09.250
<v Speaker 2>fucking ar slung around their shoulders looking out for bears everywhere.</v>

5978
02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:10.341
<v Speaker 2>Taking your kid to school,</v>

5979
02:46:10.341 --> 02:46:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you better bring the rifle.</v>

5980
02:46:12.890 --> 02:46:14.300
<v Speaker 2>She's only two blocks away.</v>

5981
02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5982
02:46:14.750 --> 02:46:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

5983
02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Bringing the rifle.</v>

5984
02:46:15.850 --> 02:46:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I saw bear here a couple of days ago,</v>

5985
02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:17.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5986
02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you walk outside your house and you hear a branch snap and you turn and</v>

5987
02:46:21.411 --> 02:46:25.370
<v Speaker 2>you see a 900 pound wild dog like thing.</v>

5988
02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:26.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's not,</v>

5989
02:46:26.730 --> 02:46:27.580
<v Speaker 2>that's not one shot.</v>

5990
02:46:27.581 --> 02:46:29.690
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be a pretty good gun to take that thing down.</v>

5991
02:46:30.030 --> 02:46:32.150
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to take it out with like a nine millimeter.</v>

5992
02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5993
02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:34.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to eat your bullets.</v>

5994
02:46:34.041 --> 02:46:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5995
02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:35.810
<v Speaker 2>It's going to kill you anyway.</v>

5996
02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

5997
02:46:37.860 --> 02:46:38.340
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5998
02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:39.173
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to,</v>

5999
02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to have a perfect shot right in the perfect part of its brain to shut</v>

6000
02:46:42.961 --> 02:46:45.600
<v Speaker 2>it off quick to prevent you from getting mauled.</v>

6001
02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:47.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6002
02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:48.390
<v Speaker 2>The amount of strength that they have to,</v>

6003
02:46:48.391 --> 02:46:52.200
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like a water balloon if you like tearing open a bag,</v>

6004
02:46:52.260 --> 02:46:54.390
<v Speaker 2>like a Ziploc bag full of Jello.</v>

6005
02:46:54.450 --> 02:46:55.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6006
02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:56.550
<v Speaker 2>They just rip you apart.</v>

6007
02:46:56.800 --> 02:46:58.620
<v Speaker 2>He had gone back to that movie revenant.</v>

6008
02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:01.710
<v Speaker 2>That fucking bear attack was insane.</v>

6009
02:47:01.810 --> 02:47:04.200
<v Speaker 2>The bear attacks nothing compared to what really happens.</v>

6010
02:47:04.630 --> 02:47:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Like if he really got bit by a bear,</v>

6011
02:47:06.691 --> 02:47:07.231
<v Speaker 2>but like that,</v>

6012
02:47:07.231 --> 02:47:09.510
<v Speaker 2>like he probably would be destroyed.</v>

6013
02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I think the guy that was the,</v>

6014
02:47:12.180 --> 02:47:14.310
<v Speaker 2>that we're really happened to them in real life.</v>

6015
02:47:14.311 --> 02:47:16.710
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of base really loosely on a story.</v>

6016
02:47:17.010 --> 02:47:20.040
<v Speaker 2>I think he got kind of like a little malt and that was enough.</v>

6017
02:47:20.130 --> 02:47:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6018
02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:22.740
<v Speaker 2>A little malt leave you like that would,</v>

6019
02:47:22.741 --> 02:47:24.270
<v Speaker 2>that bear was throwing him around for like,</v>

6020
02:47:24.390 --> 02:47:25.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6021
02:47:25.140 --> 02:47:26.070
<v Speaker 2>that bear would have killed you.</v>

6022
02:47:26.100 --> 02:47:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6023
02:47:26.670 --> 02:47:28.140
<v Speaker 2>You'd have no bones left.</v>

6024
02:47:28.310 --> 02:47:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6025
02:47:28.570 --> 02:47:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Snapped everything into a fine powder.</v>

6026
02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Just crush you and then eat you.</v>

6027
02:47:33.421 --> 02:47:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6028
02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:34.381
<v Speaker 2>I'm fuck yeah,</v>

6029
02:47:34.381 --> 02:47:35.160
<v Speaker 2>why not eat you?</v>

6030
02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Especially when she starts stinking.</v>

6031
02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:37.830
<v Speaker 2>They like to burry things.</v>

6032
02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Let them rot for a while.</v>

6033
02:47:40.590 --> 02:47:41.423
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

6034
02:47:41.430 --> 02:47:46.430
<v Speaker 2>My friend Adam and he shot a moose in Canada and a bear's claimed it and he went</v>

6035
02:47:46.981 --> 02:47:48.030
<v Speaker 2>back and there's a video of it.</v>

6036
02:47:48.031 --> 02:47:49.530
<v Speaker 2>It's so spooky.</v>

6037
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

6038
02:47:50.490 --> 02:47:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Says buried.</v>

6039
02:47:52.050 --> 02:47:53.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant big ass moose.</v>

6040
02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:54.841
<v Speaker 2>By the time they got,</v>

6041
02:47:54.841 --> 02:47:55.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6042
02:47:55.021 --> 02:47:56.520
<v Speaker 2>they shoot it and then it goes,</v>

6043
02:47:56.580 --> 02:47:58.350
<v Speaker 2>it runs away and then you have to track it.</v>

6044
02:47:58.351 --> 02:47:59.940
<v Speaker 2>You have to let it let it die.</v>

6045
02:48:00.030 --> 02:48:00.811
<v Speaker 2>It takes a little while.</v>

6046
02:48:00.811 --> 02:48:03.990
<v Speaker 2>So the smart thing to do is to sit out for a couple hours.</v>

6047
02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:05.640
<v Speaker 2>It'll be dead for sure.</v>

6048
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:10.140
<v Speaker 2>But what you don't want to do is spook it while it's injured.</v>

6049
02:48:10.170 --> 02:48:10.391
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

6050
02:48:10.391 --> 02:48:11.640
<v Speaker 2>if it's not a perfect hit,</v>

6051
02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:14.490
<v Speaker 2>if it runs away because then it's going to just keep running.</v>

6052
02:48:14.491 --> 02:48:16.110
<v Speaker 2>You can run for a long time on adrenaline.</v>

6053
02:48:16.410 --> 02:48:16.911
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

6054
02:48:16.911 --> 02:48:17.141
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6055
02:48:17.141 --> 02:48:19.800
<v Speaker 2>the correct move is if you don't see an animal die,</v>

6056
02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you don't see,</v>

6057
02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:21.540
<v Speaker 2>you see it run into the woods.</v>

6058
02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:25.200
<v Speaker 2>You wait and you wait just as a precautionary measure.</v>

6059
02:48:25.350 --> 02:48:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6060
02:48:25.650 --> 02:48:25.841
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6061
02:48:25.841 --> 02:48:29.040
<v Speaker 2>the animal died in seconds and a bear claim did immediately.</v>

6062
02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:31.140
<v Speaker 2>It died probably right in front of them.</v>

6063
02:48:31.170 --> 02:48:32.160
<v Speaker 2>What state was this?</v>

6064
02:48:32.220 --> 02:48:33.270
<v Speaker 2>This was in Alaska.</v>

6065
02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:36.030
<v Speaker 2>So the bear is just there.</v>

6066
02:48:36.060 --> 02:48:37.500
<v Speaker 2>The Moose dies right in front of him.</v>

6067
02:48:37.501 --> 02:48:37.770
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

6068
02:48:37.770 --> 02:48:38.603
<v Speaker 2>oh look at that.</v>

6069
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:39.623
<v Speaker 2>That's mine.</v>

6070
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6071
02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:43.020
<v Speaker 2>It starts eating it and he starts covering it up.</v>

6072
02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:44.880
<v Speaker 2>So eat some of it covers it up.</v>

6073
02:48:44.881 --> 02:48:47.640
<v Speaker 2>They come tracking in a hour later or so.</v>

6074
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:49.140
<v Speaker 2>It's already covered in dark.</v>

6075
02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6076
02:48:50.310 --> 02:48:50.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6077
02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:51.750
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

6078
02:48:51.780 --> 02:48:53.610
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

6079
02:48:53.670 --> 02:48:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

6080
02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

6081
02:48:56.700 --> 02:48:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6082
02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Fuck No.</v>

6083
02:48:58.351 --> 02:48:59.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6084
02:48:59.130 --> 02:49:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Think about what would it take to take fucking frozen ground myself.</v>

6085
02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:06.780
<v Speaker 2>They might've shot it and taken some of the meat and we're going back to pack</v>

6086
02:49:06.781 --> 02:49:07.470
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

6087
02:49:07.470 --> 02:49:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Cause sometimes when you hunt you'll hunt with one person,</v>

6088
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:10.381
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>

6089
02:49:10.381 --> 02:49:12.210
<v Speaker 2>then you go back to pack out a big animal,</v>

6090
02:49:12.211 --> 02:49:14.040
<v Speaker 2>you bring like five or six guys to help you.</v>

6091
02:49:14.430 --> 02:49:15.600
<v Speaker 2>But this is the video of it.</v>

6092
02:49:15.860 --> 02:49:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Look at this to give me some volume.</v>

6093
02:49:18.970 --> 02:49:20.140
<v Speaker 13>Oh Moose is very</v>

6094
02:49:22.290 --> 02:49:23.123
<v Speaker 13>under the area.</v>

6095
02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:27.140
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

6096
02:49:27.750 --> 02:49:28.583
<v Speaker 13>Okay.</v>

6097
02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:30.210
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

6098
02:49:30.210 --> 02:49:31.043
<v Speaker 13>I don't like this.</v>

6099
02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:38.060
<v Speaker 2>So everything is like,</v>

6100
02:49:38.090 --> 02:49:38.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6101
02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:41.390
<v Speaker 2>five and a half feet high grass or you know,</v>

6102
02:49:41.391 --> 02:49:41.651
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

6103
02:49:41.651 --> 02:49:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean how tall is that grass for four and a half feet at least.</v>

6104
02:49:44.670 --> 02:49:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6105
02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:46.580
<v Speaker 2>So bears could be in that shit.</v>

6106
02:49:47.250 --> 02:49:48.590
<v Speaker 2>They could be hunkered down in that shit.</v>

6107
02:49:48.770 --> 02:49:52.500
<v Speaker 2>So I'm seeing the skull on the ground and the skull skinned out.</v>

6108
02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:55.580
<v Speaker 2>So what that means to me is that he had already started butchering the,</v>

6109
02:49:55.581 --> 02:49:57.680
<v Speaker 2>the Moose and probably went back to it.</v>

6110
02:49:58.970 --> 02:50:02.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of correct that whether it was right about that or not,</v>

6111
02:50:02.930 --> 02:50:04.070
<v Speaker 2>but so this is what happened.</v>

6112
02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6113
02:50:04.850 --> 02:50:07.540
<v Speaker 2>they can only take some of the meat because they were terrified the bear is</v>

6114
02:50:07.550 --> 02:50:08.061
<v Speaker 2>going to come back.</v>

6115
02:50:08.061 --> 02:50:10.930
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even think they had a gun on them and you know,</v>

6116
02:50:10.940 --> 02:50:12.080
<v Speaker 2>they're just scan in the area,</v>

6117
02:50:13.130 --> 02:50:13.731
<v Speaker 2>see how the,</v>

6118
02:50:13.731 --> 02:50:13.971
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6119
02:50:13.971 --> 02:50:17.240
<v Speaker 2>the moots the head is already off of the antlers,</v>

6120
02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:18.680
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

6121
02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:20.090
<v Speaker 2>And so this is the next video.</v>

6122
02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:23.440
<v Speaker 7>That's scary shit man.</v>

6123
02:50:23.570 --> 02:50:24.820
<v Speaker 7>So they didn't even see the bear.</v>

6124
02:50:24.830 --> 02:50:25.840
<v Speaker 7>They just know it was a bear.</v>

6125
02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:26.650
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

6126
02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:27.483
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6127
02:50:28.450 --> 02:50:33.040
<v Speaker 7>Think about the strength to take frozen earth like that and dig it out.</v>

6128
02:50:33.260 --> 02:50:34.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6129
02:50:34.730 --> 02:50:35.810
<v Speaker 2>What's the type of bear?</v>

6130
02:50:36.170 --> 02:50:36.411
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6131
02:50:36.411 --> 02:50:37.790
<v Speaker 2>if you run into a black bear,</v>

6132
02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.010
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to be thought of as food.</v>

6133
02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:40.933
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of interesting.</v>

6134
02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:42.121
<v Speaker 2>Like you're more like,</v>

6135
02:50:42.121 --> 02:50:46.190
<v Speaker 2>like predation on humans is more common with black bears.</v>

6136
02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:47.810
<v Speaker 2>They just decided to try to eat you.</v>

6137
02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:49.250
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

6138
02:50:49.310 --> 02:50:50.390
<v Speaker 2>with grizzlies,</v>

6139
02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:52.400
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies are rare.</v>

6140
02:50:52.430 --> 02:50:54.500
<v Speaker 2>It's rare that a grizzly decides to eat.</v>

6141
02:50:54.501 --> 02:50:56.570
<v Speaker 2>You decides to chase you down and eat you.</v>

6142
02:50:56.571 --> 02:51:01.571
<v Speaker 2>It's more common that you fuck up and run into a female or you tried to steal</v>

6143
02:51:01.731 --> 02:51:02.720
<v Speaker 2>his food like that.</v>

6144
02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Like they had to get the fuck out of there because if he just decided to run at</v>

6145
02:51:05.331 --> 02:51:05.630
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

6146
02:51:05.630 --> 02:51:07.250
<v Speaker 2>they got a real giant problem.</v>

6147
02:51:07.251 --> 02:51:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time of bear won't though.</v>

6148
02:51:08.571 --> 02:51:09.231
<v Speaker 2>They're cautious.</v>

6149
02:51:09.231 --> 02:51:09.621
<v Speaker 2>They'll stay,</v>

6150
02:51:09.621 --> 02:51:11.180
<v Speaker 2>they'll hang back because they figured,</v>

6151
02:51:11.181 --> 02:51:11.601
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

6152
02:51:11.601 --> 02:51:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Are you gonna eat that whole Moose?</v>

6153
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:13.731
<v Speaker 2>You're going to leave me some.</v>

6154
02:51:13.731 --> 02:51:14.564
<v Speaker 2>I ate a bunch.</v>

6155
02:51:14.690 --> 02:51:15.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to wait a little while,</v>

6156
02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:16.401
<v Speaker 2>see what the fuck you're doing.</v>

6157
02:51:16.401 --> 02:51:17.450
<v Speaker 2>He's probably full anyway,</v>

6158
02:51:17.890 --> 02:51:18.980
<v Speaker 2>but they had to get out of there.</v>

6159
02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:21.560
<v Speaker 2>They only took her a little bit of the meat and they took off like this is too</v>

6160
02:51:21.561 --> 02:51:22.230
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

6161
02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:23.063
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6162
02:51:25.370 --> 02:51:26.360
<v Speaker 7>They used to be everywhere,</v>

6163
02:51:26.580 --> 02:51:27.750
<v Speaker 2>used to be everywhere in California.</v>

6164
02:51:27.751 --> 02:51:28.920
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's on our flag.</v>

6165
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:30.630
<v Speaker 2>We killed them all.</v>

6166
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Not We.</v>

6167
02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:32.610
<v Speaker 2>You and I were in Boston.</v>

6168
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:32.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6169
02:51:32.881 --> 02:51:34.260
<v Speaker 2>We didn't kill anybody to kill anybody,</v>

6170
02:51:34.290 --> 02:51:36.840
<v Speaker 2>but they killed all the grizzly bears in California,</v>

6171
02:51:37.410 --> 02:51:38.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's still an under state flag.</v>

6172
02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:40.770
<v Speaker 2>The state flag has a fucking grizzly bear,</v>

6173
02:51:40.771 --> 02:51:42.300
<v Speaker 2>but in California it doesn't have any grizzlies.</v>

6174
02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:43.120
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

6175
02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:43.750
<v Speaker 7>It's weird.</v>

6176
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.951
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6177
02:51:43.951 --> 02:51:45.700
<v Speaker 7>I was in Alaska once and they were,</v>

6178
02:51:45.730 --> 02:51:47.350
<v Speaker 7>they were like raccoons.</v>

6179
02:51:47.380 --> 02:51:50.110
<v Speaker 7>They were behind restaurants going through dumpsters,</v>

6180
02:51:50.540 --> 02:51:53.200
<v Speaker 7>grizzly bears or brown bears or black parents.</v>

6181
02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:54.340
<v Speaker 7>I think they were,</v>

6182
02:51:54.341 --> 02:51:56.140
<v Speaker 7>I don't want both the bolt up.</v>

6183
02:51:56.141 --> 02:51:57.610
<v Speaker 7>Their blackberries become more,</v>

6184
02:51:57.670 --> 02:51:58.400
<v Speaker 7>will they all be calling become a</v>

6185
02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:01.550
<v Speaker 2>problem if they start getting around garbage cause then they're smart.</v>

6186
02:52:01.580 --> 02:52:02.540
<v Speaker 2>They know where the garbage is.</v>

6187
02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6188
02:52:02.770 --> 02:52:03.603
<v Speaker 2>Just keep returning.</v>

6189
02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6190
02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:06.300
<v Speaker 2>There's a place called Lovech,</v>

6191
02:52:06.350 --> 02:52:06.761
<v Speaker 1>the vet,</v>

6192
02:52:06.761 --> 02:52:07.520
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

6193
02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:11.140
<v Speaker 1>It's off the five and it's named that way for the last guy to die in a bear</v>

6194
02:52:11.141 --> 02:52:12.160
<v Speaker 1>attack in California.</v>

6195
02:52:12.250 --> 02:52:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

6196
02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:13.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6197
02:52:13.810 --> 02:52:16.780
<v Speaker 1>They'll like enough he fuck enough.</v>

6198
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they wound up digging this guy up afterwards to find out the story is</v>

6199
02:52:20.141 --> 02:52:21.520
<v Speaker 1>true and he was just in pieces.</v>

6200
02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:24.193
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

6201
02:52:24.760 --> 02:52:25.600
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

6202
02:52:25.601 --> 02:52:30.601
<v Speaker 1>so coastal bear to bear attack shark attack or dying in a cryogenics tank dying,</v>

6203
02:52:34.031 --> 02:52:35.980
<v Speaker 1>the crowd would be way less painful.</v>

6204
02:52:36.100 --> 02:52:36.970
<v Speaker 1>You would just freeze.</v>

6205
02:52:37.060 --> 02:52:37.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to go.</v>

6206
02:52:38.050 --> 02:52:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the way to go though,</v>

6207
02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:41.140
<v Speaker 1>because then you're not going to get eaten.</v>

6208
02:52:41.750 --> 02:52:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Like shouldn't you return to nature?</v>

6209
02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:44.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6210
02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean you really should be eating and I'd rather be eaten by one of my con,</v>

6211
02:52:48.341 --> 02:52:49.480
<v Speaker 1>which is a ground animal.</v>

6212
02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking cons in the water.</v>

6213
02:52:51.250 --> 02:52:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I can eat and buy those heartless assholes and don't even take care of their</v>

6214
02:52:53.951 --> 02:52:54.430
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>

6215
02:52:54.430 --> 02:52:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6216
02:52:55.090 --> 02:52:55.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6217
02:52:55.391 --> 02:52:56.980
<v Speaker 1>a bear at least takes care of their young,</v>

6218
02:52:57.170 --> 02:52:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

6219
02:52:57.930 --> 02:52:58.360
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

6220
02:52:58.360 --> 02:52:59.140
<v Speaker 1>they're shit eds.</v>

6221
02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:00.310
<v Speaker 1>They eat their babies too.</v>

6222
02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And especially males.</v>

6223
02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Males kill babies left and right.</v>

6224
02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:05.620
<v Speaker 1>They actually actively go after them and kill them.</v>

6225
02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:06.640
<v Speaker 1>But sort of sharks,</v>

6226
02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:07.300
<v Speaker 1>sharks,</v>

6227
02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:09.460
<v Speaker 1>sharks have inter wound competition.</v>

6228
02:53:09.770 --> 02:53:10.071
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

6229
02:53:10.071 --> 02:53:11.950
<v Speaker 1>they eat each other inside the womb.</v>

6230
02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh no shit.</v>

6231
02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6232
02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:15.880
<v Speaker 1>You ever see like a,</v>

6233
02:53:15.940 --> 02:53:17.890
<v Speaker 1>an Mri of sharks in the womb?</v>

6234
02:53:17.950 --> 02:53:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a monster movie.</v>

6235
02:53:20.830 --> 02:53:21.940
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

6236
02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:22.833
<v Speaker 1>Is that Real,</v>

6237
02:53:24.130 --> 02:53:24.761
<v Speaker 1>those images?</v>

6238
02:53:24.761 --> 02:53:25.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

6239
02:53:25.630 --> 02:53:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those elements that I feel like it might've been from a movie,</v>

6240
02:53:28.271 --> 02:53:29.170
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking at now.</v>

6241
02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:30.153
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

6242
02:53:30.250 --> 02:53:31.083
<v Speaker 1>I think it's real.</v>

6243
02:53:31.090 --> 02:53:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason why I thought it was fake and then I found out it was real.</v>

6244
02:53:34.031 --> 02:53:36.850
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those either I thought it was real and I found out it was fake or I</v>

6245
02:53:36.851 --> 02:53:38.230
<v Speaker 1>thought it was fake and I found out it's real.</v>

6246
02:53:38.530 --> 02:53:39.363
<v Speaker 1>But the image is,</v>

6247
02:53:39.370 --> 02:53:40.091
<v Speaker 1>if it's real,</v>

6248
02:53:40.091 --> 02:53:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking amazing.</v>

6249
02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:42.880
<v Speaker 1>It's these little monsters inside,</v>

6250
02:53:42.881 --> 02:53:43.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6251
02:53:43.570 --> 02:53:44.980
<v Speaker 1>inside a womb and then you've got to think,</v>

6252
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6253
02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess no one had it.</v>

6254
02:53:47.141 --> 02:53:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

6255
02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Cause they just lay the eggs out in the men.</v>

02:53:52.270 --> 02:53:54.370
<v Speaker 1>They don't fuck have a terrible life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not a good or bad thing.</v>

6378
02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:50.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like something's going to get eaten.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you're out there and you're the slow thing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is not a,</v>

6387
02:57:01.940 --> 02:57:06.940
<v Speaker 2>this is not a discerning organism that's got moral value that it places on,</v>

6397
02:57:17.350 --> 02:57:17.740
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

6398
02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:22.740
<v Speaker 2>they're just an organism looking to survive complex set of reinforcements and</v>

6399
02:57:23.321 --> 02:57:28.180
<v Speaker 2>reward systems that are set up for it to be an incredibly efficient predator.</v>

6400
02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Fuck male lines the size of that fucking hall dude.</v>

<v Speaker 12>So the shark thing,</v>

6404
02:57:40.231 --> 02:57:44.670

6410
02:57:55.591 --> 02:58:00.591
<v Speaker 12>This is a dead shark that they performed a c section on and there was 98 live</v>

6414
02:58:04.321 --> 02:58:06.360
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that it happens every time.</v>

6418
02:58:07.141 --> 02:58:10.920
<v Speaker 2>What I had read was that it happens often.</v>

6419
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:13.290
<v Speaker 2>This is the only thing I can find a shark pregnancy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>literally millions of sharks are hunted and killed every year.</v>

6430
02:58:31.890 --> 02:58:32.431

02:58:36.030 --> 02:58:39.330
<v Speaker 2>You know that's changed people's attitudes on shark fishing because people used</v>

6434
02:58:39.331 --> 02:58:41.760
<v Speaker 2>to catch shark and used to get it at restaurants all the time.</v>

02:58:50.791 --> 02:58:52.650
<v Speaker 2>It was a common thing they'd serve in restaurants.</v>

6444
02:58:53.190 --> 02:58:57.960
<v Speaker 2>How many sharks are fence research indicates that about a hundred million sharks</v>

6445
02:58:57.961 --> 02:58:59.160
<v Speaker 2>are killed each year.</v>

6446
02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6447
02:59:00.690 --> 02:59:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Roughly 11,000 sharks and hour.</v>

6448
02:59:03.780 --> 02:59:04.613
<v Speaker 2>That is incredible.</v>

6449
02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:06.180
<v Speaker 2>This is by finning.</v>

6450
02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:07.680
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

6451
02:59:09.450 --> 02:59:12.450
<v Speaker 2>It's likely that many sharks are caught without being reported.</v>

6452
02:59:12.730 --> 02:59:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6453
02:59:12.860 --> 02:59:13.693
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

6454
02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:14.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6455
02:59:14.760 --> 02:59:17.760
<v Speaker 2>so this is just what the reporting my God,</v>

6456
02:59:19.050 --> 02:59:19.340
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

6457
02:59:19.340 --> 02:59:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Heck,</v>

6458
02:59:20.010 --> 02:59:23.280
<v Speaker 2>so this is like the first time I can remember in history that people are</v>

6459
02:59:23.281 --> 02:59:26.100
<v Speaker 2>concerned with people fishing for sharks.</v>

6460
02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Because we talked about this was the the governor in New York.</v>

6461
02:59:29.641 --> 02:59:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Who Was it?</v>

6462
02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Who was the cat that got in trouble for legally catching a shark and cooking it</v>

6463
02:59:34.801 --> 02:59:35.340
<v Speaker 2>and eating it?</v>

6464
02:59:35.340 --> 02:59:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was the governor and governor of New York,</v>

6465
02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:39.473
<v Speaker 2>but Cuomo,</v>

6466
02:59:40.050 --> 02:59:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

6467
02:59:40.830 --> 02:59:41.370
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

6468
02:59:41.370 --> 02:59:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the government son,</v>

6469
02:59:42.780 --> 02:59:43.613
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

6470
02:59:44.370 --> 02:59:45.203
<v Speaker 2>Jamie find it.</v>

6471
02:59:45.420 --> 02:59:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Coma tweeted a picture of herself.</v>

6472
02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6473
02:59:47.730 --> 02:59:49.290
<v Speaker 2>After he caught a shark or something like that.</v>

6474
02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:49.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6475
02:59:49.591 --> 02:59:51.960
<v Speaker 2>so this was all normal when we were kids.</v>

6476
02:59:52.130 --> 02:59:52.891
<v Speaker 2>This was normal as fuck.</v>

6477
02:59:52.891 --> 02:59:53.191
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

6478
02:59:53.191 --> 02:59:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Might as well be a Marlin or a halibut.</v>

6479
02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:56.821
<v Speaker 2>Just he got a shock,</v>

6480
02:59:56.821 --> 02:59:56.941
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

6481
02:59:56.941 --> 02:59:57.181
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6482
02:59:57.181 --> 02:59:57.870
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

6483
02:59:57.870 --> 02:59:58.591
<v Speaker 2>What's it taste like?</v>

6484
02:59:58.591 --> 02:59:58.711
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6485
02:59:58.711 --> 02:59:59.190
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

6486
02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.580
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

6487
02:59:59.580 --> 03:00:00.420
<v Speaker 2>You Cook it with lemon,</v>

6488
03:00:00.421 --> 03:00:02.850
<v Speaker 2>like swordfish shark.</v>

6489
03:00:02.950 --> 03:00:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6490
03:00:03.310 --> 03:00:04.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a little tough.</v>

6491
03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I 100 Florida ft four pound thresher shark,</v>

6492
03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:07.890
<v Speaker 2>so that's um,</v>

6493
03:00:08.370 --> 03:00:08.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6494
03:00:08.581 --> 03:00:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Maaco particularly delicious.</v>

6495
03:00:10.830 --> 03:00:12.460
<v Speaker 2>It really does taste a lot like swordfish,</v>

6496
03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:14.580
<v Speaker 2>but in our lifetime,</v>

6497
03:00:14.581 --> 03:00:19.260
<v Speaker 2>it's now become taboo because people have this rough idea of what a shark is and</v>

6498
03:00:19.261 --> 03:00:23.790
<v Speaker 2>the sharks are being targeted and sharks are being murdered and there's a small</v>

6499
03:00:23.791 --> 03:00:24.840
<v Speaker 2>amount of sharks left.</v>

6500
03:00:25.110 --> 03:00:28.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's accurate because I think this is just in one part of the</v>

6501
03:00:28.351 --> 03:00:29.010
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

6502
03:00:29.010 --> 03:00:30.450
<v Speaker 2>they're killing off all these sharks.</v>

6503
03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:34.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you say that there's no more grizzly bears left,</v>

6504
03:00:34.591 --> 03:00:34.741
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6505
03:00:34.741 --> 03:00:35.970
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about California,</v>

6506
03:00:35.971 --> 03:00:36.804
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

6507
03:00:37.050 --> 03:00:39.600
<v Speaker 2>But if you're talking about British Columbia,</v>

6508
03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:40.650
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong.</v>

6509
03:00:40.770 --> 03:00:45.270
<v Speaker 2>There is a fuck load of 'em up there and they're scary and they're big.</v>

6510
03:00:45.930 --> 03:00:49.350
<v Speaker 2>They're big and they're fast and they need to eat every day.</v>

6511
03:00:49.530 --> 03:00:50.730
<v Speaker 2>And they berries,</v>

6512
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:51.930
<v Speaker 2>if they find berries,</v>

6513
03:00:51.931 --> 03:00:54.450
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat some berries or the eat your asshole too.</v>

6514
03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I'd present.</v>

6515
03:00:59.140 --> 03:00:59.501
<v Speaker 2>Would you,</v>

6516
03:00:59.501 --> 03:00:59.980
<v Speaker 2>would you say</v>

6517
03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:00.550
<v Speaker 6>this is it,</v>

6518
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:01.181
<v Speaker 6>this is happening.</v>

6519
03:01:01.181 --> 03:01:01.421
<v Speaker 6>Is it,</v>

6520
03:01:01.421 --> 03:01:02.340
<v Speaker 6>let's do it right that,</v>

6521
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:03.703
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

6522
03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:05.890
<v Speaker 6>I was in Alaska once and I was in,</v>

6523
03:01:05.891 --> 03:01:06.724
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6524
03:01:07.150 --> 03:01:07.990
<v Speaker 6>I forget what town,</v>

6525
03:01:07.991 --> 03:01:08.761
<v Speaker 6>but there was a,</v>

6526
03:01:08.761 --> 03:01:10.390
<v Speaker 6>an island called Bair island.</v>

6527
03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:11.770
<v Speaker 6>And I rented this guy,</v>

6528
03:01:11.771 --> 03:01:12.450
<v Speaker 6>had a,</v>

6529
03:01:12.450 --> 03:01:14.230
<v Speaker 6>had a 1948,</v>

6530
03:01:14.231 --> 03:01:19.231
<v Speaker 6>I think it was called us Stenson or some kind of plane prop plane.</v>

6531
03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:24.100
<v Speaker 6>And I paid him a hundred bucks to take me over bear island in this fucking</v>

6532
03:01:24.101 --> 03:01:25.120
<v Speaker 6>shitty little plane.</v>

6533
03:01:25.510 --> 03:01:30.200
<v Speaker 6>And we went out there and it took them like 30 minutes to get the plane started.</v>

6534
03:01:30.210 --> 03:01:31.043
<v Speaker 6>And that was like,</v>

6535
03:01:31.090 --> 03:01:32.560
<v Speaker 6>I should get the fuck outta here.</v>

6536
03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:33.670
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

6537
03:01:33.670 --> 03:01:35.690
<v Speaker 6>so we go up and a,</v>

6538
03:01:35.710 --> 03:01:40.710
<v Speaker 6>and the thing is getting tossed around by wind and uh,</v>

6539
03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:45.490
<v Speaker 6>and we go out and we go over bear island and he's showing me fucking bear all</v>

6540
03:01:45.491 --> 03:01:45.651
<v Speaker 6>over.</v>

6541
03:01:45.651 --> 03:01:49.210
<v Speaker 6>It was like the highest concentration of bear and to anywhere in Alaska.</v>

6542
03:01:50.830 --> 03:01:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

6543
03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Those bears are giant too,</v>

6544
03:01:54.351 --> 03:01:54.640
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6545
03:01:54.640 --> 03:01:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6546
03:01:55.060 --> 03:01:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

6547
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:56.650
<v Speaker 2>the coastal bears,</v>

6548
03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:58.000
<v Speaker 2>they're all eating seafood.</v>

6549
03:01:58.001 --> 03:02:01.480
<v Speaker 2>They're eating like fish and salmon and they just get enormous.</v>

6550
03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6551
03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:02.920
<v Speaker 2>there's so big,</v>

6552
03:02:03.550 --> 03:02:06.700
<v Speaker 2>there's so much bigger than bears that are inland like hundreds of pounds.</v>

6553
03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:08.080
<v Speaker 2>But what are the inland bears eat?</v>

6554
03:02:08.470 --> 03:02:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Wherever the fuck they got ahold of my elite salmon.</v>

6555
03:02:10.841 --> 03:02:11.651
<v Speaker 2>If they find salmon,</v>

6556
03:02:11.651 --> 03:02:12.640
<v Speaker 2>if there's a salmon river,</v>

6557
03:02:12.641 --> 03:02:13.271
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat fish,</v>

6558
03:02:13.271 --> 03:02:14.680
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat berries,</v>

6559
03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:18.010
<v Speaker 2>he calves eat a lot of calves,</v>

6560

<v Speaker 2>did a lot of a calf's of a elk and Moose and deer.</v>

6561
03:02:23.111 --> 03:02:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Fauns the small things that can't get away.</v>

6562
03:02:25.601 --> 03:02:26.560
<v Speaker 2>They eat everything they can.</v>

6563
03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:27.933
<v Speaker 2>They're so big.</v>

6564
03:02:28.750 --> 03:02:29.583
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6565
03:02:29.770 --> 03:02:30.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just the,</v>

6566
03:02:30.270 --> 03:02:34.240
<v Speaker 2>to imagine how much food you would have to eat if you weighed 800 pounds.</v>

6567
03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:36.450
<v Speaker 2>How much food would you have to eat every day?</v>

6568
03:02:36.470 --> 03:02:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6569
03:02:36.590 --> 03:02:38.230
<v Speaker 2>four times as much as you eat.</v>

6570
03:02:38.231 --> 03:02:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Now we did that fucking creep.</v>

6571
03:02:39.520 --> 03:02:40.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6572
03:02:40.780 --> 03:02:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking long nailed creep.</v>

6573
03:02:43.060 --> 03:02:43.871
<v Speaker 2>That's a monster,</v>

6574
03:02:43.871 --> 03:02:44.430
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6575
03:02:44.430 --> 03:02:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6576
03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:45.160
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

6577
03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:46.360
<v Speaker 2>but we think it's Yogi.</v>

6578
03:02:46.420 --> 03:02:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

03:02:48.790 --> 03:02:50.170
<v Speaker 2>He will eat your kid in front of you.</v>

6581
03:02:50.290 --> 03:02:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6582
03:02:50.890 --> 03:02:52.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they have to do.</v>

6583
03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:52.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6584

<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

6585
03:02:52.631 --> 03:02:53.590
<v Speaker 2>they're predators.</v>

6586
03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:54.450
<v Speaker 2>They're out there.</v>

6587
03:02:54.450 --> 03:02:54.680
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

6588
03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:55.750
<v Speaker 2>they're omnivores.</v>

6589
03:02:55.840 --> 03:02:56.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6590
03:02:56.111 --> 03:02:59.530
<v Speaker 2>they do occasionally eat whatever the fuck they want.</v>

6591
03:02:59.531 --> 03:03:00.790
<v Speaker 2>They'll eat roots and berries.</v>

6592
03:03:00.791 --> 03:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>They'll eat everything else too,</v>

6593
03:03:02.231 --> 03:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>but they'll definitely you.</v>

6594
03:03:03.570 --> 03:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6595
03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:04.630
<v Speaker 2>And love it.</v>

6596
03:03:04.630 --> 03:03:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6597
03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Have a good old time.</v>

6598
03:03:07.650 --> 03:03:07.831
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6599
03:03:07.831 --> 03:03:09.630
<v Speaker 6>That salmon's a perfect food for them.</v>

6600
03:03:09.631 --> 03:03:10.560
<v Speaker 6>It's all fat.</v>

6601
03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:11.910
<v Speaker 6>You just store it up.</v>

6602
03:03:12.030 --> 03:03:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

6603
03:03:12.690 --> 03:03:15.930
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like it's designed for them too because the salmon die.</v>

6604
03:03:16.290 --> 03:03:18.450
<v Speaker 2>They literally die on the river.</v>

6605
03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't even have to catch him.</v>

6606
03:03:20.660 --> 03:03:20.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6607
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:21.623
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

6608
03:03:22.170 --> 03:03:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Every year when they have to die,</v>

6609
03:03:24.061 --> 03:03:25.890
<v Speaker 2>they go back up to where they were born,</v>

6610
03:03:25.891 --> 03:03:26.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6611
03:03:26.190 --> 03:03:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6612
03:03:26.970 --> 03:03:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6613
03:03:27.690 --> 03:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>They say that once the salmon make the trek from the ocean to the fresh water,</v>

6614
03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:35.280
<v Speaker 2>they're already on a path to die.</v>

6615
03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Their clock is already gone over.</v>

6616
03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:40.440
<v Speaker 2>It's already flipped over into no return land.</v>

6617
03:03:40.441 --> 03:03:43.920
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't take them out of there and bring them to like some salmon pawn.</v>

6618
03:03:43.921 --> 03:03:44.760
<v Speaker 2>They live forever.</v>

6619
03:03:45.150 --> 03:03:45.983
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work that way.</v>

6620
03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:47.480
<v Speaker 2>There they brew,</v>

6621
03:03:47.530 --> 03:03:48.363
<v Speaker 2>they breed,</v>

6622
03:03:48.570 --> 03:03:49.560
<v Speaker 2>they make the track,</v>

6623
03:03:49.770 --> 03:03:54.210
<v Speaker 2>they breed and when they get to the spot where you know when there were the end</v>

6624
03:03:54.211 --> 03:03:54.691
<v Speaker 2>of their life,</v>

6625
03:03:54.691 --> 03:03:54.931
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

6626
03:03:54.931 --> 03:03:56.640
<v Speaker 2>their body starts changing color.</v>

6627
03:03:56.880 --> 03:03:58.100
<v Speaker 2>They getting mushy,</v>

6628
03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:02.630
<v Speaker 2>they live rotten and they just fucking wind up like pooling up on the ground and</v>

6629
03:04:02.631 --> 03:04:05.780
<v Speaker 2>then the bears move in and they eat hundreds of rotten ones.</v>

6630
03:04:06.020 --> 03:04:06.800
<v Speaker 2>See this is,</v>

6631
03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:10.640
<v Speaker 2>this is while the salmon are in the run and these bears are,</v>

6632
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:12.080
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting over territory.</v>

6633
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of these motherfuckers.</v>

6634
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

6635
03:04:14.391 --> 03:04:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

6636
03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:16.400
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting over who gets to salmon.</v>

6637
03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6638
03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:19.340
<v Speaker 2>but these are salmon that are still pretty fresh and healthy.</v>

6639
03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:20.030
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

6640
03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.760
<v Speaker 2>they're swimming around,</v>

6641
03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:21.593
<v Speaker 2>they look good.</v>

6642
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:25.370
<v Speaker 2>And so they catch them like that was a perfectly healthy salmon and he catches</v>

6643
03:04:25.371 --> 03:04:29.780
<v Speaker 2>it right in the middle of it or tried Huggies all slow mo and shit.</v>

6644
03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Here he goes.</v>

6645
03:04:30.650 --> 03:04:32.120
<v Speaker 2>They try and they catch some of them.</v>

6646
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh come on bitch.</v>

6647
03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:36.793
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

6648
03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:38.463
<v Speaker 2>get that.</v>

6649
03:04:38.500 --> 03:04:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Imagine just standing in freezing cold water waiting to catch something with</v>

6650
03:04:42.641 --> 03:04:43.474
<v Speaker 2>your mouth.</v>

6651
03:04:43.630 --> 03:04:45.160
<v Speaker 2>It's delicious.</v>

6652
03:04:45.310 --> 03:04:45.521
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6653
03:04:45.521 --> 03:04:46.900
<v Speaker 2>But they figured it out and it works.</v>

6654
03:04:46.930 --> 03:04:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

6655
03:04:47.260 --> 03:04:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Look at the cubs.</v>

6656
03:04:47.940 --> 03:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Like come on mom to fuck.</v>

6657
03:04:50.170 --> 03:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>So mom's probably going to give him some of that.</v>

6658
03:04:52.990 --> 03:04:53.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6659
03:04:53.321 --> 03:04:57.070
<v Speaker 2>see she breaks off pieces of it and so they just keep doing that back and forth</v>

6660
03:04:57.100 --> 03:04:58.180
<v Speaker 2>and they'll do that all day.</v>

6661
03:04:58.390 --> 03:05:01.600
<v Speaker 2>But then once the salmon are done with their run,</v>

6662
03:05:01.601 --> 03:05:02.710
<v Speaker 2>then they just die.</v>

6663
03:05:02.920 --> 03:05:07.510
<v Speaker 2>And coincidentally when they're dying is probably right when the bears are</v>

6664
03:05:07.511 --> 03:05:09.950
<v Speaker 2>trying to fatten up and get ready for hibernation.</v>

6665
03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6666
03:05:10.270 --> 03:05:14.810
<v Speaker 2>So it all like sort of happens together and they're all in the right place at</v>

6667
03:05:14.811 --> 03:05:15.620
<v Speaker 2>the right time.</v>

6668
03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6669
03:05:16.300 --> 03:05:19.150
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find bears eating rotten salmon.</v>

6670
03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Cause like sometimes they'll pull up and these these rivers and these like</v>

6671
03:05:23.410 --> 03:05:28.410
<v Speaker 2>little ponds and shit and you just see all these bears is chew on these rotten</v>

6672
03:05:28.511 --> 03:05:29.210
<v Speaker 2>carcasses.</v>

6673
03:05:29.210 --> 03:05:30.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6674
03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6675
03:05:30.351 --> 03:05:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Those salmon are endangered now we eat so much more fish.</v>

6676
03:05:33.970 --> 03:05:34.940
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

6677
03:05:34.941 --> 03:05:37.220
<v Speaker 3>I'd have fish once every three weeks.</v>

6678
03:05:37.610 --> 03:05:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Now you,</v>

6679
03:05:38.040 --> 03:05:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe it's because we're in la,</v>

6680
03:05:39.291 --> 03:05:41.330
<v Speaker 3>but I have fish a few times a week.</v>

6681
03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Do you have some fucking Sushi?</v>

6682
03:05:43.011 --> 03:05:46.460
<v Speaker 3>One day wife will cook some salmon on another day.</v>

6683
03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Go get one of those pokie bowls.</v>

6684
03:05:49.690 --> 03:05:51.070
<v Speaker 2>We're constantly eating salmon.</v>

6685
03:05:51.370 --> 03:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of food.</v>

6686
03:05:52.580 --> 03:05:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Think about all those little organisms that have to fuck.</v>

6687
03:05:55.600 --> 03:05:56.291
<v Speaker 2>Well not really.</v>

6688
03:05:56.291 --> 03:05:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Shoot loads on eggs.</v>

6689
03:05:57.400 --> 03:05:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6690
03:05:57.700 --> 03:06:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Make new organisms and then all the people with nets scooping them up.</v>

6691
03:06:02.140 --> 03:06:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you see us?</v>

6692
03:06:02.710 --> 03:06:06.310
<v Speaker 2>A tuna got sold in Japan for the highest amount ever.</v>

6693
03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:08.590
<v Speaker 2>$3 million for tuna.</v>

6694
03:06:08.980 --> 03:06:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

6695
03:06:10.600 --> 03:06:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

6696
03:06:12.050 --> 03:06:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Did you have any idea?</v>

6697
03:06:12.970 --> 03:06:14.170
<v Speaker 2>But a tuna can be 3 million.</v>

6698
03:06:14.171 --> 03:06:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6699
03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I know that they wait on the dock and the in Japan and whoever is like certain</v>

6700
03:06:19.251 --> 03:06:22.870
<v Speaker 3>chefs have more cache and they're able to come in first and pick the,</v>

6701
03:06:23.030 --> 03:06:23.863
<v Speaker 3>the tuna,</v>

6702
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:24.703
<v Speaker 3>but then they,</v>

6703
03:06:24.770 --> 03:06:26.330
<v Speaker 3>but then they auction them off and yeah,</v>

6704
03:06:26.331 --> 03:06:27.740
<v Speaker 3>they go for crazy money.</v>

6705
03:06:28.080 --> 03:06:28.913
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

6706
03:06:29.580 --> 03:06:31.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant fucking fish though.</v>

6707
03:06:31.501 --> 03:06:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it like 600 pounds or something?</v>

6708
03:06:33.031 --> 03:06:33.511
<v Speaker 2>How much does it cost?</v>

6709
03:06:33.511 --> 03:06:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6710

<v Speaker 2>Least 278 kilograms.</v>

6711
03:06:36.180 --> 03:06:39.450
<v Speaker 2>What's that in English two point to close to six.</v>

6712
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6713
03:06:40.320 --> 03:06:41.153
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

6714
03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:41.993
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

6715
03:06:42.210 --> 03:06:42.751
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard,</v>

03:06:56.270 --> 03:06:57.001
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting?</v>

6728
03:06:57.001 --> 03:06:57.990
<v Speaker 2>They're catching ones.</v>

6729
03:06:58.080 --> 03:07:03.080
<v Speaker 2>They're calling Hamachi cause they were actually from a Hamachi farm that was on</v>

6730
03:07:03.241 --> 03:07:06.630
<v Speaker 2>the big island that broke during the storm and weather that storm.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well it destroyed this uh,</v>

6735
03:07:11.810 --> 03:07:15.600
<v Speaker 2>this containment area that they had where they were farm raising Hamachi for</v>

6736
03:07:15.601 --> 03:07:16.620
<v Speaker 2>like Sushi and shit.</v>

6737

<v Speaker 2>They made 'em.</v>

6754
03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:35.910
<v Speaker 2>They made a sashimi.</v>

03:07:35.911 --> 03:07:36.900
<v Speaker 2>They made Sovich a,</v>

6756
03:07:36.901 --> 03:07:38.160
<v Speaker 2>they baked it.</v>

6757
03:07:38.610 --> 03:07:40.080
<v Speaker 2>They cooked it a couple of different ways,</v>

6758
03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:41.153
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

6759
03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:42.870
<v Speaker 2>they're so powerful.</v>

6760

6762
03:07:48.660 --> 03:07:48.991
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

6763
03:07:48.991 --> 03:07:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you're wrestling with them.</v>

6764
03:07:50.071 --> 03:07:51.290
<v Speaker 2>We can try and get them into the bullying.</v>

6765
03:07:53.160 --> 03:07:58.160
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that thing 600 pounds and Holy Shit.</v>

6766
03:07:58.501 --> 03:07:59.990
<v Speaker 2>That's like the whole family fishing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She loves fishing.</v>

6772
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6773
03:08:05.370 --> 03:08:06.300
<v Speaker 2>We put a video up,</v>

6774
03:08:06.320 --> 03:08:06.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6775
03:08:06.570 --> 03:08:06.931
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

6776
03:08:06.931 --> 03:08:07.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6777
03:08:07.500 --> 03:08:09.120
<v Speaker 2>the dolphins that were with us.</v>

6778
03:08:09.210 --> 03:08:09.870
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>

6779
03:08:09.870 --> 03:08:10.310
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

6780
03:08:10.310 --> 03:08:11.070
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

6781
03:08:11.070 --> 03:08:13.730
<v Speaker 2>They just never seen that many dolphins swim with a boat either.</v>

6782
03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:15.453
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>

6783
03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:16.313
<v Speaker 2>They just all,</v>

6784
03:08:16.350 --> 03:08:17.700
<v Speaker 2>we just hit the right spot.</v>

6785
03:08:17.730 --> 03:08:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6786
03:08:18.060 --> 03:08:20.340
<v Speaker 2>And then they all decided to swim with the boat.</v>

6787
03:08:20.341 --> 03:08:21.174
<v Speaker 2>They just get in,</v>

6788
03:08:21.230 --> 03:08:24.390
<v Speaker 2>in front of the boat as the boat's pushing the water and they started a surf.</v>

6789
03:08:24.391 --> 03:08:25.140
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

6790
03:08:25.140 --> 03:08:26.040
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

6791
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.821
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>

6792
03:08:26.821 --> 03:08:28.050
<v Speaker 2>You worry about you're going to hit him.</v>

6793
03:08:28.080 --> 03:08:28.860
<v Speaker 2>You worry that they're going to,</v>

6794
03:08:28.860 --> 03:08:30.450
<v Speaker 2>but the right people running the boat,</v>

6795
03:08:30.451 --> 03:08:31.051
<v Speaker 2>they don't worry about it.</v>

6796
03:08:31.051 --> 03:08:32.670
<v Speaker 2>All the dolphins know exactly what they're doing.</v>

6797
03:08:33.180 --> 03:08:34.200
<v Speaker 2>They're smart as shit.</v>

6798
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6799
03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:35.850
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to watch,</v>

6800
03:08:35.851 --> 03:08:36.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6801
03:08:36.330 --> 03:08:38.730
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to watch them all coordinate together and then they were done.</v>

6802
03:08:38.731 --> 03:08:39.850
<v Speaker 2>They were done like by,</v>

6803
03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:41.340
<v Speaker 2>they take off.</v>

6804
03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6805
03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:42.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6806
03:08:42.241 --> 03:08:43.770
<v Speaker 2>My daughter's surfs and they come out,</v>

6807
03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:45.000
<v Speaker 2>they play around a little bit.</v>

6808
03:08:45.270 --> 03:08:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they ride the waves when she surfing.</v>

6809
03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:49.530
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the dark sides of fishing,</v>

6810
03:08:49.531 --> 03:08:50.364
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6811
03:08:50.490 --> 03:08:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Commercial fishing is what happens in Japan when they take those dolphins and</v>

6812
03:08:55.111 --> 03:08:57.120
<v Speaker 2>they look at them as competition,</v>

6813
03:08:57.660 --> 03:08:59.160
<v Speaker 2>they're going to kill their tuna so they,</v>

6814
03:08:59.450 --> 03:09:00.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6815
03:09:00.030 --> 03:09:01.170
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing that forever.</v>

6816
03:09:01.171 --> 03:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>The large scale slaughter of them,</v>

6817
03:09:03.990 --> 03:09:05.040
<v Speaker 2>it's scary shit.</v>

6818
03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:06.293
<v Speaker 2>They just shoot him.</v>

6819
03:09:06.480 --> 03:09:07.290
<v Speaker 2>They'd cut them,</v>

6820
03:09:07.290 --> 03:09:07.710
<v Speaker 2>they bring up.</v>

6821
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:08.790
<v Speaker 2>You've ever seen the documentary,</v>

6822
03:09:08.791 --> 03:09:09.624
<v Speaker 2>the cove?</v>

6823
03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:10.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6824
03:09:10.351 --> 03:09:11.480
<v Speaker 2>now I heard about that.</v>

6825
03:09:11.790 --> 03:09:13.030
<v Speaker 2>All full.</v>

6826
03:09:13.370 --> 03:09:15.260
<v Speaker 2>All full there.</v>

6827
03:09:15.310 --> 03:09:15.720
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6828
03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:19.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're slaughtering water people.</v>

6829
03:09:20.100 --> 03:09:20.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like.</v>

6830
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:21.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6831
03:09:21.730 --> 03:09:23.400
<v Speaker 2>There's what a dolphin is,</v>

6832
03:09:23.460 --> 03:09:24.990
<v Speaker 2>is some strange,</v>

6833
03:09:24.991 --> 03:09:29.490
<v Speaker 2>super intelligent creature that we don't totally understand and they can talk,</v>

6834
03:09:29.730 --> 03:09:31.740
<v Speaker 2>they can talk to each other and we don't know what they're saying,</v>

6835
03:09:31.890 --> 03:09:32.910
<v Speaker 2>but they know what they're saying.</v>

6836
03:09:33.420 --> 03:09:35.790
<v Speaker 2>And we could train them.</v>

6837
03:09:35.820 --> 03:09:36.690
<v Speaker 2>You could ride them,</v>

6838
03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:37.491
<v Speaker 2>you can do it,</v>

6839
03:09:37.491 --> 03:09:38.730
<v Speaker 2>flips for fish,</v>

6840
03:09:38.760 --> 03:09:39.510
<v Speaker 2>all this kind of stuff.</v>

6841
03:09:39.510 --> 03:09:40.380
<v Speaker 2>That's all true.</v>

6842
03:09:40.410 --> 03:09:41.243
<v Speaker 2>That's all true.</v>

6843
03:09:41.370 --> 03:09:43.710
<v Speaker 2>But what's also true is they have a giant brain,</v>

6844
03:09:43.950 --> 03:09:45.450
<v Speaker 2>and if they have a huge brain,</v>

6845
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.801
<v Speaker 2>Devin,</v>

6846
03:09:45.801 --> 03:09:48.030
<v Speaker 2>cerebral cortex is 40% larger than a person.</v>

6847
03:09:48.600 --> 03:09:49.370
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>

6848
03:09:49.370 --> 03:09:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6849
03:09:49.800 --> 03:09:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6850
03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.970
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

6851
03:09:50.970 --> 03:09:52.950
<v Speaker 2>it's designed for you,</v>

6852
03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:53.281
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6853
03:09:53.281 --> 03:09:54.250
<v Speaker 2>the movement of his body.</v>

6854
03:09:54.251 --> 03:09:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's a lot,</v>

6855
03:09:54.850 --> 03:09:55.420
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>

6856
03:09:55.420 --> 03:09:56.560
<v Speaker 2>lot larger body,</v>

6857
03:09:57.250 --> 03:10:02.250
<v Speaker 2>but they think it's also got some sort of probably not totally understood are</v>

6858
03:10:03.401 --> 03:10:04.720
<v Speaker 2>measured cognitive ability.</v>

6859
03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:06.940
<v Speaker 2>They don't know like how smart they really are.</v>

6860
03:10:06.970 --> 03:10:07.803
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>

6861
03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:08.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6862
03:10:08.261 --> 03:10:09.430
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about Timothy Leary,</v>

6863
03:10:09.431 --> 03:10:11.200
<v Speaker 2>he used to pal around with John Lilly.</v>

6864
03:10:11.380 --> 03:10:15.460
<v Speaker 2>John Lilly's the guy who invented the isolation tank and he's also a,</v>

6865
03:10:15.461 --> 03:10:17.740
<v Speaker 2>he was a pioneer and interspecies communication.</v>

6866
03:10:17.770 --> 03:10:20.570
<v Speaker 2>You'd give dolphins acid and he would uh,</v>

6867
03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:25.630
<v Speaker 2>he was set the float tank up next to the dolphin tank and take acid and get in</v>

6868
03:10:25.631 --> 03:10:26.464
<v Speaker 2>there with them.</v>

6869
03:10:26.830 --> 03:10:27.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6870
03:10:27.131 --> 03:10:27.730
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

6871
03:10:27.730 --> 03:10:27.881
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6872
03:10:27.881 --> 03:10:30.940
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to figure out a way to get dolphins to speak.</v>

6873
03:10:31.210 --> 03:10:32.770
<v Speaker 2>He would get them to like make a noise.</v>

6874
03:10:32.771 --> 03:10:35.440
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like [inaudible] you know,</v>

6875
03:10:35.441 --> 03:10:35.951
<v Speaker 2>but they could,</v>

6876
03:10:35.951 --> 03:10:37.810
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the vocal cords.</v>

6877
03:10:37.860 --> 03:10:40.300
<v Speaker 2>They can't make the sounds that we expect,</v>

6878
03:10:40.900 --> 03:10:42.670
<v Speaker 2>but there sounds we don't understand.</v>

6879
03:10:42.700 --> 03:10:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6880
03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Which is weird cause they know what you're saying.</v>

6881
03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:45.161
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

6882
03:10:45.161 --> 03:10:45.551
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6883
03:10:45.551 --> 03:10:46.390
<v Speaker 2>we're going to jump now,</v>

6884
03:10:46.391 --> 03:10:46.920
<v Speaker 2>we're going to jump,</v>

6885
03:10:46.920 --> 03:10:47.860
<v Speaker 2>we're going to give you a fish.</v>

6886
03:10:48.070 --> 03:10:48.640
<v Speaker 2>They know it.</v>

6887
03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:49.473
<v Speaker 2>They know what you're saying.</v>

6888
03:10:49.660 --> 03:10:50.680
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what they're saying.</v>

6889
03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:53.171
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6890
03:10:53.171 --> 03:10:53.741
<v Speaker 6>It's weird when you,</v>

6891
03:10:53.741 --> 03:10:53.981
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

6892
03:10:53.981 --> 03:10:56.830
<v Speaker 6>What is the cutoff for killing an intelligent animal?</v>

6893
03:10:56.860 --> 03:10:57.041
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

6894
03:10:57.041 --> 03:10:57.251
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6895
03:10:57.251 --> 03:10:59.140
<v Speaker 6>like you can't kill dogs cat.</v>

6896
03:10:59.160 --> 03:10:59.993
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6897
03:11:00.660 --> 03:11:02.430
<v Speaker 2>dogs aren't nearly as smart as dolphins,</v>

6898
03:11:02.460 --> 03:11:03.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6899
03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:03.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6900
03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:05.820
<v Speaker 2>But you can kill dogs in some spots.</v>

6901
03:11:05.821 --> 03:11:06.654
<v Speaker 2>It's cultural.</v>

6902
03:11:06.750 --> 03:11:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6903
03:11:07.290 --> 03:11:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Because pigs are probably the smartest dogs.</v>

6904
03:11:09.660 --> 03:11:09.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

6905
03:11:09.901 --> 03:11:10.411
<v Speaker 2>We all exist.</v>

6906
03:11:10.411 --> 03:11:11.244
<v Speaker 2>Really smart.</v>

6907
03:11:11.800 --> 03:11:12.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6908
03:11:12.001 --> 03:11:12.834
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

6909
03:11:13.590 --> 03:11:14.423
<v Speaker 2>that's a tricky one.</v>

6910
03:11:14.970 --> 03:11:15.803
<v Speaker 2>All those,</v>

6911
03:11:15.810 --> 03:11:16.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6912
03:11:17.940 --> 03:11:20.400
<v Speaker 2>that is one of our criteria.</v>

6913
03:11:20.490 --> 03:11:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Like even a lot of vegetarians,</v>

6914
03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:24.480
<v Speaker 2>we'll still step on roaches.</v>

6915
03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6916
03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:26.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6917
03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:30.030
<v Speaker 2>our criteria is how smart is the thing.</v>

6918
03:11:30.510 --> 03:11:31.830
<v Speaker 2>How close is it to us?</v>

6919
03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:33.090
<v Speaker 2>The further it's away from us,</v>

6920
03:11:33.091 --> 03:11:34.080
<v Speaker 2>the easy we could just like,</v>

6921
03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:35.850
<v Speaker 2>nobody gives a fuck about oysters.</v>

6922
03:11:36.740 --> 03:11:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6923
03:11:37.050 --> 03:11:37.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6924
03:11:37.490 --> 03:11:37.790

<v Speaker 2>Saben an oyster gets got.</v>

6926
03:11:39.470 --> 03:11:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

6927
03:11:40.290 --> 03:11:41.041
<v Speaker 2>I don't care at all.</v>

6928
03:11:41.041 --> 03:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel a thing.</v>

6929
03:11:42.130 --> 03:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>And someone's shucks annoy Sir and opens up and scooped it out and swallow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but the poor little piggy.</v>

6939
03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:51.470
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

03:11:51.470 --> 03:11:52.061

<v Speaker 2>So terrified.</v>

6945
03:11:55.410 --> 03:11:56.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6946
03:11:56.680 --> 03:11:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Balance things are dumb.</v>

6947
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:59.530
<v Speaker 6>What about lobsters getting thrown in the pot?</v>

6948
03:11:59.531 --> 03:12:00.340
<v Speaker 6>Can you do that?</v>

6949
03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:01.240
<v Speaker 6>I can't do that.</v>

6950
03:12:01.630 --> 03:12:02.021
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

6951
03:12:02.021 --> 03:12:02.351
<v Speaker 6>I could do.</v>

6952
03:12:02.351 --> 03:12:04.180
<v Speaker 6>It freaks me out.</v>

6953
03:12:04.210 --> 03:12:04.451
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

6954
03:12:04.451 --> 03:12:08.530
<v Speaker 6>That they're like moving around and alive and then you throw them in and don't</v>

6955
03:12:08.531 --> 03:12:09.364
<v Speaker 6>they scream</v>

6956
03:12:09.380 --> 03:12:10.070
<v Speaker 2>they're bugs.</v>

6957
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6958
03:12:10.221 --> 03:12:10.670
<v Speaker 2>They scream.</v>

6959
03:12:10.670 --> 03:12:11.600
<v Speaker 2>They sing first.</v>

6960
03:12:12.910 --> 03:12:13.190
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

6961
03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:14.023
<v Speaker 6>scream.</v>

6962
03:12:14.170 --> 03:12:15.003
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

6963
03:12:16.140 --> 03:12:17.720
<v Speaker 6>It's not like the frog in Carnegie Hall.</v>

6964
03:12:17.721 --> 03:12:18.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they could make noise.</v>

6965
03:12:19.260 --> 03:12:20.110
<v Speaker 6>They make noise.</v>

6966
03:12:20.500 --> 03:12:21.340
<v Speaker 6>Their lobsters.</v>

6967
03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:22.503
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

6968
03:12:22.690 --> 03:12:22.901
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

6969
03:12:22.901 --> 03:12:23.970
<v Speaker 6>But they taste fuck.</v>

6970
03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:25.660
<v Speaker 6>I'll eat tons of them.</v>

6971
03:12:26.130 --> 03:12:27.940
<v Speaker 6>When I used to work in Boston at the,</v>

6972
03:12:27.941 --> 03:12:28.774
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6973
03:12:29.110 --> 03:12:30.060
<v Speaker 6>the copy Marriott,</v>

6974
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:32.170
<v Speaker 6>that was my day job for a while in college.</v>

6975
03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:33.790
<v Speaker 6>And then when I first started doing standup,</v>

6976
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:38.350
<v Speaker 6>and we used to go down and it was the biggest banquet hall in Boston.</v>

6977
03:12:38.351 --> 03:12:39.700
<v Speaker 6>So we used to get all these conventions,</v>

6978
03:12:39.701 --> 03:12:43.810
<v Speaker 6>all these fucking hayseed farmers would come from the Midwest and they'd stay in</v>

6979
03:12:43.811 --> 03:12:45.970
<v Speaker 6>the hotel and they could order any kind of dinner.</v>

6980
03:12:45.971 --> 03:12:47.170
<v Speaker 6>They want it for their banquet,</v>

6981
03:12:47.410 --> 03:12:49.090
<v Speaker 6>but they always wanted the pilgrim,</v>

6982
03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:51.980
<v Speaker 6>the pilgrim banquet and used to have to fucking</v>

6983
03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:55.550
<v Speaker 3>dress up as pilgrims who would serve lobster.</v>

6984
03:12:55.551 --> 03:12:56.720
<v Speaker 3>It didn't even make any sense.</v>

6985
03:12:57.160 --> 03:12:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Different things.</v>

6986
03:12:57.730 --> 03:12:59.180
<v Speaker 3>So so they would make,</v>

6987
03:12:59.181 --> 03:13:04.181
<v Speaker 3>and the thing about banquet cooking is you cook 10% more than the amount of</v>

6988
03:13:04.371 --> 03:13:06.260
<v Speaker 3>people you're feeding just in case,</v>

6989
03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:08.720
<v Speaker 3>which meant there was like you know,</v>

6990
03:13:08.721 --> 03:13:13.370
<v Speaker 3>30 30 college kids all waiting tables and a,</v>

6991
03:13:13.371 --> 03:13:18.050
<v Speaker 3>and so after we fed them they would usually have like a presentation or whatever</v>

6992
03:13:18.051 --> 03:13:19.370
<v Speaker 3>comedian or a speaker.</v>

6993
03:13:19.550 --> 03:13:23.030
<v Speaker 3>So we would leave the room for like an hour and a half and we would just fucking</v>

6994
03:13:23.031 --> 03:13:28.031
<v Speaker 3>go to town on like a hundred lobsters could eat like three lobsters if you</v>

6995
03:13:28.750 --> 03:13:29.300
<v Speaker 3>wanted.</v>

6996
03:13:29.300 --> 03:13:30.051
<v Speaker 3>And then our friends,</v>

6997
03:13:30.051 --> 03:13:31.090
<v Speaker 3>we're all working the bars.</v>

6998
03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:33.890
<v Speaker 3>They were all the bartenders so we'd be doing shots,</v>

6999
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:38.300
<v Speaker 3>drinking beer and so is the upside was you live like a king.</v>

7000
03:13:38.301 --> 03:13:41.240
<v Speaker 3>The downside was you were dressed like a fucking asshole.</v>

7001
03:13:45.710 --> 03:13:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I remember clam bakes.</v>

7002
03:13:46.941 --> 03:13:48.050
<v Speaker 1>People would do them on the ball.</v>

7003
03:13:48.051 --> 03:13:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7004
03:13:48.500 --> 03:13:49.700
<v Speaker 1>those were good.</v>

7005
03:13:49.701 --> 03:13:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7006
03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I like a clam bake where you would burry it and put seaweed over the top and</v>

7007
03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:54.673
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

7008
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Wet Seaweed and it would just steam everything.</v>

7009
03:13:57.210 --> 03:13:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it.</v>

7010
03:13:58.590 --> 03:14:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I've only eaten it at a restaurant.</v>

7011
03:14:00.631 --> 03:14:01.700
<v Speaker 1>When you order a clam bake.</v>

7012
03:14:01.730 --> 03:14:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7013
03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:02.701
<v Speaker 1>And they give you some,</v>

7014
03:14:02.701 --> 03:14:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I've never done the beach thing.</v>

7015
03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:05.790
