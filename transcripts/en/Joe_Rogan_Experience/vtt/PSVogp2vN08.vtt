<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you'd call it a no.</v>

3
00:00:03.171 --> 00:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Tropic nootropic.</v>

4
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.643
<v Speaker 1>How do you say it?</v>

5
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Nutropenia Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.404
<v Speaker 1>new tropics.</v>

7
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It does say on the thing,</v>

8
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:09.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>helps focus and I have to agree.</v>

10
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>

11
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>You try this new tropic formula that we've come out with.</v>

12
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.321
<v Speaker 1>We're a,</v>

13
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>we're finalizing it and they'd just finished the formula that this guy,</v>

14
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:20.311
<v Speaker 1>Chris Markus,</v>

15
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>have you tried any of it?</v>

16
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>You've been trying to,</v>

17
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with my supply.</v>

18
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

19
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>this shit gives you the most fucked up,</v>

20
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>vivid dreams.</v>

21
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.433
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

22
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you some last night.</v>

23
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.343
<v Speaker 1>Here's my dream.</v>

24
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

25
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>the House that I grew up in,</v>

26
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Swartzman Negar lives in it,</v>

27
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the house I grew up in.</v>

28
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>It's some weird house that's on the rocks right in front of water that</v>

29
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>apparently is semi-public.</v>

30
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>So Arnold Schwarzenegger is living there now and he's like swimming around.</v>

31
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>But all these people are staring at him because of his situation.</v>

32
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And because you know it is scandal,</v>

33
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

34
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Not only is he not give a fuck,</v>

35
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>but he's in really good shape now in my dream.</v>

36
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 1>And he keeps wanting to pull his balls out and now he's,</v>

37
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>he pulled his balls out,</v>

38
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>but he puts his little bikini underwear on,</v>

39
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:08.461
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

40
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:08.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>like a Frenchman who would wear.</v>

42
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

43
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>and he pulls his ball somehow or another through the back of his underwear and</v>

44
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>there where his ass cheeks are and they're giant.</v>

45
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>These giant balls that he has hanging outside of his underwear by his asshole</v>

46
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>because somehow or another that big,</v>

47
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

48
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>he's an old man,</v>

49
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:32.211
<v Speaker 1>but he looks spectacular and he moves like with confidence and grace and dives</v>

50
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>into the water.</v>

51
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

52
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get my wife away from this motherfucker.</v>

53
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at this old crazy man.</v>

54
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just gonna fuck every woman within a,</v>

55
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>a mile radius.</v>

57
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

58
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>he has no,</v>

59
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>no inhibitions,</v>

60
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

61
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>no worries about it.</v>

62
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And all these people are watching him and there's a family that's sitting behind</v>

63
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>this rock and they're like,</v>

64
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:53.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:53.971
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

66
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>they're sitting there watching Arnold moving around swimming.</v>

67
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>It keeps taking his pants off.</v>

68
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>He keeps taking his bikini bottoms off and like washing.</v>

69
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.443
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

70
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.231
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

71
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>it's some crazy what,</v>

72
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

73
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Freud would have a fucking field day with this chair.</v>

75
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.261
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

76
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>what is this dream supposed to represent?</v>

77
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>am I terrified of Arnold Sports?</v>

79
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>And that would loved to have seen your face while dreaming and just like the</v>

80
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>little flinches and you're faced with it whether they were a violence or fear,</v>

81
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at it like this.</v>

82
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

83
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 1>they say one way to analyze dreams as you look at every part of a dream is a</v>

84
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>projection of some aspect of your life.</v>

85
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>So Arnold Schwarzenegger,</v>

86
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>isn't that your ed?</v>

87
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that your lower primal south?</v>

88
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of like that.</v>

89
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:37.691
<v Speaker 1>That would be that,</v>

90
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

91
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>that dry,</v>

92
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>that the sex drive,</v>

93
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>the like that drive the power drive.</v>

94
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So you're kind of vanity drive,</v>

95
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>looking at he's a bodybuilder that it's like the most vain thing you could</v>

97
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>possibly do.</v>

98
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>And then the public ocean,</v>

99
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:51.511
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

100
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>well the public ocean,</v>

101
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:53.251
<v Speaker 1>that's your,</v>

102
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>is that your public life is that you're doing the podcast and you kind of have</v>

104
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>like have all your shit in front of everyone on the planet.</v>

105
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.060
<v Speaker 1>And so you're seeing like a projection of your ed swimming through or reacting</v>

106
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:07.181
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

107
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:07.931
<v Speaker 1>like you're thinking,</v>

108
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about all sorts of negatives.</v>

109
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

110
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.170
<v Speaker 1>we talked about yesterday.</v>

111
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

112
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's me.</v>

113
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that represents me.</v>

114
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>I see where you're going with that.</v>

115
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:17.824
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

116
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>because what this guy represents to me now,</v>

117
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.310
<v Speaker 1>when I found out that he fucked his maid and his shot loads and it was made in</v>

118
00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:25.391
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

119
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>apparently he was doing it for a long time.</v>

120
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>What he represents to me is like this almost like unbridled hedonist that</v>

121
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the stakes of,</v>

122
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>of whatever fucked up thing that he does sexually.</v>

124
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Now he's the governor,</v>

125
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>he's a giant movie star,</v>

126
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>multimillionaire married to a Kennedy,</v>

127
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:44.981
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

128
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Shriver's.</v>

129
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>She's some sort of a Kennedy,</v>

130
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>He know into this respectable family,</v>

133
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>but yet banging maids,</v>

134
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>fucking all sorts of checks all over the planet.</v>

135
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he just never pulled it back,</v>

136
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

137
00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

138
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>that to me is amazing.</v>

139
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And what's,</v>

140
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.370
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it in,</v>

141
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>in my dream,</v>

142
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>he was just completely without,</v>

143
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>without remorse.</v>

144
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Within my dream.</v>

145
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>He was owning it.</v>

146
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.701
<v Speaker 1>In my dream,</v>

147
