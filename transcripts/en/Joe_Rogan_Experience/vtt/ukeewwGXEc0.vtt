1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll be all right.</v>

3
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm the book's called the disaster diaries,</v>

4
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>how I learned to stop worrying and love the apocalypse and uh,</v>

5
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>it's really fucking interesting stuff man.</v>

6
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:10.411
<v Speaker 1>And you went,</v>

7
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>you went really deep with this.</v>

8
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>You covered so many aspects of the whole idea of survival and the whole idea of</v>

9
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:23.481
<v Speaker 1>like really chaos situations and controlling your adrenaline and relaxing and</v>

10
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:29.931
<v Speaker 1>how most people really have no idea that like when the shit hits the fan,</v>

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>most people are just literally going to like shut off.</v>

12
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>They're going to shit their pants and shut off.</v>

14
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>And that is a much more common reaction than not.</v>

15
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.183
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

16
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 2>So interesting to see that.</v>

18
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:42.554
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

19
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't know what they don't know.</v>

21
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:45.651
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

22
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

23
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.761
<v Speaker 2>that was kind of.</v>

24
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 2>So one of the major,</v>

25
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

26
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 2>sort of things I took from this book was what stress does,</v>

27
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 2>you and I know you've been in the fight game for a long time and I've written</v>

29
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 2>about the fighter's mind and stuff and I was shocked at how,</v>

30
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.860
<v Speaker 2>the Cooper's color code wasn't talked about in the fight game.</v>

32
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:04.431
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

33
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:04.851
<v Speaker 2>Which you know,</v>

34
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a shooting thing.</v>

35
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Explain the Cooper school,</v>

36
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 2>consumed the book,</v>

37
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 2>the Cooper's color code,</v>

38
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 2>which anybody who does any shooting will know about but,</v>

39
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically Jeff Cooper was a very well known farms instructor in the</v>

40
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:20.951
<v Speaker 2>sixties and he came up with this color code about your sort of alertness level</v>

41
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

42
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.761
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>

43
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>you're at home kind of off or listening to music or watching TV and then yellow</v>

44
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 2>you're on the street and a orange or you know,</v>

45
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 2>you sort of seeing maybe possible danger and then read you're fighting.</v>

46
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 2>And that was how he sort of quantified it.</v>

47
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:38.630
<v Speaker 2>And then the Marine Corps later come up with black,</v>

48
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 2>which was the catastrophic failure of your mind basically.</v>

49
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Like the total breakdown.</v>

50
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 2>And it was just so interesting to sort of,</v>

51
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

52
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I've been hearing about this anecdotally and I'd seen it with fighters,</v>

53
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

54
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 2>guys freezing,</v>

56
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 2>just doing dumb shit over and over again,</v>

57
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.931
<v Speaker 2>it's not working,</v>

59
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:59.480
<v Speaker 2>but they can't stop and they're getting punched in the face.</v>

60
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 2>So that's definitely not helping them here.</v>

61
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.643
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

62
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 2>the fact that,</v>

63
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

64
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure some of these trainers knew about it,</v>

65
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 2>but nobody had mentioned,</v>

66
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

67
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>there's this huge raft of data and research that's been done on,</v>

68
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

69
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 2>on stress and what it does to your body.</v>

70
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

71
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.221
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

72
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:16.581
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really being utilized in the fight game,</v>

74
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>but you had Kimbo in fucking side control.</v>

75
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>You work to get it.</v>

76
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:23.821
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

77
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>You were in a dominant position.</v>

78
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>He was tired and they</v>

79
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.510
<v Speaker 2>could you back up bitches.</v>

80
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 2>We did a video interview,</v>

81
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 2>everyone's on the other line.</v>

83
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I've just finished training.</v>

84
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:41.441
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on the phone and one no one was asking me any questions and I thought,</v>

85
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:41.871
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

86
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm just the Guy Kimball to be so.</v>

87
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>

88
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 2>someone asked a question,</v>

89
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 2>they said this is how he was holding the phone,</v>

90
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 2>the Asco,</v>

91
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.600
<v Speaker 2>each of the questions that I,</v>

92
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

93
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

94
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

95
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I did emphasis there just in case you couldn't visualize it.</v>

96
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 2>And they said to him,</v>

97
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 2>what would you do with James Thompson one?</v>

98
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

99
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 3>I'd hung myself.</v>

100
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.923
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

101
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

102
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.780
<v Speaker 1>that's the dumbest motherfucker in the history of MMA productions.</v>

103
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.161
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

104
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:13.350
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you have one guy,</v>

105
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>that's the most important thing,</v>

106
00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:14.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Banked everything on him winning.</v>

108
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>So stupid eggs,</v>

109
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.233
<v Speaker 1>buses.</v>

110
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>If you kicked that guy's ass,</v>

111
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>it would have been awesome if they left you in side control a little bit.</v>

112
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>An awesome.</v>

113
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Just like it was awesome for him when he won,</v>

114
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it would have been awesome for you.</v>

115
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>

116
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.010
<v Speaker 1>you gotta let the Guy who's supposed to win win win.</v>

117
00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fights where the referee errs on the side of caution and</v>

118
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>protects the fighter.</v>

119
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And in a case like yours,</v>

120
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you were denied an opportunity because of that,</v>

121
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:43.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

122
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

124
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.500
<v Speaker 3>what I was saying before,</v>

125
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:47.850
<v Speaker 3>so I started fumbling,</v>

126
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.240
<v Speaker 3>but the guy I was backstage and it just happened and I'm Gary Shaw.</v>

127
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Some fucking.</v>

128
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Carla though.</v>

130
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>They call them scholar.</v>

131
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.370
<v Speaker 1>What seems like a nice guy with a fucking.</v>

132
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.870
<v Speaker 3>What was the dollar sign?</v>

133
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Fucking.</v>

134
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.690
<v Speaker 1>It was a chain of dark side chain.</v>

136
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.960
<v Speaker 1>A Scala.</v>

137
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.393
<v Speaker 1>It's clever.</v>

139
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Well he grew up with the rich dad and he,</v>

141
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting way to live your life,</v>

143
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>but he came up to me and he said,</v>

144
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go to the hospital.</v>

145
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.700
<v Speaker 1>You've got to the hospital now.</v>

146
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I know you got to go to the hospital.</v>

147
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

149
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 3>I turned to him and I said,</v>

150
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.674
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

151
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.303
<v Speaker 3>I said Y'all,</v>

152
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.780
<v Speaker 3>but it turned away or you know,</v>

153
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 3>because there was a lot going on.</v>

154
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.253
<v Speaker 3>So he didn't hear me.</v>

155
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 3>Then he turned back and went,</v>

156
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.770
<v Speaker 3>you have to go to the hospital now I'm taking you now and I'm,</v>

157
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.610
<v Speaker 3>you really want me to go to the hospital right?</v>

158
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.503
<v Speaker 3>Too much.</v>

159
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.810
<v Speaker 3>So then I went to the press conference instead and as I walked into the patch</v>

160
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.663
<v Speaker 3>conference,</v>

161
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.593
<v Speaker 3>go shoulders going,</v>

162
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 3>we've just have to take James Thompson to the hospital,</v>

163
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.113
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

164
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.513
<v Speaker 1>breathing,</v>

165
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.520
<v Speaker 1>someone caught into it and I was drinking a drink and I think some say,</v>

166
00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:02.354
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

167
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>here's the legit issue for real.</v>

168
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>A woman like Jodie foster can come out of the closet and still play someone's</v>

169
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:08.734
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

170
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.663
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

171
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>No one has a problem with it.</v>

172
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>If Tom Cruise,</v>

173
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying Tom Cruise's gay,</v>

174
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 1>but if Tom Cruise was gay and he came out of the closet and um,</v>

175
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.170
<v Speaker 1>then wanted to do a movie where he was making out with the chairs over,</v>

176
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:22.004
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

177
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

178
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>that's reality.</v>

179
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

180
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

181
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

182
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

183
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say it's reality because I'm basing it on my own personal feelings</v>

184
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>of how it would go down.</v>

185
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>It might go down differently,</v>

186
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:39.301
<v Speaker 1>but I think that the people that do polling for politicians and stuff like that,</v>

187
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:40.444
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

188
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>you'd be amazed at how irrational voters are.</v>

189
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.810
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

190
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

191
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>how finding out.</v>

192
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>One little thing about somebody's past can really sway an election.</v>

193
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>So people are very,</v>

194
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.921
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

196
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:53.540
<v Speaker 1>people are pretty conservative in their ideologies.</v>

197
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be an issue when you're women that are out.</v>

198
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like we don't really have that much of a problem with us is not.</v>

199
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>There's no like there's going to trace trace and I really think it's Ah,</v>

200
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.300
<v Speaker 1>you're bumping muffs and you're making out a neediness to cock</v>

201
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.560
<v Speaker 1>nude.</v>

202
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>So there's also the stigma of disease and all that.</v>

204
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>So that comes with it too,</v>

205
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

206
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.503
<v Speaker 1>With the gay side,</v>

207
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>what if they're just in a jerking off each other?</v>

208
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.170
<v Speaker 1>It's completely different.</v>

209
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 1>That's staring each other in the eye.</v>

210
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:25.510
<v Speaker 1>They look away.</v>

211
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.343
<v Speaker 1>I'll look it away.</v>

212
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 1>What are you worried about for a second as a goof?</v>

213
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna jerk it off.</v>

214
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I've been shaving around my dick because they say it makes my dick look bigger,</v>

215
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not convinced.</v>

216
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Can you give me an opinion?</v>

217
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be objective here.</v>

218
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Let me give it a look.</v>

219
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.501
<v Speaker 1>I'd give it a look.</v>

220
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it looks good.</v>

221
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.190
<v Speaker 1>That looks a lot bigger.</v>

222
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you it doesn't look.</v>

223
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Can I be honest with you?</v>

224
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even live there.</v>

225
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>You can choke you with this.</v>

226
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.660
<v Speaker 1>You look like you should have a hole right now.</v>

227
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm just suck it and it wouldn't even feel bad.</v>

228
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 1>It would just go all the way in your mouth.</v>

229
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:56.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

230
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I bet would even try to right now.</v>

231
00:06:57.921 --> 00:06:59.470
<v Speaker 1>But when they to go out,</v>

232
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.541
<v Speaker 1>you mean you don't know?</v>

233
00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:01.374
<v Speaker 1>You could feel it.</v>

234
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.940
<v Speaker 1>We need to try.</v>

235
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.830
<v Speaker 1>You need to do another Mikey and Tony in the base.</v>

236
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 1>What was the characters names to remember?</v>

237
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm Mikey.</v>

238
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>One of them was Mikey.</v>

239
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.440
<v Speaker 1>It was the mom.</v>

240
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.991
<v Speaker 1>Who is Kelly?</v>

241
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Kirsten.</v>

242
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 1>She was great when</v>

243
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.260
<v Speaker 4>I was involved in boxing.</v>

244
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Some of the best fights I ever saw were in the gym.</v>

245
00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:19.254
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
