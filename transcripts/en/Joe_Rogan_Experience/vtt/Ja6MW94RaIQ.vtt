00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.450
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience and the Olympic Games,</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:04.891
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

3
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:07.360
<v Speaker 1>the event that probably requires more.</v>

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Transfer of energy and development of kinetic energy than any other,</v>

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch you could name,</v>

7
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:15.741
<v Speaker 1>but one of them.</v>

8
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:16.011
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

9
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>it's always going to be the,</v>

10
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>the javelin throw the javelin throw involves a full pallet sprint,</v>

11
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.043
<v Speaker 1>a jump,</v>

12
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>a massive explosive tuning of both hips and shoulders and a throw.</v>

13
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>All the quintessential explosive elements of the human body are involved in the</v>

14
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:36.854
<v Speaker 1>javelins room,</v>

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 1>probably to a greater degree than any other Olympic event.</v>

16
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.111
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>

17
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>people can throw a javelin 80 90 meters.</v>

18
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if you took those same javelin throwers and made them perform</v>

19
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>the same event on the knees?</v>

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be so good.</v>

21
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.110
<v Speaker 1>They probably couldn't throw it more than 10 meters.</v>

22
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.131
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

23
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:00.941
<v Speaker 1>and what's changed?</v>

24
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>The closer they get to the ground,</v>

25
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>the less they can employ explosive force.</v>

26
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>What's the first thing cowboys do when they go to Brian to steer?</v>

27
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Take it down.</v>

28
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.921
<v Speaker 1>They lock up.</v>

30
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the legs and they put it down on the ground.</v>

31
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Nobody tries to brand as standing still.</v>

32
00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get killed because it can employ explosive dynamic movement to</v>

33
00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:22.474
<v Speaker 1>hurt you.</v>

34
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>You put them on the ground.</v>

35
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Dynamic explosive movement is massively curtailed.</v>

36
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It takes away the single riskiest element of fighting,</v>

37
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>which is quick dynamic movement that can generate kinetic energy.</v>

38
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>So step number one,</v>

39
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>it was going to do it so it was get it to the ground.</v>

40
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>It's inherently safer.</v>

41
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Less things can go catastrophic.</v>

42
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:45.250
<v Speaker 1>We wrong on the ground and in the standing position.</v>

43
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>What step number two?</v>

44
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.781
<v Speaker 1>Secure.</v>

45
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Dominant position control.</v>

46
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.711
<v Speaker 1>Control.</v>

47
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Too vague.</v>

48
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.690
<v Speaker 1>There's many ways to control people.</v>

49
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a definite step.</v>

50
00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:58.000
<v Speaker 1>You've just taken a guy down.</v>

51
00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.080
<v Speaker 1>What's your first thing and was on units?</v>

52
00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

53
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing I would try to do is get to a dominant position.</v>

54
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.771
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>

55
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Being by just pass to side control.</v>

56
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Try to match it.</v>

57
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.001
<v Speaker 1>You just answered it right.</v>

58
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:09.834
<v Speaker 1>Then get pastas,</v>

59
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.703
<v Speaker 1>legs,</v>

60
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.703
<v Speaker 1>passes legs.</v>

61
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.713
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

62
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>It's legs are strong.</v>

63
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I carry you around.</v>

64
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>You could hold a person in position.</v>

65
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

66
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>they're very good defensively.</v>

67
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.803
<v Speaker 1>They dangerous.</v>

68
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.033
<v Speaker 1>Too dangerous.</v>

69
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>If I end up inside your legs,</v>

70
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.051
<v Speaker 1>if you're a skilled,</v>

71
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:25.471
<v Speaker 1>juicy play,</v>

72
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:26.221
<v Speaker 1>you can unlock me.</v>

73
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:26.911
<v Speaker 1>Can Lake Lock me,</v>

74
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>can strangle me even if you were an untrained,</v>

75
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:29.461
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

76
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:30.294
<v Speaker 1>you could up kick me.</v>

77
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Mania man has been knocked out by an upkick.</v>

79
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Even an untutored guy can pull it up,</v>

80
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>get sure lakes are dangerous.</v>

81
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>So step number two is get pasta.</v>

82
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Those dangerous lakes.</v>

83
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>What state number three?</v>

84
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Go for submission.</v>

85
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.663
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

86
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>he must be a 10th planet belt.</v>

87
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

88
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I hate to throw that in some rigid.</v>

89
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

90
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm um,</v>

91
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

92
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things like it has to be regulated.</v>

93
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>It has to be protected and it has to be guaranteed as a thing for human beings.</v>

94
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Not even just Americans.</v>

95
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.821
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

96
00:03:01.821 --> 00:03:02.181
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

97
00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:07.181
<v Speaker 3>it's stunning to me how many people are against the idea of having an open</v>

98
00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:08.414
<v Speaker 3>internet.</v>

99
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

100
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.371
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

101
00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:10.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

102
00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:11.480
<v Speaker 4>most of the polling,</v>

103
00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:13.040
<v Speaker 4>I think polls are always,</v>

104
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:13.761
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be careful,</v>

105
00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:14.001
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

106
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Because they can ask a question one way and get an answer.</v>

107
00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:20.600
<v Speaker 4>But the best one done was right before our boat by the University of Maryland,</v>

108
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.670
<v Speaker 4>found 83% of the public supported net neutrality opposed what we were doing.</v>

109
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.890
<v Speaker 1>But who are those 17% dummies?</v>

110
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to know.</v>

111
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I think anything you can get the American public to agree to at 83% is a pretty,</v>

112
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wonderful but I'm stunned [inaudible] 17% yeah,</v>

113
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.803
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

114
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.250
<v Speaker 1>But isn't there a bunch of people?</v>

115
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.613
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>

116
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

117
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I wrote about this on Twitter recently without judgment.</v>

118
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I said that net neutrality seems to me to be one of those ideological issues</v>

119
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.663
<v Speaker 3>where um,</v>

120
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the right you support it or if you're on the left rather you</v>

121
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 3>support it where you're on the right,</v>

122
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.290
<v Speaker 1>you would like it to go away.</v>

123
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 1>So almost like totally disagree with,</v>

124
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

125
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.910
<v Speaker 1>please do.</v>

126
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.010
<v Speaker 1>If you are</v>

127
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 4>a democrat or a Republican,</v>

128
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:08.190
<v Speaker 4>you benefit from net neutrality and internet openness.</v>

129
00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Speaker 4>If you're conservative or liberal.</v>

130
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.090
<v Speaker 4>If you're a big business or a small business,</v>

131
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 4>you benefit from Internet openness.</v>

132
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.110
<v Speaker 4>And the history of net neutrality is something that doesn't get discussed</v>

133
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:19.944
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

134
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 4>which is that it began the first time the FCC put net neutrality policy on</v>

135
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:25.530
<v Speaker 4>paper.</v>

136
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.530
<v Speaker 4>It was 2005 and I'm old enough to remember that that was when President George</v>

137
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.380
<v Speaker 4>W.</v>

138
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 4>Bush was in the White House.</v>

139
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.563
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

140
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 4>this country's first net neutrality policies were put on paper one a republican</v>

141
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 4>was running the FCC.</v>

142
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 4>It is only in recent days.</v>

143
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.070
<v Speaker 4>We have characterize this as a left right issue and I think that's a</v>

144
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally a mistake.</v>

145
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.330
<v Speaker 4>How did it happen like when when Ajit Pi proposes legislation and passed it,</v>

146
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>it baffled me.</v>

147
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I thought net neutrality was a thing we had all agreed on.</v>

148
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.221
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

149
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>we're never touching this.</v>

150
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>How did this happen?</v>

151
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

152
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

153
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

154
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 4>through a whole bunch of boring Washington</v>

155
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.100
<v Speaker 1>seizures whereby they circulate out of proposed rulemaking or how did,</v>

156
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 1>how did he get the power and leverage to pass this?</v>

157
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.920
<v Speaker 4>I think that he was supported by people in Washington,</v>

158
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 4>including some broadband providers and was led to believe that with deregulation</v>

159
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.480
<v Speaker 4>we would all be better off</v>

160
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 3>being away from race car driving.</v>

161
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 3>When you deciding at just like enough is enough,</v>

162
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 3>do you think that in some ways that this is,</v>

163
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 3>you appreciating other aspects of life too that you,</v>

164
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

165
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at your racing thing and you're like,</v>

166
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

167
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot,</v>

168
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I did enough and then why don't I just appreciate all the other stuff?</v>

169
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good question.</v>

171
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:53.820
<v Speaker 1>A lead to me into a good thought.</v>

172
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

173
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.163
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

174
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually more</v>

175
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 5>being honest.</v>

176
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 5>Like I think everyone would expect since I do what I do at the level that I do</v>

177
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:04.821
<v Speaker 5>it at,</v>

178
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 5>the racing is my only thing I care about.</v>

179
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:07.881
<v Speaker 5>I love it so much.</v>

180
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 5>I'll do anything I drive every day.</v>

181
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 5>And the truth is no,</v>

182
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.411
<v Speaker 5>I like racing,</v>

183
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 5>but I don't,</v>

184
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of things I don't really like about it too and I'm grateful for</v>

185
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 5>everything it's given me.</v>

186
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 5>But if you were to ask me what I do outside of racing and my personal life,</v>

187
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't go to the race track.</v>

188
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't really watch races.</v>

189
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.374
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

190
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.191
<v Speaker 5>I don't do that.</v>

191
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 5>So those aren't my hobbies.</v>

192
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 5>Like your hobbies or your real loves,</v>

193
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 5>what do you not like about it?</v>

194
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.383
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

195
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 5>well I would say that in the last year or so,</v>

196
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

197
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.823
<v Speaker 5>just the,</v>

198
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 5>as far as an energetic space,</v>

199
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 5>it's just so sad and negative at t a lot of the time.</v>

200
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 5>And even in just racing in general,</v>

201
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 5>most of the time it's miserable.</v>

202
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 5>Like you'd have some days that are good,</v>

203
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 5>but most of the time it's not happy and you wish there was,</v>

204
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:51.371
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

205
00:06:51.371 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

206
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.240
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

207
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 5>you're on.</v>

208
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 5>You're not satisfied.</v>

209
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 5>You wish somebody would have treated you better out there.</v>

210
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

211
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 5>there's so many things to be negative about and just the grind of it.</v>

212
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

213
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.120
<v Speaker 5>it's the people like everybody's worn out and you know,</v>

214
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 5>you have to be really careful about the people that are around you because</v>

215
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 5>they've got to be in a good mood because it's easy to spiral out of control</v>

216
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 5>because you see each other for three,</v>

217
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:15.921
<v Speaker 5>four days a week,</v>

218
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 5>every week for 40 weeks a year.</v>

219
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

220
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

221
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 5>you gotta be in a good space with people,</v>

222
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 5>but it still doesn't alienate you completely.</v>

223
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Even if there,</v>

224
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 5>you're in a good space with people that the ones next to you,</v>

225
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 5>cause you got a car next to you on both sides in the garage and haulers next to</v>

226
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 5>each other and buses right next to each other and you see a bunch of other</v>

227
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

228
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

229
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.351
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

230
00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

231
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.361
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

232
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of negativity to some degree.</v>

233
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

234
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 5>a lot of grind.</v>

235
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 5>It just kind of feels like the grind a little bit.</v>

236
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.373
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

237
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

238
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 5>so I just kind of felt like it wasn't a space that I wanted to be in as much</v>

239
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:47.841
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

240
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:47.991
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

241
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:48.790
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

242
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.310
<v Speaker 5>I want to be in a happy space where I'm just doing things that bring me joy.</v>

243
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

244
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

245
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Speaker 5>it just,</v>

246
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 5>there wasn't doing that as much or I was noticing it,</v>

247
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 5>I was noticing I was missing that or wanting it more.</v>

248
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 5>I think that's really what it comes from is growing as a person and realizing,</v>

249
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.413
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

250
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody's afraid to take chances and do something new in their life</v>

251
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 5>because they're identified a certain way or there'll be judged if they don't do</v>

252
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 5>it or judged if they do something different and who are they now and are they</v>

253
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 5>crazy and what are they thinking?</v>

254
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

255
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 5>it's just life.</v>

256
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 5>Just do things that make you happy.</v>

257
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 6>In his case,</v>

258
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 6>his kidneys were in trouble and his heart was in trouble.</v>

259
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 6>And the cells,</v>

260
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.893
<v Speaker 6>they don't,</v>

261
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 6>unlike what we used to think in the early days,</v>

262
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:33.890
<v Speaker 6>they don't become anything.</v>

263
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 6>These kinds of,</v>

264
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 6>this kind of stem cell does not become anything in your body,</v>

265
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.220
<v Speaker 6>but at home,</v>

266
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.220
<v Speaker 6>areas of that need repair and it secretes things that stimulates the repair and</v>

267
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 6>decrease the inflammation and helps out with the immune system.</v>

268
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 6>So the vast majority of what we treat or autoimmune diseases.</v>

269
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.933
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

270
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.511
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

271
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 6>in Hud's case,</v>

272
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 6>we gave him ivs so that,</v>

273
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 6>that he could basically have these</v>

274
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.050
<v Speaker 1>things on board.</v>

275
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.670
<v Speaker 1>So creating the,</v>

276
00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:00.700
<v Speaker 1>the secreting the cytokines and the,</v>

277
00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>and the growth factors that are normally secreted.</v>

278
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>And when you're 92 and you have multiorgan failure,</v>

279
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>you're basically running on fumes.</v>

280
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 1>And so you put these days zero young healthy cells and they secrete these things</v>

281
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>that kind of restarts everything.</v>

282
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And so what was his response to this Ivy Treatment?</v>

284
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

285
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

286
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

287
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

289
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

290
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I can wax lyrical about that.</v>

291
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>He's almost a hundred years old and,</v>

292
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>from pretty bad shape.</v>

294
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>It was like bee stings.</v>

295
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It was like he got a new lease of life.</v>

296
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Like he got a big dose locally in the hip,</v>

297
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>which a fixed all his inflammation and pain.</v>

298
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And he started walking again,</v>

299
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and his kidneys were good.</v>

300
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And his heart,</v>

301
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 1>he had a prolapse valves in there and they healed.</v>

302
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:45.901
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

303
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:46.734
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

304
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.461
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

305
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.294
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

306
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 1>cognitive powers improved.</v>

307
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>His eyesight improved.</v>

308
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.703
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

309
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

310
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.910
<v Speaker 1>and other stuff improved that I ate.</v>

311
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.130
<v Speaker 1>He would hate me to talk about it,</v>

312
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 1>but he had two nurses that reported to me and it was like,</v>

313
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:03.990
<v Speaker 1>holy mackerel,</v>

314
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>that's using it as a towel rack,</v>

315
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.513
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

316
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
