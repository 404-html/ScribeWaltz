00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.450

<v Speaker 1>It really started with like,</v>

11
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.284
<v Speaker 1>what's the dumbest thing we could call a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show your mom's house talking about </v>

<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>

16
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>It is like it's how Tom and I normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and then we just put microphones.</v>

17
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid farts and I don't know.</v>

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I feel like too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we,</v>

20
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we serve a demographic like,</v>

21
00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:58.891
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

22
00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.724
<v Speaker 1>I was at the rite aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to go use the toilet and </v>

23
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>this guy stocking the shelves goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina p.</v>

24
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

25
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

26
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mommy and this is fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>

27
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.823
<v Speaker 1>these are the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are stocking shit and </v>

28
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>driving the trucks and like sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cubicles and these days,</v>

29
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the podcasting world of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are doing other stuff.</v>

30
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

31
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not like watching a show,</v>

32
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>like if you're watching a show for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most part,</v>

33
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting down and watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you like listening to a podcast,</v>

34
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>you're doing other stuff of cleaning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

35
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:32.814
<v Speaker 1>doing whatever and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing and you guys put up fucking </v>

36
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>around those as well.</v>

37
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Like how much of your show is video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what percentage of your audience.</v>

38
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>

39
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Video stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

40
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:44.664
<v Speaker 1>Who Watches Youtube stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the difference between like </v>

41
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>the Youtube bonds versus the audio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's smaller,</v>

42
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audio is the hardcores and then.</v>

43
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And then interesting videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondary.</v>

44
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people would have thought,</v>

45
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like videos always going to be seeing it</v>

46
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>as better because it's an added element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.804
<v Speaker 1>But I have a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because our show we play like a </v>

48
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:03.354
<v Speaker 1>porno clips in the towns and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not appropriate for the </v>

49
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:07.464
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got youtube on your </v>

50
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>earplugs at your state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your speakers or whatever,</v>

51
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>and then it's all fuck me and then fired</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your job.</v>

52
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Her God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe Tommy met her.</v>

53
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.713
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like texting him like don't </v>

54
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.144
<v Speaker 1>forget your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a child with me like you would </v>

55
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

56
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

57
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

58
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the craziest part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

59
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>it's been a great show and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:41.454
<v Speaker 1>we have you to thank because you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that told us to start it until </v>

61
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>everybody started though back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

62
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>But you got to do a podcast to do 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

63
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>But luckily 50 of them listened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God 30 probably.</v>

64
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.773
<v Speaker 1>But some of them are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some really good podcasts that </v>

65
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>have come out</v>

66
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 2>of my stupid stone suggestions.</v>

67
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the great motivator.</v>

68
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.803
<v Speaker 1>The great challenger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great beginner of fat shaming </v>

69
00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 1>campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

70
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.783
<v Speaker 1>I can't take credit for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fat shame was all Bert and tom </v>

71
00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:14.820
<v Speaker 1>talking shit to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't put that.</v>

72
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.570
<v Speaker 1>But then you came up with the idea to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the challenge.</v>

73
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.240
<v Speaker 1>The challenge.</v>

74
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weight loss contest.</v>

75
00:03:19.381 --> 00:03:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Well we sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried to figure out what to do,</v>

76
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 2>which we should have like something fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of.</v>

77
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.053
<v Speaker 2>Because there's also an issue that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on like it's going on right now </v>

78
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:28.584
<v Speaker 2>with Ari and it was going on with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people on the outside think it's </v>

79
00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 2>serious and this is probably a good time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to address this.</v>

80
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Like people on the outside of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were actually mad at Ari.</v>

81
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Ari is actually like not good for his </v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

82
00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

83
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.880
<v Speaker 2>these are jokes folks were fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

84
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.043
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is all just and so all you </v>

85
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:53.040
<v Speaker 2>people that take it seriously don't take</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything unless we say this is serious.</v>

86
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.023
<v Speaker 2>Don't take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all that bird is fat thomas fats </v>

87
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

88
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.290
<v Speaker 2>we were having a great time with it.</v>

89
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 2>They were having fun with it and the Ra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a welter stuff.</v>

90
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:02.160
<v Speaker 2>That stuff is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

91
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:02.994
<v Speaker 2>Red is like for real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most honest guys I've ever </v>

92
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:07.224
<v Speaker 2>met in my life and for sure he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about paying for those guys to </v>

93
00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:11.664
<v Speaker 2>go to fucking Europe for a soccer game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean he wouldn't have </v>

94
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.963
<v Speaker 2>honored this bet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it got complicated because I </v>

95
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 2>paid for the bat and I sent those guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a basketball game.</v>

96
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 2>What was the game again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cavs warriors.</v>

97
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Is that a big game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

98
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:24.811
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

99
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:26.190
<v Speaker 2>At the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

100
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Do you get it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I get it?</v>

101
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Go to a basketball game.</v>

102
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>The most boring thing in the world for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

103
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.263
<v Speaker 1>watched some guys throw a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Players in the world are in those two </v>

104
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:35.814
<v Speaker 1>teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they do really good at throwing the </v>

105
00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:39.900
<v Speaker 1>ball in the hole?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

106
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do you like sports at all?</v>

107
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought for sure not football.</v>

108
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.790
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get so bored.</v>

109
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.133
<v Speaker 1>Bored the shit out of me too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Tom's been trying to explain this </v>

110
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:54.230
<v Speaker 1>shit to me for years and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

111
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:54.961
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:55.794
<v Speaker 1>They run five seconds and then the start</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then and then comes the show after </v>

113
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 1>the show or the four white guys talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fucking game.</v>

114
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:02.664
<v Speaker 1>They just watched for two more hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the stupid jokes that fucking </v>

115
00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>white guys that do the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary in there.</v>

116
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>The worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't find funnier.</v>

117
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>People that skip bayless kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his name,</v>

118
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.510
<v Speaker 1>but could you imagine being stuck on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane with that guy right now?</v>

119
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 1>He just keeps talking to you with shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

120
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

121
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't talk shit.</v>

122
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible person.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I like?</v>

126
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.230

<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>

127
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.093
<v Speaker 1>I watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched professional pool hunting </v>

128
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>shows like my wife comes home and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at our dvr.</v>

129
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

130
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 2>This is the dvr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kickboxing,</v>

131
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 2>MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bow hunting,</v>

132
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bow hunting,</v>

133
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 2>bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

134
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 2>like a real crime stories like what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck is wrong with you?</v>

135
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Like murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing,</v>

136
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punching,</v>

137
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like most of it though is </v>

138
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so obsessed with hunting.</v>

139
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Most of my dvr is like these bowhunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that's your jam.</v>

140
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:09.254
<v Speaker 1>So that's your hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Are you watching it for tips and </v>

141
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>figure out what to do in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

142
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>which seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like would just shoot the animal.</v>

143
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get near it.</v>

144
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

145
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things on the outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like very simple,</v>

146
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>but on the inside it's very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how everything.</v>

147
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like surfing,</v>

148
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>that's super easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

149
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>it was like the hardest fucking thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to learn to do.</v>

150
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen an indoor one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

151
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.620
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these indoor ones.</v>

152
00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:36.240
<v Speaker 1>They have a woman,</v>

153
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Austin Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get on a surfboard and you,</v>

154
00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:41.790
<v Speaker 2>you can go on it for like 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they say.</v>

155
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.930
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing way to get good because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to wait for waves.</v>

156
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this huge pool.</v>

157
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.860
<v Speaker 1>You get in there with a surfboard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you surf like fucking crazy and you just</v>

158
00:06:52.861 --> 00:06:55.020
<v Speaker 1>keep doing it and you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>paddle.</v>

159
00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:55.854
<v Speaker 1>Paddle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paddle out turned the fucking board </v>

160
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:57.974
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

161
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also your whole.</v>

162
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.210
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine you're developing those </v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilizer muscles,</v>

163
00:07:03.211 --> 00:07:04.044
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was talking to guys that have </v>

164
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.380
<v Speaker 2>looked at that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

165
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.070
<v Speaker 2>you just surf around and you get used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like balancing.</v>

166
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 2>So this would be a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that guy.</v>

167
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding buddy.</v>

168
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his face is.</v>

169
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.500
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a good way to develop all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

170
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.463
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize when you start doing yoga is </v>

171
00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 2>that there's all these weird muscles </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you didn't know that were weak,</v>

172
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.080
<v Speaker 2>like these weird stabilizer muscles in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your feet.</v>

173
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Like the number one thing that bothered </v>
<v Speaker 2>me when I first started doing yoga is my</v>

174
00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:39.240
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My feet would give out before anything.</v>

175
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so weird.</v>

176
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.930
<v Speaker 2>They would just give out your ankles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean?</v>

177
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.783
<v Speaker 2>Oh my feet like the heel because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing on one foot and you're </v>

178
00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:49.080
<v Speaker 2>balancing so your foot has to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like do all this,</v>

179
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

180
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.740
<v Speaker 2>like adjusting and while that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening they're like,</v>

181
00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:53.574
<v Speaker 2>my foot's getting fatigued,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the arch of my foot starts hurting </v>

182
00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:56.670
<v Speaker 2>and I have to put it down.</v>

183
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.013
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

184
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.570
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me a long time to get past that.</v>

185
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now were you a huge fan of hot yoga </v>

186
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:06.700
<v Speaker 1>before you came up with this challenge?</v>

187
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it for a few years now.</v>

188
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty seriously for two years.</v>

189
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I did it on and off for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years before that,</v>

190
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:18.810
<v Speaker 2>but I got real serious about two years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and two months ago.</v>

191
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I just started doing it every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

192
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:24.550
<v Speaker 2>What's the benefit of the heat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cold heat shock proteins.</v>

193
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this hasn't been proven,</v>

194
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:28.174
<v Speaker 2>but there's the study they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I think at Harvard about this </v>

195
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.114
<v Speaker 2>because it's been proven that sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a woman that I have on the </v>

196
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:36.160
<v Speaker 2>podcast all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's brilliant.</v>

197
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Her name is Dr Rhonda Patrick and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of my favorite people and her,</v>

198
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:43.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's done a bunch of work on Saunas.</v>

199
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:44.344
<v Speaker 2>She's kind of obsessed with cryotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold shock proteins and heat shock </v>

200
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:50.860
<v Speaker 2>proteins and your body has a response to</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme heat,</v>

201
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.760
<v Speaker 2>extreme cold by producing these anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory.</v>

202
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 2>And when you go into a hot sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's four times a week if you </v>

203
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:01.704
<v Speaker 2>could do it four times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it reduces mortality amongst all causes </v>

204
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:07.070
<v Speaker 2>by 40 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no shed,</v>

205
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 2>stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attack,</v>

206
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:08.874
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

207
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.923
<v Speaker 2>And it's because most of the issues that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have health wise stem from </v>

208
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and inflammation from </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

209
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.020
<v Speaker 2>poor diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all,</v>

210
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 2>you can mitigate a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation with sauna.</v>

211
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.913
<v Speaker 2>And I think yoga mimics the sauna </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it is so fucking hot in the </v>

212
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:28.171
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

213
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 2>The room is 105 degrees and then once </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start exercising,</v>

214
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.760
<v Speaker 2>your body is through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I am like,</v>

215
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.633
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times they're doing poses and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have my arm straight out and I'm </v>

216
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 2>watching water just poor out of my body </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the ground.</v>

217
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a shirt on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

218
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.220
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like it's coming out of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wet shirt.</v>

219
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just pouring off my body trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip,</v>

220
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:47.551
<v Speaker 2>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip,</v>

221
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:52.551
<v Speaker 2>just squeezing all the water out of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>body and I drink a large 64 ounce bottle</v>

222
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 2>of water with ice during the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

223
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 2>So in that 90 minute class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 64 ounces of water.</v>

224
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a tremendous amount of stress</v>

225
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:07.050
<v Speaker 2>on your body from that heat and from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>poses themselves.</v>

226
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.490
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

227
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.383
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the results of this study come back </v>

228
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.593
<v Speaker 2>because I think they're going to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a similar effect to like the </v>

229
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 2>anti inflammatory markers in the blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you see from sauna.</v>

230
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.100
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know.</v>

231
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:20.934
<v Speaker 2>That song is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can get a sauna like near your </v>

232
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:24.200
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why now?</v>

233
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking about this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

234
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 2>They them that you can install a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

235
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Like the new studio has a sauna.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

238
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on that.</v>

239
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 2>A primal diet had been done subsistence </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

240
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For like,</v>

241
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost a year now.</v>

242
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

243
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:44.364
<v Speaker 2>my trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd take,</v>

244
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.990
<v Speaker 2>she said it's the inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the inflammation,</v>

245
00:10:46.991 --> 00:10:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

246
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

247
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it from a woman once.</v>

248
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 2>She told me she's a trainer and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

249
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.353
<v Speaker 2>and she was talking to me about back </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues and issues that people have and </v>

250
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 2>she was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to sound really weird,</v>

251
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.673
<v Speaker 2>but one of the best ways that we figured</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to help people with back issues </v>

252
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.320
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to go on a gluten free diet.</v>

253
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.960
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

254
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.803
<v Speaker 2>This was a few years back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having some neck problems and she </v>

255
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 2>was almost like a gluten free diet.</v>

256
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.781
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

257
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:20.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gluten causes inflammation.</v>

258
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.690
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

259
00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:22.524
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like some new age hippie </v>

260
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:23.934
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

261
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.950
<v Speaker 2>So then I started looking into it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I realized like,</v>

262
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to this.</v>

263
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:27.841
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

264
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:28.674
<v Speaker 2>it's not just gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually refined carbohydrates and </v>

265
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:35.280
<v Speaker 2>refined sugars and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But gluten to,</v>

266
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

267
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.970
<v Speaker 2>maynard from tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 2>that dude and Keenan tool is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's awesome.</v>

269
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:42.414
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he also has his own vineyard and an </v>

270
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Speaker 2>a in a restaurant in Austria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever doing an Australia is a,</v>

271
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.013
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know until he told me it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>small restaurant that serves like small </v>

272
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>plates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like sorta like</v>

273
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Tapa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like a similar career path,</v>

274
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

275
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.583
<v Speaker 3>he has um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they serve pasta that is heirloom pasta </v>

276
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.241
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

277
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:04.961
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

278
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 3>we'll use heirloom wheat because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wheat that they used to sell,</v>

279
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.561
<v Speaker 3>like W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

280
00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:10.394
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people used to grow like way back </v>

281
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 3>in the early days was much more low </v>
<v Speaker 3>yield,</v>

282
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.813
<v Speaker 3>I'd say the same thing that people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>done to tomatoes and a lot of things by </v>

283
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 3>making them more robust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they did this to wheat,</v>

284
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.520
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made a much higher yield wheat.</v>

285
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 3>So if you have an acre of wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get much more wheat out of it.</v>

286
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 3>But it has much more complex gluten's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

287
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 3>And it's more difficult for your body to</v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

288
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.153
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that I noticed when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to Italy is I was eating pasta </v>

289
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:38.164
<v Speaker 3>over there and it didn't get me this </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible brick in my stomach feeling </v>

290
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.570
<v Speaker 3>like you want to die is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it different?</v>

291
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 3>And he was explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

292
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 3>your body is struggling to process this </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern gluten,</v>

293
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.400
<v Speaker 3>this modern wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he sells this stuff that's heirloom.</v>

294
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Just sorta like those ugly tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those delicious heirloom tomatoes.</v>

295
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>

296
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what a tomato used to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to be this like weird,</v>

297
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 3>funky looking but super delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost like a fruit.</v>

298
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't even eat pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had it in like a year.</v>

299
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

300
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 3>every now and then I have a nibble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thought of eating a bowl of it,</v>

301
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:17.280
<v Speaker 3>now it's repulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Empty.</v>

302
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.200
<v Speaker 3>There's no nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

303
00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just dog shit.</v>

304
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to turn to slop on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

305
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't like it.</v>

306
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to love it.</v>

307
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I eat it every now and then I'll still </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat it.</v>

308
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:29.794
<v Speaker 3>I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day I made sausage and put a </v>

309
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 3>pasta like I bought some of that Italian</v>
<v Speaker 3>pasta.</v>

310

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real deal.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You get it.</v>

312
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.800

<v Speaker 3>They have.</v>

313
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:42.634
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

314
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.940

<v Speaker 3>with the person?</v>

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he chills alone.</v>

380
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:55.184
<v Speaker 3>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes out in the yard swimming by </v>

381
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 3>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of hilarious.</v>

382
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.253
<v Speaker 3>Like the pools there and he just dives </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the water by himself and then as </v>

383
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:05.070
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

384
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.903
<v Speaker 3>what's really silly is as he's swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's paddling and he creates these </v>

385
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:12.790
<v Speaker 3>splashes and he tries to bite them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's splashed.</v>

386
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so silly.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

399
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.490
<v Speaker 3>People that don't like dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what don't you like about them?</v>

400
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 3>They're sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're loving and they're stoked to</v>

401
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:47.474
<v Speaker 3>see you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a weird thing though with </v>

402
00:16:48.921 --> 00:16:51.020
<v Speaker 3>people that only like dogs and don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like people,</v>

403
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.100
<v Speaker 3>so that's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

404
00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:54.740

406
00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 3>The person that's strictly dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you mean?</v>

407
00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:01.310
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

408
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.090
<v Speaker 3>that's fucked up therapy problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

409
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:05.924
<v Speaker 3>the next step is people judge people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's horse people in my neighborhood </v>

410
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:13.580
<v Speaker 3>or judge them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

411
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:15.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like horses.</v>

412
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to ride them.</v>

413
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they smell bad.</v>

414
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're pretty firm until the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Whitney.</v>

415
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

416
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I see her on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does.</v>

417
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.350
<v Speaker 3>She loves her horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

418
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 3>what do they love so much about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>horses when these crazy?</v>

419
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's very smart.</v>

420
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the smartest people I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever met,</v>

421
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.490
<v Speaker 3>but she's fucking insane in a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

422
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.383
<v Speaker 3>but like she has so much information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I talked to her have to </v>

423
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:37.960
<v Speaker 3>google something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

424
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.840
<v Speaker 3>What does she know about telling me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me?</v>

425
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

426
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.880
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she told me about weird violent sports I</v>

427
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know existed.</v>

428
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.613
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things she was telling me is </v>

429
00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:48.140
<v Speaker 3>why people have a fear of public </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking.</v>

430
00:17:48.141 --> 00:17:48.974
<v Speaker 3>This was something that she said the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last time she was on the podcast and I </v>

431
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 3>said why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

432
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:54.060
<v Speaker 3>because in the past when you spoke in </v>
<v Speaker 3>public,</v>

433
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 3>it was because you were trying to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>case for your survival.</v>

434
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

435
00:17:58.651 --> 00:17:59.484
<v Speaker 3>They were looking at you like you fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and there was a big group of people </v>

436
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:03.450
<v Speaker 3>judging you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

437
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.030
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

438
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I would think it's fear of alienation </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the pack.</v>

439
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Speaker 3>At the same reason people are afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

440
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.923
<v Speaker 3>It's because you don't want to lose your</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection to the tribe because it </v>

441
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:18.230
<v Speaker 3>separates you from the tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

442
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 3>as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you notice that when people get to</v>

443
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 3>be a certain level of success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some of them,</v>

444
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.283
<v Speaker 3>like some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them just stay cool and they </v>

445
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:27.900
<v Speaker 3>just hang no matter what.</v>

446
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.733
<v Speaker 3>Like Ron White,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ron Wyden has always just hanging out </v>

447
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.223
<v Speaker 3>and he's about as big as you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Ron Wyden is sold out fucking </v>

448
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.713
<v Speaker 3>arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

449
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hang with Ronnie,</v>

450
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.060
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

451
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

452
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.300
<v Speaker 3>drank gives you a hug and he's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

453
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.543
<v Speaker 3>But like some people they get insulated </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get weird and then they lose </v>

454
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 3>touch with everybody and then their </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy suffers.</v>

455
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well because you can't be removed from </v>

456
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 3>the world to talk about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't really work that way,</v>

457
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:54.830
<v Speaker 3>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

458
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.130
<v Speaker 3>but I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I don't know.</v>

459
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you stay normal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're super successful.</v>

460
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.740
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I do a lot of other shit,</v>

461
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:05.960
<v Speaker 3>like the yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

462
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I think doing yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like difficult,</v>

463
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 3>doing Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowhunting bond,</v>

464
00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the hardest things I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

465
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super difficult.</v>

466
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:15.474
<v Speaker 3>Super difficult to get accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super intense pressure on the line when </v>

467
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 3>you have to execute a shot and a living </v>
<v Speaker 3>creature and then you know,</v>

468
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.733
<v Speaker 3>just to get obsessed with the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>methodology behind it and all the </v>

469
00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:30.180
<v Speaker 3>technique and all the learning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying it and just.</v>

470
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.230
<v Speaker 3>I get obsessed with things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like doing things I suck at,</v>

471
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.110
<v Speaker 3>like yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowhunting and Jujitsu.</v>

472
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 3>You get more humble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

473
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 3>I slept less a Jujitsu that I do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things,</v>

474
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 3>but I still suck in comparison to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are really good.</v>

475
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.053
<v Speaker 3>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that because I started baking </v>

476
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 3>very domestic a and I suck at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking terrible ad you have to think,</v>

477
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.740
<v Speaker 3>but I have to think and I'm learning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

478
00:19:56.741 --> 00:19:59.250
<v Speaker 3>and it's for the thrill and the joy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

479
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not result oriented.</v>

480
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.500
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between hobbies and career,</v>

481
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:06.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no who gives a shit.</v>

482
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 3>There's no results that need to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you and bow hunting.</v>

483
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:10.140
<v Speaker 3>If they happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

484
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:11.070
<v Speaker 3>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

485
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's for the enjoyment of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity versus like results,</v>

486
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:15.781
<v Speaker 3>you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

487
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:16.614
<v Speaker 3>why should I play the piano?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get to Carnegie Hall </v>

488
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>with it says you have to get to Carnegie</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hall.</v>

489
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.933
<v Speaker 3>Just enjoy the activity or hobby well in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indiana and being obsessed with the </v>

490
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:30.780
<v Speaker 3>process of learning because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginner.</v>

491
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.913
<v Speaker 3>Whereas opposed to like if you're some </v>
<v Speaker 3>mega celebrity superstar comedian that </v>

492
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 3>sells out giant arenas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

493
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.110
<v Speaker 3>You're not a beginner man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're.</v>

494
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.163
<v Speaker 3>And if that's all you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if all you do is something you're </v>

495
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.030
<v Speaker 3>awesome at and everybody loves you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go out,</v>

496
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.290
<v Speaker 3>what's up everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>

497
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.080
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

498
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.913
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird disconnect that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people and you see it with certain </v>

499
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:52.594
<v Speaker 1>comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see a clear progression in </v>

500
00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:00.510
<v Speaker 1>their stardom and their act falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and that is because of the loss of</v>

501
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 1>touch with reality and what's normal in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

502
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:10.321
<v Speaker 1>And also you get to fucking comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride complacency and you start believing</v>

503
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:16.831
<v Speaker 1>that you're awesome self critical aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of analyzing your act,</v>

504
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:21.280
<v Speaker 1>going over with a fine tooth comb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you just did this special,</v>

505
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.114
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you must have spent a lot of </v>

506
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.990
<v Speaker 1>time combing every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

507
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:28.400
<v Speaker 1>every word mattered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every sentence mattered,</v>

508
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.190
<v Speaker 1>every joke manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're really good.</v>

509
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole thing.</v>

510
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to fucking hate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

511
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad you said that because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

512
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

513
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

514
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you before we really,</v>

515
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:45.723
<v Speaker 1>October ninth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just some Douche bag who sold 200 </v>

516
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 1>tickets in Portland and I'm still that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

517
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:50.680
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

518
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.820
<v Speaker 1>October 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,</v>

519
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.120
<v Speaker 1>8 million people now have access to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff.</v>

520
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.773
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of a mind fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the good news is I'm still </v>

521
00:21:57.431 --> 00:22:01.020
<v Speaker 1>self-loathing enough to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta grind like you still,</v>

522
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm still gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the comedy store.</v>

523
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Sure work out this next hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always the work of it.</v>

524
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:06.933
<v Speaker 1>But you do have to fucking hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe the hype that you're </v>

525
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.040
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know all the various incarnations </v>

527
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:16.390
<v Speaker 1>your act has gone through in each bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>has gone through.</v>

528
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.740
<v Speaker 1>When someone comes to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

529
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go secret with Mommy's.</v>

530
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.313
<v Speaker 1>See you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the first time hearing all the </v>

531
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>material and they love and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

532
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know better because you know,</v>

533
00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>you've gone through it all and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked it apart and you know,</v>

534
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people like I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like the biggest fan of me.</v>

535
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.563
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't do better no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much I murder of your comedy and you're </v>

536
00:22:42.251 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most thoughtful thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>provoking,</v>

537
00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:46.450
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're here really deep and good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've know myself too well,</v>

540
00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Alec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe.</v>

541
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

542
00:22:57.521 --> 00:22:58.354

<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking to tom about </v>

<v Speaker 1>this so far this morning too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we're walking and I was like that.</v>

544
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.363
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep your career is if you struggle </v>

545
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:07.960
<v Speaker 1>is though it was the first.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

547
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:10.294
<v Speaker 1>you don't think you're all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do stuff that you're sucking that to do </v>

548
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the baking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the hot yoga,</v>

549
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.420
<v Speaker 1>do pilates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pauses.</v>

550
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Very underrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking it kicks my ass.</v>

551
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to exercise,</v>

552
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:21.754
<v Speaker 1>but after I had my kid I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be brittle and hunched </v>

553
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:25.504
<v Speaker 1>over and in Shitty at 50 like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to 50 and plot is like a core </v>

554
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:30.960
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

555
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 1>your whole core and that's the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't think about.</v>

556
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hip word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use like core.</v>

557
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.740
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that.</v>

558
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it really means,</v>

559
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 1>which you really got to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not just your muscles,</v>

560
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>like your thighs or your arms work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

561
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.843
<v Speaker 2>stuff that keeps you upright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those muscles that stabilize your </v>

562
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those muscles that allow you to have</v>

563
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:52.814
<v Speaker 2>good posture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those muscles that keep your discs </v>

564
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 2>from compressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

565
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.903
<v Speaker 2>like all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that yoga </v>

566
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stretches you out and</v>

567
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 4>get back into yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

569
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.400

<v Speaker 4>I got Sciatica because he know your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body literally splits in half.</v>

571
00:24:10.571 --> 00:24:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Your pelvis is to two bones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

572
00:24:12.821 --> 00:24:15.580
<v Speaker 4>That come apart and baby comes out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it has to heal.</v>

573
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:19.900
<v Speaker 4>So I'm two years postpartum and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just now kind of coming back.</v>

574
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.080
<v Speaker 4>But yeah dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's brutal.</v>

576
00:24:23.111 --> 00:24:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure being 39 or 41 I had a baby </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably wasn't helpful,</v>

577
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.000
<v Speaker 4>but that plays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it kicks my and I'm bad at it too.</v>

578
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.600
<v Speaker 4>I suck at polities and I make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself the whole time.</v>

579
00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:35.434
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have perfect form for the best </v>

580
00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:39.880
<v Speaker 4>at this you've ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do still do it.</v>

581
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.240
<v Speaker 4>You still fucking push yourself while </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing things that you suck at I think is</v>

582
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.220
<v Speaker 4>his giant</v>

583
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.520
<v Speaker 2>for anyone doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that if you get,</v>

584
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you get to certain levels of proficiency</v>
<v Speaker 2>at things,</v>

585
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:53.783
<v Speaker 2>you can get lost in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the best ways </v>

586
00:24:56.171 --> 00:24:57.004
<v Speaker 2>especially maybe I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm just looking at in terms of </v>

587
00:24:58.991 --> 00:24:59.824
<v Speaker 2>creative endeavors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like standup obviously is so </v>

588
00:25:01.991 --> 00:25:06.550
<v Speaker 2>dependent upon your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so dependent upon creativity that one of</v>

589
00:25:06.551 --> 00:25:07.384
<v Speaker 2>the best ways for me to have other </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts other than like just my </v>

590
00:25:11.501 --> 00:25:14.440
<v Speaker 2>immediate act and doing shows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel,</v>

591
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's the worst thing that happens</v>

592
00:25:15.751 --> 00:25:16.570
<v Speaker 2>to comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

593
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.403
<v Speaker 2>They started doing an airplane jokes </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're on airplanes all the </v>

594
00:25:18.611 --> 00:25:21.760
<v Speaker 2>time and hotel jokes and they just lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>their perspective.</v>

595
00:25:21.761 --> 00:25:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do other shit like live a life.</v>

596
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Live a life and do stuff that's fucking </v>

597
00:25:26.741 --> 00:25:28.050
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

598
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Have some struggles so that the standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle,</v>

599
00:25:30.101 --> 00:25:33.400
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem that standup is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>easiest fucking part of my day.</v>

600
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:33.760
<v Speaker 2>All</v>

601
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.170
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After,</v>

602
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it for 14 years.</v>

603
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.773
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yoga and running and all this different </v>

604
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:43.470
<v Speaker 4>shit I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The standup part is the easiest part.</v>

605
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:44.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so interesting too.</v>

606
00:25:44.881 --> 00:25:46.470
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

607
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been,</v>

608
00:25:47.611 --> 00:25:48.444
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing it for 14 years before I</v>
<v Speaker 4>got this first special and I was like </v>

609
00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.380
<v Speaker 4>thinking about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crazy shit you go through to,</v>

610
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.890
<v Speaker 4>to be a comic and like the horrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions.</v>

611
00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:02.940
<v Speaker 4>I put myself as a woman too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's especially fucked up because you're</v>

612
00:26:02.941 --> 00:26:03.774
<v Speaker 4>like if feature act and you're staying </v>
<v Speaker 4>in motels where the door faces the </v>

613
00:26:07.861 --> 00:26:08.694
<v Speaker 4>fucking parking lot and you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>some Hibachi grill and some weirdos </v>

<v Speaker 4>going to try to pay you with a fur coat </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of money this week.</v>

<v Speaker 3>when my youngest was three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were skiing.</v>

673
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.940
<v Speaker 3>She's been skiing since you like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we took her skin and uh,</v>

674
00:28:47.941 --> 00:28:51.300
<v Speaker 3>we're putting all our stuff back in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we had everything stacked up,</v>

675
00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 3>but we're putting the bags away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting ready to leave.</v>

676
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.810

<v Speaker 3>your helmet back in,</v>

678
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.570
<v Speaker 3>in the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks to helmet,</v>

679
00:29:01.571 --> 00:29:02.404
<v Speaker 3>she likes the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a word for shit that they can't say no.</v>

700

703
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:37.570
<v Speaker 1>while I take a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the difference between the way</v>

704
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 1>kids treat the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mommy and Daddy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Formula breast.</v>

710
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.440
<v Speaker 1>So just connected to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like physically,</v>

711
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:56.470
<v Speaker 1>you are the source of nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the source of love.</v>

712
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 1>You're the source of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on.</v>

713
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it feel?</v>

714
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Powerful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

715
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.593
<v Speaker 1>it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really as far as being a woman in </v>

716
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:07.270
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Societaly,</v>

717
00:31:07.271 --> 00:31:08.104
<v Speaker 1>it's not that great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say that like reproduction </v>

718
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:12.130
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking awesome.</v>

719
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.930
<v Speaker 1>How is it not great?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Societaly?</v>

720
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:15.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

721
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:17.770
<v Speaker 1>we're still second class citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest,</v>

722
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>women are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

723
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.790
<v Speaker 1>your power is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>

724
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't really feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

725
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

726
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:25.391
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

727
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:26.224
<v Speaker 1>It's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't exist in a corporate </v>

728
00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:28.744
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

729
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.550
<v Speaker 1>But where do you find the deficit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup?</v>

730
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

731
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's starting to come around,</v>

732
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:39.310
<v Speaker 1>but if you'll look at like where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>at now,</v>

733
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.323
<v Speaker 1>it feels a little regressive in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we were in the nineties with </v>

734
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:44.900
<v Speaker 1>female cow I would say.</v>

735
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the source of that is?</v>

736
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

737
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot.</v>

738
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

739
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.820
<v Speaker 1>I think nine slash 11 changed us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made us more conservative in some ways.</v>

740
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:57.520
<v Speaker 1>A little more insulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

741
00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:58.443
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a lack of quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when someone like you comes </v>

742
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:05.170
<v Speaker 1>along for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you this before.</v>

743
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean I saw you at the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 1>like four or five years ago when I ran </v>

744
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.240
<v Speaker 1>up to like one set that you had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

745
00:32:11.241 --> 00:32:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the funniest people alive.</v>

746
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't take off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

747
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.250
<v Speaker 1>You're very encouraging of me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always am so thankful.</v>

748
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.293
<v Speaker 1>You're the reason I got a special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in here at years ago and you're </v>

749
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.660
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have an hour.</v>

750
00:32:22.661 --> 00:32:23.640
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

751
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should get a manager and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agent.</v>

752
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't even thinking in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying like intelligent.</v>

753
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 1>What were you thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking just like,</v>

754
00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be good at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be good,</v>

755
00:32:35.981 --> 00:32:37.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's the right attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

756
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Agronomically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

757
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.033
<v Speaker 1>The people that are like,</v>

758
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I need a special now those people suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

759
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Like the people that are trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's way out of their reach.</v>

760
00:32:46.401 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Like the people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

761
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:49.220
<v Speaker 2>I need to be filling arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

762
00:32:49.221 --> 00:32:50.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to fucking good 10 minutes.</v>

763
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 2>A piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really talking about like those are</v>

764
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 2>the crazy people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

765
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 2>The people that are like really good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>promotion but really bad at standup.</v>

766
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.903
<v Speaker 2>But then however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people who are really talented </v>

767
00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:02.483
<v Speaker 2>but don't have enough business savvy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there needs to be some kind </v>

768
00:33:04.971 --> 00:33:05.804
<v Speaker 2>of like thing where you start to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>the business and you become responsible </v>

769
00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:09.434
<v Speaker 2>for that end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I was not taking </v>

770
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:11.744
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think the thing about standup is </v>

771
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:15.703
<v Speaker 2>that there is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially today and there's a </v>

772
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 2>difference between today and 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago or 20 years ago because there's more</v>

773
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:22.874
<v Speaker 2>opportunity and because there's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity because of there's youtube </v>

774
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:26.804
<v Speaker 2>and there's social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have become very </v>

775
00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Speaker 2>famous just through twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram and social media.</v>

776
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.890
<v Speaker 2>So all this new opportunity has opened </v>
<v Speaker 2>up more possibilities so people are less</v>

777
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 2>stingy and there's more of a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>community for whatever reason.</v>

778
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Particularly in La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>La has a very good sense of community.</v>

779
00:33:43.851 --> 00:33:47.630
<v Speaker 2>So even if you're not like the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>business savvy,</v>

780
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:48.523
<v Speaker 2>you can be around a lot of people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself or like other people that are </v>

781
00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:54.920
<v Speaker 2>encouraging and then help and tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody about their friends.</v>

782
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 2>And like it's one of the cool things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about comedy.</v>

783
00:33:56.811 --> 00:34:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll go to like Tom's page if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else is doing something and it'd</v>

784
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's too fucking laid back.</v>

797
00:34:21.821 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 2>He's Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He falls asleep constantly.</v>

798
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 2>That motherfucker will sit down and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes he's out cold.</v>

799
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:28.603
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took pictures of him on a plane the </v>

800
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:32.150
<v Speaker 2>other day because we were flying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>

801
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:36.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a 40 minute flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's out cold protein dude.</v>

802
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a lack of vitamins for sure because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't eat well.</v>

803
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does eat vegan.</v>

804
00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Look at um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>

805
00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

806
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.990
<v Speaker 2>he definitely doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't take any supplements.</v>

807
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.063
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like make sure that he has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete balanced amino acid profile to </v>

808
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:56.223
<v Speaker 2>is foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I was telling to you that </v>

809
00:34:57.891 --> 00:34:59.730

<v Speaker 2>but that's a lot of work.</v>

810
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.053
<v Speaker 2>It is of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what to do if you want to be </v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking jacked.</v>

<v Speaker 3>of the things that happened along the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

852
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 3>he started getting a lot of jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>

853
00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.200
<v Speaker 3>writing on television shows and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to guys or they do that.</v>

854
00:37:00.661 --> 00:37:01.494
<v Speaker 3>It happened to Fitzsimmons who's also </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best comics alive and they </v>

855
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:04.764
<v Speaker 3>get distracted by other people's work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people don't realize how good </v>

856
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:08.994
<v Speaker 3>they are at stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get a chance to see Greg </v>

857
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:11.663
<v Speaker 3>Fitzsimmons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is one of the fucking best comments </v>

858
00:37:13.051 --> 00:37:16.800
<v Speaker 3>alive and greg and I started out </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally a week apart from each other.</v>

859
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 3>Same Club in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's great.</v>

860
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.533
<v Speaker 3>He's best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great human being tail and he's </v>

861
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:24.204
<v Speaker 3>super funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's super funny and super smart and </v>

862
00:37:26.071 --> 00:37:27.210
<v Speaker 3>just a sweetheart.</v>

863
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.550
<v Speaker 3>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just ridiculous.</v>

864
00:37:29.551 --> 00:37:30.384
<v Speaker 3>He's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true about writing for other </v>

865
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.113
<v Speaker 3>people and because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote for cartoons for many years and </v>

866
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I do feel like it sucks your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

867
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:38.964
<v Speaker 3>your juice out of your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I worked on Chelsea for a </v>

868
00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 3>minute and wrote on that show and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

869
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.530
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

870
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like you're cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

871
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 3>your own voice and your own ship working</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much on other people's stuff and then</v>

872
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:54.810
<v Speaker 3>not at all at your own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden you're thing is</v>

873
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:55.644
<v Speaker 3>done and you're behind instead of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same spot you were when you </v>

874
00:37:58.501 --> 00:37:59.334
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're behind because you don't even </v>

875
00:38:00.631 --> 00:38:02.880
<v Speaker 3>know your act anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to go over your material.</v>

876
00:38:02.881 --> 00:38:05.640
<v Speaker 3>You're not really working anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not in your conscious.</v>

877
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not always there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it Louis Ck?</v>

878
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:08.383
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about when he was a writer</v>
<v Speaker 3>on some late was at the tonight show or </v>

879
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:11.994
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he was a writer on one of </v>

880
00:38:14.491 --> 00:38:15.324
<v Speaker 3>the big late night shows and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got it pretty young too and he was </v>

881
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:19.044
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the best job I could ever hope </v>

882
00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:21.594
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I'm going to hate myself if </v>

883
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I stay here because you know that I know</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a comic.</v>

884
00:38:26.941 --> 00:38:29.610
<v Speaker 3>I know somewhere that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there I need to be doing.</v>

885
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.850
<v Speaker 3>So it's like this gilded cage of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being a writer.</v>

886
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also being on a sitcom.</v>

887
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.913
<v Speaker 3>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being on a Sitcom did that to me for </v>

888
00:38:37.781 --> 00:38:38.690
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

889
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you weren't doing your full </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential was working all day.</v>

890
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:43.443
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

891
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I was still doing sets at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't writing any new material at</v>

892
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

893
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I was just doing the same set over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again.</v>

894
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.953
<v Speaker 3>And I started this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started having some hard sets and one </v>

895
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:58.940
<v Speaker 3>night the writers came to see me and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went up late at the comedy store and ate</v>

896
00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a platter of Dick's,</v>

897
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.160
<v Speaker 3>just a full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a flake,</v>

898
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 3>someone getting married or they bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there with the hors d'oeuvres,</v>

899
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.503
<v Speaker 3>eat every trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just realized like I've become a </v>

900
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:14.104
<v Speaker 3>bad comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to be good when I was young </v>

901
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.610
<v Speaker 3>and then I got this show and then over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the course of the four years,</v>

902
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.700
<v Speaker 3>five years that I was on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just might act deteriorated.</v>

903
00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:22.534
<v Speaker 3>And I realized like I got to get back on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the horse and that because of that one </v>

904
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:29.230
<v Speaker 3>bombing set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a year and a half later,</v>

905
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

906
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I got my first album that I did on </v>
<v Speaker 3>warner brothers.</v>

907
00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I allow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like 10 years into comedy.</v>

908
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:41.100
<v Speaker 3>So the whole thing was like a velvet </v>
<v Speaker 3>cage,</v>

909
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's like,</v>

910
00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

911
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I've made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's going to be beautiful now,</v>

912
00:39:44.771 --> 00:39:46.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's not because you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>your thing.</v>

913
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.660
<v Speaker 3>And it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone asked me like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of fucking deal in it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's that about that thing.</v>

926
00:40:22.431 --> 00:40:23.264
<v Speaker 3>And I don't want to fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like answering to people for </v>

927
00:40:25.001 --> 00:40:25.834
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like the notes that she had </v>

928
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:34.410
<v Speaker 3>some Douchey unfunny producer that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling you guys how to do your show and</v>

929
00:40:34.411 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 3>that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it can be all the time.</v>

930
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.980
<v Speaker 3>How many times you can say one thing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has the worst.</v>

931
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.930
<v Speaker 3>When you were an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you act on that show,</v>

932
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.910
<v Speaker 3>would you get lines that you were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

933
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I know?</v>

934
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:52.930
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not on news radio.</v>

935
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:57.370
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] news radio was so good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the writers were so good and the guy who</v>

936
00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:58.690
<v Speaker 3>ran it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Simms,</v>

937
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.160
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the executive producer,</v>

938
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:01.263
<v Speaker 3>the creator of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a genius and one of the things </v>

939
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:04.540
<v Speaker 3>that was brilliant about him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

940
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:05.870
<v Speaker 3>he still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still a genius.</v>

941
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.290
<v Speaker 3>One of the things is brilliant about him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he let everybody add the leg.</v>

942
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.133
<v Speaker 3>Dave Foley was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like the secret producer of that </v>

943
00:41:13.031 --> 00:41:16.820
<v Speaker 3>show was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But because he was on news radio,</v>

944
00:41:16.821 --> 00:41:18.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right after kids in the hall,</v>

945
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:21.130
<v Speaker 3>like you did kids in the hall where he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the primary writers,</v>

946
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.050
<v Speaker 3>he's a really good writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he would,</v>

947
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.370
<v Speaker 3>he would see like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

948
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:25.563
<v Speaker 3>the thing is if you ever been on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitcom before we ever worked on a </v>

949
00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

950
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.420
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a run through.</v>

951
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 3>So you do a table read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go down,</v>

952
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 3>everybody sits down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go over the lines,</v>

953
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Speaker 3>you find out what's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody laughs,</v>

954
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:38.923
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the writers will go back to the writing </v>

955
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:40.454
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tweak stuff a little bit and then </v>

956
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:42.254
<v Speaker 3>you go to the floor and you run it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so will you do in a run through as </v>

957
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 3>you'll start off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

958
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:48.560
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing the hair and the break </v>
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>

959
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:50.540
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

960
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe it just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it seems like it work,</v>

961
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:55.100
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Dave would be the guy that goes,</v>

962
00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm andy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't,</v>

963
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 3>why don't we try this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Vicky,</v>

964
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.373
<v Speaker 3>why don't you walk in here and Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you walk in at the same time and you </v>

965
00:42:03.591 --> 00:42:05.210
<v Speaker 3>guys both say the same thing at the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

966
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.043
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

967
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:06.973
<v Speaker 3>he'll like come up with like a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario to get this point across to </v>

968
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:10.874
<v Speaker 3>move us into the next scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he would do that in front of the </v>

969
00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 3>producers and they would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love it.</v>

970
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

971
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:15.873
<v Speaker 3>let's go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they would rewrite the scene and </v>

972
00:42:17.211 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 3>put Dave's lines and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I swear to God,</v>

973
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:20.780
<v Speaker 3>that might've happened 40 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

974
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you see that show,</v>

975
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 3>like maybe 40 percent of the scenes at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least were tweaked by Dave Foley.</v>

976
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.900
<v Speaker 3>That's bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And did he get the punch up?</v>

977
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:34.901
<v Speaker 3>Credit Punch up credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was the thing is like everybody</v>

978
00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:37.610
<v Speaker 3>was just working to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But oddly enough,</v>

979
00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Phil Hartman did zero of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phil Hartman was just like,</v>

980
00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:41.923
<v Speaker 3>stick to the script and kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But his character was such a beautiful </v>

981
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:47.580
<v Speaker 3>character to write for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

982
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:52.580
<v Speaker 3>sort of have tos ridiculous guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

983
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 3>just completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

984
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.860
<v Speaker 3>just didn't get it and was like full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

985
00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.693
<v Speaker 3>And he was so good at playing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>character that they would just nail his </v>

986
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:01.874
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I then he would just go out and smash </v>

987
00:43:02.901 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

988
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.650
<v Speaker 3>That was a little too young when that </v>
<v Speaker 3>show came out.</v>

989
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Phil Hartman,</v>

990
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

991
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

992
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:13.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like crazy.</v>

993
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

994
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I like Rodney Dangerfield and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you ever hear that back to school?</v>

995
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:20.684
<v Speaker 3>When he got that script it was kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turd and the story goes that he took it </v>

996
00:43:25.251 --> 00:43:26.084
<v Speaker 3>and he rewrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he wrote jokes and all the margins </v>

997
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.790
<v Speaker 3>and then go and send it back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>studio and they were like,</v>

998
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.500
<v Speaker 3>this is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we make this movie?</v>

999
00:43:33.501 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:35.920
<v Speaker 3>you could pay me whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$10,000</v>

1001
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.680

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.980
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like,</v>

1003
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.660
<v Speaker 3>that's how fucking Dave Foley should </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been.</v>

1004
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Like with Kevin Hart does with movies </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm like,</v>

1005

<v Speaker 3>instagram,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at promotion but they're not </v>

1041
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:54.760
<v Speaker 3>talented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1042
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Speaker 3>You need to have some kind of meat for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bone now.</v>

1043
00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.540

1047
00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:12.390
<v Speaker 3>He became famous through social media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first guy ever.</v>

1048
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1049
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:15.960
<v Speaker 3>But you have to have that in you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

1050
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading a people magazine </v>
<v Speaker 3>article.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>

1055
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.930
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't followers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was friends.</v>

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 3>So many friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even fucking know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I do want to note that many people.</v>

1058
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.250

<v Speaker 3>It took its place,</v>

1061
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 3>but my space still there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jamie,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's fucking faded.</v>

1124
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.793

<v Speaker 3>Was sitting there from the late </v>

1125
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:46.483
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so whoever had their shit together most </v>

1126
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:50.590
<v Speaker 3>as an open miker was definitely the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfunny.</v>

1127
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You remember it probably wasn't around </v>

1129
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:55.144
<v Speaker 3>when you were around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a thing called the comedy </v>

1130
00:48:56.201 --> 00:48:59.110
<v Speaker 3>USA industry guide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1131
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.213
<v Speaker 3>when I first started out there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing called the comedy USA Industry </v>

1132
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Guide and they would send it out to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the industry and I was always like super</v>

1133
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:07.984
<v Speaker 3>in awe of the guys that had a big page </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like a lot of it was like college </v>

1134
00:49:11.981 --> 00:49:14.560
<v Speaker 3>acts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a college act back then was.</v>

1135
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.270
<v Speaker 3>That was the pinnacle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you wanted to be.</v>

1136
00:49:16.271 --> 00:49:17.104
<v Speaker 3>You want to be a college act because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were a college act you could make </v>

1137
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:22.570
<v Speaker 3>like a thousand dollars a college or </v>
<v Speaker 3>$2,000</v>

1138
00:49:22.571 --> 00:49:25.620
<v Speaker 3>a college like Holy Shit and you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about,</v>

1139
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do two colleges on a weekend and</v>

1140
00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:28.204
<v Speaker 3>make $4,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was insane and I knew guys who were </v>

1141
00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:31.960
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

1142
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.720
<v Speaker 3>I knew guys who would manage clean your </v>
<v Speaker 3>act up so you can do colleges.</v>

1143
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:38.740
<v Speaker 3>They will say that that that was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best when I started to.</v>

1144
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:41.530
<v Speaker 3>It was you got to clean it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>

1145

00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:43.714
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get on the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the internet happened and </v>

1147
00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:48.730
<v Speaker 3>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

1148
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:49.770
<v Speaker 3>and you're clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1149
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.760
<v Speaker 3>there's different outlets now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And you know what's really gross to the </v>

1152
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:03.970
<v Speaker 3>mediocre comic that suppresses the </v>
<v Speaker 3>talented guys that are coming up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you can't do that on TV is going to be a</v>

1163
00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 3>lot of guys that are on TV and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be on TV and you're going to be</v>

1164
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:37.370
<v Speaker 3>back here doing the same jokes saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck word all the time.</v>

1165
00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1166
00:50:39.171 --> 00:50:40.710
<v Speaker 3>well what about like the comics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1167
00:50:40.711 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 3>like Andrew dice clay or Sam kinison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got news for you,</v>

1168
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:47.480
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not dice clay to remind you where</v>

1169
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 3>you are on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the totem pole.</v>

1170
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:50.150
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1171
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.360
<v Speaker 3>somebody like this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not good advice.</v>

1172
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.253
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember being told back to with </v>

1173
00:50:56.901 --> 00:50:58.020
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think right now for,</v>

1174
00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:58.903
<v Speaker 3>for female comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like right now there's a </v>

1175
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:04.310
<v Speaker 3>particular dichotomy between like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Madonna whore thing.</v>

1176
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.300
<v Speaker 3>Like either you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1177
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:10.020
<v Speaker 3>young and hot and you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>like sexual stuff or like you're me give</v>

1178
00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:10.780
<v Speaker 3>get fucking mom.</v>

1179
00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about mom stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1180
00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:13.220
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

1181
00:51:13.221 --> 00:51:16.190
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you can be just a person.</v>

1182
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1183
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:20.090
<v Speaker 3>but why do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think you can.</v>

1184
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.430
<v Speaker 3>I think anybody can be a person if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just own it,</v>

1185
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.740
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an.</v>

1186
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1187
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the marketing and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's just marketing.</v>

1188
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.850
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think you don't.</v>

1189
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:31.400
<v Speaker 3>You don't see it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1190
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:34.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not that it can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people look at archetypes,</v>

1191
00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think like something that's already</v>

1192
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:38.350
<v Speaker 3>been carved out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Sarah Silverman.</v>

1193
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 3>She's pretty and she talks dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do that.</v>

1194
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.680
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see like these,</v>

1195
00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patrice o'neal used to call them babies.</v>

1196
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Like I got a lot of babies live comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1197
00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:48.824
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are my David tell got a lot of </v>

1198
00:51:50.091 --> 00:51:50.924
<v Speaker 3>comedy babies and David Taylor had a ton</v>
<v Speaker 3>of comedy babies because people would </v>

1199
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 3>imitate what they saw that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>

1200
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:57.643
<v Speaker 3>saw that thing.</v>

1201
00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:58.491
<v Speaker 3>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1202
00:51:58.491 --> 00:52:01.680
<v Speaker 3>I know that I can do like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could talk like Dave.</v>

1203
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.780
<v Speaker 3>And so there's these people that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like imitated his cadence and rhythm and</v>

1204
00:52:05.781 --> 00:52:08.660
<v Speaker 3>it like some of them egregiously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some of them you're like,</v>

1205
00:52:08.661 --> 00:52:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ your bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Borderline a thief,</v>

1206
00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1207
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.060
<v Speaker 3>It's easier for the audience to identify</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman as a,</v>

1208
00:52:17.061 --> 00:52:17.894
<v Speaker 3>this is the one I have sex with or this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not serious and I don't mean this as </v>

1209
00:52:22.311 --> 00:52:23.110
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1210
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:24.900
<v Speaker 3>a woe is me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally,</v>

1211
00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:25.671
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1212
00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:26.504
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel is either there's women that you </v>

1213
00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:29.430
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's women that are,</v>

1214
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.320
<v Speaker 3>that are off limits that are similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>maternal I leave.</v>

1215
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:33.860
<v Speaker 3>That's been my experience in the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1216
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out with dudes.</v>

1217
00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:36.554
<v Speaker 3>It was like the best thing that ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to me was hooking up with Tom </v>

1218
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Cigarette because it put like a magical </v>
<v Speaker 3>lasso,</v>

1219
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.300
<v Speaker 3>have a limits flexibility.</v>

1220
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:51.510
<v Speaker 3>And immediately one of the friends I </v>
<v Speaker 3>became a off limits per.</v>

1221
00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.413
<v Speaker 3>I became a person and it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I find that as I get older and </v>

1222
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:59.030
<v Speaker 3>become more like less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuckability stuff goes down.</v>

1223
00:52:59.031 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really liked just being a human,</v>

1224
00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:03.483
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I was going to fucking go with </v>

1225
00:53:05.571 --> 00:53:06.680
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I know what you're saying,</v>

1226
00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:08.900
<v Speaker 3>but do you think this is all in your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>head?</v>

1227
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the all reality is right.</v>

1228
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:12.783
<v Speaker 3>Aren't we all living in our own data </v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of these archetypes that </v>

1229
00:53:17.541 --> 00:53:20.150
<v Speaker 3>everybody sort of claims are </v>
<v Speaker 3>inescapable.</v>

1230
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll see someone that doesn't fit</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that at all and you go,</v>

1231
00:53:23.561 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I didn't see that coming.</v>

1232
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.020
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm trying to think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the big,</v>

1233
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.620
<v Speaker 3>the big female comics and they usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>either one or the other.</v>

1234
00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's either a mommy or about ellen.</v>

1235
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Very asexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1236
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.480
<v Speaker 3>She's neither short hair and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably a ton of posts.</v>

1237
00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:45.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love.</v>

1238
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.153
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she just gets her receipt and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets her toes done and it's a box and I </v>

1239
00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.130
<v Speaker 3>would love to hear her talk about eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy and that be like my favorite thing</v>

1240
00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:56.964
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonder why don't she makes a face when </v>

1241
00:54:00.691 --> 00:54:01.524
<v Speaker 3>she posted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe she,</v>

1242
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:06.740
<v Speaker 3>not she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she came up.</v>

1243
00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she's super gross about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's super gross,</v>

1244
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.003
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the people that are super </v>

1245
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.450
<v Speaker 3>one way publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe privately.</v>

1246
00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:22.663
<v Speaker 3>She's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought about that about </v>

1247
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:27.620
<v Speaker 3>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the nicey Nice ones.</v>

1248
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the nicey nice ones,</v>

1249
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:33.960
<v Speaker 3>but the over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like defenders of women there turned out</v>

1250
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:34.794
<v Speaker 3>to be super pervy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know a few of those always get </v>

1251
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:39.690
<v Speaker 3>busted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1252
00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's people that you can trust,</v>

1253
00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:42.480

1257
00:54:49.231 --> 00:54:50.064

<v Speaker 3>if you're not addressing the darkness,</v>

1263
00:55:03.631 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 3>the darkness comes out uh,</v>

00:55:13.981 --> 00:55:16.760
<v Speaker 3>freak shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so clever.</v>

1268
00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might be the exception to the rule be</v>

1269
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.570
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he's so nice family guy.</v>

1270
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I think he really likes being a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1271
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't sense that shit from him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put cosby.</v>

1272
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh God was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a surprise.</v>

1273
00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:29.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it though?</v>

1274
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.740
<v Speaker 3>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever hear the rumors?</v>

1275
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.693
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See I did in show business circles </v>

1276
00:55:34.771 --> 00:55:35.250
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1277
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:36.083
<v Speaker 3>briefly I lived in the actor's world </v>
<v Speaker 3>right when I was on news radio and I </v>

1278
00:55:39.271 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 3>would hear it and hear it back then that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would drug people.</v>

1279
00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1280
00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:43.800
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1281
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would hear it.</v>

1282
00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:48.300
<v Speaker 3>It was like one of those weird rumors </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would go around bill cosby drugs,</v>

1283
00:55:48.301 --> 00:55:50.630
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1284
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 3>what's going on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Hannah,</v>

1285
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.460
<v Speaker 3>when Hannah talked about it on stage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it all blew up,</v>

1286
00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of crazy if you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hannibal,</v>

1287
00:55:59.100 --> 00:55:59.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he just happened to be talking </v>

1288
00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:02.214
<v Speaker 3>about it and then someone happened to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>filming it and then the rest of the </v>

1289
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:05.520
<v Speaker 3>world was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that true?</v>

1290
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.473
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because bill cosby's always telling </v>

1291
00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:08.844
<v Speaker 3>people to not swear talent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially like he was big on telling </v>

1292
00:56:11.671 --> 00:56:15.720
<v Speaker 3>young black comedians not swear enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk about sex and he's like,</v>

1293
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:16.643
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill cosby and until now at least I'm </v>

1294
00:56:17.371 --> 00:56:19.080
<v Speaker 3>not raping people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>

1295
00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:22.210
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1296
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 3>That was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rumor</v>

1297
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.330
<v Speaker 1>was always around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1298
00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had heard some creepy,</v>

1299
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.990
<v Speaker 1>a little creepiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1300
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.250
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was that extent when someone,</v>

1301
00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 1>when someone does something like that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1302
00:56:36.041 --> 00:56:37.680
<v Speaker 1>like that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

1303
00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:41.990
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the creepiest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>things a human can do to another human.</v>

1304
00:56:41.991 --> 00:56:42.824
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that this guy who was </v>

1305
00:56:45.321 --> 00:56:47.540
<v Speaker 2>America's father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1306
00:56:47.541 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of ways he was our black dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.790
<v Speaker 2>he was the moral authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1308
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.880
<v Speaker 2>he was Mr Huxtable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:56.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the fact that that guy,</v>

1310
00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:01.520
<v Speaker 2>someone described him as the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>serial rapist in the history of America,</v>

1311
00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.593
<v Speaker 2>like that really might be the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if he really did drug all these </v>

1312
00:57:06.291 --> 00:57:09.260
<v Speaker 2>people that he said he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many people have raped more?</v>

1313
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.190
<v Speaker 2>He might be number one.</v>

1314
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:11.480
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

1315
00:57:11.481 --> 00:57:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1316
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:14.023
<v Speaker 1>And the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's the darkest motherfucker ever </v>

1317
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:23.870
<v Speaker 1>darken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start drugging them,</v>

1318
00:57:23.871 --> 00:57:28.871
<v Speaker 1>watching them plastic fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's got kids even more fucked up.</v>

1319
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:30.103
<v Speaker 1>The crazy part was drug use or someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else's baby and sticking his dick and </v>

1320
00:57:33.111 --> 00:57:34.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other unconscious.</v>

1321
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.830
<v Speaker 1>It's so evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's evil.</v>

1322
00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about Harvey Weinstein?</v>

1323
00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.450
<v Speaker 1>And he's won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew about two apparently.</v>

1324
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>

1326
00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.030

<v Speaker 1>wants you to suck his dick to get a </v>

1328
00:57:54.381 --> 00:57:55.214
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's funny because you do think </v>

1329
00:57:57.591 --> 00:57:58.011
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1330
00:57:58.011 --> 00:57:58.844
<v Speaker 1>isn't that kind of why you become like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show business executive to get chicks </v>

1331
00:58:01.881 --> 00:58:04.790
<v Speaker 1>not to rape chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexual assault is always off the table,</v>

1332
00:58:04.791 --> 00:58:06.950
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did he rape them or did.</v>

1335
00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:13.693
<v Speaker 1>and he is not a looker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's definitely the type of guy </v>

1336
00:58:16.851 --> 00:58:20.300
<v Speaker 1>that would be the type of guy he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what's fucked up.</v>

1337
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Suicide threat prompts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Police response.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1343
00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.673
<v Speaker 2>It must be so overwhelmed with guilt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear and remorse and just self hatred </v>

1344
00:58:39.921 --> 00:58:42.230
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sounds like an addict,</v>

<v Speaker 2>addict,</v>

<v Speaker 2>gluttonous man.</v>

1349
00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at his physical self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1350
00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.393
<v Speaker 2>his face is over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flowing on his collar and he's just </v>

1351
00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:03.030
<v Speaker 2>gluttonous food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the plus?</v>

1352
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.093
<v Speaker 2>There's this gluttonous existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a measured thought out </v>

1353
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:16.160
<v Speaker 2>contemplatives introspective existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's just trying to enjoy his time</v>

<v Speaker 2>You guys were all great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1357
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.453
<v Speaker 2>I expect from like Steven Spielberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven Spielberg to be like this really </v>

1358
00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:28.170
<v Speaker 2>like introspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughtful guy.</v>

1359
00:59:28.171 --> 00:59:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I was just enjoying the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>making amazing movies,</v>

1360
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.600
<v Speaker 2>but he's a creative thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvey's and Executive Guy,</v>

1361
00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:36.530

1362
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:40.060
<v Speaker 2>the money guy behind everything and Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1363
00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:44.970
<v Speaker 1>It is so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So gross.</v>

1364
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:46.890
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now on the other hand,</v>

1365
00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:48.960
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1366
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:49.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood is such a labyrinth in terms </v>

1367
00:59:51.481 --> 00:59:54.270
<v Speaker 1>of like getting shit done and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>deals closed.</v>

1368
00:59:54.271 --> 00:59:55.500
<v Speaker 1>And how did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this happen?</v>

1369
00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:59.430
<v Speaker 1>It would kind of be nice to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to Netflix special,</v>

1370
00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:03.270
<v Speaker 1>just go fucking suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I can be like,</v>

1371
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I have to do.</v>

1372
01:00:04.441 --> 01:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It's something that guys come over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you nasty.</v>

1373
01:00:06.751 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's your special right?</v>

1374
01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Way Easier would you have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with Tommy?</v>

1375
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Listen Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not sex work.</v>

1376
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:20.063
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like cut and dry and it's </v>

1377
01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>an exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1378
01:00:22.831 --> 01:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I was in law school for two weeks and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember two weeks,</v>

1379
01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>two weeks and I dropped out in contract </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

1380
01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>It's an exchange of something for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

1381
01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Seems fucking pretty straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what prostitution is,</v>

1382
01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.473
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the weirdest things that </v>

1383
01:00:35.101 --> 01:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>massage is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but prostitution isn't.</v>

1384
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1385
01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>It is odd because we do not like genital</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>

1386
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>not like genital pleasure for cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like general pleasure has to be for love</v>

1387
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and be loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1388
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It has to be given free is the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in civilization that we require to</v>

1389
01:00:52.501 --> 01:00:53.334
<v Speaker 1>be given away for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else you can exchange money </v>

1390
01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting change.</v>

1391
01:00:57.151 --> 01:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Money for food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1392
01:00:58.651 --> 01:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone cooks for you,</v>

1393
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's normal.</v>

1394
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>So total normal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very intimate thing.</v>

1395
01:01:04.891 --> 01:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Feeding someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1396
01:01:06.541 --> 01:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1397
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:07.993
<v Speaker 1>It's a hair salon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wash your head to give you a head </v>

1398
01:01:10.351 --> 01:01:11.184
<v Speaker 1>massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one thing I miss about having hair </v>

1399
01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>rubbed my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1400
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>it's the best feeling in the world.</v>

1401
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Massage or foot massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love foot massages.</v>

1402
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's people out there that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot massages more than than like head,</v>

1403
01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1404
01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1405
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.513
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you put a camera in front of </v>

1406
01:01:31.861 --> 01:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>two people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking totally illegal.</v>

1407
01:01:33.511 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Now it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're paying pam.</v>

1408
01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So what's were retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1409
01:01:37.021 --> 01:01:37.854
<v Speaker 1>that makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babies were grown up babies because you </v>

1410
01:01:40.321 --> 01:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>can commodify that and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalistic thing.</v>

1411
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's more commodifiable as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>product is.</v>

1412
01:01:46.711 --> 01:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two factors.</v>

1413
01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:50.363
<v Speaker 1>One is the tax factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to get taxes from </v>

1414
01:01:52.801 --> 01:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>people that are prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1415
01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:54.981
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1416
01:01:54.981 --> 01:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1417
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1418
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1419
01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.733
<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>

1420
01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Where's that money going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give us,</v>

1421
01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:59.103
<v Speaker 2>give us our cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing is the sex </v>

1422
01:02:03.451 --> 01:02:06.750
<v Speaker 2>trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex slavery aspect,</v>

1423
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:11.040
<v Speaker 2>like protecting people that are sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffickers because like,</v>

1424
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:12.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have someone that was sold </v>

1425
01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:13.614
<v Speaker 2>into sex slavery or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some way bartered their trip to </v>

1426
01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had some sort of a sex slave deal.</v>

1427
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.093
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there has been arguments that what </v>

1428
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:30.111
<v Speaker 2>makes that exists in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it prostitution is illegal here and a</v>

1429
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:32.760
<v Speaker 2>prostitution was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be.</v>

1430
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:33.653
<v Speaker 2>That stuff would all go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much like the argument is with illegal </v>

1431
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:39.510
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you made marijuana legal,</v>

1432
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.560
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have as much of the Mexican</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug trade,</v>

1433
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 2>which you are seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are seeing in America.</v>

1434
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's retarded and a wait.</v>

1435
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>But wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey,</v>

1436
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>he was the guy that would give girls the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder rubs.</v>

1437
01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.840
<v Speaker 2>He would tell them to massage him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1438
01:02:56.841 --> 01:02:59.750
<v Speaker 2>he was massage them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did massage him.</v>

1439
01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:02.420
<v Speaker 2>He would do according to these girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true,</v>

1440
01:03:02.421 --> 01:03:03.254
<v Speaker 2>but he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be the guy that I'll be right back </v>

1441
01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.610
<v Speaker 2>and he comes back in a bathrobe bathrobe</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1442
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.010
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

1443
01:03:10.011 --> 01:03:10.844
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to make light of anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual assault or whatever it was or </v>

1444
01:03:15.261 --> 01:03:17.300
<v Speaker 2>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other working on the roof again,</v>

1445
01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:18.560
<v Speaker 2>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1446
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.480
<v Speaker 2>but what I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

1447
01:03:20.481 --> 01:03:23.770
<v Speaker 2>how many women said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fuck load.</v>

1448
01:03:23.771 --> 01:03:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Like that was his move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're seeing is his missed pitches,</v>

1449
01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:28.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1450
01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:32.060
<v Speaker 2>He hit a lot of fucking triples and home</v>
<v Speaker 2>runs,</v>

1451
01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.013
<v Speaker 2>knocked a lot of balls out of the park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally he was whipping </v>

1452
01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:37.670
<v Speaker 2>occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1453
01:03:37.671 --> 01:03:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I got this one in the back boys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

1454
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.630
<v Speaker 2>fuck off you pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1455
01:03:41.631 --> 01:03:42.200
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1456
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Just come back to my room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1457
01:03:43.251 --> 01:03:43.630
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1458
01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut down.</v>

1459
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvey just wasn't connecting.</v>

1460
01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't connecting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but listen,</v>

1461
01:03:49.131 --> 01:03:51.560
<v Speaker 2>I got all this girl wants to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next [inaudible],</v>

1462

<v Speaker 2>16.</v>

1463
01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Willing to do the thing to get the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of okay.</v>

1464
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then then like that guys,</v>

1465
01:04:00.331 --> 01:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>they can get the part and get your money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get on with it.</v>

1466
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.353
<v Speaker 2>How many girls read the story when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>broke and could still taste the </v>

1467
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.733
<v Speaker 2>asparagus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caviar flavored come just the cocaine </v>

1468
01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:18.240
<v Speaker 2>and vodka in his loads and I bet he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Flemmi like Moan when he comes.</v>

1469
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.650
<v Speaker 2>He's a kind of get sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1470
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:31.603
<v Speaker 1>Battle in the corners of his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he talked to you trying to hit on </v>

1471
01:04:34.401 --> 01:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a little bit bubble lip.</v>

1472
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.220
<v Speaker 1>He nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty,</v>

1473
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.083
<v Speaker 1>nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a gluttonous man right out of </v>

1474
01:04:43.551 --> 01:04:44.870
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not attractive.</v>

1475
01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.153
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite too is that he would jerk </v>

1476
01:04:48.171 --> 01:04:49.700
<v Speaker 1>off into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear this?</v>

1477
01:04:49.701 --> 01:04:50.534
<v Speaker 1>But he plants was green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to exist off of his loads but </v>

1478
01:04:56.091 --> 01:04:58.160
<v Speaker 1>that's such a desperate thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like come over.</v>

1479
01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.240

<v Speaker 1>Can I have it?</v>

1480
01:04:59.241 --> 01:04:59.811
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1481
01:04:59.811 --> 01:05:00.950

<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1483
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.130
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was hoping they would just dive</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a grenade.</v>

1484
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Gave a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know so</v>

1485
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>like I was thinking too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1486
01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.493
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen so many dudes jerking off in </v>

1487
01:05:14.031 --> 01:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>public like homeless guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got anything for it.</v>

1488
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1489
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 2>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:24.123
<v Speaker 2>You guys look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about male versus </v>

1491
01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:28.810
<v Speaker 2>female sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1492
01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Is the accepting part of female sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus the giving,</v>

1493
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.140
<v Speaker 2>like trying to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take this,</v>

1494
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.033
<v Speaker 2>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is that men take it </v>

1495
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.720
<v Speaker 2>literally or constantly building come </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're alive.</v>

1496
01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.600
<v Speaker 2>You come as backing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're,</v>

1497
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.970
<v Speaker 2>if you're not like I used to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit in my art,</v>

1498
01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:49.893
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really based on advice that I </v>

1499
01:05:51.371 --> 01:05:54.750
<v Speaker 2>used to give friends when they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no girl wants to get marines.</v>

1500
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I listened me jerk off first and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it like if you're,</v>

1501
01:05:59.741 --> 01:06:01.900
<v Speaker 2>if you're having a hard time with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone and you're,</v>

1502
01:06:01.901 --> 01:06:02.734
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to do and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to see them jerk off first and </v>

1503
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 2>then see them and then you'll be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with them without any sexual lust.</v>

1504
01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.330
<v Speaker 2>You won't make it because of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as a young man,</v>

1505
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:16.990
<v Speaker 2>this is a real issue with me when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my twenties because I was so horny,</v>

1506
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:20.020
<v Speaker 2>it was like I was a drug addict so I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1507
01:06:20.021 --> 01:06:20.854
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like making agreements with </v>

1508
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:22.091
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1509
01:06:22.091 --> 01:06:22.924
<v Speaker 2>she's annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's going to let me have sex with </v>

1510
01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so listen,</v>

1511
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:25.863
<v Speaker 2>just let's just change our behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mold to what she likes and then you'll </v>

1512
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:32.830
<v Speaker 2>get the fucker is that's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like otherwise just be beating off.</v>

1513
01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:33.843
<v Speaker 2>But I remember one time I was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go out with this girl and she was </v>

1514
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:40.930
<v Speaker 2>just so preposterously annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so frustrating.</v>

1515
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 2>She just was always negative and before </v>
<v Speaker 2>we went out,</v>

1516
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:47.830
<v Speaker 2>before I went to go get her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jerked off and I was sitting there.</v>

1517
01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>

1518
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even enjoy her company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not compatible with me.</v>

1519
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.193
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you would just like someone as a </v>

1520
01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:59.260
<v Speaker 2>person and you like having sex with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1521
01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.213
<v Speaker 2>That's a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you only like having sex with </v>

1522
01:07:02.411 --> 01:07:03.244
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some sort of a weird bartered </v>

1523
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:05.703
<v Speaker 2>deal and that's a lot of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of men get in and I'm sure a lot </v>

1524
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:09.874
<v Speaker 2>of women probably too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can only speak for men like men </v>

1525
01:07:12.281 --> 01:07:13.114
<v Speaker 2>get involved in these relationships </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're really just in a </v>

1526
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:16.594
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that you have a continuous supply of </v>

1527
01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:21.100
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're young and stupid.</v>

1528
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.770
<v Speaker 2>When you're 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically a monkey.</v>

1529
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:24.651
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1530
01:07:24.651 --> 01:07:25.484
<v Speaker 2>you're just like a little eight person </v>
<v Speaker 2>just trying to fuck and you just try to </v>

1531
01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.200
<v Speaker 2>love her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's really cool.</v>

1532
01:07:29.201 --> 01:07:30.090
<v Speaker 2>And why do you love her?</v>

1533
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Because she smells good because her tits</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel good in your mouth.</v>

1534
01:07:32.411 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is really going on?</v>

1535
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you actually enjoy her company as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being outside of sex?</v>

1536
01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:40.290
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1537
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.163
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you could just jerk off first </v>

1538
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>and then hang out with someone you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually liked them,</v>

1539
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:51.280
<v Speaker 2>like then you have a real relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oh I really like you.</v>

1540
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you clear out the pipes,</v>

1541
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 2>clear out the testosterone and think </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly super smart.</v>

1542
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm just guessing.</v>

1543
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.093
<v Speaker 2>I've never been a media mogul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine there's a bunch of </v>

1544
01:08:07.631 --> 01:08:09.400
<v Speaker 2>factors going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1545
01:08:09.401 --> 01:08:13.950
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly kissing his ass and rubbing.</v>

1546
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:14.913
<v Speaker 2>Like I saw a picture him with Renee </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zellweger and Renee Zellweger was like </v>

1547
01:08:18.831 --> 01:08:19.664
<v Speaker 2>cuddling up with them and she had her </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand on him and he had his arm on her </v>

1548
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.100
<v Speaker 2>and there was some other celebrity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his right and there were like,</v>

1549
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:25.641
<v Speaker 2>Yuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yuck,</v>

1550
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:26.474
<v Speaker 2>Yuck it up.</v>

1551
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:30.650
<v Speaker 2>But he was like pawn her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a hold of her and I would imagine</v>

1552
01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:31.484
<v Speaker 2>that there's all these people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize that he's just like epicenter </v>

1553
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:39.431
<v Speaker 2>of power and success and you want Harvey</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein of Miramax to love you and you</v>

1554
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:42.254
<v Speaker 2>would get close to him and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of drinks and you're doing coke </v>

1555
01:08:45.201 --> 01:08:45.800
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1556
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.633
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got her hand on his leg and he's </v>

1557
01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:53.230
<v Speaker 2>got Russell Crowe to his right and Renee</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zellweger to his left and she's smiling.</v>

1558
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:56.360
<v Speaker 2>They're probably hammered and everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Xanax.</v>

1559
01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Next scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got his dick in her butt.</v>

1560
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:00.650
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1561
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:04.610
<v Speaker 2>She's imagining Jones' diary number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number six.</v>

1562
01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine with me.</v>

1563
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:06.644
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that really happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that it's not just that </v>

1564
01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:14.150
<v Speaker 2>he was predatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was also that he lived.</v>

1565
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1566
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.903
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an apologist folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine that he lived in </v>

1567
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:23.660
<v Speaker 2>this world where he was like royalty.</v>

1568
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.380
<v Speaker 2>He was essentially like the king of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>empire.</v>

1569
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had all these employees is one of</v>

1570
01:09:29.811 --> 01:09:30.644
<v Speaker 2>the articles that I read today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was from the Telegraph where </v>

1571
01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:34.760
<v Speaker 2>this guy was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1572
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:35.773
<v Speaker 2>he was at a party or one of his friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>was at a party and they were having a </v>

1573
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:41.084
<v Speaker 2>conversation with this girl who worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Harvey and Harvey just set her name </v>

1574
01:09:46.221 --> 01:09:47.054
<v Speaker 2>from across the room and her face went </v>
<v Speaker 2>pale and she immediately just ran away </v>

1575
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:52.130
<v Speaker 2>from him to run to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like didn't say,</v>

1576
01:09:52.131 --> 01:09:53.540
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be right back.</v>

1577
01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Just ran at a fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1578
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.670
<v Speaker 2>That is obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

1579
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:58.603
<v Speaker 2>Can he be interpretation after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be exaggeration of what the </v>

1580
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.430
<v Speaker 2>actual circumstances were to fit a </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

1581
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.530
<v Speaker 2>but you got to imagine that this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just multimodal tie millionaire.</v>

1582
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Just orgiastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gluttonous.</v>

1583
01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Jabba the Hutt motherfucker just getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>as.</v>

1584
01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:20.220
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to be the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest driver.</v>

1585
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also these girls he </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get and he's like close to them,</v>

1586
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:29.510
<v Speaker 1>close to the anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1587
01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:30.344
<v Speaker 1>Listen Christina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the one that he cut his hand on </v>

1588
01:10:31.851 --> 01:10:32.684
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best when they come into my </v>

1589
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.530
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about this.</v>

1590
01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.150
<v Speaker 1>A proposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a proposal.</v>

1591
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:40.120
<v Speaker 1>You come up to his room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a bathrobe on.</v>

1592
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.963
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1593
01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My neck is tense.</v>

1594
01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to send you like coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about cocaine?</v>

1595
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Caviar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine carrier altogether that is.</v>

1596
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:57.230
<v Speaker 1>He is unbelievably him and I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1597
01:10:57.231 --> 01:11:00.560
<v Speaker 1>and I know Hugh hefner was a big mogul </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did a lot of cool shit.</v>

1598
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Not For me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a tough gig to like living</v>

1599
01:11:04.971 --> 01:11:09.650
<v Speaker 1>in the mansion and being one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls come over for movie night,</v>

1600
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:10.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's in his pajamas and you know </v>

1601
01:11:11.961 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>that he bought them because</v>

1602
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.090
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to get anyone pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I read in.</v>

1603
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:20.780
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly Holly Madison wrote,</v>

1604
01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.390
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that her name is Dolly Madison.</v>

1605
01:11:23.391 --> 01:11:24.224
<v Speaker 3>Is the pastry like who the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have to worry about birth </v>

1606
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:31.620
<v Speaker 3>controls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1607
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:32.454
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a lot of like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would make the girls make out in </v>

1608
01:11:35.131 --> 01:11:37.680
<v Speaker 3>front of him and then he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>masturbate too.</v>

1609
01:11:37.681 --> 01:11:38.514
<v Speaker 3>It's also kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is a way of avoiding possible </v>

1610
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.280
<v Speaker 3>pregnancies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we developed a strategy over year.</v>

1611
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:48.160
<v Speaker 3>They're like ducking pregnancies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1612
01:11:48.161 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird thing to write,</v>

1613
01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:50.844
<v Speaker 3>to be putting yourself out there as this</v>
<v Speaker 3>person with a lot of money who really </v>

1614
01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:56.550
<v Speaker 3>loves young girls and the young girls </v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

1615
01:11:56.551 --> 01:12:01.520
<v Speaker 3>All I have to do is catch one load at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right time.</v>

1616
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.483
<v Speaker 3>Stories about athletes that girls put </v>
<v Speaker 3>holes in the condoms or the girl girls </v>

1617
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.790
<v Speaker 3>take the condoms out of the trash and </v>
<v Speaker 3>score them into their posting.</v>

1618
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How was I born,</v>

1619
01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Mommy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1620
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:16.014
<v Speaker 3>it's a lovely story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Umami Umami took a condom like one of </v>

1621
01:12:20.131 --> 01:12:23.820
<v Speaker 3>the pastry bags and quarter that fucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1622
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Well your mother fish to filthy condom </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the trash.</v>

1623
01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 3>I tended to throw it in the toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had one saved in my mouth.</v>

1624
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Spit that one in the toilet and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>why you're alive.</v>

1625
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:40.103
<v Speaker 3>Wild wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I heard that the playboy </v>

1626
01:12:42.781 --> 01:12:46.130
<v Speaker 3>mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wrote that it was run down and uh,</v>

1627
01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.380
<v Speaker 3>they had like bunk beds and shit in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rooms and like,</v>

1628
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:51.930
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't as glamorous as everybody.</v>

1629
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't touch factor fear factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>playmate edition.</v>

1630
01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:58.560
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>

1631
01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.513
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go see that at the grotto was </v>

1632
01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:03.234
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were the people that worked there </v>

1633
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:06.840
<v Speaker 3>were very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The girls were very nice,</v>

1634
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:10.590
<v Speaker 3>but there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that you're experiencing</v>

1635
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:13.470
<v Speaker 3>where it's like they don't have a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of options.</v>

1636
01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:17.070
<v Speaker 3>So it's like it's an option for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a part of this.</v>

1637
01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 3>And some of them loved it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them it was what they wanted.</v>

1638
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.400
<v Speaker 3>And for some of them there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sadness to it.</v>

1639
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:24.743
<v Speaker 3>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also some of them when we did </v>

1640
01:13:26.371 --> 01:13:27.204
<v Speaker 3>fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some of them were like older </v>

1641
01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:28.854
<v Speaker 3>playmates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they've been playmates like 10 years </v>

1642
01:13:29.941 --> 01:13:30.774
<v Speaker 3>ago or 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were like pushing 30 and maybe </v>

1643
01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:34.470
<v Speaker 3>even older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1644
01:13:34.471 --> 01:13:35.304
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do soon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what am I going to do in five </v>

1645
01:13:37.921 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do in 10 years?</v>

1646
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.090
<v Speaker 3>And then there's not a lot of answers on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the horizon.</v>

1647
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.133
<v Speaker 3>So they'll go looking for maybe some old</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich husband type character or maybe </v>

1648
01:13:48.031 --> 01:13:50.220
<v Speaker 3>some way out financially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1649
01:13:50.221 --> 01:13:52.200
<v Speaker 3>maybe have some business that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>start,</v>

1650
01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some clothing line,</v>

1651
01:13:53.271 --> 01:13:57.420
<v Speaker 3>like everyone's got a hustle and a scam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they essentially don't really have a</v>

1652
01:13:57.421 --> 01:13:57.960
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>

1653
01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.380
<v Speaker 3>They have like this sort of like opening</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this world.</v>

1654
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:03.510
<v Speaker 3>And then they would have the mansion </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties.</v>

1655
01:14:03.511 --> 01:14:04.440
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I,</v>

1656
01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I went to one for the marijuana policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>project.</v>

1657
01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I hosted this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this event.</v>

1658
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:12.790
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very weird.</v>

1659
01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 3>It was like they have bands playing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and you're just walking around and</v>

1660
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 3>just pot everywhere and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>stoned out of their mind.</v>

1661
01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:18.874
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an extra surreal because of the </v>

1662
01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 3>pot factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like you go by where,</v>

1663
01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.170
<v Speaker 3>where he had pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like birds and monkeys and shit.</v>

1664
01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is this place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's high as fuck,</v>

1665
01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.450
<v Speaker 3>but it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1666
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:33.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was no playmates for that one.</v>

1667
01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:34.294
<v Speaker 3>That was weird because that was one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones you rent out and so lecherous </v>

1668
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:39.580
<v Speaker 3>guys went there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will go to the mainland.</v>

1669
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:41.050
<v Speaker 3>They rented it out.</v>

1670
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Sweets?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1671
01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They rent out the use of the mansion.</v>

1672
01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can use the garage.</v>

1673
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.410
<v Speaker 3>You can come in the grotto where </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone else comes.</v>

1674
01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 3>General public want to jerk off in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grotto.</v>

1675
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they actually let people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the grotto.</v>

1676
01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:56.320
<v Speaker 3>When I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

1677
01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:59.030
<v Speaker 3>It was quite a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do remember like the,</v>

1678
01:14:59.031 --> 01:15:04.031
<v Speaker 3>the grotto had this phone from like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>19 seventies old ass fucked up fondly.</v>

1679
01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.960
<v Speaker 3>The upkeep on a place like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably super expensive.</v>

1680
01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:08.794
<v Speaker 3>There's the phone look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old wack ass phone and all the buttons </v>

1681
01:15:13.151 --> 01:15:13.984
<v Speaker 3>for the lights and Shit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't going to put money into </v>

1682
01:15:17.081 --> 01:15:19.390
<v Speaker 3>renovating that shit because he was old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1683
01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:22.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think there wasn't money.</v>

1684
01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:28.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mansion was a location that actually</v>

1685
01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 3>made money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1686
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:32.170
<v Speaker 3>because it was like a destination and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would rent it out for stuff,</v>

1687
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.360
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think the magazine was </v>
<v Speaker 3>making money.</v>

1688
01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.193
<v Speaker 3>I think the magazine was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggling once the Internet happened </v>

1689
01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:42.160
<v Speaker 3>and you can get pornography for free and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can actually see everything.</v>

1690
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.060
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1691
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why buy playboy?</v>

1692
01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:45.611
<v Speaker 3>Like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1693
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I can say purely can just see when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>took the.</v>

1694
01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:50.290
<v Speaker 3>They took nudity out for like a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1695
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:52.030
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did,</v>

1696
01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.680
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were.</v>

1697
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:54.850
<v Speaker 3>They were getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1698
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:58.500
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be maximum show girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1699
01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.453

<v Speaker 3>He did for a little while and just the </v>

<v Speaker 3>sales tanked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crashed even maximum smack,</v>

1701
01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:06.683
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a military base in the British ones </v>

1702
01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:10.023
<v Speaker 3>that they let them look at Teddy mags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can get maximum magazine and </v>

1703
01:16:13.571 --> 01:16:16.720
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not The American military does not allow</v>

1704
01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:17.554
<v Speaker 3>you to look at Teddy mags and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American military has a very high rate </v>

1705
01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.590
<v Speaker 3>of sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>

1706
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:27.640
<v Speaker 3>I've been to the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan and a lot of those bases and</v>

1707
01:16:27.641 --> 01:16:28.474
<v Speaker 3>I've heard bad stories is apparently a </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant issue that is very suppressed </v>

1708
01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:38.140
<v Speaker 3>because you're not dealing with like law</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like civilian law.</v>

1709
01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.560
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with like military law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1710
01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:43.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the real numbers are,</v>

1711
01:16:43.091 --> 01:16:46.660
<v Speaker 3>but I've read quite a few stories about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real issue.</v>

1712
01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.593
<v Speaker 3>If you don't give them an outlet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you have a bunch of people who </v>

1713
01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:52.630
<v Speaker 3>are watching their friends heads get </v>
<v Speaker 3>blown up.</v>

1714
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.673
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your whole reality is out the window </v>

1715
01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:57.694
<v Speaker 3>when you're at war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not excusing anyone for sexual </v>

1716
01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:00.124
<v Speaker 3>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying like the world that </v>

1717
01:17:02.801 --> 01:17:03.634
<v Speaker 3>you're living in at home and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in Afghanistan and bullets are </v>

1718
01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 3>whizzing by.</v>

<v Speaker 2>some sort of a parole deal is that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know guys that had to go in the army </v>

1725
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:23.300

1726
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.950

<v Speaker 4>those deals a lot.</v>

1728
01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did those deals.</v>

1729
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:29.720
<v Speaker 4>It's Kinda good though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1730
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:32.200
<v Speaker 4>when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would choose military over.</v>

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:33.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go put me in the boat.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:17:36.111 --> 01:17:36.944
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think because I was in Kuwait I think </v>

1735
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:41.870
<v Speaker 4>and they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1736
01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 4>guys coming out of active battle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1737
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.473
<v Speaker 4>they're just so whacked out and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what happens when they assault </v>

1738
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:49.160
<v Speaker 4>women and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

1739
01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1740
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.213
<v Speaker 2>You also have ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also have cte which leads to </v>

1741
01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:58.070
<v Speaker 2>impulsive behavior and cte or even know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that is.</v>

1742
01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sample.</v>

1743
01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how was the actual word of Patheon?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cephalopathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brain damage.</v>

1745
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.943
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially it's what football players </v>

1746
01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:12.260
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would boxers get MMA fighters,</v>

1747
01:18:12.261 --> 01:18:14.960
<v Speaker 2>get it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People with head injuries and one of the</v>

1748
01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:15.794
<v Speaker 2>things that is a part of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get impulsive and you do irrational </v>

1749
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:20.450
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughtless things,</v>

1750
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:22.430
<v Speaker 2>and you almost like you can't help </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

1751
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:23.930
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1752
01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:27.410
<v Speaker 2>they think that it's a responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>erratic changes in behavior,</v>

1753
01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:30.050
<v Speaker 2>violent behavior amongst athletes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have it,</v>

1754
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:32.660
<v Speaker 2>especially football players.</v>

1755
01:18:32.661 --> 01:18:33.494
<v Speaker 2>like really aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up things with football players </v>

1756
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:37.730
<v Speaker 2>have done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they attribute some of it to cte.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And it's boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like 19 year old boys that are just</v>

1773
01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:18.690
<v Speaker 4>getting blown up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stepping on IED like I go visit boys and</v>

<v Speaker 4>that are injured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel bad that they're not out </v>

<v Speaker 4>fighting next to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fighting with their company or </v>

1777
01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.193
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They feel guilty that they're not still </v>

1778
01:19:31.831 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 4>out there and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1780
01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.253
<v Speaker 2>He's got a great book called tribe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of it is about what happens </v>

1781
01:19:42.641 --> 01:19:47.170
<v Speaker 2>to people in times of war and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to soldiers,</v>

1782
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:48.783
<v Speaker 2>the comradery that they share together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that even though these harrowing </v>

1783
01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.970
<v Speaker 2>death filled moments of their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when they look back at it,</v>

1784
01:19:58.150 --> 01:20:00.880
<v Speaker 2>it was their favorite time of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that interesting?</v>

1785
01:20:00.881 --> 01:20:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people apparently his.</v>

1786
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of people believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people extreme struggled,</v>

1787
01:20:08.601 --> 01:20:13.601
<v Speaker 2>don't find meaning in life and that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dull gray cubicle life stuck in traffic,</v>

1788
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.450
<v Speaker 2>eating fast food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching TV,</v>

1789
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.360
<v Speaker 2>going to sleep by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the torture.</v>

1790
01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:22.463
<v Speaker 2>That's the torturous existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the existence of of battle and the </v>

1791
01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:26.154
<v Speaker 2>comradery that they share when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers are side by side fighting for </v>

1792
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.230
<v Speaker 2>their lives and and defending each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1793
01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:36.300
<v Speaker 2>The comraderies incredibly intense</v>

1794
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:37.243
<v Speaker 4>and the emotions are incredibly high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine too that that high </v>

1795
01:20:40.641 --> 01:20:42.870
<v Speaker 4>stakes your life is at stake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1796
01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.830
<v Speaker 4>and you have to take care of each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's so true.</v>

1797
01:20:45.831 --> 01:20:48.530
<v Speaker 4>There is nothing more depressing than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gray,</v>

1798
01:20:48.650 --> 01:20:49.580
<v Speaker 4>the grays,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and then the rock come like that.</v>

1803
01:20:58.110 --> 01:21:00.660
<v Speaker 2>The drone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drone of and nothing existence.</v>

1804
01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.633
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is what most people sell </v>

1805
01:21:03.511 --> 01:21:04.344
<v Speaker 2>their time for the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sell their eight hours everyday </v>

1806
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:08.243
<v Speaker 2>plus commuting to the drone time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just droning on and there are a lot of </v>

1807
01:21:12.271 --> 01:21:13.104
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those people are listening to </v>

1808
01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:18.590
<v Speaker 2>this right now and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about podcasts that's amazing for,</v>

1809
01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:22.530
<v Speaker 2>for that is like people get a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear the way other people live and think</v>

1810
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 2>and then realize like there is a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1811
01:21:24.661 --> 01:21:25.494
<v Speaker 2>I am alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm alive and my brain is working and I </v>

1812
01:21:27.931 --> 01:21:31.470
<v Speaker 2>can think and even though I'm stuck here</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have to pay my bills,</v>

1813
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.633

<v Speaker 2>I need to figure out my exit strategy </v>

1814
01:21:34.651 --> 01:21:38.310
<v Speaker 2>and I need to start moving on it now and</v>

1815
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:41.100
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge factor in people's futures</v>

1816
01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 2>to hear the fact that other people have </v>

<v Speaker 4>really acutely aware of my death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've always been very existential,</v>

1862
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 4>like I've always loved thinking about my</v>
<v Speaker 4>death because it frees me to be alive,</v>

1863
01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 4>but now at 40 1:41</v>

1867
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:58.090
<v Speaker 4>on this planet and it's really weighing </v>
<v Speaker 4>on me now more.</v>

1868
01:23:58.091 --> 01:24:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Especially now that I have a child and </v>

1880
01:24:29.821 --> 01:24:34.821
<v Speaker 2>imagine that don't enjoy exercise is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise is not an option.</v>

1881
01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a necessity for body maintenance.</v>

01:24:38.611 --> 01:24:39.720
<v Speaker 2>So all these people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You don't just have a heart attack and </v>

1888
01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:52.403
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You slowly rot away and then your body </v>

1889
01:24:55.771 --> 01:24:56.780
<v Speaker 2>gives out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

1892
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:09.790
<v Speaker 2>The quality of your time with exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>is far superior than the quality of your</v>

1893
01:25:09.931 --> 01:25:13.050
<v Speaker 2>time without exercise because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more relaxed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He body functions better,</v>

<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

1897
01:25:21.481 --> 01:25:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even open up a jar of pickles.</v>

1898

<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should devote a certain amount </v>

1904
01:25:36.721 --> 01:25:39.810
<v Speaker 2>of time per week for body maintenance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll feel better.</v>

1905
01:25:39.811 --> 01:25:41.670

<v Speaker 2>abilities.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of the everyday grind because your </v>

1909
01:25:47.161 --> 01:25:51.270
<v Speaker 2>body's experiencing some stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some workload.</v>

1910
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:53.850
<v Speaker 2>And by doing that and putting out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>

1925
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 4>they make you do it.</v>

1926
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Just don't just go and pay somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1927
01:26:33.031 --> 01:26:34.590
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people who don't have any money,</v>

1928
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:37.830
<v Speaker 2>if you can listen to this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means you have a computer,</v>

1929
01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:38.933
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully if you have a computer or if </v>

1930
01:26:40.801 --> 01:26:41.634
<v Speaker 2>you have a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a regular iphone or </v>

1931
01:26:42.961 --> 01:26:46.890
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go on youtube and you could play</v>

1932
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:49.290
<v Speaker 2>a yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of them.</v>

1933
01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:52.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to pay to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1934
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:55.260
<v Speaker 2>hot yoga I think is better because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like more strain in your body.</v>

1935
01:26:55.261 --> 01:26:56.940
<v Speaker 2>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regular Yoga is fine.</v>

<v Speaker 2>know kettlebell exercises,</v>

1940
01:27:05.041 --> 01:27:05.874

<v Speaker 4>we didn't have any money and the battle </v>

1946
01:27:21.131 --> 01:27:24.490
<v Speaker 4>was full and fucked up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to pay some fucking guy to</v>

1947
01:27:24.491 --> 01:27:26.980
<v Speaker 4>come here and just snake this thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's it.</v>

1948
01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:28.870
<v Speaker 4>And I learned how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went down to the hardware store,</v>

1949
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:30.150
<v Speaker 4>got the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to do it,</v>

1950
01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:32.790
<v Speaker 2>but if it got one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I got one of them power snakes,</v>

1951
01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:37.870
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking snake the shit out of my,</v>

1952
01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:42.870
<v Speaker 2>my watch my dogs in the shower and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just caked up with hair.</v>

1953
01:27:42.871 --> 01:27:44.430
<v Speaker 2>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had just like,</v>

1954
01:27:44.431 --> 01:27:45.264
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our Pi.</v>

1955
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:48.990
<v Speaker 2>But like I would pull it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drain like these big wads.</v>

1956
01:27:49.170 --> 01:27:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Especially Brutus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1957
01:27:50.601 --> 01:27:52.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Shiba Inu,</v>

1958
01:27:52.170 --> 01:27:56.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm a English bulldog mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of hair.</v>

1959
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:58.080
<v Speaker 2>And when I would watch him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shower,</v>

1960
01:27:58.081 --> 01:28:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I would pull these hunks and Marshall's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst though the goldens that worse.</v>

1961
01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.030
<v Speaker 2>You pull these giant chunks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's hair logged everything up.</v>

1962
01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.073
<v Speaker 2>So I just got one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snakes shoved it in there and it </v>

1963
01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:14.760
<v Speaker 2>follows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weighed down and cleans it all out.</v>

1964
01:28:14.761 --> 01:28:18.300
<v Speaker 2>And then the water flushes don't pump </v>
<v Speaker 2>that drain.</v>

1965
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit down there though.</v>

1966
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:21.080
<v Speaker 4>That eats away your pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1967
01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:21.923
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I was thinking I should </v>

<v Speaker 4>electrician while I was doing standup in</v>

1969
01:28:26.991 --> 01:28:27.824
<v Speaker 4>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as a day job because I for when </v>

<v Speaker 4>plumbing or your electricity is not a </v>

1973

<v Speaker 4>small job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the guy that knows how to do that </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your lights don't work or the thing </v>

01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:48.650
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1978
01:28:48.651 --> 01:28:50.450
<v Speaker 4>you have the knowledge of the power to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do this,</v>

1979
01:28:50.451 --> 01:28:51.284
<v Speaker 4>please help me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you think you should've become a </v>

1980
01:28:52.491 --> 01:28:56.450
<v Speaker 4>plumber just to learn it so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>do for yourself or to do it as a Gig.</v>

1981
01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.770
<v Speaker 4>That should've been my daytime job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you do that as a Gig,</v>

1982
01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:00.910
<v Speaker 4>that's not an easy gig to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy.</v>

1983
01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 4>You to have an apprenticeship.</v>

1984
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:07.310
<v Speaker 1>You learn how to deal with the union has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shit involved and you know what</v>

1985
01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:12.350
<v Speaker 1>skill it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also super long hours.</v>

1986
01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you're working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working hard like plumbers work,</v>

1987
01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the long hours.</v>

1988
01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping I could make my own hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more.</v>

1989
01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:20.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the good thing about something like </v>

1990
01:29:20.851 --> 01:29:22.590
<v Speaker 1>that though is you would have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights free.</v>

1991
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:24.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be so tired.</v>

1992
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>You need a lazy day job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I found for standup.</v>

1993
01:29:28.261 --> 01:29:31.080
<v Speaker 1>It was the best just to have like a nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>to five that I didn't give a shit about.</v>

1994
01:29:31.290 --> 01:29:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have to expend too much energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was your.</v>

1995
01:29:33.190 --> 01:29:34.023
<v Speaker 1>What would your nine to five job that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were when you first started making </v>

1996
01:29:36.211 --> 01:29:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it first started working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1997
01:29:38.410 --> 01:29:41.460
<v Speaker 1>the best job I ever had was at the girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>scouts of Greater Los Angeles.</v>

1998
01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:43.493
<v Speaker 1>That's the fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As John was part time and I would like </v>

1999
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:47.783
<v Speaker 1>help the girl scout cookie drive sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would answer phones and I was on </v>

2000
01:29:51.601 --> 01:29:52.434
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea lately at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would go to the round table and </v>

2001
01:29:55.501 --> 01:29:57.930
<v Speaker 1>then go work at the girl scouts like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next day.</v>

2002
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.980
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2003
01:29:58.981 --> 01:30:00.360
<v Speaker 1>it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun though.</v>

2004
01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:04.410
<v Speaker 1>It was like an easy paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let girls in the cub scouts now?</v>

2005
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:06.713
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is it vice versa to the cub scouts </v>

2006
01:30:09.271 --> 01:30:12.000
<v Speaker 1>are going to join the girl scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any boys are going to sign</v>

2007
01:30:12.001 --> 01:30:13.810
<v Speaker 1>up for the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2008
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.270
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How Binary?</v>

2009
01:30:16.170 --> 01:30:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Super Binary about my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh.</v>

2010
01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:23.250
<v Speaker 1>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so binary in our house.</v>

2011
01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:26.520
<v Speaker 1>We just bought my son a football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a football book.</v>

2012
01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It's in the shape of a football and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explains football to the boy.</v>

2013
01:30:29.501 --> 01:30:30.270
<v Speaker 1>You should do that.</v>

2014
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:31.103
<v Speaker 1>And right next to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a little dress and see which one to </v>

2015
01:30:32.311 --> 01:30:33.260
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2016
01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I fucking tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he chooses.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's so funny now that I have a son and </v>

<v Speaker 1>the other thing to have the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible start.</v>

2099
01:34:32.051 --> 01:34:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Everything is marketed that if you don't</v>

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you,</v>

2102
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I've known the human race now for 41 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2103
01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:42.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucking impressed and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried that my kid is behind all these </v>

2104
01:34:45.821 --> 01:34:49.090
<v Speaker 1>assholes because most people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really doing much anyway,</v>

2105
01:34:49.091 --> 01:34:51.190
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not so worried about getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

2106
01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:53.090
<v Speaker 1>He's fine by cracking his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2107
01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:56.410
<v Speaker 1>He needs his fucking net zero evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does anything by the way,</v>

2108
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know</v>

2109
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.170
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do know about it unfortunately.</v>

2110
01:35:00.171 --> 01:35:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went into it.</v>

2111
01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:03.380
<v Speaker 3>I had a lady on was written articles </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2112
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:07.730
<v Speaker 3>It was all invented by a guy who was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnetic healer in the 18 hundreds.</v>

2113
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:08.713
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's grandfathered in that we'd like to </v>

2114
01:35:09.891 --> 01:35:12.170
<v Speaker 3>think of as being legit source of </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>

2115
01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:15.020
<v Speaker 3>Like they call themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doctors didn't go to medical school,</v>

2116
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:16.363
<v Speaker 3>medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like they put leaches on </v>

2117
01:35:18.591 --> 01:35:19.640
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that kind of.</v>

2118
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:20.563
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just leaches might actually have a </v>

2119
01:35:21.531 --> 01:35:24.830
<v Speaker 3>medical benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the only thing that seems to help is</v>

2120
01:35:24.831 --> 01:35:28.550
<v Speaker 3>adjusting lower back for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alleviate some pain,</v>

2121
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:31.880
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is is like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychosomatic shit going on with people.</v>

2122
01:35:32.110 --> 01:35:35.240
<v Speaker 3>There's some placebo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like does that feel better?</v>

2123
01:35:35.241 --> 01:35:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

2124
01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.080
<v Speaker 3>I like you're looking forward to feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

2125
01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Just being touched feels better now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting a massage feels better,</v>

2126
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:44.390
<v Speaker 3>but there's no like one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2127
01:35:44.391 --> 01:35:46.250
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to an orthopedic surgeon,</v>

2128
01:35:46.251 --> 01:35:47.630
<v Speaker 3>you have a tear in your knee.</v>

2129
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:51.260
<v Speaker 3>They replace your acl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking real.</v>

2130
01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.080
<v Speaker 3>They really fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2131
01:35:53.210 --> 01:35:54.140
<v Speaker 3>if someone just takes you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>about the sun.</v>

<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>

2139
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:07.850
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying to have somebody do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2140
01:36:07.851 --> 01:36:10.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>did not dissolve.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just listened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she can get through life and not have</v>

2149
01:36:33.471 --> 01:36:36.050

<v Speaker 3>strangled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2154
01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.000

<v Speaker 3>Like what's causing why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you're doing that?</v>

2157
01:36:50.841 --> 01:36:52.880
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence that that works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't do anything.</v>

2158
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about it.</v>

2159
01:36:54.681 --> 01:36:56.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't let anybody fucking crack me.</v>

2160
01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.210
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how prominent it is.</v>

2161
01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:00.073
<v Speaker 3>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a girl tell us when our son was </v>

2162
01:37:02.211 --> 01:37:05.990
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks old and he was crying like </v>
<v Speaker 3>around 5:00</v>

2163
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:07.940
<v Speaker 3>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it was his witching hour.</v>

2164
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Newborns often have the time of day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get cranky.</v>

2165
01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:12.860
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is our,</v>

2166
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.540
<v Speaker 3>our nanny at the time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but she'll charge you 50 because he's so</v>

2172
01:37:29.721 --> 01:37:30.760
<v Speaker 3>small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2173
01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when they do this thing.</v>

2174
01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.870
<v Speaker 3>They go near you with energy with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris.</v>

2175
01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had somebody new you will </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to blow your fucking brains out?</v>

2176
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I had a lady do it to me and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what it does,</v>

2177
01:37:43.641 --> 01:37:46.760
<v Speaker 3>but they hover over you over your </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chakra,</v>

2178
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:49.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the whole time I'm like,</v>

2179
01:37:49.641 --> 01:37:54.641
<v Speaker 3>I'm so angry that this person's dealing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I want to try it,</v>

2180
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:59.400
<v Speaker 3>because I had heard about it and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2181
01:37:59.401 --> 01:38:00.780
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it like a massage?</v>

2182
01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:04.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a massage,</v>

2183
01:38:04.021 --> 01:38:05.010
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2184
01:38:05.011 --> 01:38:05.844
<v Speaker 3>she doing reiki treatment session,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please give me some volume so I can </v>

2185
01:38:10.831 --> 01:38:13.830
<v Speaker 3>understand how she's healing her vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's hovering over a pussy.</v>

2186
01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:15.540
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this area is hot,</v>

2187
01:38:17.490 --> 01:38:19.500
<v Speaker 3>warm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might have syphilis.</v>

2188
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Go to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's up with your socks?</v>

2189
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:27.780
<v Speaker 3>He's given up on life with those socks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's shutting it down.</v>

2190
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I usually start at the bird.</v>

2191
01:38:30.721 --> 01:38:33.210
<v Speaker 3>I started at the third day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at her.</v>

2192
01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:34.530
<v Speaker 3>She's super healthy.</v>

2193
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:39.410
<v Speaker 5>Placing my hands on the client because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want to press into her eyes.</v>

2194
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:42.650
<v Speaker 3>You're not near her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy bitch.</v>

2195
01:38:42.710 --> 01:38:44.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's her third eye.</v>

2196
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry I'm.</v>

2197
01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:50.200
<v Speaker 5>Or approximately two to three minutes.</v>

2198
01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.190
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's infuriating it of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>demo.</v>

2199
01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:58.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to take you through each </v>
<v Speaker 5>one explaining what</v>

2200
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:59.990
<v Speaker 3>super healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking at her.</v>

2201
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.100
<v Speaker 3>She's got a chart on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's got to be legit.</v>

2202
01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:07.920
<v Speaker 3>The fucking short legitimize drawn like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a 19 sixties kung food diagram.</v>

2203
01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:12.600
<v Speaker 3>This is where the death touch is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will push my stupid chart.</v>

2204
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:13.643
<v Speaker 3>I had a lady cornered me at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>store and tell me the cheese or a reiki </v>

2205
01:39:16.531 --> 01:39:19.920
<v Speaker 3>healer and she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She made me put my hand down and I go,</v>

2206
01:39:19.921 --> 01:39:21.120
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>

2207
01:39:21.190 --> 01:39:24.300
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just to just so you can feel it,</v>

2208
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:26.160
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I feeling?</v>

2209
01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.900
<v Speaker 3>She was just put your hand out and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>empty your mind like,</v>

2210
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:30.420
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2211
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:33.810
<v Speaker 3>I put my hand down and she just hovers </v>
<v Speaker 3>their handover.</v>

2212
01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.710
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

2213
01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:36.060
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not open.</v>

2214
01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:37.440
<v Speaker 3>This is not going to work if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>open.</v>

2215
01:39:37.441 --> 01:39:37.771
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2216
01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:40.740
<v Speaker 3>well it's not going to work because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just hovered in your hand over me.</v>

2217
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:42.150
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Reiki healer.</v>

2218
01:39:42.151 --> 01:39:43.320
<v Speaker 3>I might pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're crazy.</v>

2219
01:39:43.321 --> 01:39:44.790
<v Speaker 3>You're out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2220
01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:46.080
<v Speaker 3>she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a shyster.</v>

2221
01:39:46.081 --> 01:39:47.330
<v Speaker 3>These are hucksters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2222
01:39:47.650 --> 01:39:48.483
<v Speaker 3>they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they believe some of </v>

2223
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:51.960
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to generalize them into</v>

2224
01:39:51.961 --> 01:39:52.794
<v Speaker 3>one giant group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of them must believe they're </v>

2225
01:39:54.721 --> 01:39:55.950
<v Speaker 3>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

2226
01:39:55.951 --> 01:39:58.100
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to believe it's working</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2227
01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.360
<v Speaker 3>It's that CBF.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2228
01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:00.590
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2229
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:01.433
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been hypnotized to stop smoking </v>

2230
01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:04.870
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes and it's been a lead on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stairs.</v>

2231
01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:06.110
<v Speaker 3>That's different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2232
01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:08.130
<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2233
01:40:08.131 --> 01:40:09.850
<v Speaker 3>but he knows this is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2234
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:11.780
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's what I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to.</v>

2235
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to see if you agree with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what standup is.</v>

2236
01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're killing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if I'm watching you,</v>

2237
01:40:19.051 --> 01:40:21.120
<v Speaker 3>if you're onstage and you're killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting in the back of the room.</v>

2238
01:40:21.150 --> 01:40:23.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm letting you think for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like caught in your trance,</v>

2239
01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:25.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2240
01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2241
01:40:28.401 --> 01:40:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I agree with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she's wrong.</v>

2242
01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Don't let her dress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting there and I'm allow.</v>

2243
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.040
<v Speaker 3>If you're killing and I'm locked into </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I'm really enjoying the show,</v>

2244
01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:39.083
<v Speaker 3>I'm allowing you to think for me and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>falling into this trance in sort of a </v>

2245
01:40:43.501 --> 01:40:46.020
<v Speaker 3>way and when and when you're making me </v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh,</v>

2246
01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:47.740
<v Speaker 3>then like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2247
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I have confidence in your thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>process that I'll let you take the reins</v>

2248
01:40:52.081 --> 01:40:53.650
<v Speaker 3>and I'll just sit back and have a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2249
01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

2250
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 2>think there's something to that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hypnotized for the first time last</v>

2251
01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:00.760
<v Speaker 2>year by a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name is vinny shoreman and he does a</v>

2252
01:41:00.761 --> 01:41:02.380
<v Speaker 2>lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a hypnotist,</v>

2253
01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:03.423
<v Speaker 2>but he also does a lot of work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters and he puts them in this state </v>

2254
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:06.904
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're entirely conscious while this is </v>

2255
01:41:08.341 --> 01:41:11.200
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he puts you in this very,</v>

2256
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:16.201
<v Speaker 2>very relaxed state and you go over </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you would like to work on or</v>

2257
01:41:16.811 --> 01:41:18.970
<v Speaker 2>go over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that perhaps are bothering you.</v>

2258
01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Go over things that are bothering you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the past.</v>

2259
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:22.323
<v Speaker 2>But what it is is about putting you in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of mind where you can just relax </v>

2260
01:41:26.861 --> 01:41:31.861
<v Speaker 2>and think and not be overwhelmed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraneous information or things outside</v>

2261
01:41:32.171 --> 01:41:34.170
<v Speaker 2>of your control that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2262
01:41:34.290 --> 01:41:36.660
<v Speaker 2>that's like as real as meditation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

2263
01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:37.590
<v Speaker 2>But this shit</v>

2264
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:41.130
<v Speaker 1>where I'm going to hover over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina and pretend I'm cooking.</v>

2265
01:41:42.330 --> 01:41:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The energy.</v>

2266
01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:46.500
<v Speaker 1>You're not open Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not open to it.</v>

2267
01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:47.363
<v Speaker 1>If my hand was a marshmallow right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for a bit because I'm roasting over </v>

2268
01:41:50.581 --> 01:41:55.581
<v Speaker 1>your pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She recovered her everything.</v>

2269
01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:59.460
<v Speaker 1>When she got to the vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stayed there for a long time.</v>

2270
01:41:59.610 --> 01:42:00.660
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

2271
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:05.550
<v Speaker 1>This is the area of your travels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where it all stems here.</v>

2272
01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Plus the heat coming out of your hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sweaty.</v>

2273
01:42:08.971 --> 01:42:13.971
<v Speaker 1>Smell them stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>

2274
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:17.680
<v Speaker 2>But people always want to find like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with me.</v>

2275
01:42:17.681 --> 01:42:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I have anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm living in traffic.</v>

2276
01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:22.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't like my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone fix me.</v>

2277
01:42:22.410 --> 01:42:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put needles in your head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all over the place.</v>

2278
01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:29.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a bunch of dog shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you done acupuncture?</v>

2279
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Well aligns too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hated it.</v>

2280
01:42:31.281 --> 01:42:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I was so angry the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hurts.</v>

2281
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:36.950
<v Speaker 1>It fucking hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hurt for me.</v>

2282
01:42:36.951 --> 01:42:37.581
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met.</v>

2283
01:42:37.581 --> 01:42:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she was doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having migraines.</v>

2284
01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 years ago.</v>

2285
01:42:42.531 --> 01:42:45.080
<v Speaker 1>But it's because I was on this birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill that was fucking with me.</v>

2286
01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2287
01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:47.330
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because you didn't get the needles.</v>

2288
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:49.980
<v Speaker 1>You know why it wasn't open enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Reiki.</v>

2289
01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you just Reiki the fist right </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

2290
01:42:57.410 --> 01:43:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Now go ahead and make a fist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it in your ass.</v>

2291
01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Feel the energy massager in her colon.</v>

2292
01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:08.763
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2293
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:13.230
<v Speaker 2>I only did it once and it was a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a chiropractor too.</v>

2294
01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:14.123
<v Speaker 2>So you had double bullshit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He adjusted my neck and then he stuck </v>

2295
01:43:17.581 --> 01:43:20.070
<v Speaker 2>needles in my head and he was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix my shoulder and I'm like,</v>

2296
01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.520
<v Speaker 2>how'd that go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turned out.</v>

2297
01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:26.190
<v Speaker 2>It was just a little slight little </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle poll that I needed to get over.</v>

2298
01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.173
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about psychics and </v>

2299
01:43:28.951 --> 01:43:31.350
<v Speaker 2>mediums?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit artists.</v>

2300
01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I go with.</v>

2301
01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:35.843
<v Speaker 2>I think it is entirely possible that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense things that we don't have an </v>

2302
01:43:40.621 --> 01:43:43.680
<v Speaker 2>understanding of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you feel something weird.</v>

2303
01:43:43.681 --> 01:43:44.514
<v Speaker 2>Like I was thinking about a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine yesterday and I hadn't talked to </v>

2304
01:43:46.801 --> 01:43:48.960
<v Speaker 2>him in awhile and he emailed me out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the blue.</v>

2305
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's coincidence.</v>

2306
01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the odds of it happening.</v>

2307
01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.593
<v Speaker 2>You got to think of how many times do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about your friend and they </v>

2308
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:00.610
<v Speaker 2>don't email you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2309
01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why is it then when you think about</v>

2310
01:44:04.341 --> 01:44:06.570
<v Speaker 2>them and they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it just going?</v>

2311
01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:07.483
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there are times where you </v>

2312
01:44:09.891 --> 01:44:12.830
<v Speaker 2>sense things that you don't have a sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

2313
01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a feeling that you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't understand and I think we</v>

2314
01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:18.523
<v Speaker 2>sent things about each other and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>their social cues that we're picking up </v>

2315
01:44:21.711 --> 01:44:22.544
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's maybe people give off </v>

2316
01:44:23.661 --> 01:44:24.494
<v Speaker 2>pheromones when they're upset me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe those trigger you because we were </v>

2317
01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:30.710
<v Speaker 2>sort of designed to avoid confrontation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and certain individuals,</v>

2318
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:32.143
<v Speaker 2>but I think this idea that they can look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you and like your family is from a </v>

2319
01:44:38.301 --> 01:44:39.830
<v Speaker 2>sense of farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Desert</v>

2320
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:44.950
<v Speaker 3>farm is your farm farming your plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so implants know what it is.</v>

2321
01:44:45.081 --> 01:44:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Is a potted plant sit by those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2322
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:54.520
<v Speaker 3>And you are close to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would that be a mother?</v>

2323
01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:55.820
<v Speaker 3>And My mother was a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mother.</v>

2324
01:44:55.821 --> 01:44:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2325
01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.660
<v Speaker 3>I see your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2326
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.360

<v Speaker 3>Is there an a in her name?</v>

2327
01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Magdalen man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2328
01:45:07.170 --> 01:45:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I went to see this lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knew everything about my mom.</v>

2329
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:12.310
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine went to a chiropractor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the chiropractor,</v>

2330
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.010
<v Speaker 3>a psych exam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and same shit.</v>

2331
01:45:16.011 --> 01:45:18.480
<v Speaker 3>Different toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to the chiropractor.</v>

2332
01:45:18.481 --> 01:45:20.260
<v Speaker 3>He knew all about my grandmother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2333
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:22.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you already know or you're psychic </v>

2337
01:45:27.581 --> 01:45:28.414
<v Speaker 3>rather still killing the chiropractor.</v>

2338

2342
01:45:41.651 --> 01:45:42.484

<v Speaker 3>way and you're giving them the </v>

2362
01:46:42.701 --> 01:46:44.320
<v Speaker 3>a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the lady was.</v>

2363
01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:45.513
<v Speaker 3>She was good because I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what it is is people can read </v>

2364
01:46:47.531 --> 01:46:49.830
<v Speaker 3>your unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one unconscious reading,</v>

2365
01:46:49.831 --> 01:46:51.600
<v Speaker 3>another unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine.</v>

2366
01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:55.530
<v Speaker 3>I feel like your father was an organist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I right?</v>

2367
01:46:56.050 --> 01:46:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the thing.</v>

2368
01:46:57.421 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 3>They're telling you things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>already know.</v>

2369
01:46:59.590 --> 01:47:00.423
<v Speaker 3>That's what drives me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking what's already a belief or </v>

2370
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:06.420

<v Speaker 3>What do you think about astrologers?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can't subscribe to.</v>

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.610
<v Speaker 3>How can you not believe you're such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scorpio?</v>

2380
01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:33.393
<v Speaker 3>It's silly when you can find traits in </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and all sorts of people that </v>

2381
01:47:36.871 --> 01:47:39.840
<v Speaker 3>match all sorts of different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could be a virgo.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Taurus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Leo?</v>

2386
01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I could read any,</v>

2387
01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:53.100
<v Speaker 3>any horoscope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it would probably apply.</v>

2388
01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I really wonder about.</v>

2389
01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are bullshit.</v>

2390
01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:57.813
<v Speaker 3>The real horoscope thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to the people that are </v>

2391
01:48:00.271 --> 01:48:02.190
<v Speaker 3>super into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

2392
01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:06.570
<v Speaker 3>They literally want to know what time of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day you were born,</v>

2393
01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:10.500
<v Speaker 3>what part of the world you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're like,</v>

2394
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:12.340
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a Gemini with a cancer ride.</v>

2395
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.273
<v Speaker 3>Park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut.</v>

2396
01:48:14.410 --> 01:48:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes my asshole pucker.</v>

2397
01:48:16.670 --> 01:48:17.503
<v Speaker 3>Like even hearing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a million alarm bells are </v>

2398
01:48:20.371 --> 01:48:20.881
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dum,</v>

2399
01:48:20.881 --> 01:48:21.511
<v Speaker 3>dum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dum,</v>

2400
01:48:21.511 --> 01:48:21.900
<v Speaker 3>dum.</v>

2401
01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:23.360
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only go.</v>

2402
01:48:24.250 --> 01:48:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Stan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hope you still get to the coast.</v>

2403
01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.350
<v Speaker 3>We have a funny bit about how ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2404
01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.360
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun.</v>

2405
01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:31.660
<v Speaker 3>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2406
01:48:31.661 --> 01:48:33.390
<v Speaker 3>it's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're searching.</v>

2407
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:35.370
<v Speaker 3>People are always searching for meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2408
01:48:35.371 --> 01:48:36.204
<v Speaker 3>We're always searching for someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows something that we don't hidden </v>

2409
01:48:38.311 --> 01:48:39.144
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The secrets to the universe because </v>

2410
01:48:40.141 --> 01:48:40.974
<v Speaker 3>there's so much uncertainty that leaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>open the possibility that someone has </v>

2411
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:45.210
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been gifted,</v>

2412
01:48:45.211 --> 01:48:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I have a gift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

2413
01:48:46.831 --> 01:48:47.641
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

2414
01:48:47.641 --> 01:48:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to a psychic once.</v>

2415
01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:53.220
<v Speaker 3>I went to an audition in New York and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just like,</v>

2416
01:48:53.230 --> 01:48:56.530
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walking to the train station.</v>

2417
01:48:56.531 --> 01:48:59.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to a psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went to the psychic and she's like,</v>

2418
01:49:00.450 --> 01:49:01.540
<v Speaker 3>you have a brother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2419
01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:06.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a psychic brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like maybe you have a brother you</v>

2420
01:49:06.931 --> 01:49:07.510
<v Speaker 3>don't know about.</v>

2421
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:08.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2422
01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:13.470
<v Speaker 3>My mom had me when she was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a sister shut the fuck up and she</v>

2423
01:49:13.471 --> 01:49:15.510
<v Speaker 3>made up a bunch of stupid shit and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking about,</v>

2424
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:19.620
<v Speaker 3>you're not sure what you want to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>

2425
01:49:19.621 --> 01:49:20.371
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2426
01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2427
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:24.390
<v Speaker 3>I think what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is terrible.</v>

2428
01:49:24.930 --> 01:49:27.780
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lady just tell me right before I</v>

2429
01:49:27.781 --> 01:49:29.490
<v Speaker 3>shot my specialist psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2430
01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you see in my future?</v>

2431
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:32.813
<v Speaker 3>And I knew that the special was coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she didn't even know that I did for </v>

2432
01:49:35.371 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 3>a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

2433
01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:37.403
<v Speaker 3>I see you as like an interior designer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just guessing you have a real flair for </v>

2434
01:49:44.071 --> 01:49:44.610
<v Speaker 3>style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got.</v>

2435
01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I certainly do not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the last thing I'm good at.</v>

2436
01:49:47.471 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 3>And where two different</v>

2437
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.540
<v Speaker 4>colored socks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bitch look at me.</v>

2438
01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:51.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know what I'm doing.</v>

2439
01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:54.730
<v Speaker 4>Crazy lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did you go see her?</v>

2440
01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:56.950
<v Speaker 4>Because there's a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a friend's podcast,</v>

2441
01:49:56.951 --> 01:49:59.620
<v Speaker 4>which they have mediums on and I thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll be,</v>

2442
01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:01.270
<v Speaker 4>it'll be silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll be fun.</v>

2443
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:02.660
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2444
01:50:02.661 --> 01:50:04.450
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got suckered in that day.</v>

2445
01:50:04.451 --> 01:50:06.190
<v Speaker 4>I think I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really did.</v>

2446
01:50:06.210 --> 01:50:09.840
<v Speaker 4>I know if I'm being honest because my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother died two years ago so I was Kinda</v>

2447
01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:10.970
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2448
01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that I looking back,</v>

2449
01:50:12.551 --> 01:50:13.384
<v Speaker 4>she did totally lead me down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your mother was kind of nutty </v>

2450
01:50:16.691 --> 01:50:17.980
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mother was mentally ill.</v>

2451
01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:19.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like legit,</v>

2452
01:50:19.450 --> 01:50:23.590
<v Speaker 4>like she was a borderline personality </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder and then had schizophrenia too.</v>

2453
01:50:23.591 --> 01:50:27.850
<v Speaker 4>So it was fucking whackadoodles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have to do like self audits?</v>

2454
01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:31.350
<v Speaker 4>You mean aggressive therapy for the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>decade or so?</v>

2455
01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:34.440
<v Speaker 4>Do you look into your own brand?</v>

2456
01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.730
<v Speaker 4>Go and my wacky 24 slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2457
01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.440
<v Speaker 4>Well that 20 percent more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2458
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:39.760
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was,</v>

2459
01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:41.253
<v Speaker 4>I grew up alone with my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my parents split and then I was raised </v>

2460
01:50:43.571 --> 01:50:48.571
<v Speaker 4>by a crazy person and so I've had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like relearn how to think and what's,</v>

2461
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:50.940
<v Speaker 4>what's the right way to do stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2462
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:51.783
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in therapy for a decade so </v>

2463
01:50:52.841 --> 01:50:54.400
<v Speaker 4>I've had to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2464
01:50:54.670 --> 01:50:56.770
<v Speaker 4>like I just had to relearn and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

2465
01:50:56.830 --> 01:50:58.510
<v Speaker 4>You totally can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2466
01:50:58.511 --> 01:51:00.160
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I and I just want to talk.</v>

2467
01:51:00.161 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't talk about it to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh poor me,</v>

2468
01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 4>I had this thing but just didn't let </v>
<v Speaker 4>people know.</v>

2469
01:51:04.421 --> 01:51:07.750
<v Speaker 4>If you did grow up kind of Wacky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can fucking fix your brain.</v>

2470
01:51:07.810 --> 01:51:09.070
<v Speaker 4>You can reorient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

2471
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:12.160
<v Speaker 4>you can change how you think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have to stay sick,</v>

2472
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:13.103
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2473
01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:14.830
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how often do you go to therapy?</v>

2474
01:51:14.890 --> 01:51:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Every week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2475
01:51:15.821 --> 01:51:18.250
<v Speaker 4>And if I don't like I feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I started,</v>

2476
01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:21.280
<v Speaker 4>I got to have a whole regimen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the exercise,</v>

2477
01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:23.710
<v Speaker 4>it's the therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's eating,</v>

2478
01:51:23.711 --> 01:51:24.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sleeping,</v>

2479
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:27.310
<v Speaker 4>it's got to do it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise,</v>

2480
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:28.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2481
01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I get out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what do you get out of the therapy?</v>

2482
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:32.203
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

2483
01:51:32.230 --> 01:51:33.063
<v Speaker 4>I believe in psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like getting back Friday and I like to </v>

2484
01:51:36.761 --> 01:51:39.280
<v Speaker 4>go back to the initial wound to the root</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause.</v>

2485
01:51:39.970 --> 01:51:41.850
<v Speaker 4>I like to go back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2486
01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.440
<v Speaker 4>because what happens is you get wounded </v>
<v Speaker 4>way back when,</v>

2487
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:46.540
<v Speaker 4>right at the childhood trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing,</v>

2488
01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:47.403
<v Speaker 4>and then you grow up and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>triggered by whatever stuff happens as </v>

2489
01:51:50.111 --> 01:51:50.944
<v Speaker 4>an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Except now you're all fired up and </v>

2490
01:51:52.211 --> 01:51:54.760
<v Speaker 4>you're all angry and you're so </v>
<v Speaker 4>overreacted and you don't know why.</v>

2491
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:55.623
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably not because of what </v>

2492
01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:56.320
<v Speaker 4>happened today.</v>

2493
01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 4>It's what happened back here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you resolve the ship back here,</v>

2494
01:51:59.950 --> 01:52:02.920
<v Speaker 4>then what happens today becomes a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearer and it works for me.</v>

2495
01:52:03.010 --> 01:52:04.510
<v Speaker 4>So it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2496
01:52:04.511 --> 01:52:06.340
<v Speaker 4>And don't think about what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2497
01:52:06.370 --> 01:52:08.750
<v Speaker 4>Think about why you feel weird about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on right now.</v>

2498
01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:09.633
<v Speaker 4>What is it really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did my husband really just look at me </v>

2499
01:52:11.351 --> 01:52:12.184
<v Speaker 4>funny and that's why I'm so furious </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this little thing or is this </v>

2500
01:52:15.911 --> 01:52:19.030
<v Speaker 4>something that's Mommy Daddy way back </v>
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>

2501
01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:19.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think a lot of us live from </v>

2502
01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.350
<v Speaker 4>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You live from the past wound.</v>

2503
01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:27.880
<v Speaker 4>You make all your decisions based on on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that programming,</v>

2504
01:52:27.881 --> 01:52:28.714
<v Speaker 4>so if you're fucking wires are crossed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to make bad decisions over </v>

2505
01:52:31.091 --> 01:52:31.924
<v Speaker 4>and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that anytime spent </v>

2506
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:38.890
<v Speaker 4>thinking about your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about the way you think,</v>

2507
01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:43.760
<v Speaker 4>just examining your own mind is as long </v>
<v Speaker 4>as you're really doing it justice.</v>

2508
01:52:43.761 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 4>So really being like so many people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't</v>

2509
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.700
<v Speaker 3>ever think about the way they think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2510
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:50.630
<v Speaker 3>they're just caught up in the whirlwind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life,</v>

2511
01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:54.200
<v Speaker 3>the momentum of their own existence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next thing you know,</v>

2512
01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:56.900
<v Speaker 3>they're like miserable and 50 and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing?</v>

2513
01:52:56.901 --> 01:52:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Where am I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where am I?</v>

2514
01:52:58.820 --> 01:52:59.653
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it's the divorce and remarriage to </v>

2515
01:53:02.991 --> 01:53:05.150
<v Speaker 3>someone who's going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to fix it.</v>

2516
01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:07.790
<v Speaker 3>He's going to fix it and he's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's my soul mate.</v>

2517
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have an affair.</v>

2518
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:11.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask out here.</v>

2519
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:16.250
<v Speaker 3>How's that gonna work for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start doing drugs,</v>

2520
01:53:16.251 --> 01:53:17.990
<v Speaker 3>alcohol overheating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2521
01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compulsive.</v>

2522
01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:21.710
<v Speaker 3>That'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll clear up this stuff,</v>

2523
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gambling,</v>

2524
01:53:22.701 --> 01:53:23.534
<v Speaker 3>one of the weirdest one to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many people that are compulsive </v>

2525
01:53:26.181 --> 01:53:29.180
<v Speaker 3>gamblers and I see the itch and them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get that itch.</v>

2526
01:53:29.690 --> 01:53:31.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm so scared to gambling.</v>

2527
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.390
<v Speaker 3>You go to Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2528
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it.</v>

2529
01:53:36.771 --> 01:53:38.780
<v Speaker 3>I know it's not from your work there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

2530
01:53:38.781 --> 01:53:39.614
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2531
01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked there a lot.</v>

2532
01:53:41.230 --> 01:53:42.063
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked there like three or four times </v>

2533
01:53:43.971 --> 01:53:44.804
<v Speaker 3>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2534
01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:50.110
<v Speaker 3>for the UFC and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I now spend zero time and casinos,</v>

2535
01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:51.773
<v Speaker 3>but I used to spend time because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows because I would stay in a casino </v>

2536
01:53:54.201 --> 01:53:55.034
<v Speaker 3>and then I would work in a casino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now I just stay outside of the </v>

2537
01:53:57.771 --> 01:54:01.250
<v Speaker 3>casino because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't enjoy being around that energy.</v>

2538
01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this frantic gambler energy.</v>

2539
01:54:04.161 --> 01:54:04.994
<v Speaker 3>We see these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk by the card tables and they're </v>

2540
01:54:06.291 --> 01:54:07.970
<v Speaker 3>just looking and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2541
01:54:07.971 --> 01:54:09.950
<v Speaker 3>You're like watching people in an opium </v>
<v Speaker 3>den.</v>

2542
01:54:10.530 --> 01:54:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2543
01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:13.730
<v Speaker 3>it's depravity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's low energy,</v>

2544
01:54:13.731 --> 01:54:16.700
<v Speaker 3>low frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the lightest synthetic,</v>

2545
01:54:16.701 --> 01:54:18.920
<v Speaker 3>the synthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time stops,</v>

2546
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:20.300
<v Speaker 3>the I don't like that.</v>

2547
01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:21.493
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what I figured out too is that </v>

2548
01:54:22.491 --> 01:54:24.590
<v Speaker 3>everyone's got the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the addictions,</v>

2549
01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:25.424
<v Speaker 3>the gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the compulsive behaviors because we're </v>

2550
01:54:27.441 --> 01:54:30.320
<v Speaker 3>afraid to feel the feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just afraid of the feeling,</v>

2551
01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:31.193
<v Speaker 3>the that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's also there is a reward </v>

2552
01:54:34.551 --> 01:54:37.010
<v Speaker 3>to winning and you're chasing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>reward constantly.</v>

2553
01:54:37.011 --> 01:54:37.844
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily know if it's a being</v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid of the feeling as much as being </v>

2554
01:54:41.361 --> 01:54:42.900
<v Speaker 3>addicted to the reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2555
01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was reading this article that the</v>

2556
01:54:45.141 --> 01:54:48.290
<v Speaker 3>guy who created likes on facebook was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that,</v>

2557
01:54:48.291 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only does he not use facebook,</v>

2558
01:54:50.301 --> 01:54:54.020
<v Speaker 3>now that he's got like a thing set up on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his computer where he can't go to reddit</v>

2559
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:57.560
<v Speaker 3>and his phone is set up or you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>download apps.</v>

2560
01:54:57.860 --> 01:54:58.693
<v Speaker 3>Like he doesn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like that whole like thing where </v>

2561
01:55:01.391 --> 01:55:04.270
<v Speaker 3>you go to check to see how many likes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got on a facebook post.</v>

2562
01:55:04.270 --> 01:55:05.900
<v Speaker 3>You may or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

2563
01:55:05.901 --> 01:55:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Reward system is entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's addictive and it triggers this,</v>

2564
01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:14.090
<v Speaker 3>this thing in people and that it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>hijack your mind.</v>

2565
01:55:14.150 --> 01:55:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was like literally like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>title of the article is that like,</v>

2566
01:55:17.811 --> 01:55:18.644
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this technology can hijack your mind </v>

2567
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:22.910
<v Speaker 3>without question at the reward system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2568
01:55:22.911 --> 01:55:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Like little rats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ding,</v>

2569
01:55:24.081 --> 01:55:24.441
<v Speaker 3>Ding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ding.</v>

2570
01:55:24.441 --> 01:55:25.720
<v Speaker 3>I got the cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cheese.</v>

2571
01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:27.640
<v Speaker 3>There's mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People in front of the slots.</v>

2572
01:55:27.641 --> 01:55:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2573
01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:32.090

<v Speaker 3>Just droned out.</v>

2574
01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:34.220
<v Speaker 3>But then when you're in the reward </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

2575
01:55:34.221 --> 01:55:35.054
<v Speaker 3>you're not thinking about the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bothering you and everything's </v>

01:59:13.501 --> 01:59:15.630
<v Speaker 2>standing up and then they get down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

2658
01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:19.170
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to imagine doing this shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2659
01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:20.083
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's really interesting is a lot </v>

2660
01:59:21.721 --> 01:59:22.554
<v Speaker 2>of these people that get into Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>are particularly talented at Jujitsu </v>

2661
01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:30.090
<v Speaker 2>because they have some amazing control </v>
<v Speaker 2>over their body.</v>

2662
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:33.630
<v Speaker 2>One of our best students from 10th </v>

01:59:41.001 --> 01:59:41.834
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking savage Jujitsu fighters </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the reasons why is because </v>

2667
01:59:45.441 --> 01:59:47.660
<v Speaker 3>they have this incredible control of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their body and that pant,</v>

<v Speaker 3>there's one that's going on right now.</v>

2686
02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:28.873
<v Speaker 3>It's not visual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a story on my friend Remy </v>

2687
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:32.203
<v Speaker 3>Warren on his instagram page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were on an island in Alaska and </v>

2688
02:00:36.621 --> 02:00:39.170
<v Speaker 3>they got attacked by a giant grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear,</v>

2689
02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:43.520
<v Speaker 3>a giant Kodiak Brown bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A thousand pound bear knocked him over,</v>

2690
02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:44.533
<v Speaker 3>ran through the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One guy was literally riding on the </v>

2691
02:00:46.761 --> 02:00:48.820
<v Speaker 3>bears back as it ran down the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little,</v>

2692
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:49.663
<v Speaker 3>the bear literally attacked and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so many people and everybody </v>

2693
02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:53.870
<v Speaker 3>scattered in certain directions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody got killed,</v>

2694
02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:58.550
<v Speaker 3>but they easily could have gotten killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's on his instagram page.</v>

2695
02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:01.160
<v Speaker 3>There's that video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also an instagram story.</v>

2696
02:01:01.161 --> 02:01:03.470
<v Speaker 3>If you using the APP and you click on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this little icon,</v>

2697
02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:07.690
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of those where you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 100 dots in a row and he broke it.</v>

2698
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:08.533
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he did it.</v>

2699
02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:12.560
<v Speaker 3>He broke a long video down into 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>second chunks.</v>

2700
02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:14.780
<v Speaker 3>You record the whole video and that will</v>
<v Speaker 3>take.</v>

2701
02:01:14.781 --> 02:01:16.670
<v Speaker 3>You got to take time to put it up on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

2702
02:01:16.671 --> 02:01:17.900
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how do you do?</v>

2703
02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:18.793
<v Speaker 3>How do you do one where they seamlessly </v>
<v Speaker 3>go into the other where there's no </v>

2704
02:01:21.771 --> 02:01:24.890
<v Speaker 3>breaks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just use the next 15 second part.</v>

2705
02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit of a pain.</v>

2706
02:01:27.381 --> 02:01:28.850
<v Speaker 3>That Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There might be a better way,</v>

2707
02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:30.800
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there's a better way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that there is,</v>

2708
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:33.950
<v Speaker 3>but the way he did is so seamless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there is a better way.</v>

2709
02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're better at it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

2710
02:01:37.570 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a thousand huge.</v>

2711
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:40.993
<v Speaker 2>Kodiak Brown bear charge them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had killed an elk and they had the </v>

2712
02:01:43.701 --> 02:01:44.534
<v Speaker 2>elk in camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to meet and camp and this bear </v>

2713
02:01:45.681 --> 02:01:48.620
<v Speaker 2>just ran over the top of the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full blast at them,</v>

2714
02:01:48.621 --> 02:01:49.454
<v Speaker 2>knocking people left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they said it was only because there </v>

2715
02:01:51.351 --> 02:01:53.720
<v Speaker 2>were so many of them that they survived </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nobody got hurt.</v>

2716
02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:54.763
<v Speaker 2>One guy hit the bear in the face with </v>
<v Speaker 2>ski poles with like trekking poles and </v>

2717
02:01:58.491 --> 02:02:00.320
<v Speaker 2>the bear scrambled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he said,</v>

2718
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:01.363
<v Speaker 2>literally there was giant gnashing teeth</v>
<v Speaker 2>inches from his face and everyone went </v>

2719
02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:09.260
<v Speaker 2>full bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone went full reptilian.</v>

2720
02:02:09.261 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 2>They didn't see a common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had bear spray and pistols,</v>

2721
02:02:11.901 --> 02:02:13.550
<v Speaker 2>but they couldn't get to them in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2722
02:02:13.551 --> 02:02:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you think you can handle this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you think you're prepared though,</v>

2723
02:02:16.271 --> 02:02:17.870
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've done this next time.</v>

2724
02:02:17.871 --> 02:02:18.704
<v Speaker 2>We should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2725
02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:19.371
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2726
02:02:19.371 --> 02:02:20.770

<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2727
02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:24.080
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea how you're gonna react </v>
<v Speaker 2>when a thousand pound bear runs at you.</v>

2728
02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hell No.</v>

2729
02:02:27.450 --> 02:02:30.500
<v Speaker 4>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had a rat in our house and I was like</v>

2730

<v Speaker 4>terrified of killing it and seeing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead in the.</v>

2731
02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.540
<v Speaker 4>But I was excited to put down those </v>
<v Speaker 4>traps,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the snap traps.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna fucking kill this thing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like the rat getting great in the tree.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I know when that motherfucker shitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>all over your house and shitting in your</v>

2740
02:02:57.141 --> 02:03:00.440
<v Speaker 4>kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all I want is to see in the hills</v>

2741
02:03:00.710 --> 02:03:02.090
<v Speaker 4>when you're in the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get rats.</v>

2742
02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:03.760
<v Speaker 4>No way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2743
02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:05.120
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know.</v>

2744
02:03:05.121 --> 02:03:07.460
<v Speaker 4>It's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that that rat thing.</v>

2745
02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:10.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean we eventually caught it because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>poisoned the fuck out of our yard.</v>

2746
02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:13.460
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2747
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:14.750
<v Speaker 4>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2748
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:17.960
<v Speaker 4>it felt good to kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm fucking showed up dead.</v>

2749
02:03:17.961 --> 02:03:19.520
<v Speaker 4>One day my kid was playing right next to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2750
02:03:19.521 --> 02:03:20.390
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

2751
02:03:20.391 --> 02:03:21.224
<v Speaker 4>it's here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was all stiff and I got to like </v>

2752
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:23.390
<v Speaker 4>throw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was good.</v>

2753
02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:26.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it really made me realize maybe this</v>

2754
02:03:26.391 --> 02:03:27.224
<v Speaker 4>is like whatever tangent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I'm becoming more of an </v>

2755
02:03:29.541 --> 02:03:30.374
<v Speaker 4>atheist to cause you start to realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it really just is like humans </v>

2756
02:03:35.031 --> 02:03:35.864
<v Speaker 4>versus the elements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just us trying to build a </v>

2757
02:03:38.331 --> 02:03:40.040
<v Speaker 4>fucking house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to keep the road.</v>

2758
02:03:40.041 --> 02:03:42.890
<v Speaker 4>And so trying to keep your shit safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bears from eating,</v>

2759
02:03:42.891 --> 02:03:44.720
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to keep your young safe,</v>

2760
02:03:44.721 --> 02:03:46.640
<v Speaker 4>trying to get them raised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2761
02:03:46.641 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just animals,</v>

2762
02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:50.840
<v Speaker 4>but we've got like cars and I phones and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

2763
02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:51.620
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2764
02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:54.710
<v Speaker 4>Well there's definitely a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shoot.</v>

2765
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like vision.</v>

2766
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:58.430
<v Speaker 4>I have this trap to trap one word </v>
<v Speaker 4>screams,</v>

2767
02:03:58.431 --> 02:03:59.830
<v Speaker 4>but oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a,</v>

2768
02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:00.793
<v Speaker 4>is it down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to find it out and I don't </v>

2769
02:04:01.881 --> 02:04:05.000
<v Speaker 4>remember exactly where he had it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got it up somewhere on instagram.</v>

2770
02:04:05.550 --> 02:04:07.160
<v Speaker 4>They caught them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good for him.</v>

2771
02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:09.290
<v Speaker 4>This is a good trap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have this one too.</v>

2772
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:10.760
<v Speaker 4>It's an electric one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

2773
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:13.100
<v Speaker 4>but he was hearing them in his walls and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2774
02:04:14.890 --> 02:04:17.750
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen rats on Netflix?</v>

2775
02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:19.100
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wwe.</v>

2776
02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:20.080
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2777
02:04:20.150 --> 02:04:22.490
<v Speaker 4>the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop what you're doing because I'm about</v>

2778
02:04:22.491 --> 02:04:27.491
<v Speaker 4>to ruin this documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rats on Netflix now,</v>

2779
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:32.030
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking amazing.</v>

2780
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:34.730
<v Speaker 4>It's so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're nasty as fuck.</v>

2781
02:04:34.731 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so and he realized how many</v>

2782
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:39.630
<v Speaker 3>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many.</v>

2783
02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:43.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh my asshole just tangled and I knew it</v>
<v Speaker 3>overrun.</v>

2784
02:04:44.370 --> 02:04:48.150
<v Speaker 3>They say the weight in humans and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight and rats might be the same.</v>

2785
02:04:49.090 --> 02:04:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weight,</v>

2786
02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:51.193
<v Speaker 3>the weight and the weight of rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there might be as many pounds of </v>

2787
02:04:55.591 --> 02:04:58.440
<v Speaker 3>rat as there are pounds of p.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one theory.</v>

2788
02:04:58.441 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 3>They don't know like it's just guesswork</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many rats there are,</v>

2789
02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:03.960
<v Speaker 3>but they're convinced there's as many </v>
<v Speaker 3>rats as there are people.</v>

2790
02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:09.690
<v Speaker 3>There's 7 million people in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 7 million rats,</v>

2791
02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:13.410
<v Speaker 3>but they say it might be as high as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body mass,</v>

2792
02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:16.800
<v Speaker 3>like the bio mass of rats in the biomass</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

2793
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.353
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I knew when I fucking found </v>

2794
02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:20.613
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ended up,</v>

2795
02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:21.600
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2796
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.480
<v Speaker 3>When you find one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch.</v>

2797
02:05:23.730 --> 02:05:24.563
<v Speaker 3>These unfortunate rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not part of the study were found </v>

2798
02:05:26.371 --> 02:05:28.560
<v Speaker 3>hung by the lower east side resident </v>
<v Speaker 3>last summer.</v>

2799
02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:31.020
<v Speaker 3>They hung rats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why they hang on.</v>

2800
02:05:31.021 --> 02:05:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Those are horrendous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2801
02:05:32.881 --> 02:05:35.820
<v Speaker 3>They hang them just to let all the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>rats.</v>

2802
02:05:35.821 --> 02:05:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Now listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't fucking neighborhood.</v>

2803
02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Let this be a warning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't see those Cuban rats.</v>

2804
02:05:43.290 --> 02:05:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My husband went there once and they're.</v>

2805
02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:47.700
<v Speaker 3>They're called Nutria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2806
02:05:47.701 --> 02:05:48.534
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2807
02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:51.570
<v Speaker 3>They have those in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hunt them.</v>

2808
02:05:52.110 --> 02:05:55.470
<v Speaker 3>They apparently they taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2809
02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People Cook them.</v>

2810
02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like God.</v>

2811
02:05:58.621 --> 02:06:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Did Anthony Bordain have it on a show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>

2812
02:06:01.230 --> 02:06:04.290
<v Speaker 3>it was on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another show was on someone's show.</v>

2813
02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.213
<v Speaker 3>Someone had a show about a like edible </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild animals that people take for </v>

2814
02:06:09.841 --> 02:06:11.310
<v Speaker 3>granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was called,</v>

2815
02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:14.610
<v Speaker 3>but he cooked nutria and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>

2816
02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:17.970
<v Speaker 3>He made like this casserole or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Uganda.</v>

2817
02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:20.190
<v Speaker 3>In Uganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2818
02:06:20.730 --> 02:06:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in the south because I think.</v>

2819
02:06:22.411 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 3>And you've got to attend.</v>

2820
02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:25.380
<v Speaker 3>They fed him a rat and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's delicious.</v>

2821
02:06:25.381 --> 02:06:28.830
<v Speaker 3>And you just knew that he was painting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a yellow curry sauce.</v>

2822
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I had squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear it's greasy.</v>

2823
02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I had.</v>

2824
02:06:32.401 --> 02:06:34.110
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't greasy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was good.</v>

2825
02:06:34.290 --> 02:06:38.010
<v Speaker 3>It tasted good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't taste bad is bad,</v>

2826
02:06:38.011 --> 02:06:39.170
<v Speaker 3>but it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2827
02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:40.980
<v Speaker 3>you've got to think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's eating acorns.</v>

2828
02:06:41.310 --> 02:06:42.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2829
02:06:43.410 --> 02:06:45.300
<v Speaker 3>it's probably just like rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2830
02:06:45.301 --> 02:06:50.301
<v Speaker 3>have you ever eat squirrels?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably saying I've had a rattle snake.</v>

2831

<v Speaker 3>Jambalaya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I like alligator.</v>

2834
02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:57.630

<v Speaker 3>a buddy of mine.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're basically shooting a purse.</v>

2837
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:06.600
<v Speaker 3>When I was on road rules back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Viagara cocaine 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposed to 65.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

2975
02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Question.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is not balanceable.</v>

2978
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:31.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2979
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:32.050
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do this,</v>

2980
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.200
<v Speaker 3>especially in today's culture where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2981
02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:36.300
<v Speaker 3>there's no hall pass anymore for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

2982
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:37.223
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just got to go into hiding or like </v>

2983
02:13:39.241 --> 02:13:40.074
<v Speaker 3>bill cosby do the complete deflection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know what these images are </v>

2984
02:13:43.411 --> 02:13:45.960
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's in total denial,</v>

2985
02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:48.570
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a blind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2986
02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Cosby's almost completely blind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that.</v>

2987
02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:53.250
<v Speaker 3>It's weird when you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2988
02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:56.130
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2989
02:13:56.820 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like my body is failing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>his reality.</v>

2990
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:05.190
<v Speaker 3>The evils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making them blind.</v>

2991
02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:07.950
<v Speaker 3>I was a fan of his in a big way when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a little kid.</v>

2992
02:14:07.951 --> 02:14:08.784
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember listening to a bill cosby </v>

2993
02:14:11.191 --> 02:14:15.420
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean his eyes were all fucked up.</v>

2994
02:14:15.421 --> 02:14:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Now guys like really aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>glaucoma.</v>

2995
02:14:17.641 --> 02:14:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Go with the one above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the art,</v>

2996
02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:23.400
<v Speaker 3>the folded hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that picture right there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

2998
02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:29.573
<v Speaker 3>It's just so weird to go from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture to the one in the upper right </v>

2999
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:36.000
<v Speaker 3>where he's smiling like what happened?</v>

3000
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:37.303
<v Speaker 3>Like this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the guy we thought we were </v>

3001
02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:39.624
<v Speaker 3>getting right now that we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jello pudding America looking at me </v>

3002
02:14:44.241 --> 02:14:45.074
<v Speaker 3>smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you were the girl who this </v>

<v Speaker 3>sweetheart.</v>

3005
02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:52.531
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3006

<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

3007
02:14:54.170 --> 02:14:56.310
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking people's humanity.</v>

3008
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:59.070
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Hugh hefner thing,</v>

3010
02:15:01.591 --> 02:15:04.290
<v Speaker 3>They know what they're signing up for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not dragging anybody.</v>

3011
02:15:04.650 --> 02:15:05.351
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3012
02:15:05.351 --> 02:15:07.460
<v Speaker 3>and everyone's kind of aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3013
02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:10.590
<v Speaker 3>it's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be great,</v>

3014
02:15:10.620 --> 02:15:12.540
<v Speaker 3>but there is an exchange here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get free rent.</v>

3015
02:15:13.230 --> 02:15:16.290
<v Speaker 3>The Pajama thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even Harvey's not drugging anybody.</v>

3016
02:15:16.590 --> 02:15:18.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that we don't know yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3017
02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:20.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm just talking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>

3018
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm for the stories that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here and he's just like,</v>

3019

<v Speaker 3>like again throwing.</v>

3020
02:15:26.710 --> 02:15:27.543

<v Speaker 3>he's missing a lot of pitches like over </v>

3021
02:15:29.701 --> 02:15:30.511
<v Speaker 3>the years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3022
02:15:30.511 --> 02:15:31.344
<v Speaker 3>So if 25 women have come forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many did he just fucking knock it </v>

3023
02:15:34.921 --> 02:15:37.410
<v Speaker 3>out of the park?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inside the mind of Bill Cosby.</v>

3024
02:15:37.411 --> 02:15:38.244
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you wish we could really get in </v>

3025
02:15:40.141 --> 02:15:41.160
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like pills,</v>

<v Speaker 3>rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rerecord that humming and people are </v>

3027
02:15:43.681 --> 02:15:44.514
<v Speaker 3>asleep.</v>

3028
02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:50.910
<v Speaker 3>How is that your favorite too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I need you to be totally dead.</v>

3029
02:15:51.410 --> 02:15:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3030
02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:54.143
<v Speaker 3>I've heard theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the theories that I heard that </v>

3031
02:15:55.861 --> 02:15:56.694
<v Speaker 3>was kind of interesting is that when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are that much of a celebrity in a time </v>

3032
02:16:01.531 --> 02:16:03.710
<v Speaker 3>where there's no repercussions like pre </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>

3033
02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:04.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3034
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:06.780
<v Speaker 3>That your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3035
02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:10.200
<v Speaker 3>your thoughts of who you are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison to who other people are,</v>

3036
02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:13.440
<v Speaker 3>is that you really literally feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're royalty.</v>

3037
02:16:13.890 --> 02:16:15.690
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're better than other people.</v>

3038
02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:16.633
<v Speaker 3>Mean I worked at a casino wants and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>told me that this was before bill cause </v>

3039
02:16:19.421 --> 02:16:20.254
<v Speaker 3>we got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was when the allegations were just </v>

3040
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:25.530
<v Speaker 3>before they were even emerging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was before anything happened.</v>

3041
02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:26.513
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about how weird he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that he made the employees all sit </v>

3042
02:16:29.861 --> 02:16:32.260
<v Speaker 3>down and watch him eat curry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3043
02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:33.123
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to have everybody in that was </v>

3044
02:16:34.691 --> 02:16:36.250
<v Speaker 3>working there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>door people,</v>

3045
02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:37.000
<v Speaker 3>box office.</v>

3046
02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.610
<v Speaker 3>They had to sit in the room with him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch him while he ate.</v>

3047
02:16:40.390 --> 02:16:43.390
<v Speaker 3>And then he had a security guard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tuck him into bed,</v>

3048
02:16:43.391 --> 02:16:46.570
<v Speaker 3>like literally talk him into bed at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night when he went to sleep.</v>

3049
02:16:47.650 --> 02:16:48.483
<v Speaker 3>What's the curry though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wanted people to watch a meat and then </v>

3050
02:16:50.651 --> 02:16:51.860
<v Speaker 3>watch them take a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3051
02:16:52.090 --> 02:16:55.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could,</v>

3052
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:56.583
<v Speaker 3>you could be generous and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe it was like his way of </v>

3053
02:16:58.901 --> 02:16:59.734
<v Speaker 3>getting over stage fright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he gets over the feeling of people </v>

3054
02:17:02.261 --> 02:17:04.630
<v Speaker 3>watching him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he all these people staring at them</v>

3055
02:17:04.631 --> 02:17:06.970
<v Speaker 3>and then going onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it could be an effective strategy.</v>

3056
02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Like if you really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you have a room full of people that</v>

3057
02:17:11.171 --> 02:17:12.004
<v Speaker 3>are just staring at you and you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing normal stuff and then you go on </v>

3058
02:17:14.421 --> 02:17:16.600
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you've kind of relaxed.</v>

3059
02:17:16.710 --> 02:17:17.543
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

3060
02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Does that make any sense?</v>

3061
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:20.660
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3062
02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:23.660
<v Speaker 4>I meant does it does for somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 4>would.</v>

3063
02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:26.240
<v Speaker 4>Who would I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me personally,</v>

3064
02:17:26.510 --> 02:17:30.380
<v Speaker 4>the power move of doing that is such an </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole thing.</v>

3065
02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:31.491
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey everybody,</v>

3066
02:17:31.491 --> 02:17:33.620
<v Speaker 4>stop what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch me eat curry.</v>

3067
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:35.570
<v Speaker 4>It's so absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3068
02:17:35.571 --> 02:17:37.060
<v Speaker 4>do you really need that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that</v>

3069
02:17:37.210 --> 02:17:38.043
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the woman who was working there was </v>

3070
02:17:38.471 --> 02:17:40.320
<v Speaker 3>telling me that's how she was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

3071
02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:41.740
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so weird.</v>

3072
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.823
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how so?</v>

3073
02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:44.013
<v Speaker 3>And then she was just telling me all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these stories in the dressing room and </v>

3074
02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:49.210
<v Speaker 3>I'll be standing around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a power move though.</v>

3075
02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:50.980
<v Speaker 3>20 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a power.</v>

3076
02:17:50.981 --> 02:17:52.210
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hey,</v>

3077
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:53.770
<v Speaker 3>do do what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3078
02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Taught me in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tuck me,</v>

3079
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:57.960
<v Speaker 3>talk to me in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep it.</v>

3080
02:17:57.961 --> 02:18:02.961
<v Speaker 3>Climb in bed and you'd have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little Burrito Burrito.</v>

3081
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Read them and go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mood now who shot the light out?</v>

3082
02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:07.953
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:13.063
<v Speaker 3>I sing the praises of the fat shaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign and I think that shaming is </v>

3199
02:23:16.951 --> 02:23:17.784
<v Speaker 3>such a wonderful tool to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>jumpstart whatever it is that they need </v>

3200
02:23:21.601 --> 02:23:23.160
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people don't want to hear that.</v>

3201
02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:25.290
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but shame is a wonderful.</v>

3202
02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:26.153
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily bad to feel shame </v>

3203
02:23:28.331 --> 02:23:31.180
<v Speaker 3>shaming is okay in small doses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's motivate you.</v>

3204
02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:32.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people need to be motivated and in </v>

3205
02:23:35.550 --> 02:23:36.383
<v Speaker 3>whatever way they can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is it makes people feel </v>

3206
02:23:38.521 --> 02:23:40.440
<v Speaker 3>bad and people don't want people to feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

3207
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:41.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well feeling bad is what makes you </v>

3208
02:23:42.541 --> 02:23:45.150
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some people in the shame you,</v>

3209
02:23:45.151 --> 02:23:47.010
<v Speaker 3>they're shaming you because they're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>being mean.</v>

3210
02:23:47.130 --> 02:23:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Any positive consequences that come from</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are just in consequential.</v>

3211
02:23:50.101 --> 02:23:51.900
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just lucky.</v>

3212
02:23:53.310 --> 02:23:54.143
<v Speaker 3>But in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a constructive shame and </v>

3213
02:23:57.310 --> 02:23:58.143
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're both wanting to lose weight in </v>

3214
02:23:59.581 --> 02:24:00.414
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom and burt were both shitting on each </v>

3215
02:24:01.771 --> 02:24:03.800
<v Speaker 3>other equally back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3216
02:24:03.810 --> 02:24:04.643
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was interesting is like fans </v>

3217
02:24:06.031 --> 02:24:08.640
<v Speaker 3>got really into it and we're really mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

3218
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3219
02:24:09.330 --> 02:24:11.520
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really funny about it,</v>

3220
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:13.590
<v Speaker 3>we got many submissions on your mom's </v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

3221
02:24:13.591 --> 02:24:16.060
<v Speaker 3>international submissions of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3222
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:20.270
<v Speaker 3>English teachers and their classrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like teaching them how to say burtis fat</v>

3223
02:24:20.271 --> 02:24:22.680
<v Speaker 3>in English and then like speaking Indian</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>

3224
02:24:22.681 --> 02:24:23.880
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really cool.</v>

3225
02:24:24.090 --> 02:24:24.923
<v Speaker 3>So many videos I started doing like </v>
<v Speaker 3>local TV stations and talking to them </v>

3226
02:24:29.191 --> 02:24:34.191
<v Speaker 3>about how fat burgers just get online </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just got so crazy,</v>

3227
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:37.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people would go to burt's show </v>

3228
02:24:38.641 --> 02:24:40.570
<v Speaker 3>and yell out Tom's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3229
02:24:40.650 --> 02:24:41.483
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like Tom's shows people yell out </v>

3230
02:24:43.230 --> 02:24:44.340
<v Speaker 3>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fat.</v>

3231
02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:47.410
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think the bird is fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign took off a lot.</v>

3232
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I would say that guts and heat and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his podcast births is struggling</v>

3233
02:24:53.191 --> 02:24:54.024
<v Speaker 3>in comparison to Tom's doors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you guys have a much more </v>

3234
02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:58.010
<v Speaker 3>powerful presence online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3235
02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's like he fucked with the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3236
02:25:00.390 --> 02:25:01.560
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did fight with around it.</v>

3237
02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Now sober October.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are how many?</v>

3238
02:25:04.831 --> 02:25:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Eleven days in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3239
02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:10.110
<v Speaker 3>today's the 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows I'm not smoking pot.</v>

3240
02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:11.490
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3241
02:25:11.491 --> 02:25:12.324
<v Speaker 3>Because I got shamed into it because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was being a fucking bitch is what you </v>

3242
02:25:15.511 --> 02:25:18.630
<v Speaker 3>can't smoke pot like I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that wasn't part of the deal.</v>

3243
02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:21.630
<v Speaker 3>And I thought about it on September 31st</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it was.</v>

3244
02:25:21.631 --> 02:25:22.321
<v Speaker 3>September.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

3245
02:25:22.321 --> 02:25:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Thirty one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty,</v>

3246
02:25:23.580 --> 02:25:24.520
<v Speaker 3>30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3247
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:25.570
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3248
02:25:25.571 --> 02:25:26.404
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take the whole month top </v>

3249
02:25:27.401 --> 02:25:28.234
<v Speaker 3>pot too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've taken the whole month out pot </v>

3250
02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:33.960
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>is my dreams aren't.</v>

3251
02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:35.453
<v Speaker 3>Hence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a dream last night and maybe it </v>

3252
02:25:37.711 --> 02:25:38.544
<v Speaker 3>was [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm paying attention all this Harvey </v>

3253
02:25:39.490 --> 02:25:40.323
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein chip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a dream last night that there was </v>

3254
02:25:42.581 --> 02:25:47.560
<v Speaker 3>some Russian woman who was married to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some Russian dictator.</v>

3255
02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Dude that was seducing me and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified seducing you are the girl.</v>

3256
02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:55.390
<v Speaker 3>The woman was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>

3257
02:25:55.391 --> 02:25:57.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some really hot Russian woman,</v>

3258
02:25:57.341 --> 02:25:58.174
<v Speaker 3>but I was terrified of her because she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the wife of some really powerful </v>

3259
02:26:02.171 --> 02:26:04.480
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was like making me hang out with</v>

3260
02:26:04.481 --> 02:26:06.820
<v Speaker 3>her and like I didn't fuck her in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams.</v>

3261
02:26:07.090 --> 02:26:08.560
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was like,</v>

3262
02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:13.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically like being submissive to her,</v>

3263
02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:14.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very strange and we were on a </v>

3264
02:26:16.481 --> 02:26:18.610
<v Speaker 3>boat somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was super vivid.</v>

3265
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:19.803
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I looked out the window and another </v>

3266
02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:22.480
<v Speaker 3>boat was really close to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't collide with us.</v>

3267
02:26:22.481 --> 02:26:23.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3268
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:25.810
<v Speaker 3>but it was like super vivid and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking like,</v>

3269
02:26:25.811 --> 02:26:27.380
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3270
02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:29.020
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was last night.</v>

3271
02:26:29.021 --> 02:26:29.854
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking I didn't have any </v>

3272
02:26:30.401 --> 02:26:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Alpha brain before I went to bed either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like one of those dreams,</v>

3273
02:26:33.610 --> 02:26:35.950
<v Speaker 3>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really vivid,</v>

3274
02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:36.873
<v Speaker 3>like really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that I'd </v>

3275
02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:41.760
<v Speaker 3>heard when people stop smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it their dreams become very vivid and</v>

3276
02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:42.730
<v Speaker 3>you remember your dreams</v>

3277
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:44.023
<v Speaker 4>now in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my therapist will do dream analysis on </v>

3278
02:26:47.091 --> 02:26:47.980
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3279
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:48.833
<v Speaker 4>and it's usually people who represent </v>
<v Speaker 4>either feelings you have or you don't </v>

3280
02:26:52.281 --> 02:26:54.320
<v Speaker 4>really dream you dream and symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3281
02:26:54.470 --> 02:26:58.250
<v Speaker 4>So the Russian lady could be whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be your mother,</v>

3282
02:26:58.251 --> 02:26:58.890
<v Speaker 4>your sister,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your</v>

3283
02:26:58.890 --> 02:27:01.160
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're represented power to me,</v>

3284
02:27:01.210 --> 02:27:05.240
<v Speaker 3>like the feeling of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3285
02:27:05.241 --> 02:27:07.970
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very unusual for a man to feel like</v>

3286
02:27:07.971 --> 02:27:11.090
<v Speaker 3>they're in a position where a woman has </v>
<v Speaker 3>power over them unless it's your boss.</v>

3287
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.983
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me it was like this feeling of </v>

3288
02:27:14.931 --> 02:27:15.764
<v Speaker 3>this woman who I couldn't say no to and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was scared of because she was like </v>

3289
02:27:19.930 --> 02:27:22.070
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was married to some dictator,</v>

3290
02:27:22.490 --> 02:27:23.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's like,</v>

3291
02:27:23.181 --> 02:27:25.550
<v Speaker 3>come into my room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to go with me.</v>

3292
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.170
<v Speaker 3>She was really beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3293
02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:27.801
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3294
02:27:27.801 --> 02:27:28.491
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

3295
02:27:28.491 --> 02:27:30.350
<v Speaker 3>I'll do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like really?</v>

3296
02:27:30.351 --> 02:27:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous around her and said,</v>

3297
02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:33.493
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in the dream now unless I forgot </v>

3298
02:27:34.791 --> 02:27:35.690
<v Speaker 3>that part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3299
02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

3300
02:27:38.450 --> 02:27:40.310
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I better do what she says,</v>

3301
02:27:40.311 --> 02:27:42.670
<v Speaker 3>like one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking like a modern,</v>

3302
02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:44.990
<v Speaker 3>whether that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's what it feels like to be like,</v>

3303
02:27:46.250 --> 02:27:48.650
<v Speaker 3>like someone how to deal with someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Harvey Weinstein.</v>

3304
02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:51.590
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering if that's what planted </v>
<v Speaker 3>that seed in my head.</v>

3305
02:27:51.591 --> 02:27:52.424
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was a young starlet hoping to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it in the business and he was the </v>

3306
02:27:55.911 --> 02:27:57.050
<v Speaker 3>guy that held,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3307
02:27:57.051 --> 02:27:59.880
<v Speaker 3>possible my future in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3308
02:28:00.310 --> 02:28:01.390
<v Speaker 4>Well also the dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3309
02:28:01.391 --> 02:28:02.224
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my shrink says that when you do your </v>

3310
02:28:03.161 --> 02:28:03.994
<v Speaker 4>dream analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times it's feelings you can't </v>

3311
02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:09.160
<v Speaker 4>deal with in waking life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's the feeling in the dream.</v>

3312
02:28:09.550 --> 02:28:12.610
<v Speaker 4>What do you our powerlessness would </v>
<v Speaker 4>think they would say about this dream?</v>

3313
02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:14.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know because I don't know enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>about your personal life.</v>

3314
02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:16.600
<v Speaker 4>It would have to know more about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>dynamics,</v>

3315
02:28:16.601 --> 02:28:18.600
<v Speaker 4>like between your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3316
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:22.760
<v Speaker 4>whoever else is in your world because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll always represents other people you</v>

3317
02:28:22.761 --> 02:28:23.750
<v Speaker 4>won't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you won't ever dream.</v>

3318
02:28:23.751 --> 02:28:25.430
<v Speaker 4>Like if you have problems with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mommy and your daddy,</v>

3319
02:28:25.431 --> 02:28:26.300
<v Speaker 4>it's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never,</v>

3320
02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:28.070
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever it's just so weird.</v>

3321
02:28:28.071 --> 02:28:31.850
<v Speaker 4>But whenever I dream about my father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually dream about Howard Stern.</v>

3322
02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Like I associate the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3323
02:28:33.771 --> 02:28:34.604
<v Speaker 4>So Howard starting shows up so they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a similar sense of humor and I grew up </v>

3324
02:28:38.571 --> 02:28:41.030
<v Speaker 4>on stern and I see stern is like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>paternal,</v>

3325
02:28:41.390 --> 02:28:44.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could be my dad like in a lot of ways</v>

3326
02:28:44.661 --> 02:28:47.250
<v Speaker 4>he's my comedy dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I grew up just worshiping.</v>

3327
02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:48.273
<v Speaker 4>Starting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3328
02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:50.480
<v Speaker 4>So whenever I start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

3329
02:28:50.481 --> 02:28:50.961
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3330
02:28:50.961 --> 02:28:51.794
<v Speaker 4>I have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a data issue that would you be </v>

3331
02:28:52.371 --> 02:28:55.490
<v Speaker 4>weirded out if you did a show?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would fucking love.</v>

3332
02:28:55.491 --> 02:28:56.780
<v Speaker 4>It's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my dream.</v>

3333
02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:59.300
<v Speaker 4>That's one of my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get geeked out on celebrities.</v>

3334
02:28:59.301 --> 02:29:00.134
<v Speaker 4>I don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>P would be the only one that I had been </v>

3335
02:29:02.501 --> 02:29:03.270
<v Speaker 4>nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was</v>

3336
02:29:03.270 --> 02:29:05.760
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing that I ever did</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3337
02:29:05.761 --> 02:29:07.730
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my mind he was like,</v>

3338
02:29:08.090 --> 02:29:11.220
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't give a fuck if I was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tonight show didn't mean anything to</v>

3339
02:29:11.221 --> 02:29:13.710
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never a tonight show comic like my</v>

3340
02:29:13.711 --> 02:29:14.544
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all those things were like for </v>

3341
02:29:15.961 --> 02:29:17.640
<v Speaker 2>people who want to do seven clean </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

3342
02:29:17.641 --> 02:29:19.760
<v Speaker 2>And I was a Kennison guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3343
02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I liked Kennison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3344
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like dice,</v>

3345
02:29:23.011 --> 02:29:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3346
02:29:24.061 --> 02:29:24.894
<v Speaker 2>I like Richard Pryor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't want to be that kind of </v>

3347
02:29:26.850 --> 02:29:27.683
<v Speaker 2>squeaky clean comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me Howard stern was like this </v>

3348
02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:32.513
<v Speaker 2>groundbreaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was the first guy to ever just </v>

3349
02:29:34.531 --> 02:29:37.320
<v Speaker 2>do an all talk show on regular radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3350
02:29:37.470 --> 02:29:40.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean he used to do songs used to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>records,</v>

3351
02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:41.333
<v Speaker 2>but then it became just the stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the records was even better and </v>

3352
02:29:45.331 --> 02:29:48.120
<v Speaker 2>then it became all that and when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

3353
02:29:48.210 --> 02:29:49.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've heard like there was some </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny shows in Boston with back in the </v>

3354
02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:53.880
<v Speaker 2>day when they had real djs and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3355
02:29:54.210 --> 02:29:55.920
<v Speaker 2>but I'd always heard about stern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3356
02:29:56.130 --> 02:29:56.963
<v Speaker 2>and then once I first started listening </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them and it was like he was on in </v>

3357
02:30:00.181 --> 02:30:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Boston as well and I was thinking like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3358
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:05.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the holy grail.</v>

3359
02:30:06.010 --> 02:30:06.843
<v Speaker 2>Like that's when you get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially then back in the day when he </v>

3360
02:30:09.121 --> 02:30:11.070
<v Speaker 2>was on like regular radio and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>was listening.</v>

3361
02:30:11.071 --> 02:30:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3362
02:30:11.850 --> 02:30:14.340
<v Speaker 2>he'd get like 18 million people </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to a show.</v>

3363
02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:15.413
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing I'd ever like that </v>

3364
02:30:16.261 --> 02:30:17.220
<v Speaker 2>before or since.</v>

3365
02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:18.300
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I used to,</v>

3366
02:30:18.330 --> 02:30:19.163
<v Speaker 4>I worked in my dad's shop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Dad had a forklift repair shop and </v>

3367
02:30:21.931 --> 02:30:23.610
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to fucking work there every </v>
<v Speaker 4>summer.</v>

3368
02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:26.130
<v Speaker 4>And I remember starting at like 12 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>

3369
02:30:26.131 --> 02:30:26.964
<v Speaker 4>I started listening to stern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was on the radio here in La in the </v>

3370
02:30:29.131 --> 02:30:29.964
<v Speaker 4>mornings and I would be so bummed when </v>
<v Speaker 4>those four hours were over and then I </v>

3371
02:30:32.281 --> 02:30:35.430
<v Speaker 4>have to listen to whoever fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>dickhead was on after like whatever fake</v>

3372
02:30:35.431 --> 02:30:39.450
<v Speaker 4>nonsense radio and then like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Bango Fiesta came out.</v>

3373
02:30:41.490 --> 02:30:43.680
<v Speaker 4>That was the shit and they had like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3374
02:30:43.681 --> 02:30:47.100
<v Speaker 4>the KKK guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A self was so.</v>

3375
02:30:47.101 --> 02:30:48.930
<v Speaker 4>It was so radical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so funny.</v>

3376
02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:52.200
<v Speaker 4>Remember private parts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course I've seen it a million times.</v>

3377
02:30:52.201 --> 02:30:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know to me too.</v>

3378
02:30:53.701 --> 02:30:58.200
<v Speaker 4>He also represented this fight against </v>
<v Speaker 4>the suppressive free speech of the right</v>

3379
02:30:58.201 --> 02:31:02.340
<v Speaker 4>wing people that were empowered at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time because the FCC went after him in a</v>

3380
02:31:02.341 --> 02:31:03.820
<v Speaker 4>huge way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were finding Istation,</v>

3381
02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:07.950
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands of dollars for </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing like potty jokes or something like</v>

3382
02:31:07.951 --> 02:31:09.380
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am talking about penises.</v>

3383
02:31:09.390 --> 02:31:10.223
<v Speaker 4>Like they would attack them and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally find them hundreds of </v>

3384
02:31:13.381 --> 02:31:14.214
<v Speaker 4>thousands of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a direct assault on free speech </v>

3385
02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:18.900
<v Speaker 4>because it wasn't even words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

3386
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 4>wasn't</v>

3387
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:23.220
<v Speaker 2>even forbidden words was like topics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were deciding what people could and</v>

3388
02:31:23.221 --> 02:31:26.640
<v Speaker 2>couldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was for all of us who are comics,</v>

3389
02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:28.980
<v Speaker 2>he was at the front of the line of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3390
02:31:29.250 --> 02:31:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

3391
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:34.640
<v Speaker 2>he was the guy that was taking the hits </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in a lot of ways it boosted them,</v>

3392
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:35.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everybody was aware that he was </v>

3393
02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:39.600
<v Speaker 2>being attacked and people were outraged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

3394
02:31:39.601 --> 02:31:43.230
<v Speaker 2>it represented when Bush was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Bush was the president,</v>

3395
02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:46.590
<v Speaker 2>and we were all kind of freaked out by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this was happening,</v>

3396
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:47.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3397
02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:48.713
<v Speaker 2>this guy who was this really funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were deciding who was a criminal </v>

3398
02:31:52.050 --> 02:31:52.883
<v Speaker 2>and they were finding his station,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of dollars for </v>

3399
02:31:55.381 --> 02:31:56.214
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For,</v>

3400
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:58.950
<v Speaker 2>for making people laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so crazy.</v>

3401
02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it just represented so much.</v>

3402
02:32:02.011 --> 02:32:04.380
<v Speaker 2>It was just so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so crazy.</v>

3403
02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:07.680
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the most nervous I've ever been</v>

3404
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:08.543
<v Speaker 2>in my life the night before I did it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I did yoga the night before I </v>

3405
02:32:12.511 --> 02:32:13.344
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did yoga in my hotel room to calm </v>

3406
02:32:14.251 --> 02:32:16.510
<v Speaker 2>myself down and it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3407
02:32:16.570 --> 02:32:17.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super,</v>

3408
02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:18.033
<v Speaker 2>super calm</v>

3409
02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:21.830
<v Speaker 1>to the beat like I would love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would probably happen.</v>

3419
02:32:35.521 --> 02:32:38.370

<v Speaker 1>I don't sleep through the night anymore.</v>

3420

<v Speaker 1>I wake up all night shift things too.</v>

3423
02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:45.510

<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

3424
02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I imagine.</v>

02:38:02.331 --> 02:38:04.040
<v Speaker 3>So fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stand up on the spot.</v>

3540
02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:06.020
<v Speaker 3>Make up things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People yell things out at you,</v>

3541
02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:09.080
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about male feminists.</v>

3542
02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:09.973
<v Speaker 3>Somehow the subject came up and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying if you could give any one of </v>

3543
02:38:12.441 --> 02:38:15.470
<v Speaker 3>those guys a pill that would turn them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into that thor dude,</v>

3544
02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:16.810
<v Speaker 3>that Chris Hemsworth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3545
02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:17.720
<v Speaker 3>they would all take it.</v>

3546
02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Are The bond powerful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then didn't.</v>

3547
02:38:21.261 --> 02:38:23.720
<v Speaker 3>They would just be themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't have to.</v>

3548
02:38:23.721 --> 02:38:24.554
<v Speaker 3>Like I was talking about this tweet that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read that literally made me want to </v>

3549
02:38:27.111 --> 02:38:29.000
<v Speaker 3>punch my fist through the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>laptop.</v>

3550
02:38:29.630 --> 02:38:30.463
<v Speaker 3>This guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not calling myself a feminist until </v>

3551
02:38:32.421 --> 02:38:34.340
<v Speaker 3>women tell me I'm doing feminism </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>

3552
02:38:35.850 --> 02:38:39.080
<v Speaker 3>It's just like literally cutting off his</v>
<v Speaker 3>dick and offering it on a platter.</v>

3553
02:38:39.081 --> 02:38:40.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't need this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not about that.</v>

3554
02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:42.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3555
02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:43.700
<v Speaker 3>and here's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3556
02:38:43.701 --> 02:38:44.534
<v Speaker 3>at least for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate when a man is down for the </v>

3557
02:38:46.911 --> 02:38:47.860
<v Speaker 3>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

3558
02:38:47.861 --> 02:38:50.990
<v Speaker 3>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not sexually.</v>

3559
02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:54.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not attractive to data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy that's like a girl.</v>

3560
02:38:54.350 --> 02:38:56.090
<v Speaker 3>For me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

3561
02:38:56.390 --> 02:38:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I like men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It totally 100 percent sexist.</v>

3562
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

3563
02:39:00.951 --> 02:39:03.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I answered girl be sexist.</v>

3564
02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's okay for a girl to want</v>

3565
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:08.660
<v Speaker 3>a traditional gender roles.</v>

3566
02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:10.910
<v Speaker 3>It's very suppressive if a guy wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3567
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:12.860
<v Speaker 3>That's the thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3568
02:39:12.861 --> 02:39:13.521
<v Speaker 3>I see you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3569
02:39:13.521 --> 02:39:17.180
<v Speaker 3>because we have the option to be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stay at home mom or the career lady.</v>

3570
02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:20.390
<v Speaker 3>But if you want like a guide to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3571
02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:21.433
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I like a woman to just shut the </v>

3572
02:39:23.301 --> 02:39:25.340
<v Speaker 3>fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be banger.</v>

3573
02:39:25.930 --> 02:39:27.320
<v Speaker 3>People like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3574
02:39:27.350 --> 02:39:28.560
<v Speaker 3>You're considered?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3575
02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Say I like a guy who just grabs you by </v>
<v Speaker 3>my here and fucked my mouth.</v>

3576
02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:33.890
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

3577
02:39:33.890 --> 02:39:34.280
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3578
02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:37.310
<v Speaker 3>she's so empowered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3579
02:39:37.311 --> 02:39:40.100
<v Speaker 3>There's a lady that she's a slut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shamed.</v>

3580
02:39:40.530 --> 02:39:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can be herself.</v>

3581
02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3582
02:39:43.251 --> 02:39:44.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3583
02:39:44.211 --> 02:39:45.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I just,</v>

3584
02:39:45.891 --> 02:39:46.724
<v Speaker 3>all of our issues stem the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of our issues stem from actual </v>

3585
02:39:49.851 --> 02:39:52.490
<v Speaker 3>sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual discrimination.</v>

3586
02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:54.740
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we didn't have that,</v>

3587
02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:55.793
<v Speaker 3>if we just had people judge by on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>merits of their behavior and their </v>

3588
02:39:59.331 --> 02:40:04.190
<v Speaker 3>character and what they're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we would just look like this.</v>

3589
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:06.050
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about the standup </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy world,</v>

3590
02:40:06.051 --> 02:40:06.884
<v Speaker 3>like maybe audience members like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you would be able to tell much </v>

3591
02:40:09.291 --> 02:40:11.470
<v Speaker 3>more than I would that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3592
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:14.520
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that some guys see a </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl go up and they go,</v>

3593
02:40:14.521 --> 02:40:17.070
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll shoot for me.</v>

3594
02:40:17.250 --> 02:40:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the whole environment I came up</v>

3595
02:40:20.101 --> 02:40:21.540
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure arms folded.</v>

3596
02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Fuck is this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I refine it.</v>

3597
02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long is she up for?</v>

3598
02:40:24.631 --> 02:40:25.464
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We took a post 100 percent go to the </v>

3599
02:40:27.390 --> 02:40:28.223
<v Speaker 3>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the world of comics it's very </v>

3600
02:40:32.581 --> 02:40:35.670
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian if you kill you or you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comic,</v>

3601
02:40:35.730 --> 02:40:36.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody.</v>

3602
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:37.583
<v Speaker 3>None of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody in the comedy world looks at Ali </v>

3603
02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Wong as a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's amazing.</v>

3604
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:43.590
<v Speaker 3>She's just a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

3605
02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:45.550
<v Speaker 3>she happens to be a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's,</v>

3606
02:40:45.570 --> 02:40:47.500
<v Speaker 3>she's just a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3607
02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:48.640
<v Speaker 3>That's how everybody looks at her.</v>

3608
02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Like there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a thing,</v>

3609
02:40:51.270 --> 02:40:55.230
<v Speaker 3>there's like a level of the video game </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get to where you slot into,</v>

3610
02:40:55.260 --> 02:40:56.910
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a peer,</v>

3611
02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:58.830
<v Speaker 3>like she's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3612
02:40:59.270 --> 02:41:00.103
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting thing about the </v>

3613
02:41:01.021 --> 02:41:02.760
<v Speaker 3>world of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're a killer,</v>

3614
02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:03.833
<v Speaker 3>people think of you as a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if you have a vagina </v>

3615
02:41:05.821 --> 02:41:07.650
<v Speaker 3>or a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're gay or you're straight.</v>

3616
02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:09.300
<v Speaker 3>If you're murdering it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3617
02:41:09.370 --> 02:41:11.040
<v Speaker 3>you're in that group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3618
02:41:11.041 --> 02:41:13.290
<v Speaker 3>It's the great leveler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

3619
02:41:13.390 --> 02:41:14.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

3620
02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:15.540
<v Speaker 3>it's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3621
02:41:15.541 --> 02:41:18.510
<v Speaker 3>because nobody can hold your hand for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you once you get up there.</v>

3622
02:41:18.530 --> 02:41:18.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3623
02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:19.830
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

3624
02:41:19.831 --> 02:41:20.664
<v Speaker 3>it's a very ballsy thing to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>either you fail and you fail or you </v>

3625
02:41:23.851 --> 02:41:25.020
<v Speaker 3>succeed and you succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heart,</v>

3626
02:41:25.021 --> 02:41:27.570
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no middle ground,</v>

3627
02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:28.433
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely think women have a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>harder go at it because I think that </v>

3628
02:41:31.531 --> 02:41:34.680
<v Speaker 3>sexual topics that you either are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>slut,</v>

3629
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:37.410
<v Speaker 3>like you were saying before or they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>

3630
02:41:37.870 --> 02:41:38.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3631
02:41:38.130 --> 02:41:38.963
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're just a regular woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're talking to these strangers </v>

3632
02:41:41.610 --> 02:41:42.443
<v Speaker 3>about like how you like your asshole </v>
<v Speaker 3>licked and you're really embarrassed </v>

3633
02:41:44.671 --> 02:41:45.271
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>

3634
02:41:45.271 --> 02:41:46.730
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3635
02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:48.960
<v Speaker 3>and girls will get mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're attractive.</v>

3636
02:41:48.961 --> 02:41:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Girls get mad at you because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>their husbands laughing.</v>

3637
02:41:51.391 --> 02:41:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Like that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's reps,</v>

3638
02:41:53.610 --> 02:41:54.443
<v Speaker 3>she's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then politics are almost off level </v>

3639
02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:58.670
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3640
02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:01.810
<v Speaker 3>people get mad at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will get mad at you if you like.</v>

3641
02:42:01.860 --> 02:42:02.693
<v Speaker 3>You're a trump supporter and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman and you're on stage and there's a </v>

3642
02:42:05.911 --> 02:42:07.800
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are liberals.</v>

3643
02:42:07.801 --> 02:42:10.230
<v Speaker 3>They'll get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget you're a liberal onstage and this</v>

3644
02:42:10.231 --> 02:42:12.420
<v Speaker 3>trump supporters in the audience and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>start shitting on trump.</v>

3645
02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:16.580
<v Speaker 3>They'll get mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stick to the job with depaul jokes,</v>

3646
02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:18.430
<v Speaker 3>the jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3647
02:42:18.530 --> 02:42:22.140
<v Speaker 3>what I've noticed is that at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>here's my thing,</v>

3648
02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:23.220
<v Speaker 3>I have hope for this.</v>

3649
02:42:23.610 --> 02:42:24.443
<v Speaker 3>The millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're changing how comedy is </v>

3650
02:42:26.881 --> 02:42:29.220
<v Speaker 3>consumed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The podcasting world.</v>

3651
02:42:29.250 --> 02:42:30.990
<v Speaker 3>It's millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the early adapters,</v>

3652
02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:33.690
<v Speaker 3>and they grew up watching Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 3>Silverman,</v>

<v Speaker 3>shell.</v>

3655
02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:39.713
<v Speaker 3>That 20 year old boy doesn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same bias that the men who I started in </v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3657
02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:49.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a given that if a woman is a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's cooler.</v>

3658
02:42:49.261 --> 02:42:51.130

3660
02:42:54.331 --> 02:42:56.010
<v Speaker 3>but I'd like to think there's less </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexism.</v>

02:43:24.341 --> 02:43:27.730
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if that was a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh guys,</v>

3679
02:43:32.801 --> 02:43:34.630
<v Speaker 4>have so many swinging dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3680
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:37.550
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that feminism shit and I,</v>

3681
02:43:37.930 --> 02:43:41.200
<v Speaker 4>I try not to look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problems of the world.</v>

3682
02:43:41.380 --> 02:43:44.500
<v Speaker 4>I try to fucking transcendent like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't even spell.</v>

3683
02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:45.473
<v Speaker 4>I used to be so much angrier at feminism</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all this shit when I was in my </v>

3684
02:43:47.051 --> 02:43:49.300
<v Speaker 4>thirties and then I now I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3685
02:43:49.301 --> 02:43:52.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what society wants me to be</v>

3686
02:43:52.540 --> 02:43:54.730
<v Speaker 4>or what the fucking rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

3687
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you at life is too short for me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>even worry about what this person thinks</v>

3688
02:43:59.021 --> 02:44:00.220
<v Speaker 4>or the society is thinking.</v>

3689
02:44:00.350 --> 02:44:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that like what you're seeing,</v>

3690
02:44:01.791 --> 02:44:04.730
<v Speaker 2>like on college campuses where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are super radical,</v>

3691
02:44:04.731 --> 02:44:05.564
<v Speaker 2>left wing progressive as in I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing that with young people as </v>

3692
02:44:08.601 --> 02:44:09.434
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are just trying to work </v>

3693
02:44:10.371 --> 02:44:12.360
<v Speaker 2>out the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3694
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:17.410
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes they work out the world by</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming some sort of a behavior pattern</v>

3695
02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:19.193
<v Speaker 2>in that behavior pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be right wing or it could be left </v>

3696
02:44:21.021 --> 02:44:22.730
<v Speaker 2>wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it can be feminist,</v>

3697
02:44:22.731 --> 02:44:23.830
<v Speaker 2>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3698
02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:25.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be gender queer.</v>

3699
02:44:25.371 --> 02:44:27.980
<v Speaker 2>They'll try that out for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shave half my head and wear</v>

3700
02:44:27.981 --> 02:44:28.814
<v Speaker 2>a nose ring and say fuck cis gendered </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and people get weird and they just </v>

3701
02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:37.030
<v Speaker 2>assume these patterns and try them out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>

3702
02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Almost like dressing punk rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3703
02:44:39.170 --> 02:44:41.420
<v Speaker 2>start wearing doc martins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ruin your jeans up.</v>

3704
02:44:42.690 --> 02:44:44.800
<v Speaker 4>That was really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you do that?</v>

3705
02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:46.390
<v Speaker 4>My Lane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was punk as fuck.</v>

3706
02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.840
<v Speaker 4>Goth and punk for any weird piercings in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the face.</v>

3707
02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:52.780
<v Speaker 4>The nose or the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3708
02:44:52.781 --> 02:44:53.614
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was too sensible because I knew that </v>

3709
02:44:55.001 --> 02:44:57.010
<v Speaker 4>I'd have a hole in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

3710
02:44:57.020 --> 02:44:59.590
<v Speaker 4>You're always so controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3711
02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:00.573
<v Speaker 4>I only have one shitty tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a tramp stamp in the nineties on </v>

3712
02:45:02.741 --> 02:45:03.574
<v Speaker 4>road rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

3713
02:45:03.690 --> 02:45:04.523
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that control things </v>

3714
02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:09.220
<v Speaker 4>because your mom was nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3715
02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:11.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My world was out of control,</v>

3716
02:45:11.771 --> 02:45:14.590
<v Speaker 4>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to be responsible.</v>

3717
02:45:14.591 --> 02:45:18.700
<v Speaker 4>I was the one that was responsible from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time I was a little little kid.</v>

3718
02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:19.880
<v Speaker 4>I grew up fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3719
02:45:19.890 --> 02:45:21.560
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parentified child,</v>

3720
02:45:21.561 --> 02:45:24.550
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that</v>

3721
02:45:25.150 --> 02:45:26.280
<v Speaker 2>so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find that a lot.</v>

3722
02:45:26.330 --> 02:45:28.800
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I have this dilemma.</v>

3723
02:45:28.801 --> 02:45:31.890
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this with Bryan County</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a lot of my friends that are dads.</v>

3724
02:45:32.010 --> 02:45:36.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like all my interesting friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>came from fucked up childhoods,</v>

3725
02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:39.030
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want that for my kids knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3726
02:45:39.031 --> 02:45:41.850
<v Speaker 2>So what is that like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my favorite people came from</v>

3727
02:45:42.780 --> 02:45:45.290
<v Speaker 4>childhoods game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Recognize game son.</v>

3728
02:45:45.530 --> 02:45:46.890
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3729
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:49.880
<v Speaker 4>but it's because your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your wires or whatever.</v>

3730
02:45:49.881 --> 02:45:52.370
<v Speaker 4>Crossed a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same way similarly,</v>

3731
02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:54.490
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want to fuck up your can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have the same dilemma.</v>

3732
02:45:54.510 --> 02:45:55.700
<v Speaker 4>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my son.</v>

3733
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:56.743
<v Speaker 4>Then again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be super thrilled with my son grew </v>

3734
02:45:57.771 --> 02:45:58.880
<v Speaker 4>up and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love,</v>

3735
02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:00.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be an accountant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to be normal.</v>

3736
02:46:02.030 --> 02:46:03.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't want him to be in show business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3737
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:05.480
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is craziness.</v>

3738
02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 4>This business is not for normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially Avenue that you've</v>

3739
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:11.600
<v Speaker 3>carved standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3740
02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:13.003
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3741
02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:15.950
<v Speaker 3>We've carved horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3742
02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:17.720
<v Speaker 3>It's bananas and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

3743
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:18.583
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I look back on who we </v>
<v Speaker 3>started with like 14 years ago and the </v>

3744
02:46:21.921 --> 02:46:25.040
<v Speaker 3>attrition rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no real,</v>

3745
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:27.500
<v Speaker 3>it's just bananas that we can even make </v>
<v Speaker 3>a living at this.</v>

3746
02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no reason I should be what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying.</v>

3747
02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:33.450
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3748
02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:34.430
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3749
02:46:34.431 --> 02:46:39.431
<v Speaker 3>you start off and you suck and you keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>working at it and suck less and then you</v>

3750
02:46:40.101 --> 02:46:43.730
<v Speaker 3>start getting laughs and he started </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing better when they start working and</v>

3751
02:46:43.770 --> 02:46:44.603
<v Speaker 3>you keep building and keep moving as </v>
<v Speaker 3>long as you keep moving and sometimes </v>

3752
02:46:46.851 --> 02:46:47.684
<v Speaker 3>you'll have some setbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like probably you when you were doing </v>

3753
02:46:48.651 --> 02:46:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Chelsea lately and me when I was doing </v>
