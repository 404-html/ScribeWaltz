<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>

13
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.793
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>

14
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

15
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about the different kinds of comedians that there really are</v>

16
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980
<v Speaker 1>like mean comedians there.</v>

17
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.801
<v Speaker 1>They're comedians.</v>

18
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>They have a special skillset.</v>

19
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

20
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>They have a special skillset.</v>

21
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.220
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

22
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>one of my closest friends,</v>

23
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.064
<v Speaker 1>bearded humor,</v>

24
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

25
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>I would say if he was a standup comic he would probably be be in my top five in</v>

27
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>terms of creativity,</v>

28
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>in terms of talking about things in a moment and just all are funny.</v>

29
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the skill set for stand up now.</v>

31
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>It used to be I started 25 years ago.</v>

32
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>It used to be Tony,</v>

33
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>where you proved yourself as a person with any type of comedic integrity while I</v>

34
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>was on stage standing flat footed in front of an audience that you probably</v>

35
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>don't want you to be funny or no have have no idea.</v>

36
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.293
<v Speaker 1>You can be funny.</v>

37
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>But these main,</v>

38
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 1>these many people,</v>

39
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Photoshop,</v>

40
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>especially because our attention is so quick.</v>

41
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>And so John to social media,</v>

42
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>media people,</v>

43
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if people are as excited about stand up as they used to be.</v>

44
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>A nail is excited about what's going to be the newest thing.</v>

45
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>What's gonna be,</v>

46
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>what's gonna be the hardest photo?</v>

47
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>The photo shop was gonna be the hardest image.</v>

48
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>that's the easiest to get,</v>

50
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to get it on your phone.</v>

52
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>You get those images,</v>

53
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>the photoshops and the memes that are funny that hit you immediately.</v>

54
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>But I think right now,</v>

55
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:36.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

56
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>especially when you go to the store,</v>

57
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>don't you think there's like more people interested in standup now than ever?</v>

58
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

59
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.001
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

60
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

61
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>we in in a tricky place now.</v>

62
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>People are interested in it,</v>

63
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>but people are so,</v>

64
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>they're more critical of stand up now more than ever.</v>

65
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It used to be a time when you could just say what you want it.</v>

66
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And people say that that person was outspoken.</v>

67
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Outrageous.</v>

68
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>But they were themselves.</v>

69
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>But now you tell one joke,</v>

70
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>one blogger,</v>

72
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>one troller dissects your jokes and print your jokes.</v>

73
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't do the setup,</v>

74
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>don't do a call back,</v>

75
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>don't do the tag.</v>

76
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>

77
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>you offended somebody.</v>

78
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>But I think with a lot of events that happen today that are happening now,</v>

80
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>comedy's going to start taking it a shift back to people on his voices.</v>

81
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.341
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>

82
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:31.341
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a direct backlash to like political correct thinking and the,</v>

83
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>the type of policing that you're seeing.</v>

84
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:35.561
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

85
00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you'd been pleased and I understand polices and stuff in the Catholic church,</v>

86
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>police stuff in a regular church,</v>

87
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 1>but you go to a comedy club to police you,</v>

88
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.633
<v Speaker 1>we're in the wrong place.</v>

89
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>And nine times out of 10 people that go to a comedy show there,</v>

90
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>walk out in protest,</v>

91
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>their mindset was to protest before they even went there.</v>

92
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>They're just waiting for the trigger word just to be like,</v>

93
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

94
00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

95
00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>they leave.</v>

96
00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:02:59.531 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a way</v>

98
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>to get a lot of attention,</v>

99
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 2>being outraged.</v>

101
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.801
<v Speaker 2>It's something,</v>

102
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>especially if you kind of have a point,</v>

103
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>like if you could articulate that point,</v>

104
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.071
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

105
00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to get attention.</v>

106
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 2>The trollers and the people that,</v>

107
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

108
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a,</v>

109
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant market for that.</v>

110
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think of like a,</v>

111
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 2>if you're a comic and you're a famous comic and you're outspoken,</v>

112
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 2>and someone could take your bit and take it apart like they've done with</v>

114
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle when many times,</v>

115
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

116
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

117
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle owns it so much.</v>

118
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>He owns it.</v>

119
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I was just with him and you I've never seen to got it flips our sets over like</v>

120
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 2>he just riding another five minute bit.</v>

121
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.141
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

122
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

123
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 2>But the thing with the thing is now I've watched some of his new stuff and</v>

124
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 2>things he doing now.</v>

125
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 2>He's going to lead the charge for comedians having a voice.</v>

126
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I did a show with him at the store recently and at the end of it he said,</v>

127
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>comedians now more than ever,</v>

128
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>you need to grab your balls because it's our job to talk about the things that</v>

129
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>are bad in his world and we are the best people forward.</v>

130
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 2>What's the last line of free speech?</v>

131
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 2>It's the last real line of free speech because you don't have a real boss,</v>

132
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

133
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Like when you go onstage,</v>

134
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 2>it's no one's,</v>

135
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>no one gives you a single word of direction,</v>

136
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

137
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

138
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:08.801
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

139
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>that's a very unusual place to be in,</v>

140
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 2>in terms of entertainment and something that reaches,</v>

141
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 2>especially with someone like Dave millions and millions and millions of people.</v>

142
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Every time he does a Netflix special,</v>

143
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 2>every time somebody he does anything that's filmed,</v>

144
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 2>it's going to hit millions of people.</v>

145
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 2>They have no one telling you what to do.</v>

146
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.051

<v Speaker 2>He's a real that I've been following you for a,</v>

151
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been a comedy store for years.</v>

152
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm always in the cut and I've seen you do some material like how the fuck does</v>

153

154
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 2>because he fucking owns it.</v>

155
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's totally believe what I'm saying.</v>

156
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of ways,</v>

157
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 2>like in other things it's obvious that I don't really believe it,</v>

158
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying it because I think it's funny and opinion.</v>

163
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's 100% can you imagine a situation?</v>

165
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 2>You have an argument with your wife or somebody and you can't go on stage at</v>

166
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 2>night just to talk about how pissed off she made you.</v>

167
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.703
<v Speaker 2>That's how outlet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

169
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>So as much as people get stuff out of us,</v>

170
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 2>when you come to a show,</v>

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>we get now our psychiatric exam right on spot.</v>

175
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 2>could turn it into a bit and you can get hundreds of people just dying laughing.</v>

176
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>All,</v>

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I had some conflicts online.</v>

179
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 2>One of them with a bunch of vegans.</v>

184
00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to entertain me every once while you just want to punch a troller</v>

185
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>phages would read the comments.</v>

186
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 2>That was the problem is occasionally you read the comments are like Holy Shit,</v>

222
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:41.354
<v Speaker 3>He's an asshole.</v>

223
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.403
<v Speaker 3>He's a little bit of it,</v>

224
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.170
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

225
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Bill Brennan is a mother fucking prick.</v>

226
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.390
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about man?</v>

227
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Telling people to turn into s when the asshole is in body in him,</v>

228
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.650
<v Speaker 3>especially people wear glasses because they were,</v>

229
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 3>they have like million different frames.</v>

230
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

231
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 3>that's when you add the next level of being an asshole when you switched your</v>

232
00:06:58.281 --> 00:06:59.114
<v Speaker 3>glasses up.</v>

233
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 3>But Neil Brennan is a Vegan and he's one of those,</v>

234
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't think vegans should it be allowed to go to a barbecue and complained.</v>

235
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 3>They could play.</v>

236
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 3>They all come to a fucking barbecue.</v>

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 3>They got their panties.</v>

238
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.863
<v Speaker 3>They're upset.</v>

239
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.250
<v Speaker 3>If you've been cooking meat on a grill that was designed to cook dead animals,</v>

240
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 3>they'll sort of tend to get up and they'd get upset.</v>

241
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 3>So all vegans are assholes.</v>

242
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry it's not all of them,</v>

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 3>but I see what you're saying.</v>

<v Speaker 3>All the ones that I</v>

245
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.820
<v Speaker 3>did it because it cause when I make them,</v>

246
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 3>but they made the transition.</v>

247
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 3>It can't just become vegans.</v>

248
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.833
<v Speaker 3>They got,</v>

249
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 3>they just got to let you know I'm Vegan now.</v>

250
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.313

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.091
<v Speaker 3>They just can't do it.</v>

256
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:45.230
<v Speaker 3>They got to make an announcement.</v>

257
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I think I let everybody know that I'm a Vegan and now and I'm an asshole.</v>

258
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 3>They think they're saving the world and the worst is a Vegan that always gets</v>

289
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Colorado has a lot of them there.</v>

290
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Some of them.</v>

291
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Twitter.</v>

292
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.303
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

293
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 3>how do you transport?</v>

294
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:46.551
<v Speaker 3>Is there a loss?</v>

295
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 3>Can you transport your killer?</v>

296
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 3>You have to break it down wherever where you kill it.</v>

297
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>

298
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 3>you have to have,</v>

299
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.773
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

300
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.643
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

301
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 3>you have a tag</v>

302
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 4>and then when you,</v>

303
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 4>when you have a tag,</v>

304
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to get a certain kind of animal.</v>

305
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 4>So say if it's like,</v>

306
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

307
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:02.191
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

308
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:02.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

309
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 4>a buck deer tag,</v>

310
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 4>that means you can kill a male deer.</v>

311
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.200
<v Speaker 4>And then once you kill it,</v>

312
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 4>then you break it down and you either bring it to a butcher shop and they turn</v>

313
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 4>it into cuts for you.</v>

314
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Or You could do it yourself and wrap it up,</v>

315
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 4>but you have to have a tag.</v>

316
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 4>You have to register that you killed that animal and you have to keep that,</v>

317
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

318
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.531
<v Speaker 4>that with you,</v>

319
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 4>that paperwork with you.</v>

320
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 4>So if you transport the,</v>

321
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 4>the meat across state lines and some game warden pulled you over and said,</v>

322
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 4>you have a deer in your car.</v>

323
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:29.831
<v Speaker 4>I knew he asked her,</v>

324
00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:30.400
<v Speaker 4>do sir?</v>

325
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 4>And he's got to see that you have the paperwork for it.</v>

326
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound racist and all,</v>

327
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know a black person that could tell that story you just told about</v>

328
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>killing butchering up to transport in a dead end.</v>

329
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:46.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

330
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:47.920
<v Speaker 4>that's what you have to do.</v>

331
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:48.650
<v Speaker 4>That's how you do it.</v>

332
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.930
<v Speaker 4>You got to put them on ice.</v>

333
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.591
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have to,</v>

334
00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.390
<v Speaker 4>you have an obligation to try to save the meat.</v>

335
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.970
<v Speaker 4>You know when you have an animal and it's down,</v>

336
00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 4>you want to get it into like a packaged form as quick as possible.</v>

337
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:01.030
<v Speaker 4>You want to break it down.</v>

338
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.010
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's like,</v>

339
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.260
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

340
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.720
<v Speaker 4>sometimes people hang things.</v>

341
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.580
<v Speaker 4>They hang things in their garage</v>

342
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 1>cold too.</v>

343
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.590
<v Speaker 1>So you wouldn't,</v>

344
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.930
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned were hanging on I think about is Jesse's son.</v>

345
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

346
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Talk about said No.</v>

347
00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:20.450
<v Speaker 1>A whole bunch of people back in one interview.</v>

348
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Crazy story itches.</v>

349
00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:23.120
<v Speaker 1>It such a mess.</v>

350
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a mess and I think was really awful about it because his story,</v>

351
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.843
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

352
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.090
<v Speaker 1>it was like good and bad of it to good of it was when people thought that he was</v>

353
00:10:35.241 --> 00:10:38.240
<v Speaker 1>violated and he was a victim of a hate crime.</v>

354
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.130
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just gay people.</v>

355
00:10:40.131 --> 00:10:42.860
<v Speaker 1>There was a Russian to support him.</v>

356
00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like thug dudes,</v>

357
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.051
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

358
00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It was like some real motherfuckers.</v>

359
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.751
<v Speaker 1>Dell was like,</v>

360
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:47.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

361
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I saw exhibit,</v>

362
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.003
<v Speaker 1>make a comment.</v>

363
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a community of people away from the LBG community that thought it was</v>

364
00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:57.074
<v Speaker 1>really fucked up.</v>

365
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

366
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

367
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.130
<v Speaker 1>that was the beauty of the incident because it kind of put people together.</v>

368
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.410
<v Speaker 1>But the fun thing about it was just a lot and it's so fucking unfortunate.</v>

369
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's so unfortunate that somebody would play on people's emotions for or to</v>

370
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:19.850
<v Speaker 1>benefit themselves.</v>

371
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.330
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

372
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.163
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>

373
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:21.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

374
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.900
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain narcissism that exists in show business that I think you and I</v>

375
00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:27.190
<v Speaker 4>both know very well.</v>

376
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:27.491
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

377
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:32.170
<v Speaker 4>we've all seen it and thankfully the people that seem to be the best for</v>

378
00:11:32.171 --> 00:11:32.681
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason,</v>

379
00:11:32.681 --> 00:11:33.160
<v Speaker 4>they have the,</v>

380
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.600
<v Speaker 4>some of the best handles on it.</v>

381
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.370
<v Speaker 4>Like Dave doesn't show any of that.</v>

382
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.940
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

383
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.730
<v Speaker 4>But there's some people that do and that narcissism is weird,</v>

384
00:11:39.731 --> 00:11:43.540
<v Speaker 4>that that wanting it to be all about them and then they'll do sneaky shit,</v>

385
00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:45.040
<v Speaker 4>like fake and attack.</v>

386
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.760
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

387
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.950
<v Speaker 4>that's a symptom of that same kind of thinking.</v>

388
00:11:47.951 --> 00:11:48.640
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

389
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.040
<v Speaker 4>it just got desperate and went in some crazy way.</v>

390
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.360
<v Speaker 1>It was officer a reason,</v>

391
00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>because you have like when I first</v>

392
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.023
<v Speaker 3>went down,</v>

393
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 3>you had people that normally people that you look at,</v>

394
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:57.641
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

395
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 3>that's my friend or whoever,</v>

396
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 3>you started having side eyes and that's just,</v>

397
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:02.973
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

398
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 3>it's so messed up.</v>

399
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 3>And I think also as messed up as much as people wrote for him when he thought</v>

400
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 3>that it was an injustice,</v>

401
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:10.120
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

402
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 3>nobody's really talking about it.</v>

403
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.390
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's addressing it.</v>

404
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

405
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

406
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.021
<v Speaker 3>this is our movement.</v>

407
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:16.230
<v Speaker 3>These are things that we were trying to progress toward.</v>

408
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 3>But this was an isolated incident and just say how awful it was.</v>

409
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.383
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

410
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

411
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 3>the beautiful thing is that people are way more tolerant than they ever have</v>

412
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 3>been before.</v>

413
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 3>They're also beautiful things attack didn't happen.</v>

414
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

415
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 3>So I don't have to think of one more atrocious thing that people have done to</v>

416
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 3>another person for no reason.</v>

417
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

418
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.073
<v Speaker 3>So that's good.</v>

419
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 3>And it's also good that you get to see where that kind of stuff heads where</v>

420
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 3>you're always looking to be a victim to the point where you realize there's like</v>

421
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 3>some sort of currency and being a victim.</v>

422
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 3>So people fake being a victim so they can get all this fucking attention.</v>

423
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:47.981
<v Speaker 3>It's good for us.</v>

424
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:51.410
<v Speaker 3>It's good for us to see cause you see that now next time a story comes around</v>

425
00:12:51.411 --> 00:12:53.870
<v Speaker 3>that just a little fishy I'm guessing.</v>

426
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.533
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

427
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like the boy who cried wolf and that's what's unfortunate about it because</v>

428
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 3>anytime someone says that they were a victim of such a heinous crime like that,</v>

429
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 3>you want to believe him,</v>

430
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 3>you want to believe them.</v>

431
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.573
<v Speaker 3>The mean they said,</v>

432
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 3>then it makes you start second guessing thing.</v>

433
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:10.001
<v Speaker 3>And that's another thing.</v>

434
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 3>It was awful about the whole thing and all the smoke he's getting right now and</v>

435
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 3>he deserved,</v>

436
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.630
<v Speaker 3>because I've been tearing his ass up on Instagram on everything he does.</v>

437
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 3>He deserves every bit he knows he deserves,</v>

438
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.130
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows he deserves it.</v>

439
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:21.611
<v Speaker 3>I read it.</v>

440
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:26.611
<v Speaker 3>I read a story once about this dude who said that he punished his daughter by</v>

441
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 3>making her sit in the backyard by a tree.</v>

442
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 3>And then he went out there an hour later and she was gone.</v>

443
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 3>And the suspect that coyotes got her.</v>

444
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking that story going,</v>

445
00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:36.851
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

446
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 3>that just does not sound real.</v>

447
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 3>That does not sound real.</v>

448
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 3>It just seems weird.</v>

449
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.620
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of left a baby in the backyard and coyotes got it.</v>

450
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Like one was like a new,</v>

451
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.850
<v Speaker 3>like a black not walking or anything like that.</v>

452
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.341
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

453
00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 3>he left the baby,</v>

454
00:13:49.271 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 3>like to punish the baby like a two year old.</v>

455
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Left it in the,</v>

456
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

457
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 3>it turns out he really didn't do that.</v>

458
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:57.280
<v Speaker 3>The kid died and he'd stuffed it in some drainage ditch somewhere.</v>

459
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.451
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

460
00:13:58.451 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

461
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember how the kid died.</v>

462
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.810
<v Speaker 3>What was the reason for it?</v>

463
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:02.800
<v Speaker 3>But it was one of those stories.</v>

464
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:03.421
<v Speaker 3>We hear this toy,</v>

465
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:04.211
<v Speaker 3>you like Jesus.</v>

466
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:05.470
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't sound real.</v>

467
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes stories don't sound real.</v>

468
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 3>The next thing we're going to be second guessing everything.</v>

469
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.220
<v Speaker 3>I hope not.</v>

470
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 3>But when it first went down,</v>

471
00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:13.984
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a,</v>

472
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.380
<v Speaker 3>I've thought it was a situation where Lee Daniels and Jesse sat down in a</v>

473
00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:22.270
<v Speaker 3>writer's room and Lee Daniels,</v>

474
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:22.491
<v Speaker 3>Lee,</v>

475
00:14:22.491 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 3>anybody got any ideas for any new episodes?</v>

476
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.380
<v Speaker 3>It just like,</v>

477
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:26.891
<v Speaker 3>I got one.</v>

478
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:27.724
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to believe it.</v>

479
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:27.881
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

480
00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be hungry as shit,</v>

481
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:29.764
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

482
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to subway to get a 12 inch footlong.</v>

483
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Ellie Daniel was like,</v>

484
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.343
<v Speaker 3>I believe that</v>

485
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Speaker 3>avenue,</v>

486
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 3>that part I did with her,</v>

487
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:41.610
<v Speaker 3>the whole story elite.</v>

488
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>

489
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.341
<v Speaker 3>you said to them,</v>

490
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 3>nobody's going to believe it.</v>

491
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Jesse got upset.</v>

492
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 3>It told the totally Dez,</v>

493
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.621
<v Speaker 3>we'll see.</v>

494
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shoot it myself,</v>

495
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 3>and he walked to self into the that whole scenario and it's just</v>

496
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 2>awful.</v>

497
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.620
<v Speaker 2>That's entirely possible.</v>

498
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what it sounds like.</v>

499
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:56.031
<v Speaker 2>It sound like,</v>

500
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:56.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say now anybody that was a fan of empire,</v>

502
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 2>which I know a lot of people that's listening work being very sarcastic when I</v>

503
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 2>say that they're gonna be like second guessed the storyline of so many of those</v>

504
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:06.711
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

505
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 2>the storylines of everybody to whoever said today we're done wrong or anything</v>

506
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:12.000
<v Speaker 2>you'd,</v>

507
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.490
<v Speaker 2>the awful thing about this is now people are going to be ready and quick to just</v>

508
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 2>second guess anything that you say.</v>

509
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

510
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:19.330
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

511
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 2>that's a fact.</v>

512
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Until we can read each other's minds till we could find out for sure that's</v>

513
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:25.280
<v Speaker 2>going to change the whole game.</v>

514
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.230
<v Speaker 2>The reason why his mind.</v>

515
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

516
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely gonna eliminate a lot of street fights.</v>

517
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Most of them I made you talk about your,</v>

518
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 2>your imminent danger sensors are going to be 100% if you read somebody's mind.</v>

519
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

520
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

521
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I want to do that.</v>

522
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

523
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I like him a secrets.</v>

524
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 2>No Marlin.</v>

525
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I like having secrets too,</v>

526
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 2>but I like going all in.</v>

527
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I think all in,</v>

528
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.851
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

529
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just inevitable.</v>

530
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about it in the last podcast about there's something they're</v>

531
00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:53.210
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to shoot into your neck and what did he say the way he</v>

532
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:54.044
<v Speaker 2>described it,</v>

533
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.210
<v Speaker 2>like an injection that will take over sort of the way it interacts with your</v>

534
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 2>brain cells thread thread itself in your brain house.</v>

535
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.190
<v Speaker 2>So literally like having,</v>

536
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to have built in Wifi Internet systems where we're connected</v>

537
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.620
<v Speaker 2>to each other's heads.</v>

538
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.870
<v Speaker 2>So this is what people request was like a study they going to try out on people</v>

539
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 2>or you can just go to your doctor and say,</v>

540
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 2>shoot me with the brain shit.</v>

541
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.090
<v Speaker 2>I think eventually it's going to be shooting with the brain shit first you got</v>

542
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 2>to get it on a clinical trial,</v>

543
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.570
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to be like a heroin addict and so do you get for that?</v>

544
00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Like who is close to no brain cells and shit and that's when we try it on it.</v>

545
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 2>But what was that movie?</v>

546
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:36.671
<v Speaker 2>There was a movie where a dude got shot and they put some chip in his back</v>

547
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.841
<v Speaker 2>upgrade.</v>

548
00:16:37.841 --> 00:16:38.520
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

549
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

550
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 2>and it did that to him.</v>

551
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 2>It turned up and he like at an access to all the information.</v>

552
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:44.140
<v Speaker 2>He knew martial arts,</v>

553
00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:46.870
<v Speaker 2>he knew how to move and everything was happening like that.</v>

554
00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:50.900
<v Speaker 2>He was a basically like a super computer inside of a person that to do</v>

555
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:51.734
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

556
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.660
<v Speaker 2>just official intelligence is right down the line.</v>

557
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.130
<v Speaker 2>If they're talking about this shit,</v>

558
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:56.540
<v Speaker 2>shooting it in your brain,</v>

559
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going to share a network.</v>

560
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.510
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to be on a network.</v>

561
00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:02.180
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a lot of white people joining that effort because black people</v>

562
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:03.110
<v Speaker 2>don't fuck with needles,</v>

563
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:03.944
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

564
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 2>We don't do none of that unless less is heroin.</v>

565
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:09.150
<v Speaker 2>We don't take out Bruh.</v>

566
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you.</v>

567
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

568
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.241
<v Speaker 2>say that.</v>

569
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:11.871
<v Speaker 2>But how many,</v>

570
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 2>how many athletes are on steroids?</v>

571
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

572
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:15.104
<v Speaker 2>but that's a different,</v>

573
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 2>that's a different animal.</v>

574
00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the average black dude that's strictly in Brownsville or watch</v>

575
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.060
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

576
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:21.291
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

577
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I got this new brain shit.</v>

578
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 2>We objected through a needle.</v>

579
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 2>They go fuck you up.</v>

580
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:25.940
<v Speaker 2>They don't wanna hear that shit.</v>

581
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

582
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably true.</v>

583
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people are going to try that?</v>

584
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Like who's going to be the earliest adopter or getting an a shot in your neck.</v>

585
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.400
<v Speaker 2>The lets you read everybody's mind and then what are you going to do?</v>

586
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:37.581
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

587
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:38.690
<v Speaker 2>It is an interesting thing.</v>

588
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.300
<v Speaker 2>It's going to fuck our job up man.</v>

589
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Because like half of what we do is say shocking shit that people know is kind of</v>

590
00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:45.351
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

591
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 2>But you can't believe you're saying that people are always like,</v>

592
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>oh not the old winter's Joe coming up.</v>

593
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:52.630
<v Speaker 2>You've got that.</v>

594
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.281
<v Speaker 2>If you could do that,</v>

595
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.770
<v Speaker 2>that'd be the ultimate fucking joke.</v>

596
00:17:54.771 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Gator right there.</v>

597
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

598
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Two guys walk in a bar.</v>

599
00:17:57.991 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 2>You don't get anything happening.</v>

600
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.620
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>

601
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I think I had to pass on it.</v>

602
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Keep it bro.</v>

603
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

604
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be weird.</v>

605
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:04.860
<v Speaker 2>When would you get it?</v>

606
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Like you wouldn't would,</v>

607
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:07.190
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be the first comedian to have it.</v>

608
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.053
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

609
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.650
<v Speaker 2>you almost want to be a fool who doesn't have it.</v>

610
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be a comedian,</v>

611
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch other motherfuckers do it first.</v>

612
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

613
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll in the back.</v>

615
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is they're going to fucking take over like finances,</v>

616
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:19.730
<v Speaker 2>like instantly they're gonna.</v>

617
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 2>As soon as they upload their brand and they're like,</v>

618
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't get all this money.</v>

619
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to figure out a way to get all this fucking money and then by the time</v>

620
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 2>you shoot it into your head,</v>

621
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 2>they've already got the system locked down.</v>

622
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.561
<v Speaker 2>But see that's,</v>

664
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not bad to talk to Mel Gibson.</v>

665
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:31.200

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

699
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:29.450

701
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.043
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember</v>

702
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.020
<v Speaker 2>eating dead babies to like get the stem cells.</v>

703
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.620
<v Speaker 2>12 years is we'll take a bad turn</v>

704
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.110
<v Speaker 2>about rape on South Park.</v>

705
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck.</v>

706
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.360
<v Speaker 2>They're the best.</v>

707
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>They're also pushing the boundaries</v>

708
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.933
<v Speaker 3>like change.</v>

709
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones out there that are promoting like ridiculous,</v>

710
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.910
<v Speaker 3>preposterous comedy that's completely offensive but brilliant.</v>

711
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that when we were doing Chappelle show,</v>

712
00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.301
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

713
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I appreciate more than anything about this show was how it put</v>

714
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.990
<v Speaker 3>people of all races,</v>

715
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 3>all backgrounds together to do the thing that we all should have in common.</v>

716
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.680
<v Speaker 3>In as to laugh and also to not push the button but touch on retro stuff without</v>

717
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.950
<v Speaker 3>having angry undertone.</v>

718
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.920
<v Speaker 3>And this was so fucked up about American.</v>

719
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Now whenever you talk about race,</v>

720
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 3>it feels like one side,</v>

721
00:21:25.541 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 3>somebody has to tint be tense.</v>

722
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.420
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying is never like a comfortable saves.</v>

723
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.303
<v Speaker 3>Never like,</v>

724
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.630
<v Speaker 3>and I know things are intense,</v>

725
00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:32.340
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

726
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 3>we have to be able to laugh first.</v>

727
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Once you get people to laugh,</v>

728
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 3>you can talk about whatever you want and then even if a person is not in</v>

729
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 3>agreement or have the same thoughts at the end of the day,</v>

730
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to respect that person.</v>

731
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 3>And I think those same people should be able to share a laugh.</v>

732
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

733
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.870
<v Speaker 3>And there was a a fun,</v>

734
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:54.871
<v Speaker 3>silly non aggressive quality to the way you guys put together sketches that got</v>

735
00:21:55.601 --> 00:21:57.520
<v Speaker 3>the point across and everybody laughed.</v>

736
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Everybody laughed at my joke to this.</v>

737
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:00.750
<v Speaker 3>To this day when I traveled,</v>

738
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.633
<v Speaker 3>I do my audiences.</v>

739
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because of course you would think I'm going to draw a certain</v>

740
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:05.920
<v Speaker 3>audience because I'm black,</v>

741
00:22:05.921 --> 00:22:06.221
<v Speaker 3>which I,</v>

742
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

743
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.990
<v Speaker 3>which I am and I do,</v>

744
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:08.921
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird.</v>

745
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:11.200
<v Speaker 3>I could go to places in a straight up like Dave,</v>

746
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.990
<v Speaker 3>column d,</v>

747
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.330
<v Speaker 3>The muddy boot motherfuckers,</v>

748
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:14.621
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

749
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Like the money book motherfuckers,</v>

750
00:22:16.121 --> 00:22:17.040
<v Speaker 3>the money boost to jail,</v>

751
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.160
<v Speaker 3>they got John Deere.</v>

752
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

753
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.181
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

754
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:21.010
<v Speaker 3>They know all that elk shit you talking about,</v>

755
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:22.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 3>do John Deere is no,</v>

757
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:24.754
<v Speaker 3>all this shit.</v>

758
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 3>They probably call her right now and say,</v>

759
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

760
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.171
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

761
00:22:27.171 --> 00:22:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I think you got done wrong.</v>

762
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.360
<v Speaker 3>You got to cut the heart from,</v>

763
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

764
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:31.660
<v Speaker 3>you've got to go left or right.</v>

765
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.590
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

766
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.120
<v Speaker 3>And I've noticed I have those people and then I have heard people,</v>

767
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's just interesting when you can look out and this is what that showed it.</v>

768
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:43.620
<v Speaker 3>When you can look at an audience and you say you have all of America there,</v>

769
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.450
<v Speaker 3>it was the best sketch comedy show in the history of television,</v>

770
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.140
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

771
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 3>I think in living color is very,</v>

772
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:49.331
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

773
00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 3>very overlooked.</v>

774
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 3>People forget how God Damn Day was hilarious and groundbreaking.</v>

775
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:55.750
<v Speaker 3>It was bright in both of them.</v>

776
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Like it's wherever I go,</v>

777
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:58.054
<v Speaker 3>people always,</v>

778
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 3>they always bring it up is a big point in my career.</v>

779
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.550
<v Speaker 3>But I was like every,</v>

780
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know ever happens every 10 years or 15 years.</v>

781
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:05.854
<v Speaker 3>It comes a time where,</v>

782
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

783
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.380
<v Speaker 3>the audience wants something different.</v>

784
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

785
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 3>That's sick shit.</v>

786
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:10.744
<v Speaker 3>Water down.</v>

787
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Same way when in living color.</v>

788
00:23:12.411 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Same Way with def comedy jam came out,</v>

789
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:14.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

790
00:23:14.891 --> 00:23:15.111
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

791
00:23:15.111 --> 00:23:16.230
<v Speaker 3>you didn't see a lot of uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a black standups on TV,</v>

793
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.020
<v Speaker 3>but they had this underground circuit.</v>

794
00:23:20.021 --> 00:23:20.854
<v Speaker 3>It was bubbling.</v>

795
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.630
<v Speaker 3>That was bubbling and it was,</v>

796
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.810
<v Speaker 3>it was the right time when they pulled out to the right time and live in color</v>

797

802
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 3>Even though that only lasted three or four episode,</v>

803
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.260
<v Speaker 3>it was the right time and it caught on it the right time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something.</v>

813
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand in the history of sketch,</v>

814
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.930
<v Speaker 3>nobody has premiered a schedule and it came off so hardcore the first night.</v>

815
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.440
<v Speaker 3>It's hot as hell.</v>

816
00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 3>She's hard as it comes.</v>

817
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 3>When they ended that Shit,</v>

818
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:02.360
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

819
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.560
<v Speaker 3>when we asked why,</v>

820
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.280
<v Speaker 3>why after all these years would you still,</v>

821
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:09.801
<v Speaker 3>so he was like,</v>

822
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:12.680
<v Speaker 3>because she's a nigger lover.</v>

823
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.553
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

824
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

825
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 3>that was one of them.</v>

826
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.660
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the joints.</v>

827
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

828
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.930
<v Speaker 3>wake up everybody no more sleeping in bed.</v>

829
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.200
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

830
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.200
<v Speaker 3>From that moment that this show was going to be on the next level of shops.</v>

831
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Well was he was free.</v>

832
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:31.671
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

833
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:33.050
<v Speaker 3>there was so many when we did,</v>

834
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:33.791
<v Speaker 3>funny thing,</v>

835
00:24:33.791 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things I used to do,</v>

836
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I was a warm up comedian for Chappelle show.</v>

837
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.310
<v Speaker 3>So whenever you saw Chappelle show episode in,</v>

838
00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:43.580
<v Speaker 3>have you noticed that?</v>

839
00:24:43.581 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I came on screen</v>

840
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not being cocky,</v>

841
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 3>people who go nuts,</v>

842
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 3>they be like,</v>

843
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:49.401
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

844
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 3>And the reason was because I was a guy that wanted the ordinance before Dave</v>

845
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:53.660
<v Speaker 3>came out.</v>

846
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Ah.</v>

847
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.610
<v Speaker 3>So I knew if I go gut the room out at the beginning,</v>

848
00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.660
<v Speaker 3>people don't,</v>

849
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.230
<v Speaker 3>people don't even,</v>

850
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.501
<v Speaker 3>they didn't,</v>

851
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 3>nobody knew I was there anything.</v>

852
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.790
<v Speaker 3>If I ripped that at the beginning and then when they see me on the screen,</v>

853
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:05.624
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be like,</v>

854
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.943
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be big.</v>

855
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

856
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

857
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:08.650
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

858
00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.021
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

859
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:09.811
<v Speaker 3>and that show,</v>

860
00:25:09.811 --> 00:25:10.081
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

861
00:25:10.081 --> 00:25:10.914
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>

862
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.200
<v Speaker 3>it was just loud.</v>

863
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.260
<v Speaker 3>A lot of things happen.</v>

864
00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:19.261
<v Speaker 3>And show people like Rick James Sketch the day we played that on a wrap arounds.</v>

865
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:20.971
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

866
00:25:20.971 --> 00:25:21.900
<v Speaker 3>I should hit so hard.</v>

867
00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:22.734
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

868
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.290
<v Speaker 3>this shit is fucking crazy crazy.</v>

869
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.540
<v Speaker 3>One thing people don't know is that comedy central did not like that sketch</v>

870
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.240
<v Speaker 3>comedy central.</v>

871
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Here's this funny kind of guessed.</v>

872
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.630
<v Speaker 3>It comes such didn't think Charlie Murphy.</v>

873
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>shit six times and every time,</v>

879
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.940

885
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.470

887
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.830
<v Speaker 3>He was born in school day teachers.</v>

888
00:26:08.831 --> 00:26:09.860
<v Speaker 3>What are the five things they say?</v>

889
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 3>But I'm Rick James Bitch.</v>

890
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.071
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

891
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Tom used to spend four week,</v>

892
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.320
<v Speaker 3>you add Dave Chappelle.</v>

893
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Go to the fucking time.</v>

894
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Out Room is one of the most iconic sketches of all time.</v>

895
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:20.690
<v Speaker 3>How wrong was comedy central?</v>

896
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.231
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

897
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 3>not just a little wrong.</v>

898
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:22.850
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>

899
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:23.041
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

900
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:25.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll along the way wrong all the way wrong.</v>

901
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Like almost like suicidal.</v>

902
00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:27.710
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

903
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

904
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 3>But then it goes to show us like it goes to show,</v>

905
00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:32.600
<v Speaker 3>you know how you have a vision with something.</v>

906
00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:33.160
<v Speaker 3>You see it.</v>

907
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

908
00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Everybody may not see it.</v>

909
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the problem with working with executives to right.</v>

910
00:26:37.281 --> 00:26:39.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like their vision is different than your vision.</v>

911
00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:39.271
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

912
00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:42.080
<v Speaker 3>you'd like to shape you in a certain way and you know,</v>

913
00:26:42.081 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 3>and I know Dave ran into problems with</v>

914
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.760
<v Speaker 1>them wanting them to change language so they could get more sponsors.</v>

915
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

916
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.493
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

917
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that that wasn't an issue.</v>

918
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 1>And to be quite honest,</v>

919
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what happened.</v>

920
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Everything is speculation.</v>

921
00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.860
<v Speaker 1>He never talked to him about,</v>

922
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 1>never talked to him about it because the reason why I never talked to him about</v>

923
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 1>it because I didn't need to talk to them about it.</v>

924
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.993
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

925
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

926
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.070
<v Speaker 1>that show was great for me.</v>

927
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.920
<v Speaker 1>It was a great Frey platform for me and then out.</v>

928
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 1>It was more important,</v>

929
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:18.410
<v Speaker 1>my friendship and how he felt away from that was more important then.</v>

930
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 1>So why did you leave?</v>

931
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

932
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.803
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you go?</v>

933
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.080
<v Speaker 1>First Time I saw him or like as long as you okay.</v>

934
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause this to be scary for anybody.</v>

935
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:26.521
<v Speaker 1>One of your closest friends,</v>

936
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 1>somebody you work with all of a sudden just goes to another country.</v>

937
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.873
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear from him,</v>

938
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.750
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

939
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.160
<v Speaker 1>But when I first saw him after that,</v>

940
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:34.860
<v Speaker 1>like I was excited and I would just like,</v>

941
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

942
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 1>with whatever it was,</v>

943
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 1>we had a moment we may history and people go on,</v>

944
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 1>people going to do other things and just keep it moving.</v>

945
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Well that show was really,</v>

946
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 1>people always say Danielle,</v>

947
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for the Chapelle show,</v>

948
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:48.984
<v Speaker 1>this and that.</v>

949
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Japan's show gave me a platform for people to see what I've been doing for</v>

950
00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:55.194
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

951
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.741
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

952
00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you see talents in the club now you see a muffin is good shit,</v>

953
00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.250
<v Speaker 1>good shit.</v>

954
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.440
<v Speaker 1>But when they get the right platform for the world series,</v>

955
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:02.843
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

956
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of separate.</v>

957
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

958
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you see one person go from one level to the next level who has the right</v>

959
00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 1>platform to showcase their talent.</v>

960
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:11.790
<v Speaker 1>And that show did that for me.</v>

961
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And with that said,</v>

962
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I gave that show everything every time I had a second on camera every time,</v>

963
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.570
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at two and a half years on this show,</v>

964
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>if you had an editor breakdown how many times I spoke,</v>

965
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 1>it would probably be a total of four minutes.</v>

966
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a word here,</v>

967
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I get a phrase here,</v>

968
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.970
<v Speaker 1>but I told myself whenever they turn out motherfucking camera I'm going for it.</v>

969
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Like even if I'm not talking I'm going to make my body so expressive that your</v>

970
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:43.290
<v Speaker 1>eyeball draws too with,</v>

971
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I remember Neal told me one time,</v>

972
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.620
<v Speaker 1>he said because I always,</v>

973
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I always get a mic cause I'll come up with a line or something to throw in.</v>

974
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 1>And we were doing a Rick James Sketch and I didn't have a mic.</v>

975
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I was like Yo uh sound.</v>

976
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 1>And Neil said you're not going to get a mic bro.</v>

977
00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.373
<v Speaker 1>I said I might,</v>

978
00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.693
<v Speaker 1>I might.</v>

979
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like I might say something like you're not going to say anything.</v>

980
00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:05.274
<v Speaker 1>I was like fuck.</v>

981
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So I told myself,</v>

982
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:11.210
<v Speaker 1>well he smacks this motherfucker cause if you look at that scene where he smacks</v>

983
00:29:11.211 --> 00:29:11.340
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

984
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

985
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:12.630
<v Speaker 1>what the f?</v>

986
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.171
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

987
00:29:13.171 --> 00:29:13.470

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.303
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

989
00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:14.710

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I pushed that.</v>

993
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I said what thought fuck I made my face.</v>

994
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.570
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give me a mic,</v>

995
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 1>but I said what the fuck with my face.</v>

996
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And I always as people always as a matter of showing up as the young actors and</v>

997

1001
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:40.350
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do is figure out a way to get on a set.</v>

1002
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 1>You get on a set,</v>

1003

1018
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Some people feel uncomfortable,</v>

1019
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 2>they just like to be cool while they're telling the jokes or like some people</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1027
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I saw Jim brewer like the first time I saw him we were really young.</v>

1028
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Jim Brewer.</v>

1030
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:29.200

1034
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.260

1035
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:34.210

1053
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.170
<v Speaker 2>he was a murderer and he was,</v>

1060
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:14.370
<v Speaker 2>One of the worst bombings in my entire career I was headlining and Jim was and</v>

1061
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.170
<v Speaker 2>we were working together.</v>

1062
00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:15.840
<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>

1063
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Millan is a prime spot to fuck somebody up.</v>

1064
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:19.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a price.</v>

1065
00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:24.430
<v Speaker 2>By 2025 we had a good mc two so the MC was like got the crowd,</v>

1066
00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 2>really pop it and then the middle came on and jam chest rip the place up.</v>

1067
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.820
<v Speaker 2>He may have to apart and I was scared and I had a blown out ACL at the time and</v>

1068
00:31:33.821 --> 00:31:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I was wearing cavalry cheese.</v>

1069
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I was wearing like a sexy pants.</v>

1070
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.923
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1071
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm like too much information.</v>

1072
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Pause side with these stupid pants and people were in the eighties man,</v>

1073
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.350
<v Speaker 2>like they were tied at the top and they flared out a little.</v>

1074
00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to see almost like a little bit.</v>

1075
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.570
<v Speaker 2>They're pathetic.</v>

1076
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:52.110
<v Speaker 2>That thought.</v>

1077
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Can't believe ever owned them but they were in style.</v>

1078
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what I have that like that Bro.</v>

1079
00:31:59.170 --> 00:31:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

1080
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.371
<v Speaker 2>You're not sure.</v>

1081
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:00.860
<v Speaker 2>No Elk.</v>

1082
00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 2>A number of no you're not.</v>

1083
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I think mine were probably jeans.</v>

1084
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.460
<v Speaker 2>The jeans ones like that.</v>

1085
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Like see the far left and the blue right there.</v>

1086
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

1087
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1088
00:32:09.221 --> 00:32:09.560
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

1089
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.393
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

1090
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.373
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

1091
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.071
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1092
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:12.821
<v Speaker 2>Can I wear those?</v>

1093
00:32:12.821 --> 00:32:16.120
<v Speaker 2>And they have a straight face and then I had like some nice dress up shirt on</v>

1094
00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:18.190
<v Speaker 2>and I just ate plates of Shit.</v>

1095
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.620
<v Speaker 2>But it made me rethink my whole act cause it was,</v>

1096
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 2>it was so such a humiliating bombing and I,</v>

1097
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 2>cause I knew that they,</v>

1098
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:26.230
<v Speaker 2>the audience was right.</v>

1099
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't being funny.</v>

1100
00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I was nervous and scared about it.</v>

1101
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Those are the moments that make you 100% like now I see a comedy.</v>

1102
00:32:34.391 --> 00:32:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I go to some clubs,</v>

1103
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.440
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers trying to do the lineup kind of soft like well we can't that</v>

1104
00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:40.274
<v Speaker 2>person</v>

1105
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 1>in front of that person because they won't be able to follow blah blah blah.</v>

1106
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.310
<v Speaker 1>But it should be a point like when I,</v>

1107
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 1>when I started like the baddest motherfuckers on the game,</v>

1108
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:50.300
<v Speaker 1>they went on stage and if he was a new jack coming up,</v>

1109
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.820
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to have a defining moment in comedy?</v>

1110
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 1>You've got a go behind somebody.</v>

1111
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:55.483
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can do.</v>

1112
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.930
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a hot room,</v>

1113
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.180
<v Speaker 1>everybody's doing good but put that shit behind where you got them off fucking</v>

1114
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:01.881
<v Speaker 1>like a bill.</v>

1115
00:33:01.881 --> 00:33:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Burke comes in the room and just goes and fucks it up.</v>

1116
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 1>What do you stand up?</v>

1117
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:07.641
<v Speaker 1>We did,</v>

1118
00:33:07.641 --> 00:33:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I did a tour with him bill.</v>

1119
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting cause I know they have one of those podcasts where to</v>

1120
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:14.751
<v Speaker 1>theme is,</v>

1121
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:16.620
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had to come behind a distillery?</v>

1122
00:33:16.621 --> 00:33:21.621
<v Speaker 1>I forget to podcast it desert but crystal if you ever had to come behind a story</v>

1123
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:25.160
<v Speaker 1>of coming behind someone that just the most going on after them.</v>

1124
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 1>And then Krista live I saw Kristala do once he said me and that but when we were</v>

1125
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 1>doing Chappelle should have to Chappelle show after second year Chappelle show.</v>

1126
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:38.420
<v Speaker 1>We weren't really making a lot of money on special cause the show still hadn't</v>

1127
00:33:38.421 --> 00:33:38.990
<v Speaker 1>been proven.</v>

1128
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.900
<v Speaker 1>You know something you got to,</v>

1129
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.991
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a contract,</v>

1130
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:42.651
<v Speaker 1>you've got contract.</v>

1131
00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:47.651
<v Speaker 1>That's it just so happened to cause the show blew up before the contract was</v>

1132
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:48.621
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1133
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:50.200
<v Speaker 1>But that don't mean nobody's going to renegotiate.</v>

1134
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.670
<v Speaker 1>So we had this popular,</v>

1135
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but we weren't making money.</v>

1136
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.140
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1137
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I came with the idea that doing a tour called the I'm rich bitch tour and at the</v>

1138
00:33:58.581 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1139
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.100
<v Speaker 1>at the time Charlie was China,</v>

1140
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.350
<v Speaker 1>like anywhere he goes,</v>

1141
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 1>at the time bill burr was um,</v>

1142
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:07.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1143
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 1>a headliner probably at the time and be rooms,</v>

1144
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:10.881
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1145
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And this is no disrespect to him,</v>

1146
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but he was on the come up.</v>

1147
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1148
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.600
<v Speaker 1>But when you saw bill,</v>

1149
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.730
<v Speaker 1>you knew this muffled was going to be next.</v>

1150
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.593
<v Speaker 1>You knew he was going,</v>

1151
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 1>he was going to pop it.</v>

1152
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 1>But we still wasn't getting no cash.</v>

1153
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Charlie had never told jokes and I was like,</v>

1154
00:34:23.781 --> 00:34:25.160
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck you around all these communities?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You never been on stage.</v>

1156
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.800
<v Speaker 1>So I used to bully him.</v>

1157
00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:28.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1158

<v Speaker 1>rest in peace.</v>

1160
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.131
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>

1161
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:31.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1162

<v Speaker 1>you so tough motherfucker,</v>

1163
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.800
<v Speaker 1>but not with a microphone in your hand.</v>

1164
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:38.750
<v Speaker 1>And I bullied them so much that he finally went on stage and Charlie,</v>

1165
00:34:38.751 --> 00:34:38.961
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1166
00:34:38.961 --> 00:34:43.961
<v Speaker 1>the tour was Charlie would mc and all we needed him to do was 10 or 15 minutes</v>

1167
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:45.321
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

1168
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Me and Charlie outside of the day were to pop up people on the show.</v>

1169
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Bill bird had a couple of sketches per bill burgeon pop off of the show.</v>

1170
00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:53.410
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1171
00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:54.200
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

1172
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:54.980
<v Speaker 1>but if we're going to do this,</v>

1173
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.210
<v Speaker 1>let's have a fire show.</v>

1174
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:56.751
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1175
00:34:56.751 --> 00:34:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't we could put somebody's weak in the middle.</v>

1176
00:34:59.420 --> 00:34:59.721
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1177
00:34:59.721 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 1>let's give them a show that they won't ever forget.</v>

1178
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And Charlie used to come out to 10 or 15 minutes and I tell people that,</v>

1179
00:35:07.331 --> 00:35:07.641
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1180
00:35:07.641 --> 00:35:10.280
<v Speaker 1>who's the toughest person to follow?</v>

1181
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.550
<v Speaker 1>But Charlie,</v>

1182
00:35:11.551 --> 00:35:16.460
<v Speaker 1>we got through 10 15 minutes and Bill Burger would come out and do 20 to 25 and</v>

1183
00:35:16.461 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 1>then I came behind bill,</v>

1184
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.750
<v Speaker 1>not one night for a year,</v>

1186
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.580
<v Speaker 1>And Bill Burns a type of act.</v>

1187
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 1>You have no days off.</v>

1188
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 1>You have no or any of that,</v>

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.470
<v Speaker 1>any little inkling of being off.</v>

1191
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:34.281
<v Speaker 1>You're just gonna hear.</v>

1192
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:34.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1193
00:35:34.521 --> 00:35:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I liked the show,</v>

1194
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 1>but the white dude was funny as a motherfucker,</v>

1195
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1196
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.903
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

1197
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:40.800
<v Speaker 3>you could tell that time there,</v>

1198
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:43.200
<v Speaker 3>Bill Byrd was going to be a star,</v>

1199
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.240
<v Speaker 3>whether it would have been movies or television,</v>

1200
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 3>but as a stand up,</v>

1201
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:46.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1202
00:35:46.921 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 3>he was one pound for pound,</v>

1203
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:49.650
<v Speaker 3>one of the dope dopest to do it.</v>

1204
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:50.531
<v Speaker 3>And I tore,</v>

1205
00:35:50.531 --> 00:35:51.450

1206
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 3>We had a blast.</v>

1207
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:53.934
<v Speaker 3>Bill's brilliant.</v>

1209
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.541
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1210
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I got to work with Charlie for,</v>

1211
00:35:55.951 --> 00:35:57.120
<v Speaker 3>we did this maxim tour.</v>

1212
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 3>We did like 22 dates.</v>

1213
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Me and him and John [inaudible],</v>

1214
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 3>we traveled all over the place when Charlie was starting to do it.</v>

1215
00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:03.511
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1216
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 3>he kind of looks like two years in,</v>

1217
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 3>he was two years in at the time.</v>

1218
00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.220
<v Speaker 3>And you know what people judge,</v>

1219
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:12.290
<v Speaker 3>people understand how tough it is to start as a comedian has a famous person as</v>

1220
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:15.780
<v Speaker 3>a comedian that you're basically,</v>

1221
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:18.960
<v Speaker 3>you're open miker does selling out all across the country.</v>

1222
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:20.363
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>

1223
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.490
<v Speaker 3>but you're Eddie Murphy's brother.</v>

1224
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.040
<v Speaker 3>So you got to fight past all of that shit,</v>

1225
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:27.450
<v Speaker 3>creating your own identity.</v>

1226
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:28.561
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1227
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Like I could not imagine like the heat he probably had.</v>

1228
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:33.481
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>

1230
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:34.314
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Murphy,</v>

1231
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Hey Eddie Murphy.</v>

1232
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that when Charlie passed that I really appreciated</v>

1233
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.430
<v Speaker 3>about what the Chappelle show did for him.</v>

1234
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Because when he passed away,</v>

1235
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 3>nobody said Eddie Murphy's brother died.</v>

1236
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1237
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like Charlie marries passed away.</v>

1238
00:36:49.021 --> 00:36:51.870
<v Speaker 3>So he had his true identity and that was Charlie Murphy.</v>

1239
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:52.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1240
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:54.090
<v Speaker 3>And that was one of his bits.</v>

1241
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1242
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1243
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:55.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1244
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

1245
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 3>does it piss you off for people?</v>

1246
00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.030
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] he was,</v>

1247
00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm just happy to not call me Eddie Murphy's brother anymore.</v>

1248
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.830
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

1249
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:02.521
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

1250
00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:03.620
<v Speaker 3>That was at that time.</v>

1251
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 3>That was one that was a joke and addressed it.</v>

1252
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:08.280
<v Speaker 3>And it just kept on and he,</v>

1253
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:08.710
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1254
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 3>and he found himself,</v>

1255
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.220
<v Speaker 3>he got better,</v>

1256
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.420
<v Speaker 3>he got better.</v>

1257
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.520
<v Speaker 3>And then he carved his own lane.</v>

1258
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 3>He called us,</v>

1259
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.320
<v Speaker 3>he carved his own lane.</v>

1260
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:16.621
<v Speaker 3>Did.</v>

1261
00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:21.600
<v Speaker 3>I was with Maury Smith used to be the UFC heavyweight champion and a Ivan</v>

1262
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:22.261
<v Speaker 3>salivary,</v>

1263
00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:24.570
<v Speaker 3>who's a guy who fought in the middleweight division in the UFC and a couple</v>

1264
00:37:24.571 --> 00:37:28.900
<v Speaker 3>other professional fighters at a table with Charlie Murphy and trial.</v>

1265
00:37:28.901 --> 00:37:32.430
<v Speaker 3>He was explaining how none of these motherfuckers know how to do a Chicago Ridge</v>

1266
00:37:32.431 --> 00:37:35.160
<v Speaker 3>hand karate shit.</v>

1267
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.281
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1268
00:37:35.281 --> 00:37:36.114
<v Speaker 3>he was big on it,</v>

1269
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.251
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1270
00:37:37.251 --> 00:37:39.330
<v Speaker 3>it's like Charlie Murphy's holding court,</v>

1271
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 3>standing up.</v>

1272
00:37:40.261 --> 00:37:42.120
<v Speaker 3>All these UFC fighters is taking it back.</v>

1273
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.800
<v Speaker 3>And Charlie Murphy was talking about Ridge hand and it's a talking about,</v>

1274
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.280
<v Speaker 3>and he knew exactly what he's talking about.</v>

1275
00:37:46.281 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1276
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.090
<v Speaker 3>He knew how to fight for sure.</v>

1277
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.081
<v Speaker 3>I've had,</v>

1278
00:37:49.081 --> 00:37:49.441
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>

1279
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:49.770
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1280
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:50.990
<v Speaker 3>he never knew martial arts.</v>

1281
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:51.751
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1282
00:37:51.751 --> 00:37:52.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1283
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.100
<v Speaker 3>he was big into it years ago.</v>

1284
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 3>He used to be on at his body guy when Eddie was like right at the height of his</v>

1285
00:37:58.501 --> 00:37:59.250
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1286
00:37:59.250 --> 00:37:59.820

1288
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.570

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:56.973
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1367
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know he was sick.</v>

1368
00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.710

1371
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 1>that you say that because I had to continue to do shows,</v>

1372
00:40:06.291 --> 00:40:10.130
<v Speaker 1>do radio interviews and stuff and the thing that people kept saying was he was</v>

1373
00:40:10.131 --> 00:40:10.964
<v Speaker 1>so young,</v>

1374
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.370
<v Speaker 1>he was so young and he was young.</v>

1375
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.473
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1376
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that we're all going to live to be 80 90 a hundred.</v>

1377
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1378
00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.950
<v Speaker 1>only thing we all guaranteed when we're born,</v>

1379
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.360
<v Speaker 1>we have are born date.</v>

1380
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.790
<v Speaker 1>We have that dash in the middle and then we have the end and it comes down to</v>

1381
00:40:31.791 --> 00:40:33.740
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do you do with your dash?</v>

<v Speaker 1>What motivates you?</v>

1387
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.420
<v Speaker 1>What did you do with that dash?</v>

1388
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck gives a fuck about living to a hundred and you don't have a</v>

1389
00:40:44.841 --> 00:40:45.674
<v Speaker 1>passport.</v>

1390
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.780
<v Speaker 1>You haven't been outside of your block.</v>

1391
00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:48.800
<v Speaker 1>You haven't been,</v>

1392
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.060
<v Speaker 1>you have never been on an airplane.</v>

1393
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.320
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with your life?</v>

1394
00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:56.620
<v Speaker 1>And I know Charlie from the point of being in the navy to a band with his</v>

1395
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.060
<v Speaker 1>brother sent his brother,</v>

1396
00:40:59.061 --> 00:41:00.710
<v Speaker 1>reached certain hightest success,</v>

1397
00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.700
<v Speaker 1>being interested about interested in the business but you know,</v>

1398
00:41:04.701 --> 00:41:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Kinda India but never really major mark.</v>

1399
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:12.770
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a platform that you become and get your identity and shit.</v>

1400
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the dopest shit.</v>

1401
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1402
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.660
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best kind of success stories because it doesn't happen</v>

1403
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:20.703
<v Speaker 2>automatically</v>

1404
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.630
<v Speaker 1>notch.</v>

1405
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.610
<v Speaker 1>And I did it my way and it's like,</v>

1406
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:25.470
<v Speaker 1>people say what they want to say,</v>

1408
00:41:25.471 --> 00:41:28.200
<v Speaker 1>but he put the work in that.</v>

1409
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I remember when,</v>

1410
00:41:29.761 --> 00:41:30.540

1485
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 3>And when I'm telling you it was a lesson,</v>

1486
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck you want to ask with somebody for something and you don't got shit</v>

1487
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:37.130
<v Speaker 3>to give them but you're just a lot of guys in the beginning.</v>

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:53.020
<v Speaker 3>This motherfucker what the day was like a hotline from anybody from the streets.</v>

1496
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 3>You ever thought about being an actor?</v>

1497
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:58.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to put those 10 years of getting rejected.</v>

1498
00:43:58.281 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Just call this number and we'll put you on the wire.</v>

1499
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.800
<v Speaker 3>You know what gets me about acting though is when someone has never acted</v>

1500
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:04.101
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1501
00:44:04.101 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 3>it goes in there and kills it.</v>

1502
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:06.951
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1503
00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:09.560
<v Speaker 3>like people who are like athletes in particular,</v>

1504
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.940
<v Speaker 3>like rappers have done it.</v>

1505
00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of people have done it,</v>

1506
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.063
<v Speaker 3>but some people,</v>

1507
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.940
<v Speaker 3>but some people I believe that that,</v>

1508
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.660
<v Speaker 3>do you have natural talents?</v>

1509
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.660
<v Speaker 3>I think some people have natural talents that person,</v>

1510
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:25.220
<v Speaker 3>like you have a person that's trained that you have people that are natural and</v>

1511
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>

1512
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:26.420
<v Speaker 3>If you think about it,</v>

1513
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.493
<v Speaker 3>acting as just,</v>

1514
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1515
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:28.923

1518
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Is it a person that,</v>

1519
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.620
<v Speaker 1>is it a person that two foot of 12 years they'd been studying and they went to</v>

1520
00:44:39.621 --> 00:44:43.190
<v Speaker 1>the school or as a motherfucker to get a one store and that one character that</v>

1521
00:44:43.191 --> 00:44:44.024
<v Speaker 1>they can nail,</v>

1522
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:44.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1523
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Or is it a case of there's some people that'll do stop stand up comedy for 30</v>

1524
00:44:48.521 --> 00:44:50.290
<v Speaker 2>years and they're never going to be that funny.</v>

1525
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Or Dave could do it for a year and and kill you like Chapelle yeah,</v>

1526
00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1527
00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:55.720
<v Speaker 2>He could kill.</v>

1528
00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.201
<v Speaker 2>But he's gotten,</v>

1529
00:44:56.201 --> 00:44:56.950
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't do this.</v>

1530
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:57.850
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

1531
00:44:57.851 --> 00:45:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some people that there's is a whole different animal.</v>

1532
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I say that,</v>

1533
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:05.290
<v Speaker 1>you're a great comic.</v>

1534
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself a great comic.</v>

1535
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.010
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1536
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I consider you a great comment.</v>

1537
00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.013
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

1538
00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And with that said,</v>

1539
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:12.873
<v Speaker 1>like out,</v>

1540
00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:18.030
<v Speaker 1>we do have equals like as much as people talk about somebody and you're smiling,</v>

1541
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1542
00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm great to a motherfucker.</v>

1543
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:20.951
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1544
00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:21.401
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

1545
00:45:21.401 --> 00:45:21.551
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1546
00:45:21.551 --> 00:45:24.100
<v Speaker 1>one day I was watching Dave on stage and I'm like,</v>

1547
00:45:24.101 --> 00:45:25.750
<v Speaker 1>what makes this motherfucker great?</v>

1548
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think in my opinion,</v>

1549
00:45:27.611 --> 00:45:28.151
<v Speaker 1>what makes them great?</v>

1550
00:45:28.151 --> 00:45:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like,</v>

1551
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not too often that we have or opportunity to have a Muhammad Ali moment.</v>

1552
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And when I say that me in a moment where you got to throw everything on the</v>

1553
00:45:39.701 --> 00:45:40.120
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>

1554
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.960
<v Speaker 1>it's your integrity,</v>

1555
00:45:40.961 --> 00:45:42.010
<v Speaker 1>your moral beliefs.</v>

1556
00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.690
<v Speaker 1>What do I want to stand on,</v>

1557
00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.170
<v Speaker 1>what do I want to stand for?</v>

1558
00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's how some people get attached.</v>

1559
00:45:48.611 --> 00:45:48.661
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

1560
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Of course Muhammad Ali was the greatest,</v>

1561
00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.790
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't just in a boxing ring.</v>

1562
00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:54.490
<v Speaker 1>We made them great is what he stood for.</v>

1563
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think when I look at Dave Chappelle and looking to stand up and I look at</v>

1564
00:45:58.031 --> 00:45:59.650
<v Speaker 1>his career and I say what made them great?</v>

1565
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1566
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's a person just stem.</v>

1567
00:46:02.201 --> 00:46:07.201
<v Speaker 1>They believe it's going to give you their unfiltered truth and they own it and</v>

1568
00:46:07.721 --> 00:46:09.910
<v Speaker 1>don't compromise and don't back down to anyone.</v>

1569
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:11.040

1672
00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:41.531

1749
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:50.300

1750
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1751

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

1755
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:54.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you,</v>

1756
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it for 25 years and after 25 years I can honestly slate say I</v>

1757
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.970
<v Speaker 1>feel like I get better every year.</v>

1758
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

1759
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same thing.</v>

1760
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 1>That's somebody that's a appears.</v>

1761
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1762
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:07.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1763
00:51:07.581 --> 00:51:08.001
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

1764
00:51:08.001 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And I think that uh,</v>

1765
00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean good sets and bad sets when you working on new stuff.</v>

1766
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 1>But I think overall when I'm done after two years,</v>

1767
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 1>each two years is better than the two years before.</v>

1768
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 1>But I'm ready to film.</v>

1769
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1770
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it's all about.</v>

1771
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:20.571
<v Speaker 1>It's it's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>when you hit that third set,</v>

1857
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:43.740
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you're in this weird flow state where there's no resistance</v>

1858
00:53:43.741 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 3>between you and the ideas.</v>

1859
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:48.460
<v Speaker 3>The material just comes out so loose and then you'd know that they need got to</v>

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 3>You got to excuses.</v>

2143
01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.240
<v Speaker 3>You got a good excuse and you got to bags.</v>

2144
01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:54.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2145
01:01:54.491 --> 01:01:54.971
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2146
01:01:54.971 --> 01:01:57.940
<v Speaker 3>You could have an explanation for failure with no excuse.</v>

2147
01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.020
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

2148
01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.600
<v Speaker 3>We can talk about how you failed and why you failed.</v>

2149
01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Don't have an excuse because I fucked up.</v>

2150
01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I came out,</v>

2151
01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I was flat.</v>

2152
01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:07.780
<v Speaker 3>I didn't turn up.</v>

2153
01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up and don't,</v>

2154
01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:11.020
<v Speaker 3>and don't use it.</v>

2155
01:02:11.021 --> 01:02:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

2156
01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.400
<v Speaker 3>this crowd sucked.</v>

2157
01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the wrong way to look at anytime.</v>

2158
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:14.773
<v Speaker 3>I at all.</v>

2159
01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.370
<v Speaker 3>See how were they know I ain't never seen it.</v>

2160
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.230
<v Speaker 3>How were you?</v>

2161
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2162
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.610
<v Speaker 3>because guess what?</v>

2163
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.860
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's going to happen,</v>

2164
01:02:22.861 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

2165
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 3>We don't know if that motherfucker in the front row is taking about a funeral.</v>

2166
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.101
<v Speaker 3>We don't know that,</v>

2167
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:31.380
<v Speaker 3>but it's our job to like,</v>

2168
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:32.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2169
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of going back to me say earlier in a sense we do.</v>

2170
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 3>We read people's minds through their body.</v>

2171
01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:40.710
<v Speaker 3>You can tell,</v>

2172
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:42.300
<v Speaker 3>you can watch show.</v>

2173
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 3>You could be like,</v>

2174
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2175
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 3>she was so upset because I said that you could just look at,</v>

2176
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2177
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 3>you know the pasture,</v>

2178
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 3>you know everything and then we feed off of that.</v>

2179
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 3>But who's going to be fucking ready for that?</v>

2180
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:56.730
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many of these motherfuckers that are taught and I'm not going</v>

2181
01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:56.911
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>

2182
01:02:56.911 --> 01:02:57.570
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>

2183
01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:58.403
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2184
01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:02.700
<v Speaker 3>it's just frustrating when you see motherfuckers out here making excuses.</v>

2185
01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not</v>

2186
01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.010
<v Speaker 4>good for everybody that's around them.</v>

2187
01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.360
<v Speaker 4>That's also part of the problem.</v>

2188
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:07.680
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2189
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.780
<v Speaker 4>when a guy like you is around me or a,</v>

2190
01:03:10.781 --> 01:03:11.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2191
01:03:11.111 --> 01:03:14.140
<v Speaker 4>a guy like Tony Hinchcliffe are people who are just going forward,</v>

2192
01:03:14.141 --> 01:03:15.460
<v Speaker 4>who live in the comedy life.</v>

2193
01:03:15.461 --> 01:03:16.121
<v Speaker 4>Like you're writing,</v>

2194
01:03:16.121 --> 01:03:17.260
<v Speaker 4>you're always writing new material.</v>

2195
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.580
<v Speaker 4>That's an empowering.</v>

2196
01:03:18.581 --> 01:03:19.480
<v Speaker 4>I want to be around you.</v>

2197
01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:20.363
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk</v>

2198
01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:21.780
<v Speaker 3>and be around a motherfucker to talk.</v>

2199
01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:25.860
<v Speaker 3>But I've been around motherfuckers that got more bomb material.</v>

2200
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Did they got real material?</v>

2201
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:27.940

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.490
<v Speaker 3>Mother's got a old ditch do.</v>

2203
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I did my bomb set and they're waiting to just one job,</v>

2204
01:03:35.451 --> 01:03:35.971
<v Speaker 3>don't work.</v>

2205
01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:36.360
<v Speaker 3>And be like,</v>

2206
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.000
<v Speaker 3>oh it didn't slide it to their bomb is shit.</v>

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.880
<v Speaker 3>Don't have no bomb material.</v>

2209
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck writes material?</v>

2210
01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:46.740
<v Speaker 3>The bomb man yo it case they throw tomatoes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I got the old tomato bid,</v>

2212
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:50.850
<v Speaker 3>my uncle grew tomatoes back.</v>

2213
01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:52.260
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're staggered to hurt me.</v>

2214
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Go hard or go home.</v>

2215
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:57.660
<v Speaker 3>That's a ridiculous idea to have a set that you do and the audience is shitty.</v>

2216
01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:58.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean you do what you do.</v>

2231
01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.240
<v Speaker 3>that's the one thing that we control.</v>

2232
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:38.310
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to have an audition for that shit.</v>

2233
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.950
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to motherfucking get tested for it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and it's so weird.</v>

2284
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.223
<v Speaker 1>You know how we are.</v>

2285
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.153
<v Speaker 1>I could do it.</v>

2286
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I could do a show comedy clubs,</v>

2287
01:06:01.781 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>like 500 people,</v>

2288
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>498</v>

2289
01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:06.771
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers.</v>

2290
01:06:06.771 --> 01:06:11.771
<v Speaker 2>I'm destroyed in his two motherfuckers not filling me and I need to get their</v>

2291
01:06:13.551 --> 01:06:14.420
<v Speaker 2>undivided teach.</v>

2292
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:15.263
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2293
01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't even hear the laughter.</v>

2294
01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:17.991
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2295
01:06:17.991 --> 01:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't fucking like me now.</v>

2296
01:06:19.941 --> 01:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about it.</v>

2297
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2298
01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.210
<v Speaker 2>it was the worst at that was nick depalo.</v>

2299
01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:23.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2300
01:06:23.691 --> 01:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>he'll go at one person,</v>

2301
01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like this and the whole rest of the audience is dying.</v>

2302
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:29.611
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2303
01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:30.710
<v Speaker 2>someone's given an the stink eye.</v>

2304
01:06:30.711 --> 01:06:30.951
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2305
01:06:30.951 --> 01:06:32.360
<v Speaker 2>what's your fucking problem?</v>

2306
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:33.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2307
01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:33.921
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

2308
01:06:33.921 --> 01:06:34.701
<v Speaker 2>You just like that.</v>

2309
01:06:34.701 --> 01:06:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's like you and you won't stop until that person doesn't have a problem</v>

2310
01:06:38.811 --> 01:06:39.800
<v Speaker 2>with a or a leaf.</v>

2311
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing,</v>

2313
01:06:41.151 --> 01:06:41.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2314
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.830
<v Speaker 2>And just got undivided attention.</v>

2315
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:44.960
<v Speaker 2>You get committed to wanting everybody to love you.</v>

2316
01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:45.471
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

2317
01:06:45.471 --> 01:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>that's impossible.</v>

2318
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:49.380
<v Speaker 2>There's also people that will fuck with you for extra attention.</v>

2319
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.890
<v Speaker 2>They want you to look at them,</v>

2320
01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.200
<v Speaker 2>their arms crossed because they need attention.</v>

2321
01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.650
<v Speaker 2>They're the same people that protest shit where it doesn't really necessarily</v>

2322
01:06:57.651 --> 01:07:00.860
<v Speaker 2>make sense to spend so much time and effort thinking about these things.</v>

2323
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:01.723
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>

2324
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.790
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny you said about protest because</v>

2325
01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:07.813
<v Speaker 7>MMM,</v>

2326
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:11.031
<v Speaker 1>last couple of years,</v>

2327
01:07:11.031 --> 01:07:16.031
<v Speaker 1>calm has been interesting as a lot of people that are fans of Donald Trump.</v>

2328
01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that aren't fans of Donald Trump.</v>

2329
01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.760
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's petty for you to be upset with anybody because he chose to vote</v>

2330
01:07:26.481 --> 01:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>for whoever they chose to vote for.</v>

2331
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it's stupid shit.</v>

2332
01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>But I will say this past election was interesting in the sense that a lot of</v>

2333
01:07:34.761 --> 01:07:35.600
<v Speaker 1>people were upset.</v>

2334
01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Black people were upset the last election.</v>

2335
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2336
01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:39.643
<v Speaker 1>women were upset.</v>

2337
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Gay people were upset,</v>

2338
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>but white people were really upset.</v>

2339
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Like white people were the angriest and white people did not protest.</v>

2340
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>They voted black people.</v>

2341
01:07:50.931 --> 01:07:53.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like black lives matter white people.</v>

2342
01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like we'll see about that in the morning and when ever you hear someone</v>

2343
01:07:57.111 --> 01:07:57.944
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

2344
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>we'll see about that in the morning.</v>

2345
01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be some change.</v>

2346
01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.350
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be some change.</v>

2347
01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:04.370
<v Speaker 1>But comedy,</v>

2348
01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think kindness should be a place where people exercise anger or be</v>

2349
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.823
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

2350
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:15.020
<v Speaker 4>How so?</v>

2351
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:15.853
<v Speaker 4>In what way?</v>

2352
01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2353
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:17.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2354
01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>like p and met like when Donald Trump first got elected,</v>

2355
01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2356
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:26.410
<v Speaker 1>personally like it,</v>

2357
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.500
<v Speaker 1>it was very interesting and I seen a lot of comments.</v>

2358
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>They can just go up there and be like,</v>

2359
01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Donald Trump and just ah,</v>

2360
01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:34.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2361
01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:39.860
<v Speaker 1>you could find a way to say fuck Donald Trump or anybody.</v>

2362
01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.750
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't have to be fueled with any anger.</v>

2363
01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:44.131
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2364
01:08:44.131 --> 01:08:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be fueled.</v>

2365
01:08:45.031 --> 01:08:45.511
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck,</v>

2366
01:08:45.511 --> 01:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like this.</v>

2367
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:46.681
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>

2368
01:08:46.681 --> 01:08:46.921
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2369
01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

2370
01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:48.203
<v Speaker 1>why do you say that?</v>

2371
01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.433
<v Speaker 1>Why do you say fuck it?</v>

2372
01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:50.730
<v Speaker 1>And then loud the reason.</v>

2373
01:08:50.731 --> 01:08:55.731
<v Speaker 1>But I just don't think that people should be angry about how do you feel about</v>

2374
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.710
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2375
01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fucked up when politics meet people</v>

2376
01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:01.660
<v Speaker 4>angry.</v>

2377
01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 4>It's part,</v>

2378
01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:06.400
<v Speaker 4>it's contrary to what you were saying was great about Chappelle show that the</v>

2379
01:09:06.401 --> 01:09:08.170
<v Speaker 4>comedy came without being angry,</v>

2380
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.790
<v Speaker 4>but it made great points,</v>

2381
01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:13.390
<v Speaker 4>but even anybody on both sides could laugh at it.</v>

2382
01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2384
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.630
<v Speaker 4>The thing about Trump that's,</v>

2385
01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:17.500
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

2386
01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like the job shouldn't exist.</v>

2387
01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.540
<v Speaker 4>The job of web president.</v>

2388
01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:23.090
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2389
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:24.040
<v Speaker 4>she shouldn't exist.</v>

2390
01:09:24.310 --> 01:09:29.310
<v Speaker 4>It's a ridiculous idea to have 300 million people under the guidance of one.</v>

2391
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:31.833
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

2392
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.823
<v Speaker 4>And that one's,</v>

2393
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:35.020
<v Speaker 4>that one wins in a popularity contest.</v>

2394
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:35.913
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

2395
01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.340
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2396
01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.210
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking insane.</v>

2397
01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:38.021
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make sense.</v>

2398
01:09:38.021 --> 01:09:38.291
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>

2399
01:09:38.291 --> 01:09:42.250
<v Speaker 4>it was a great idea back when they were pilgrims and it was a small colony and</v>

2400
01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:43.360
<v Speaker 4>they just came over on a boat,</v>

2401
01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:43.811
<v Speaker 4>forget it.</v>

2402
01:09:43.811 --> 01:09:44.850
<v Speaker 4>Forget about the rest of this shit.</v>

2403
01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.060
<v Speaker 4>This is too many humans.</v>

2404
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.190
<v Speaker 4>So when you let a guy like that,</v>

2405
01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:50.770
<v Speaker 4>like try to be president,</v>

2406
01:09:50.771 --> 01:09:51.010
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2407
01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:51.221
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2408
01:09:51.221 --> 01:09:52.030
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be happy.</v>

2409
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.863
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to be happy,</v>

2410
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:54.810
<v Speaker 4>but you're not going to be happy if anybody wins.</v>

2411
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:55.500
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2412
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:55.900
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2413
01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.770
<v Speaker 4>it's untenable.</v>

2414
01:09:56.771 --> 01:09:57.491
<v Speaker 4>Look at Obama,</v>

2415
01:09:57.491 --> 01:10:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Obama aged like how many of years in eight years he looked at Ge,</v>

2416
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:04.810
<v Speaker 4>he age 20 the altered to Ted Danson effect once.</v>

2417
01:10:04.811 --> 01:10:05.201
<v Speaker 4>Cheers.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're like God damn stopped dying his hair.</v>

2424
01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:17.993
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

2426
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Is there something about Trump before that that people enjoyed that he was in a</v>

2427
01:10:22.991 --> 01:10:26.060
<v Speaker 4>lot of rap lyrics meant he was like the ultimate,</v>

2428
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:30.180
<v Speaker 4>like people would probably still be if he was a is to have resident,</v>

2429
01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:30.700
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2430
01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:31.480
<v Speaker 4>It'd be different.</v>

2431
01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.470
<v Speaker 4>He still popular.</v>

2432
01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:33.350
<v Speaker 4>People wrapped up.</v>

2433
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:34.520
<v Speaker 1>They liked the lifestyle.</v>

2434
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.460
<v Speaker 1>But the thing was to just my thoughts.</v>

2435
01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.890
<v Speaker 1>The thing was because you thought</v>

2436
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:42.440
<v Speaker 1>you knew a person,</v>

2437
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:43.910
<v Speaker 1>you thought you norm.</v>

2438
01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And even when he got elected,</v>

2439
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people thought they knew him,</v>

2440
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2441
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:49.940
<v Speaker 1>They thought they knew him.</v>

2442
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:50.990
<v Speaker 1>They thought the image.</v>

2443
01:10:50.991 --> 01:10:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to be a billion guy.</v>

2444
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Billion dollar playboy.</v>

2445
01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Gaf ever.</v>

2446
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:55.730
<v Speaker 1>But you thought you knew him,</v>

2447
01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.160
<v Speaker 1>but then when you got to know him,</v>

2448
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:59.311
<v Speaker 1>you start to think,</v>

2449
01:10:59.311 --> 01:10:59.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2450
01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:02.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe I didn't know him when you got to see him as president,</v>

2451
01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think even as an even as much as even how he got elected,</v>

2452
01:11:10.071 --> 01:11:10.904
<v Speaker 1>people were upset about it,</v>

2453
01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.320
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of people,</v>

2454
01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:13.050
<v Speaker 1>somebody was like,</v>

2455
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>you know where it may be.</v>

2456
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 3>All of their shit was just to get elected.</v>

2457
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that energy was to get elected and if that was the case that he'd mastered</v>

2458
01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:25.381
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2459
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 3>he'd mastered how to get connect with his base.</v>

2460
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.650
<v Speaker 3>He Massad met.</v>

2461
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.770
<v Speaker 3>He mastered how to get,</v>

2462
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.850
<v Speaker 3>not everybody the fuck would you put just the right amount of people?</v>

2463
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2464
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:37.410
<v Speaker 3>it looked the numbers.</v>

2465
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't about them.</v>

2466
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.500
<v Speaker 3>It was a popularity contest,</v>

2467
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.401
<v Speaker 3>but it's also new.</v>

2468
01:11:41.401 --> 01:11:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Like these are the people that got hit and he figured that out.</v>

2469
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.640
<v Speaker 3>What the something?</v>

2470
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 3>At some point Joe,</v>

2471
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:46.643
<v Speaker 3>people were like,</v>

2472
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.863
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>

2473
01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:49.790
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2474
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:50.371
<v Speaker 3>it's over now.</v>

2475
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:52.320
<v Speaker 3>Let's see who you really are.</v>

2476
01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:57.321
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's so many examples of when you felt like he could showed people</v>

2477
01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.310
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

2478
01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:01.110
<v Speaker 3>example that he's fought.</v>

2479
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Everybody opposed the judge just as base.</v>

2480
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2481
01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.480
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what get people ladder.</v>

2482
01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:08.850
<v Speaker 3>What make people frustrated.</v>

2483
01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.380
<v Speaker 3>He gives impression that,</v>

2484
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2485
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:16.620
<v Speaker 3>I only care about these people that elected me.</v>

2486
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:17.543
<v Speaker 3>You won.</v>

2487
01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2488
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.610
<v Speaker 3>But do you have responsibility to everybody?</v>

2489
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.910
<v Speaker 3>And it's just don't have that felon.</v>

2490
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Even on my social media,</v>

2491
01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:24.661
<v Speaker 3>I don't go hard.</v>

2492
01:12:24.661 --> 01:12:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I keep it kind of neutral.</v>

2493
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:28.050
<v Speaker 3>But I said something and somebody said,</v>

2494
01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:28.621
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2495
01:12:28.621 --> 01:12:30.180
<v Speaker 3>the last time I checked Darnell,</v>

2496
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:32.370
<v Speaker 3>the economy was doing well.</v>

2497
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.540
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2498
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:33.930
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2499
01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 3>you can't confuse the economy with humanity.</v>

2500
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.800
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing.</v>

2501
01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:38.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>

2502
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.500
<v Speaker 3>that's what people don't feel good about.</v>

2503
01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:42.840
<v Speaker 3>You can tout all the numbers,</v>

2504
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 3>you could talk all the numbers,</v>

2505
01:12:44.101 --> 01:12:46.590
<v Speaker 3>you want a black unemployment,</v>

2506
01:12:46.591 --> 01:12:47.424
<v Speaker 3>all the numbers,</v>

2507
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.480
<v Speaker 3>all the numbers.</v>

2508
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:50.250
<v Speaker 3>But how do people feel?</v>

2509
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:51.623
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying,</v>

2510
01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.753
<v Speaker 3>representative,</v>

2511
01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:53.491

2512
01:12:53.491 --> 01:12:53.791
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2513
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel represented.</v>

2514
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

2515
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.990

<v Speaker 3>But at same time,</v>

2533
01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.000
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

2534
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:17.540
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

2535
01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.010
<v Speaker 3>and it may not sound right to a lot of people,</v>

2536
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:21.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's the human factor of it.</v>

2537
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:22.801
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2540
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.090
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>

2541
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:31.090
<v Speaker 3>you why so many people don't know the economy is doing well because they don't</v>

2542
01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:32.800
<v Speaker 3>feel good.</v>

2543
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

2550
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I believe when Obama ran his campaign was change.</v>

2551
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump's would make American great again.</v>

2552
01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Either one of them could have ran off each other's campaign slogan.</v>

2553
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you know after Bush Obama could have said make American great again and it</v>

2554
01:13:56.551 --> 01:13:59.130
<v Speaker 3>would electrify to debase the same as change.</v>

2555
01:13:59.460 --> 01:13:59.910
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

2556
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:01.470
<v Speaker 3>They said the same fucking thing.</v>

2557
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.360
<v Speaker 3>That would be a great thing for Obama.</v>

2558
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:08.160
<v Speaker 3>And I'm gonna tell you one thing that kind of,</v>

2559
01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't insulting or we get,</v>

2560
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:12.191
<v Speaker 3>people have said,</v>

2561
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:14.390
<v Speaker 3>it's like you keep pushing in narrative,</v>

2562
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:15.790
<v Speaker 3>make America great again,</v>

2563
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 3>make America great again.</v>

2564
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.440
<v Speaker 3>You keep pushing it as if America was so fucked up before you took office.</v>

2565
01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:23.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's not the case.</v>

2566
01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2567
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:26.020
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>

2568
01:14:26.021 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2569
01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:28.030
<v Speaker 3>when Obama took it from Bush,</v>

2570
01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.720
<v Speaker 3>he was making America great again.</v>

2571
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a shit show and the thing that people were,</v>

2572
01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:37.750
<v Speaker 3>however you took it,</v>

2573
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 3>respected or not,</v>

2574
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:40.870
<v Speaker 3>it was never nothing.</v>

2575
01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:42.610
<v Speaker 3>Lace would and it was never,</v>

2576
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:44.343
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't no,</v>

2577
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.801
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

2578
01:14:44.801 --> 01:14:45.611
<v Speaker 3>you see this mess.</v>

2579
01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Bush left me.</v>

2580
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:47.770
<v Speaker 3>It was never like,</v>

2581
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.940
<v Speaker 3>oh this motherfucker,</v>

2582
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:49.721
<v Speaker 3>it was never,</v>

2583
01:14:49.721 --> 01:14:52.120
<v Speaker 3>no mentioned to see a new movie about Bush.</v>

2584
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:53.540
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it either.</v>

2585
01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:54.010
<v Speaker 3>What's it called?</v>

2586
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:54.843
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

2587
01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Is it out the one with vice,</v>

2588
01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:02.380
<v Speaker 3>but Dick Cheney and George Bush or whenever I think about,</v>

2589
01:15:02.381 --> 01:15:05.530
<v Speaker 3>I say about the movie about getting shot in the face because that's the only</v>

2590
01:15:05.531 --> 01:15:06.400
<v Speaker 3>thing that I want to say.</v>

2591
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:08.521
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>

2592
01:15:08.521 --> 01:15:08.691
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2593
01:15:08.691 --> 01:15:12.820
<v Speaker 3>the thing about Bush and Cheney is like that movie kind of makes it seem like</v>

2594
01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 3>Cheney was the guy pulling the strings and Bush was just like simple,</v>

2595
01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:19.690
<v Speaker 3>happy go lucky guy who they just roped into being president because he was the</v>

2596
01:15:19.691 --> 01:15:21.160
<v Speaker 3>son of a president.</v>

2597
01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:22.270
<v Speaker 3>That's that far fetched though.</v>

2598
01:15:22.271 --> 01:15:23.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not far fetched at all.</v>

2599
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:24.663
<v Speaker 3>It's not at all.</v>

2600
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:25.391
<v Speaker 3>Not even remotely.</v>

2601
01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I think I actually agree with it,</v>

2602
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:28.210
<v Speaker 3>but I think about Bush now.</v>

2603
01:15:28.211 --> 01:15:29.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't think about them in a negative way,</v>

2604
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:31.750
<v Speaker 3>but I think about changing in a negative way.</v>

2605
01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:32.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2606
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2607
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.760
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

2608
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.990
<v Speaker 3>I think about Halliburton,</v>

2609
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.081
<v Speaker 3>I think about all the,</v>

2610
01:15:36.081 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 3>the rebuilding of the places that we blew up,</v>

2611
01:15:38.651 --> 01:15:42.520
<v Speaker 3>like all the crazy shit on Dick Cheney come from picture no bid contracts that</v>

2612
01:15:42.521 --> 01:15:44.220
<v Speaker 3>are worth billions of dollars to</v>

2613
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:46.180
<v Speaker 3>the bush.</v>

2614
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.130
<v Speaker 3>Because if I ha,</v>

2615
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.360
<v Speaker 3>I know it may sound crazy.</v>

2616
01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:54.300
<v Speaker 3>If I had to have a pick of who I would want,</v>

2617
01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.320
<v Speaker 3>wanted to be the Republican candidate.</v>

2618
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:57.183
<v Speaker 3>It was on the,</v>

2619
01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:58.420
<v Speaker 3>on the Republican side was on.</v>

2620
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.070
<v Speaker 3>I like Jeb Bush.</v>

2621
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really get to know him at all.</v>

2622
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.770
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2623
01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:05.920
<v Speaker 3>That was something that I don't know,</v>

2624
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.083
<v Speaker 3>I don't know too much about,</v>

2625
01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:07.923
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

2626
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I just thought that he had,</v>

2627
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:13.240
<v Speaker 3>he was like Kinda like a mama's boy.</v>

2628
01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.250
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably out of all the kids,</v>

2629
01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:19.990
<v Speaker 3>I probably think that he probably was the one that thought a little outside of</v>

2630
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.960
<v Speaker 3>what their normal,</v>

2631
01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I think he was a successful businessman and mainly Latino chicken,</v>

2632
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:25.383
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

2633
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.433
<v Speaker 3>I know nothing about them,</v>

2634
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:27.251
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

2635
01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:27.611
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2636
01:16:27.611 --> 01:16:27.940
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2637
01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.010
<v Speaker 3>but Bush Trump fucked him up.</v>

2674
01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:24.590
<v Speaker 3>He would just like,</v>

01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:25.640
<v Speaker 3>like a dude in the hood.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I got,</v>

2684
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:35.481

2687
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:42.340
<v Speaker 3>And then a week later he asked for fucking $20 and then he asked for 10 again,</v>

2688
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:44.520
<v Speaker 3>and then it got so bad.</v>

2689
01:17:44.521 --> 01:17:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Then Michelle was sent me an email,</v>

2690
01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:47.750
<v Speaker 3>but he just,</v>

2691
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:49.370
<v Speaker 3>he'd nickeled and dimed America.</v>

2692
01:17:49.371 --> 01:17:51.350
<v Speaker 3>And that's what supported his campaign.</v>

2693
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:55.680
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that he was at a right at the turn of,</v>

2694
01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:56.020
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2695
01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:56.250
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2698
01:17:57.030 --> 01:18:01.280
<v Speaker 3>of form of media that you can use to your advantage.</v>

2699
01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.600
<v Speaker 3>He was the Facebook guy.</v>

2700
01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:03.291
<v Speaker 3>He reached people.</v>

2701
01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:04.124
<v Speaker 3>The Facebook,</v>

2702
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump's doing the same thing through Twitter.</v>

2703
01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:07.213
<v Speaker 3>I can reach people.</v>

2704
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Why does he tweet so much?</v>

2705
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Why does he tweet so much everyday?</v>

2706
01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Cause he knows motherfuckers would rather pick up a phone every to treat.</v>

2707
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Didn't read a newspaper 100%.</v>

2708
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them.</v>

2709
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.310
<v Speaker 3>All I need is headlines.</v>

2710
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:22.970
<v Speaker 3>Way more people reading tweets versus newspapers.</v>

2711
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2712
01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:24.523
<v Speaker 3>Every stunned.</v>

2713
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could get to see the exact engagement in a good article in the New</v>

2714
01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:31.550
<v Speaker 3>York Times on the front page versus one of Donald Trump's tweets.</v>

2715
01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody.</v>

2716
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 3>The only two people that motherfuckers are just waiting for their tweets come as</v>

2717
01:18:37.101 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump to Kanye west.</v>

2718
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2719
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Those are the two most interesting tweet people.</v>

2720
01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Kanye west could just say grapefruit juice and fuck up all of the media the next</v>

2721
01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2722
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:48.321
<v Speaker 3>What do you think he meant?</v>

2723
01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he meant it was hungry or he was thirsty?</v>

2724
01:18:51.090 --> 01:18:52.180
<v Speaker 3>Can you just tweet it?</v>

2725
01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Grapefruit juice,</v>

2726
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:54.930
<v Speaker 3>one of the most,</v>

2727
01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.770
<v Speaker 3>one of the most interesting tweeters out there.</v>

2728
01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:02.720
<v Speaker 3>You wait for a Kanye West tweet while he's kind of a free way of expressing</v>

2729
01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:03.554
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

2730
01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Here's an unfiltered way of expressing myself and a lot of people,</v>

2731
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:08.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2732
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:09.320
<v Speaker 3>people have mixed feelings about it.</v>

2733
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:13.070
<v Speaker 3>It's views and the black community is a little stressed out right now.</v>

2734
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2735
01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.540
<v Speaker 3>because of his Trump thing.</v>

2736
01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:15.590
<v Speaker 3>But you know what,</v>

2737
01:19:15.591 --> 01:19:15.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2738
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of that is to,</v>

2739
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.033
<v Speaker 3>there's two things.</v>

2740
01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.580
<v Speaker 3>One Obama called MC jackass that could weigh on you.</v>

2741
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:23.900
<v Speaker 3>That stung a little bit,</v>

2742
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2743
01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.090
<v Speaker 3>and then Obama,</v>

2744
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.370
<v Speaker 3>when Obama has gone and Trump takes office,</v>

2745
01:19:28.371 --> 01:19:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Trump has willing to let him talk,</v>

2746
01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:30.890
<v Speaker 3>but Trump's Trump,</v>

2747
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Trump old charm him.</v>

2748
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.721
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

2749
01:19:32.721 --> 01:19:32.991
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2750
01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:33.711
<v Speaker 3>with that said,</v>

2751
01:19:33.711 --> 01:19:35.750
<v Speaker 3>like when I do white clubs,</v>

2752
01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:36.470
<v Speaker 3>black clubs,</v>

2753
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2754
01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:38.300
<v Speaker 3>do all type of clubs.</v>

2755
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:39.890
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>

2756
01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.173
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2757
01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:42.110
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2758
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.943
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2759
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:45.560
<v Speaker 3>you first off,</v>

2760
01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Kanye West has a voice,</v>

2761
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:49.663
<v Speaker 3>not too many.</v>

2762
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.740
<v Speaker 3>As much as black people want to throw the towel in on him.</v>

2763
01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:56.160
<v Speaker 3>We don't have too many voices that everybody is waiting to hear whether whatever</v>

2764
01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:56.661
<v Speaker 3>comes out,</v>

2765
01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:57.494
<v Speaker 3>he has a voice.</v>

2766
01:19:58.070 --> 01:20:01.040
<v Speaker 3>I believe that Kanye West is trying to say something.</v>

2767
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.810
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know what the fuck he's trying to say because I'm not fluent in</v>

2768
01:20:05.811 --> 01:20:06.644
<v Speaker 3>easy,</v>

2769
01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.210
<v Speaker 3>barely know Swahili.</v>

2770
01:20:09.211 --> 01:20:14.211
<v Speaker 3>I can do something easy and I think he's trying to say something.</v>

2771
01:20:14.881 --> 01:20:17.550
<v Speaker 3>But if there was some type of interpreter,</v>

2772
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:20.083
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2773
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.860
<v Speaker 3>this would be a dope.</v>

2774
01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.700
<v Speaker 3>If the Chappelle show was right now this would be a dope ass kid.</v>

2775
01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Kanye West says something.</v>

2776
01:20:25.381 --> 01:20:25.921
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>

2777
01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:26.754
<v Speaker 3>Dave Chappelle,</v>

2778
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:28.470
<v Speaker 3>is this conscious to interpreter?</v>

2779
01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:29.580
<v Speaker 3>That would be hilarious.</v>

2780
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:30.001
<v Speaker 3>He does.</v>

2781
01:20:30.001 --> 01:20:31.350
<v Speaker 3>Connie says it didn't.</v>

2782
01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.193
<v Speaker 3>Dave yells up.</v>

2783
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:33.383
<v Speaker 4>You know what I think,</v>

2784
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.060
<v Speaker 4>and this is men only talk to him once on the phone.</v>

2785
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 4>But what I think from studying them and pay attention,</v>

2786
01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:42.450
<v Speaker 4>because we're supposed to eventually do a podcast one day is I think he's uh,</v>

2787
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.650
<v Speaker 4>he's thinks different.</v>

2788
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.490
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

2789
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:45.990
<v Speaker 4>He connects dots different.</v>

2790
01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:48.240
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the reasons why he's so prolific with music.</v>

2791
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:49.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm the point.</v>

2792
01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm making jokes and that's the point.</v>

2793
01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.170
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying?</v>

2794
01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Not speaking easy,</v>

2795
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:55.590
<v Speaker 3>but here's what some people that think like that,</v>

2796
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:57.870
<v Speaker 3>they don't know how to get it out.</v>

2797
01:20:57.871 --> 01:20:59.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like just to speak it,</v>

2798
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.650
<v Speaker 3>but I have been thinking about you.</v>

2799
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:02.341
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

2800
01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:03.174
<v Speaker 3>You're my dad.</v>

2801
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:07.410
<v Speaker 3>You must area here.</v>

2802
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:08.244
<v Speaker 3>My Dad.</v>

2803
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:09.720
<v Speaker 3>You're like my father.</v>

2804
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:11.850
<v Speaker 3>You know how hard that was for the black community here?</v>

2805
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2806
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.540
<v Speaker 3>You could sell them a clean all you want,</v>

2807
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:17.760
<v Speaker 3>but what you're saying you'd like my father.</v>

2808
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:20.550
<v Speaker 3>It didn't black people sitting back like,</v>

2809
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:22.380

2812
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:26.550

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:41.611
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2824
01:21:41.611 --> 01:21:42.444

2825
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:43.650
<v Speaker 3>my parents</v>

2826
01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 3>separated at a young age.</v>

2827
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:48.563
<v Speaker 3>First off,</v>

2828
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.160

2831
01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.290
<v Speaker 3>They had my mother and my father.</v>

2832
01:21:58.291 --> 01:21:59.124
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2833
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:00.200
<v Speaker 3>Not that,</v>

2834
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:00.451
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2835
01:22:00.451 --> 01:22:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2836
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.141
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2837
01:22:01.141 --> 01:22:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Cut My friends by her parents may say,</v>

2838
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.400
<v Speaker 3>my parents separated.</v>

2839
01:22:04.401 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were married.</v>

2840
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:07.560
<v Speaker 3>That's two winds</v>

2841
01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.280
<v Speaker 3>you up to before he be get to and they separated and mom moved down the street.</v>

2842
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:17.730
<v Speaker 3>You still got to see your fucking father.</v>

2843
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:21.840
<v Speaker 3>So that was a little troubling.</v>

2844
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:24.420
<v Speaker 3>But the whole thing is,</v>

2845
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:28.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure at some point Kaley West,</v>

2846
01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:30.600
<v Speaker 3>we'll be able to speak a language that everybody can understand.</v>

2847
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Until then it's only half full of people to speak and understand it.</v>

2848
01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:37.390
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2849
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:38.890
<v Speaker 4>also right here.</v>

2850
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:41.980
<v Speaker 4>But here's my problem with all this and I've been thinking about this a lot.</v>

2851
01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:43.870
<v Speaker 4>They want to medicate him,</v>

2852
01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2853
01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:45.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2996
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.970
<v Speaker 3>we can get along.</v>

2997
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.110
<v Speaker 3>The three of us in this room,</v>

2998
01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:07.040
<v Speaker 3>there have no problems.</v>

2999
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.010
<v Speaker 3>So when we people expand out what goes wrong?</v>

3000
01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Like if something goes wrong when you get to like 3 million,</v>

3001
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:14.653
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

3002
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:16.970
<v Speaker 3>3 million was just humans.</v>

3003
01:27:16.971 --> 01:27:18.260
<v Speaker 3>It's people expand out.</v>

3004
01:27:18.261 --> 01:27:22.190
<v Speaker 3>You get a couple of people together and most people can be fine together.</v>

3005
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.180
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>

3006
01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority,</v>

3007
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:26.810
<v Speaker 3>it's when you get to large numbers,</v>

3008
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.890
<v Speaker 3>it gets fucked up.</v>

3009
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.880
<v Speaker 3>It gets fucked up.</v>

3010
01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.940
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like people are supposed to live in small towns,</v>

3011
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>towns with all.</v>

3014
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.090
<v Speaker 3>How about if we lived in a small town with all comedians</v>

3015
01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.120
<v Speaker 3>right now I would be,</v>

3016
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:45.980
<v Speaker 3>if I live in a small town right now,</v>

3017
01:27:45.981 --> 01:27:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I would be a grandfather.</v>

3018
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:48.890
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>

3019
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:52.490
<v Speaker 3>100% what do you do in small towns?</v>

3027
01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Young comedians will actually kill each other.</v>

3028
01:28:03.981 --> 01:28:04.814

<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

3137
01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:26.161
<v Speaker 1>you should try,</v>

3138
01:31:26.161 --> 01:31:26.631
<v Speaker 1>you should try it.</v>

3139
01:31:26.631 --> 01:31:28.080
<v Speaker 1>So the first time I went on,</v>

3140
01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:29.160
<v Speaker 1>people were excited about it.</v>

3141
01:31:29.161 --> 01:31:31.800
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know what to expect and I wrote all these jokes.</v>

3142
01:31:31.801 --> 01:31:32.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3143
01:31:32.011 --> 01:31:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

3144
01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I got 30 minutes.</v>

3145
01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.033
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3146
01:31:34.230 --> 01:31:35.063
<v Speaker 1>I was so cocky.</v>

3147
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.200
<v Speaker 1>We say have an open mic and you know,</v>

3148
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Mike List is like 30 people and I would be like 10 on the list and they would</v>

3149
01:31:41.571 --> 01:31:42.211
<v Speaker 1>keep bumping me.</v>

3150
01:31:42.211 --> 01:31:44.130
<v Speaker 1>And I thought they were just trying to save me the headline.</v>

3151
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think they were just trying to give me the shittiest spot,</v>

3152
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:49.890
<v Speaker 1>but half the club came to see me so they would stay there.</v>

3153
01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And at first time I went on and all these jokes I planned I was going to do and</v>

3154
01:31:54.871 --> 01:31:56.910
<v Speaker 1>when I went on stage I drew a complete blank.</v>

3155
01:31:57.330 --> 01:31:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I remember shit.</v>

3156
01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And then I went without no,</v>

3157
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:00.551
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3158
01:32:00.551 --> 01:32:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I start fucking with somebody in the audience.</v>

3159
01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.673
<v Speaker 1>I got a laugh.</v>

3160
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.201
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

3161
01:32:04.201 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 1>I did my material and I've,</v>

3162
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the light was.</v>

3163
01:32:07.450 --> 01:32:09.520
<v Speaker 1>They gave me the light and I was like,</v>

3164
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:10.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3165
01:32:10.121 --> 01:32:10.954
<v Speaker 1>I've got a goal.</v>

3166
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Like you know the light means just make that your last joke.</v>

3167
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3168
01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And I got off abruptly.</v>

3169
01:32:15.371 --> 01:32:15.920
<v Speaker 1>They ask,</v>

3170
01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:16.691
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

3171
01:32:16.691 --> 01:32:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I got to go and people started booing,</v>

3172
01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:20.860
<v Speaker 1>the host went up and there was,</v>

3173
01:32:20.861 --> 01:32:21.401
<v Speaker 1>I know Daniel,</v>

3174
01:32:21.401 --> 01:32:23.110
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know he's new is his first time.</v>

3175
01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:24.250
<v Speaker 1>He don't know what to like me.</v>

3176
01:32:24.251 --> 01:32:25.150
<v Speaker 1>He'll be like,</v>

3177
01:32:25.151 --> 01:32:25.984
<v Speaker 1>he'll be back.</v>

3178
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:26.980
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3179
01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I was there almost every Wednesday for eight months and then I moved to new</v>

3180
01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.900
<v Speaker 1>first I moved to New York six months.</v>

3181
01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3184
01:32:37.211 --> 01:32:40.090
<v Speaker 1>First Club was or live?</v>

3185
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Either one.</v>

3186
01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn,</v>

3187
01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:42.101
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn,</v>

3188
01:32:42.101 --> 01:32:42.341
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

3189
01:32:42.341 --> 01:32:43.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad barrel.</v>

3190
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:44.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why until it stops.</v>

3191
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:45.880
<v Speaker 1>But Brooke,</v>

3192
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:50.380
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting to me cause I didn't go from from DC to like mainstream white</v>

3193
01:32:50.381 --> 01:32:50.601
<v Speaker 1>colors.</v>

3194
01:32:50.601 --> 01:32:52.780
<v Speaker 1>I was doing still to kettle rooms and shit.</v>

3195
01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:54.940
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times I couldn't get spots.</v>

3196
01:32:55.150 --> 01:32:56.510
<v Speaker 1>So I would go to a,</v>

3197
01:32:56.890 --> 01:32:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I will go to the um,</v>

3198
01:32:58.450 --> 01:33:01.820
<v Speaker 1>poetry open mikes cause that she used to be so doll,</v>

3199
01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.240
<v Speaker 1>the water was shifting the wave wave and I'd be like,</v>

3200
01:33:07.241 --> 01:33:08.680
<v Speaker 1>is anybody want break for this shit?</v>

3201
01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3202
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And then I would go do just when I couldn't do conquers,</v>

3203
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I will do that until I started making a name for myself and never looked back.</v>

3204
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:16.691
<v Speaker 1>It was dope.</v>

3205
01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:20.750
<v Speaker 1>New York is a great place to get your chops up here.</v>

3206
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you enter New York?</v>

3207
01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:27.250
<v Speaker 1>It had to be probably like 95,</v>

3208
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.280
<v Speaker 1>probably like 95 giant dirty moved.</v>

3209
01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd gone,</v>

3210
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I left in [inaudible] 94 to come to la.</v>

3211
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3212
01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.150
<v Speaker 1>When did you get out of here?</v>

3213
01:33:34.630 --> 01:33:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I got out here like seven years ago,</v>

3214
01:33:36.970 --> 01:33:37.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe eight years ago.</v>

3215
01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:38.771
<v Speaker 1>And there was,</v>

3216
01:33:38.771 --> 01:33:40.030
<v Speaker 1>because my,</v>

3217
01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:44.710
<v Speaker 1>my sister was different because I wasn't getting a lot of roadwork and I was</v>

3218
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:44.831
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3219
01:33:44.831 --> 01:33:45.390
<v Speaker 1>well fuck,</v>

3220
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:48.640
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not getting lot of roadwork I might as well try to get more film and</v>

3221
01:33:48.641 --> 01:33:50.170
<v Speaker 1>television stuff to move out to la.</v>

3222
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:51.730
<v Speaker 1>And then when I moved out here,</v>

3223
01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:52.773
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

3224
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:55.010
<v Speaker 1>started getting more personal parents.</v>

3225
01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:00.020
<v Speaker 1>And so basically I moved to La and became a road comic and I wasn't mad at it</v>

3226
01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:03.100
<v Speaker 1>because after you've done it for a while,</v>

3227
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:06.970
<v Speaker 1>you just want to where the fucking I can make money doing this shit.</v>

3228
01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:07.751
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3229
01:34:07.751 --> 01:34:08.920
<v Speaker 1>If the road is the road,</v>

3230
01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.211
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3231
01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:10.991
<v Speaker 1>If it's Hollywood,</v>

3232
01:34:10.991 --> 01:34:11.560
<v Speaker 1>it's Hollywood.</v>

3233
01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:16.420
<v Speaker 1>But who's going to pay me some money and it was the road to now like I do 40</v>

3234
01:34:16.421 --> 01:34:17.254
<v Speaker 1>weekends a year,</v>

3235
01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:20.110
<v Speaker 1>but with me having a a young kid,</v>

3236
01:34:20.111 --> 01:34:25.111
<v Speaker 1>now I'm trying to focus more in film and television and get some more stable</v>

3237
01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:26.131
<v Speaker 1>shit cause I'm,</v>

3238
01:34:26.131 --> 01:34:26.964
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a little,</v>

3239
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3240
01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:28.030
<v Speaker 1>it's getting burnt.</v>

3241
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say this because I've said it too many times.</v>

3242
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:33.490
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] she didn't have a podcast.</v>

3243
01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the humor man did.</v>

3244
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I started a thousand podcasts.</v>

3245
01:34:40.001 --> 01:34:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I need to start yours.</v>

3246
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm with it.</v>

3247
01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you my dude like you should do it.</v>

3248
01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I used to do and I miss,</v>

3249
01:34:47.051 --> 01:34:47.861
<v Speaker 1>I used to do radio.</v>

3250
01:34:47.861 --> 01:34:48.461
<v Speaker 1>I did radio.</v>

3251
01:34:48.461 --> 01:34:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I did hot 97 but I would love to do a pocket here and natural.</v>

3252
01:34:51.881 --> 01:34:53.680
<v Speaker 1>You could have the number one podcast in the country.</v>

3253
01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:54.341
<v Speaker 1>No bullshit.</v>

3254
01:34:54.341 --> 01:34:56.680
<v Speaker 1>100% let's do anything,</v>

3255
01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:57.673
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

3256
01:34:57.710 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3257
01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.000
<v Speaker 4>it'd be easy.</v>

3258
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:02.930
<v Speaker 4>You just need someone to make you an account and just up shit.</v>

3259
01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:06.530
<v Speaker 4>You could upload it literally from your iPhone or whatever phone you use.</v>

3260
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.540
<v Speaker 4>You put a little microphone in the bottom of it.</v>

3261
01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.400
<v Speaker 4>I do it and another reason why,</v>

3262
01:35:10.401 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 4>because I'll always want to talk.</v>

3263
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:13.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3264
01:35:13.011 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's fun.</v>

3265
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.411
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

3266
01:35:15.411 --> 01:35:16.940
<v Speaker 4>But you've been in the game for a while.</v>

3267
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.863
<v Speaker 4>Nine years,</v>

3268
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:19.890
<v Speaker 4>almost 10 when you were,</v>

3269
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:21.680
<v Speaker 4>you could see yourself pioneer.</v>

3270
01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:22.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3271
01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.140
<v Speaker 4>there's people that before made for sure.</v>

3272
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:25.820
<v Speaker 4>I was just one of the early adopters.</v>

3273
01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:26.930
<v Speaker 4>I'd say early adopter,</v>

3274
01:35:26.931 --> 01:35:28.100
<v Speaker 4>but it was already established.</v>

3275
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 4>Adam Curry had one,</v>

3276
01:35:29.541 --> 01:35:30.100
<v Speaker 4>I think he's,</v>

3277
01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:35.100
<v Speaker 4>he invented the name podcast and then Adam Carolla went from radio to podcast</v>

3278
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:36.020
<v Speaker 4>and that's when I was like,</v>

3279
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.501
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3280
01:35:36.501 --> 01:35:37.334

01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait a minute.</v>

3282
01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Was he a radio personality for,</v>

3283
01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.780
<v Speaker 4>he was doing the man show?</v>

3284
01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:42.521
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3285
01:35:42.521 --> 01:35:42.680
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3286
01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.110
<v Speaker 4>He did the Mancho and they did he,</v>

3287
01:35:44.150 --> 01:35:47.750
<v Speaker 4>well he was a radio personality first that he did the man show and I think he</v>

3288
01:35:47.751 --> 01:35:49.160
<v Speaker 4>did radio during the same time.</v>

3289
01:35:49.161 --> 01:35:51.110
<v Speaker 4>He did love line during the same time.</v>

3290
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:56.350
<v Speaker 4>And then after that he had a big time syndicated morning radio show and I did</v>

3291
01:35:56.391 --> 01:35:57.500
<v Speaker 4>his radio show a couple of times.</v>

3292
01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 4>And then when he left his radio show and went to podcast,</v>

3293
01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:04.730
<v Speaker 4>he got this professional studio built and everything and I went to visit him and</v>

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Did he say he was a gay Tupac?</v>

3430
01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:36.510
<v Speaker 3>He said that I ain't no killer,</v>

3435
01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:45.960
<v Speaker 3>he already had his movie in his head.</v>

3436
01:39:46.170 --> 01:39:46.870
<v Speaker 3>That's so irritating.</v>

3437
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:48.240
<v Speaker 3>I fought back.</v>

3438
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:51.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm the K two but he already had his hashtag.</v>

3439
01:39:51.441 --> 01:39:54.820
<v Speaker 3>You probably bought the white website trace there at,</v>

3440
01:39:54.821 --> 01:39:56.400
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to start this podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I gotta pee so bad.</v>

3442
01:39:58.110 --> 01:39:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I did two podcasts in a row.</v>

3445
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:04.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll take one of those.</v>

3446
01:40:04.831 --> 01:40:05.710

3450
01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.440
<v Speaker 3>I ain't mad at you son.</v>

3451
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:19.890
<v Speaker 3>just know you know you la.</v>

3453
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3454
01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.500
<v Speaker 3>is this an indycar sativa?</v>

3455
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:26.900
<v Speaker 3>There is some extra spice and next year there's a little extra like I think it's</v>

3456
01:40:26.901 --> 01:40:28.530
<v Speaker 3>called butter butter.</v>

3457
01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:29.550
<v Speaker 3>That why that's like wax.</v>

3458
01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:30.803
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

3459
01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:32.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit it.</v>

3460
01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:33.960
<v Speaker 3>You can't really tell it to be honest with you.</v>

3461
01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:36.960
<v Speaker 3>That's how white boys set up.</v>

3462
01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:39.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3463
01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:40.950
<v Speaker 3>just eat half the ear.</v>

3464
01:40:40.951 --> 01:40:41.784
<v Speaker 3>You'll be okay.</v>

3465
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:44.910
<v Speaker 3>How many people still come up to you about the wire?</v>

3466
01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I know that obviously Chappelle show,</v>

3467
01:40:46.261 --> 01:40:47.370
<v Speaker 3>but the bond,</v>

3468
01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.640
<v Speaker 3>the people that come into me a wired,</v>

3469
01:40:48.641 --> 01:40:52.170
<v Speaker 3>they'd identify by themselves as instant intellects.</v>

3470
01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3471
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.350
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3472
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Like people in</v>

3473
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

3474
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.610
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

3475
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:55.090
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

3476
01:40:55.090 --> 01:40:56.170
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like they're cocky.</v>

3477
01:40:56.171 --> 01:40:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I know you want Chappelle on a couple other things,</v>

3478
01:40:58.511 --> 01:40:59.080
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

3479
01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I really love you from the wire.</v>

3480
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:03.040
<v Speaker 1>That was a dope experience.</v>

3481
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever watch HBO is the corner I started,</v>

3482
01:41:06.551 --> 01:41:06.941
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

3483
01:41:06.941 --> 01:41:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I think I got a,</v>

3484
01:41:07.991 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was six episodes and I watched you,</v>

3485
01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.310
<v Speaker 1>it was a six year olds on the ministers.</v>

3486
01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:12.220
<v Speaker 1>All of it.</v>

3487
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I was in ed.</v>

3488
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3489
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I played a heroin addict and that,</v>

3490
01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:16.683
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

3491
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.310
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't know people that are fans.</v>

3492
01:41:18.610 --> 01:41:19.530
<v Speaker 1>If you are a fan of the wire,</v>

3493
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 1>you definitely been a fan of recording because so many of the actors came back</v>

3494
01:41:22.481 --> 01:41:26.230
<v Speaker 1>to after I watched the wire I wanted more and more content like that.</v>

3495
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:27.640
<v Speaker 1>And so I went back and tried to watch it,</v>

3496
01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:28.420
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

3497
01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I actually enjoyed rewatching the wire more.</v>

3498
01:41:31.230 --> 01:41:31.631
<v Speaker 1>So I've watched,</v>

3499
01:41:31.631 --> 01:41:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I liked to show and I was supposed to,</v>

3500
01:41:33.041 --> 01:41:34.620
<v Speaker 1>my character was supposed to um,</v>

3501
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:35.823
<v Speaker 1>build up more.</v>

3502
01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:38.200
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3503
01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.290
<v Speaker 1>the Baltimore Tourism Board was upset that every time someone goes shooting,</v>

3504
01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:48.300
<v Speaker 1>bought somebody depicted as a drug infested pretty much what it is.</v>

3505
01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's why he went from the,</v>

3506
01:41:50.290 --> 01:41:51.880
<v Speaker 1>if you notice the shift in the writing,</v>

3507
01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 1>it went from the towers to the DOC's.</v>

3508
01:41:54.611 --> 01:41:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3509
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:56.240
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did we get to the docks?</v>

3510
01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.420
<v Speaker 1>That's cause they didn't just want to be in the hood like that.</v>

3511
01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.330
<v Speaker 1>But David Simon,</v>

3512
01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:02.643
<v Speaker 1>he was um,</v>

3513
01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:03.731
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

3514
01:42:03.731 --> 01:42:03.911
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

3515
01:42:03.911 --> 01:42:04.381
<v Speaker 1>I liked you.</v>

3516
01:42:04.381 --> 01:42:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Have you know what you did.</v>

3517
01:42:05.681 --> 01:42:07.960
<v Speaker 1>So they brought me back for the last,</v>

3518
01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:09.160
<v Speaker 1>for the last season.</v>

3519
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.810
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to get Joe to watch it,</v>

3520
01:42:10.811 --> 01:42:11.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3521
01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's 10 years old now.</v>

3522
01:42:12.551 --> 01:42:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

3523
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I get back into an old show,</v>

3524
01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's so good.</v>

3525
01:42:15.821 --> 01:42:16.880
<v Speaker 1>So many people list that way.</v>

3526
01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they were like,</v>

3527
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:22.780
<v Speaker 1>definitely why are fanatics and when they brought me back to last season,</v>

3528
01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I was nervous because HBO the last season of any show on HBO to writers get</v>

3529
01:42:27.701 --> 01:42:29.860
<v Speaker 1>vindictive and they do nasty shit to the characters.</v>

3530
01:42:29.861 --> 01:42:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Like to last season,</v>

3531
01:42:31.121 --> 01:42:31.541
<v Speaker 1>the Oz,</v>

3532
01:42:31.541 --> 01:42:32.650
<v Speaker 1>it was dudes getting raped.</v>

3533
01:42:32.651 --> 01:42:34.060
<v Speaker 1>An Aza wouldn't even on us.</v>

3534
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:35.261
<v Speaker 1>They was like,</v>

3535
01:42:35.261 --> 01:42:35.501
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3536
01:42:35.501 --> 01:42:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Nickelodeon.</v>

01:42:36.341 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to get to the bathroom man.</v>

3538
01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:39.610
<v Speaker 1>But they was right to me.</v>

3539
01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get raped the last season and it was fun topic.</v>

3540
01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I know I've got to settle down and choose it for a run.</v>

3541
01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3542
01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:49.360

3545
01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:51.760
<v Speaker 1>it's so good.</v>

3546
01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:56.500
<v Speaker 1>His character comes up at like the best time and he's not to spoiler alert it,</v>

3547
01:42:56.501 --> 01:42:59.680
<v Speaker 1>but like the follow the money starts with him and like that's a,</v>

3548
01:42:59.710 --> 01:43:00.543
<v Speaker 1>that's why,</v>

3549
01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:01.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3550
01:43:01.501 --> 01:43:04.870
<v Speaker 1>that did my role would have been like if they didn't switch the tone,</v>

3551
01:43:04.871 --> 01:43:06.370
<v Speaker 1>if they would've kept it in the towers.</v>

3552
01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:11.820
<v Speaker 1>My Shit was cause I was the connection between the streets and the politics.</v>

3553
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I know I could have blown I out.</v>

3554
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:16.600
<v Speaker 1>And when I first got busted,</v>

3555
01:43:16.601 --> 01:43:17.321
<v Speaker 1>when I was in a room,</v>

01:43:17.321 --> 01:43:17.861
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to,</v>

3562
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:22.241

3569
01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3570
01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:30.460

3571
01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.840
<v Speaker 1>my name is Daniel.</v>

3572
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:34.210
<v Speaker 1>And they mostly call me lieutenant.</v>

3573
01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:37.690
<v Speaker 1>And this is have to had already seen how old robbed a whole Korean because I</v>

3574
01:43:37.691 --> 01:43:38.920
<v Speaker 1>thought he was a driver with me.</v>

3575
01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And that character's should have been off by then.</v>

3576
01:43:41.261 --> 01:43:43.630
<v Speaker 1>But so it was a good opportunity.</v>

3577
01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:45.070
<v Speaker 1>There was another cool platform.</v>

3578
01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:45.970
<v Speaker 1>It was dope.</v>

3579
01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I can honestly say whatever happens in my career.</v>

3580
01:43:48.730 --> 01:43:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I was on two shows.</v>

3581
01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>There are good go down</v>

3582
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:52.970
<v Speaker 2>in television history.</v>

3583
01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:54.930
<v Speaker 2>The wires you have,</v>

3584
01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I believe you about the wire.</v>

3585
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:58.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody says it.</v>

3586
01:43:58.250 --> 01:43:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I just had,</v>

3587
01:43:58.670 --> 01:44:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I never saddled down and washed it.</v>

3588
01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.870
<v Speaker 2>But for sure Chappelle show is the greatest sketch comedy.</v>

3589
01:44:03.871 --> 01:44:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3590
01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.850
<v Speaker 2>it's one number one and number two is like that and in living color.</v>

3591
01:44:07.851 --> 01:44:11.390
<v Speaker 2>And you could pick your spot depending upon when you grew up and what it meant</v>

3592
01:44:11.391 --> 01:44:11.870
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

3593
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Because for a lot of people in living color too,</v>

3594
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>cause it was on Fox,</v>

3595
01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:16.310
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have to have cable to get it.</v>

3596
01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.010
<v Speaker 2>It was on Fox and I have to have cable.</v>

3597
01:44:19.011 --> 01:44:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to understand a Fox Fox was right,</v>

3598
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:23.450
<v Speaker 2>but then it was like,</v>

3599
01:44:23.451 --> 01:44:27.020
<v Speaker 2>it was new too because it was for the most part of all black cast,</v>

3600
01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:27.951
<v Speaker 2>all black cast.</v>

3601
01:44:27.951 --> 01:44:28.900
<v Speaker 2>When you dancers,</v>

3602
01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:29.650
<v Speaker 2>dancers,</v>

3603
01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:32.060
<v Speaker 2>it was Jennifer Lopez.</v>

3604
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was making money and getting to ask when that was,</v>

3605
01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:38.480
<v Speaker 2>don't the wins I think who wasn't shine was Dj.</v>

3606
01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he knew how to Dj.</v>

3607
01:44:39.741 --> 01:44:43.220
<v Speaker 2>But Keenan had deaf fucking vision man.</v>

3608
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3609
01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:44.511
<v Speaker 2>He had that vision.</v>

3610
01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Who's like the seasons in that go?</v>

3611
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.931

<v Speaker 2>probably six.</v>

3613
01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:50.670
<v Speaker 2>But they're really go that man.</v>

3614
01:44:50.850 --> 01:44:51.620

01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:52.550
<v Speaker 2>that was the show.</v>

3616
01:44:52.730 --> 01:44:54.950

3617
01:44:54.951 --> 01:44:55.280
<v Speaker 2>they will,</v>

3618
01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 2>every year they would come around and say they're looking for new people for</v>

<v Speaker 2>living color in every city was like just busting doors down and tried to get an</v>

01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:50.551
<v Speaker 2>Does he drive it?</v>

3706
01:46:50.551 --> 01:46:50.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>

3707
01:46:50.970 --> 01:46:51.620
<v Speaker 2>he was driving it.</v>

3708
01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3709
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:52.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3710
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:54.143
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

3711
01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:55.453
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3712
01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:56.753
<v Speaker 2>Good Dude.</v>

3713
01:46:57.780 --> 01:46:59.060
<v Speaker 2>He never did it.</v>

3714
01:46:59.530 --> 01:47:00.363
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3715
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:02.430
<v Speaker 2>I think he's doing more standup again.</v>

3716
01:47:02.970 --> 01:47:04.350
<v Speaker 2>I heard he's doing more standup,</v>

3717
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.951
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3718
01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:05.784
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

3719
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:10.850
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough thing to do to probably to get that level as an international,</v>

3720
01:47:11.650 --> 01:47:12.750
<v Speaker 2>a list superstar,</v>

3721
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:15.360
<v Speaker 2>to still have the passion to do stand up.</v>

3722
01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3723
01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:17.400
<v Speaker 2>You got to want it.</v>

3724
01:47:17.610 --> 01:47:19.530
<v Speaker 2>You gotta want to do it for some strange reason.</v>

3725
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Let the motherfuckers peers in your group.</v>

3726
01:47:22.231 --> 01:47:22.411
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3727
01:47:22.411 --> 01:47:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I still got it.</v>

3728
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker.</v>

3729
01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.713
<v Speaker 2>You know who did,</v>

3730
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:26.700
<v Speaker 2>who did you ever see that thing?</v>

3731
01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:29.100
<v Speaker 2>It was about maybe a year or so ago.</v>

3732
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Right when bill Cosby was in the heat of all his trouble,</v>

3733
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:37.130
<v Speaker 2>where Eddie Murphy did some stand up on a day s like in front of a platform that</v>

3734
01:47:37.471 --> 01:47:37.950
<v Speaker 2>was for,</v>

3735
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:40.410
<v Speaker 2>it was an award he got at the Kennedy Center.</v>

3736
01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.510
<v Speaker 2>It was some type of cultural show.</v>

3737
01:47:42.511 --> 01:47:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember exactly the name of it,</v>

3738
01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:45.241
<v Speaker 2>but I remember,</v>

3739
01:47:45.241 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I think Dave was a part of that tour.</v>

3740
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.393
<v Speaker 2>That was a big deal.</v>

3741
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:50.130
<v Speaker 2>But what got me was how good he was.</v>

3742
01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh God damn.</v>

3743
01:47:51.451 --> 01:47:52.410
<v Speaker 2>He's good.</v>

3744
01:47:53.010 --> 01:47:53.910
<v Speaker 2>He's a comedian.</v>

3745
01:47:53.911 --> 01:47:54.744
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3746
01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:58.140
<v Speaker 2>even though he's not using the stage platform,</v>

3747
01:47:58.680 --> 01:47:59.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3748
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.460
<v Speaker 2>he sits around or it's like,</v>

3749
01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:03.480
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

3750
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3751
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:04.763
<v Speaker 2>that will be fun.</v>

3752
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

3753
01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3754
01:48:06.090 --> 01:48:06.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3755
01:48:06.391 --> 01:48:11.100
<v Speaker 2>he had this whole routine about them taking bill Cosby's a doctorate degree away</v>

3756
01:48:11.101 --> 01:48:11.934
<v Speaker 2>from him.</v>

3757
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 2>He had this whole bit about it when he's doing the bill Cosby impression wise</v>

3758
01:48:15.091 --> 01:48:15.211
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3759
01:48:15.211 --> 01:48:15.391
<v Speaker 2>I ain't,</v>

3760
01:48:15.391 --> 01:48:15.571
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3761
01:48:15.571 --> 01:48:16.051
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

3762
01:48:16.051 --> 01:48:16.450
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3763
01:48:16.450 --> 01:48:19.920
<v Speaker 2>you killed the timing was that would be so good to see him do it again.</v>

3764
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm thinking is,</v>

3765
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:22.950
<v Speaker 2>is it was so powerful.</v>

3766
01:48:22.951 --> 01:48:23.401
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3767
01:48:23.401 --> 01:48:23.911
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

3768
01:48:23.911 --> 01:48:26.100
<v Speaker 2>we missed out on years of this.</v>

3769
01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3770
01:48:27.181 --> 01:48:27.571
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

3771
01:48:27.571 --> 01:48:28.590
<v Speaker 2>what would he talk about?</v>

3772
01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:30.420
<v Speaker 2>He's like probably close to being a grant.</v>

3773
01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Can you play a little bit?</v>

3774
01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:33.323
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3775
01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's only a minute long.</v>

3776
01:48:34.681 --> 01:48:35.514
<v Speaker 2>Just give me a little bit.</v>

3777
01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:36.473
<v Speaker 6>Just give me a little bit.</v>

3778

<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>

3781
01:48:42.090 --> 01:48:42.960

3782
01:48:42.961 --> 01:48:43.794
<v Speaker 6>He says</v>

3785
01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.290
<v Speaker 6>When he went,</v>

3786
01:48:49.290 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 6>you did the trophies back.</v>

3787
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Hostos man.</v>

3788
01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:55.591
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3789
01:48:55.591 --> 01:48:56.341
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

3790
01:48:56.341 --> 01:48:58.080
<v Speaker 2>when you watch him do this,</v>

3791
01:48:58.110 --> 01:48:58.950
<v Speaker 2>this routine,</v>

3792
01:48:58.951 --> 01:48:59.311
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

3793
01:48:59.311 --> 01:49:00.031
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3794
01:49:00.031 --> 01:49:00.990
<v Speaker 2>he's still got it.</v>

3795
01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:02.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like he motherfucking Murphy.</v>

3796
01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I nobody hasn't done any standup in forever and it was like he's been doing it</v>

3797
01:49:06.391 --> 01:49:07.224
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

3798
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3799
01:49:07.591 --> 01:49:11.100
<v Speaker 2>but you got to look at him when he came on like certain people to just naturals</v>

3800
01:49:11.101 --> 01:49:11.730
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

3801
01:49:11.730 --> 01:49:13.650
<v Speaker 2>But it's so sad that he hasn't been doing it,</v>

3802
01:49:13.651 --> 01:49:14.484
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3803
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:15.750
<v Speaker 2>When you stop and think,</v>

3804
01:49:15.751 --> 01:49:16.920
<v Speaker 2>go from raw,</v>

3805
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:18.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3806
01:49:18.001 --> 01:49:21.390
<v Speaker 2>delirious to Ra to nothing for all these years.</v>

3807
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:23.520
<v Speaker 2>And he might be if he's not enough,</v>

3808
01:49:23.521 --> 01:49:24.480
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't say nothing.</v>

3809
01:49:24.481 --> 01:49:25.650
<v Speaker 2>International movie star,</v>

3810
01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:26.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3811
01:49:26.371 --> 01:49:26.730
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

3812
01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:27.563
<v Speaker 2>you mean for sure?</v>

3813
01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is terms of his do his stand up.</v>

3814
01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

3815
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.931
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

3816
01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:31.764
<v Speaker 2>I mean Wayne,</v>

3817
01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:33.630
<v Speaker 2>he's an international movie star,</v>

3818
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.080
<v Speaker 2>but he could have been one of the greatest of all time if he isn't already money</v>

3819
01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:40.560
<v Speaker 2>is already,</v>

3820
01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:43.770
<v Speaker 2>you have a top 10 you got to kind of put Eddie Murphy in there of course.</v>

3821
01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:45.150
<v Speaker 2>But he could be number one ever.</v>

3822
01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3823
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:46.860
<v Speaker 2>If he just kept doing it.</v>

3824
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 2>But he made us,</v>

3825
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:49.660
<v Speaker 2>it would just be interesting,</v>

3826
01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:51.010
<v Speaker 2>but he made his mark.</v>

3827
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Nobody was fucking doing it.</v>

3828
01:49:52.511 --> 01:49:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Like we got big names and stuff now,</v>

3829
01:49:54.881 --> 01:49:56.380
<v Speaker 2>but Eddie Murphy was just like,</v>

3830
01:49:57.070 --> 01:50:01.240
<v Speaker 2>everybody was talking about him like his special job for the next day.</v>

3831
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was quoting lines from it.</v>

3832
01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3833
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:07.790
<v Speaker 2>I watched it with my friend Jimmy and a with a,</v>

3834
01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.910
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of his friends and we were probably like 18 or something like that.</v>

3835
01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe raw Dylan,</v>

3836
01:50:14.861 --> 01:50:17.020
<v Speaker 2>1718 delirious.</v>

3837
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.790
<v Speaker 2>So Beth and I remember we were just like,</v>

3838
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:19.990
<v Speaker 2>everyone was stunned.</v>

3839
01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:20.861
<v Speaker 2>Like we were just,</v>

3840
01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:23.280
<v Speaker 2>everyone was sitting back on the couch going,</v>

3841
01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

3842
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 2>that was incredible.</v>

3843
01:50:24.971 --> 01:50:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Dice clay had that energy.</v>

3844
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3845
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Dice clay head.</v>

3846
01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was like,</v>

3847
01:50:29.111 --> 01:50:31.380
<v Speaker 2>what you said when spatials were really special,</v>

3848
01:50:31.381 --> 01:50:32.680
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't very many of them.</v>

3887
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.851
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

3888
01:51:30.851 --> 01:51:32.270
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a rough rough,</v>

3889
01:51:32.410 --> 01:51:33.370
<v Speaker 2>but the way he said it,</v>

3890
01:51:33.371 --> 01:51:34.390
<v Speaker 2>the way Kinison said it,</v>

3891
01:51:34.391 --> 01:51:34.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3892

<v Speaker 2>she saw me,</v>

3893
01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.460
<v Speaker 2>I went and got it on VHS after that to watch it.</v>

3894
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:40.001
<v Speaker 2>It was dealt,</v>

3895
01:51:40.001 --> 01:51:44.620
<v Speaker 2>but she was lying on her stomach in the parking lot to pretend to be a dead body</v>

3896
01:51:44.890 --> 01:51:46.990
<v Speaker 2>because what had happened was he's homosexual nature,</v>

3897
01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:47.920
<v Speaker 2>the Kennison bit,</v>

3898
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.881
<v Speaker 2>he's homosexual.</v>

3899
01:51:48.881 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Necrophilia Jakks we're paying money to have a little bit of time undisturbed,</v>

3900
01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:54.730
<v Speaker 2>the freshest male corpse.</v>

3901
01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.790
<v Speaker 2>So Kennison lifestyle on stage and he's going,</v>

3902
01:51:57.791 --> 01:52:00.030

3917
01:52:27.631 --> 01:52:28.620
<v Speaker 2>she's yelling out,</v>

3943
01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:06.980
<v Speaker 4>How it happened.</v>

3944
01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:07.610
<v Speaker 4>Both of them.</v>

3945
01:53:07.610 --> 01:53:07.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3946
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:08.803
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>

3947
01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:12.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean don't hit your kid with a car and hope they turn out to be a committee.</v>

3948
01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:13.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you?</v>

3949
01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:14.600
<v Speaker 4>Don't think you're funny,</v>

3950
01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:15.493
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

3951
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.811
<v Speaker 4>with Rosanne,</v>

3952
01:53:17.811 --> 01:53:20.150
<v Speaker 4>she was in a mental institute for nine months,</v>

3953
01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:21.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3954
01:53:21.021 --> 01:53:24.620
<v Speaker 4>and with Kennison they said there was an abrupt change between who he was and</v>

3955
01:53:24.621 --> 01:53:25.311
<v Speaker 4>who he became.</v>

3956
01:53:25.311 --> 01:53:29.840
<v Speaker 4>He got hit by that car and then from then on he was this wild reckless,</v>

3957
01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:33.770
<v Speaker 4>don't give a fuck guy and this ranting raging preacher.</v>

3958
01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.200
<v Speaker 4>But it turned out to be good for oh yeah,</v>

3959
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:37.160
<v Speaker 4>the dark side.</v>

3960
01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:37.993
<v Speaker 4>The dark side is,</v>

3961
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:39.320
<v Speaker 4>and from Roseanne.</v>

3962
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:40.430
<v Speaker 4>It's good for her too.</v>

3963
01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:40.851
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3964
01:53:40.851 --> 01:53:41.320
<v Speaker 4>And then you,</v>

3965
01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 4>I be done now we haven't heard.</v>

3966
01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.001
<v Speaker 4>How's that show?</v>

3967
01:53:44.001 --> 01:53:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Don't her spinoff?</v>

3968
01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:45.793
<v Speaker 4>Is it doing good?</v>

3969
01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:47.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's doing that good.</v>

3970
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:48.590
<v Speaker 4>I think it's dropping off.</v>

3971
01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Lou Roseanne is in my opinion,</v>

3972
01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:55.640
<v Speaker 4>like having a person with a broken leg and expecting them to kept keep up on a</v>

3973
01:53:55.641 --> 01:53:56.474
<v Speaker 4>hike.</v>

3974
01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:57.210
<v Speaker 4>She's got,</v>

3975
01:53:57.210 --> 01:53:58.310
<v Speaker 4>she's got brain issues.</v>

3976
01:53:58.311 --> 01:54:00.920
<v Speaker 4>She's heavily medicated and you know,</v>

3977
01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:04.100
<v Speaker 4>Adderall and marijuana and all these different things.</v>

3978
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:06.590
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit that's fucking with her head,</v>

3979
01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:07.431
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3980
01:54:07.431 --> 01:54:08.330
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>

3981
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:10.520
<v Speaker 4>they kind of knew that when they're making that show.</v>

3982
01:54:10.521 --> 01:54:11.750
<v Speaker 4>I really think they did.</v>

3983
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:13.010
<v Speaker 4>I really think they knew that,</v>

3984
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:14.960
<v Speaker 4>but they'll roll a dice.</v>

3985
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.883
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3986
01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:21.190
<v Speaker 4>But it's also one of those things where like there's lovable parts about that</v>

3987
01:54:21.261 --> 01:54:24.650
<v Speaker 4>show because of the fact that she's kind of loony,</v>

3988
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:25.280
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3989
01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:28.380
<v Speaker 4>And she's self admittedly loony and self,</v>

3990
01:54:28.381 --> 01:54:30.500
<v Speaker 4>admittedly dedicated Trey man,</v>

3991
01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:32.990
<v Speaker 4>the most interesting person is a train wreck.</v>

3992
01:54:33.710 --> 01:54:34.290
<v Speaker 4>It's true the most.</v>

3993
01:54:34.290 --> 01:54:37.700
<v Speaker 4>It was the person to watch somebody you think you could probably do better or</v>

3994
01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.050
<v Speaker 4>smarter than her does.</v>

3995
01:54:39.051 --> 01:54:39.710
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

3996
01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:42.890
<v Speaker 4>we'd like when successful people have a giant major flaw,</v>

3997
01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.060
<v Speaker 4>like a brain injury,</v>

3998
01:54:44.061 --> 01:54:45.920
<v Speaker 4>whether it makes them a ramble about shit,</v>

3999
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4000
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:47.091
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4001
01:54:47.091 --> 01:54:47.924
<v Speaker 4>I'll push for that,</v>

4002
01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:49.371
<v Speaker 4>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

4003
01:54:49.371 --> 01:54:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Like so like levers with no brain.</v>

4004
01:54:52.410 --> 01:54:53.180
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

4005
01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:53.990
<v Speaker 4>who comes a needle?</v>

4006
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.950
<v Speaker 4>The needle comes out.</v>

4007
01:54:54.951 --> 01:54:57.320
<v Speaker 4>It's shit like inject full for Kennison.</v>

4008
01:54:57.321 --> 01:54:58.380
<v Speaker 4>Like Kennison was a,</v>

4009
01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.260
<v Speaker 4>he was a groundbreaking comedian.</v>

4010
01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:02.120
<v Speaker 4>Like when I remember seeing him,</v>

4011
01:55:02.121 --> 01:55:04.610
<v Speaker 4>and obviously I was only like 18 or 19 at the time,</v>

4012
01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:06.290
<v Speaker 4>but I remember seeing him being like,</v>

4013
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.651
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4014
01:55:06.651 --> 01:55:08.210
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know that this was comedy.</v>

4015
01:55:08.211 --> 01:55:09.280
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know you could do that.</v>

4016
01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:10.760
<v Speaker 4>It was a totally different,</v>

4017
01:55:10.761 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4018
01:55:11.090 --> 01:55:12.050
<v Speaker 4>he didn't give a shit.</v>

4019
01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:14.750
<v Speaker 4>He did a show where he would call up,</v>

4020
01:55:14.751 --> 01:55:15.860
<v Speaker 4>he would have a phone,</v>

4021
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:17.660
<v Speaker 4>he would have asked some guy in the audience,</v>

4022
01:55:17.661 --> 01:55:19.520
<v Speaker 4>if your heart was ever broken by a girl,</v>

4023
01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:20.361
<v Speaker 4>and the guy would say,</v>

4024
01:55:20.361 --> 01:55:20.811
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

4025

<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>

4026
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:22.363
<v Speaker 4>Tell me what happened.</v>

4027
01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:23.331
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

4028
01:55:23.331 --> 01:55:23.601
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4029

01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:26.330
<v Speaker 8>she left me.</v>

4031
01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:26.811

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.230
<v Speaker 8>And he would get on the stage.</v>

4035
01:55:30.231 --> 01:55:30.470

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:05.590
<v Speaker 2>It was a total shut up.</v>

4136
01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:06.573
<v Speaker 2>He would have.</v>

4137
01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:08.470
<v Speaker 2>They banned him from a lot of things.</v>

4138
01:58:08.471 --> 01:58:10.990
<v Speaker 2>By the time we got to a certain stage and his comedy career,</v>

4139
01:58:10.991 --> 01:58:13.040
<v Speaker 2>there was certain subjects and certain,</v>

4140
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:15.490
<v Speaker 2>you know his bit about aids.</v>

4141
01:58:15.491 --> 01:58:17.510
<v Speaker 2>It was so ruthless and it was like you guys do.</v>

4142
01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:18.071
<v Speaker 2>Then he goes,</v>

4143
01:58:18.071 --> 01:58:19.420
<v Speaker 2>everybody says age shouldn't make fun.</v>

4144
01:58:19.421 --> 01:58:20.254
<v Speaker 2>Eight Sam,</v>

4145
01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:22.060
<v Speaker 2>it's communicable disease.</v>

4146
01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.610
<v Speaker 2>He'll straight people get it till he goes,</v>

4147
01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:24.613
<v Speaker 6>hey ma</v>

4148
01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:28.980
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

4149
01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I remember hearing that going,</v>

4150
01:58:30.010 --> 01:58:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

4151
01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

4152
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:33.361
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

4153
01:58:33.361 --> 01:58:34.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not our dance.</v>

4154
01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4155
01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:36.510
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

4156
01:58:37.170 --> 01:58:37.680
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4157
01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:40.440
<v Speaker 2>there was certain bits like that where people like cut.</v>

4158
01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:42.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4159
01:58:42.810 --> 01:58:45.700
<v Speaker 2>It would be like comedy police everywhere.</v>

4160
01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:46.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4161
01:58:46.121 --> 01:58:48.100
<v Speaker 2>so much of his bits we're punching down.</v>

4162
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:51.820
<v Speaker 2>It was the argument that I got in with the guy who wrote a book on comedy and he</v>

4163
01:58:51.821 --> 01:58:54.040
<v Speaker 2>was telling me the comedy always has to punch up.</v>

4164
01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:54.821
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

4165
01:58:54.821 --> 01:58:54.971
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4166
01:58:54.971 --> 01:58:55.541
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

4167
01:58:55.541 --> 01:58:56.374
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

4168
01:58:56.530 --> 01:58:56.771
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

4169
01:58:56.771 --> 01:58:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Sam Kiss and had one of the greatest bits of all time.</v>

4170
01:58:58.991 --> 01:59:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Two of the greatest bits of all time.</v>

4171
01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:01.030
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

4172
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:02.330
<v Speaker 2>there was a dude who's getting</v>

4173
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:04.070
<v Speaker 8>fucked in the ass after he was dead.</v>

4174
01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:05.973
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4175
01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:11.390
<v Speaker 8>Committee that nominated and made that one of all times,</v>

4176
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:12.780
<v Speaker 2>but go ahead.</v>

4177
01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:16.050
<v Speaker 2>And then the other one was the bit about watching someone,</v>

4178
01:59:16.051 --> 01:59:16.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4179
01:59:16.171 --> 01:59:17.010
<v Speaker 2>this one burnt,</v>

4180
01:59:17.130 --> 01:59:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I lost the Asher and the other one was a bit about us watching a commercial to</v>

4181
01:59:23.670 --> 01:59:27.630
<v Speaker 2>will you please donate money to feed the starving children in Africa?</v>

4182
01:59:27.810 --> 01:59:28.830
<v Speaker 2>And he's saying,</v>

4183
01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.150
<v Speaker 2>which just occurred to us,</v>

4184
01:59:30.330 --> 01:59:30.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4185
01:59:30.721 --> 01:59:33.210
<v Speaker 2>like there wouldn't be world hunger if you people</v>

4186
01:59:33.330 --> 01:59:34.360
<v Speaker 8>move where that photo,</v>

4187
01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:39.600
<v Speaker 8>he has this horrible fucking joke and there's a SARS punching down of all time.</v>

4188
01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:43.460
<v Speaker 8>He's making fun of starving children and it's so good.</v>

4189
01:59:43.461 --> 01:59:44.400
<v Speaker 8>It's just an observation.</v>

4190
01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:45.950
<v Speaker 8>I call it an observation and,</v>

4191
01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:46.681
<v Speaker 8>and he's like,</v>

4192
01:59:46.681 --> 01:59:46.951
<v Speaker 8>he goes,</v>

4193
01:59:46.951 --> 01:59:47.280
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

4194
01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:48.810
<v Speaker 8>we got deserts in America too.</v>

4195
01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.770
<v Speaker 8>We just don't live it.</v>

4196
01:59:49.771 --> 01:59:50.640
<v Speaker 8>I'm asshole.</v>

4197
01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:51.121
<v Speaker 8>He goes,</v>

4198
01:59:51.121 --> 01:59:51.954
<v Speaker 8>don't send them food,</v>

4199
01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:52.950
<v Speaker 8>sending you emails.</v>

4200
01:59:53.170 --> 01:59:53.360
<v Speaker 8>Send.</v>

4201
01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:54.360
<v Speaker 8>I'm sounding like me.</v>

4202
01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:56.010
<v Speaker 8>He's getting his,</v>

4203
01:59:56.011 --> 01:59:59.460
<v Speaker 8>he kept going to take you where the food and they,</v>

4204
01:59:59.461 --> 02:00:01.110
<v Speaker 8>that's all they need to do is simple.</v>

4205
02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:02.860
<v Speaker 8>He had a joke where he was saying,</v>

4206
02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:03.541
<v Speaker 8>he literally saying,</v>

4207
02:00:03.541 --> 02:00:03.990
<v Speaker 8>see that,</v>

4208
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.680
<v Speaker 8>see that.</v>

4209
02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:05.610
<v Speaker 8>It's fucking sad.</v>

4210
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:10.740
<v Speaker 8>No one's going to be a hundred years from now fucking pack your kids cash.</v>

4211
02:00:10.741 --> 02:00:13.010
<v Speaker 8>We didn't take you where the food is as fun.</v>

4212
02:00:13.050 --> 02:00:17.250
<v Speaker 8>You were crying and it was the most ruthless and wrong thing that anybody could</v>

4213
02:00:17.251 --> 02:00:18.084
<v Speaker 8>ever say.</v>

4214
02:00:18.090 --> 02:00:20.700
<v Speaker 8>You're talking about starving children and it was,</v>

4215
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:22.260
<v Speaker 8>you can manage down,</v>

4216
02:00:22.261 --> 02:00:23.160
<v Speaker 8>you can make it all work.</v>

4217
02:00:23.250 --> 02:00:24.083
<v Speaker 8>We can make it all work.</v>

4218
02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:25.020
<v Speaker 8>He,</v>

4219
02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:27.720
<v Speaker 8>you can hunt you down with earthquake like effects.</v>

4220
02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:28.890
<v Speaker 8>Boom.</v>

4221
02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.513
<v Speaker 2>What a punch.</v>

4222
02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I probably killed it at the end with a punch.</v>

4223
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:36.750
<v Speaker 2>It was unbelievably funny and it was one of the most punched down things you</v>

4224
02:00:36.751 --> 02:00:37.584
<v Speaker 2>could ever do.</v>

4225
02:00:37.650 --> 02:00:39.600
<v Speaker 2>He's making fun of starving babies.</v>

4226
02:00:39.630 --> 02:00:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it could be done.</v>

4227
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:42.180
<v Speaker 2>You can make fun of anything.</v>

4228
02:00:42.210 --> 02:00:42.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

4229
02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:45.030
<v Speaker 2>we have to know that we have to know two things.</v>

4230
02:00:45.031 --> 02:00:45.271
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

4231
02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:48.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not really happening the way you're saying it cause you're just joking and</v>

4232
02:00:48.391 --> 02:00:49.224
<v Speaker 2>it's comedy.</v>

4233
02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:52.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a observation.</v>

4234
02:00:52.230 --> 02:00:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4235
02:00:52.710 --> 02:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said Donald can a joke be too soon and I don't think it's a joke.</v>

4236
02:00:57.151 --> 02:00:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Could be too soon,</v>

4237
02:00:58.260 --> 02:00:59.260
<v Speaker 2>but it never could be too.</v>

4238
02:00:59.261 --> 02:01:04.140
<v Speaker 2>So for funny observation is the observation that we say we can go,</v>

4239
02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:09.560
<v Speaker 2>we could go to a fucking funeral being up mother phone inside laughing like</v>

4240
02:01:09.841 --> 02:01:10.640
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

4241
02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4242
02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:11.640
<v Speaker 2>And everybody would go,</v>

4243
02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:12.473
<v Speaker 2>going to tumble.</v>

4244
02:01:12.590 --> 02:01:13.320
<v Speaker 2>When will,</v>

4245
02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you in heaven when you go to heaven,</v>

4246
02:01:16.290 --> 02:01:18.330
<v Speaker 2>assuming that everybody's going to go to heaven,</v>

4247
02:01:19.110 --> 02:01:20.760
<v Speaker 2>one of the best buy is not going to go to heaven.</v>

4248
02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.080
<v Speaker 2>One of the best lines,</v>

4249
02:01:22.110 --> 02:01:25.680
<v Speaker 2>one of the best one liners I ever heard was from Dave Foley.</v>

4250
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I was on news radio with Dave Foley and after Phil Hartman and gotten murdered</v>

4251
02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:33.270
<v Speaker 2>by his wife and then his wife committed suicide.</v>

4252
02:01:33.450 --> 02:01:34.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4253
02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>He was up for an Emmy and Hartman was,</v>

4254
02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:37.231
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4255
02:01:37.231 --> 02:01:38.064
<v Speaker 2>So we all wet,</v>

4256

<v Speaker 2>I'm going for it.</v>

4302
02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you just have to jump on something.</v>

4303
02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:14.133
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't</v>

4304
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:17.030
<v Speaker 3>make my stomach rumble a little bit,</v>

4305
02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:18.350
<v Speaker 3>a little uncomfortable,</v>

4306
02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:19.430
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4307
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:20.263
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

4308
02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:21.920
<v Speaker 3>it's funny but it's not like,</v>

4309
02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:22.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want my gut to be happy.</v>

4312
02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:25.701
<v Speaker 3>You don't want,</v>

4313
02:03:25.701 --> 02:03:28.160
<v Speaker 3>one thing that I think we should really say is,</v>

4314
02:03:28.161 --> 02:03:28.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4315
02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:33.640
<v Speaker 3>we should really thank all the real comedy club fans that are still coming out.</v>

4316
02:03:34.341 --> 02:03:38.630
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that we're not getting what guys like you and me perform</v>

4317
02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:41.780
<v Speaker 3>wild people when we perform in front of comedy clubs,</v>

4318
02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:42.480
<v Speaker 3>when I can,</v>

4319
02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:43.220
<v Speaker 3>a lot of pushback,</v>

4320
02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:43.431
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4321
02:03:43.431 --> 02:03:44.720
<v Speaker 3>we're getting a lot of good crowds,</v>

4322
02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:45.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4323
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:47.660
<v Speaker 3>It's great crowds and they want to,</v>

4324
02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:51.600
<v Speaker 3>they want to hear that fucking voicemail.</v>

4325
02:03:51.610 --> 02:03:52.820
<v Speaker 3>And I hear that crazy shit</v>

02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:58.240
<v Speaker 3>it's weird because like I'll do shelves,</v>

4328
02:03:58.250 --> 02:04:01.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll do like an improv saying and Cleveland some shit and then I'll have a sold</v>

4331
02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:06.860
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

4332
02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:07.251
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

4333
02:04:07.251 --> 02:04:08.660
<v Speaker 3>how many people follow me on social media?</v>

4334
02:04:08.661 --> 02:04:12.860
<v Speaker 3>And it's like out of a room of like 500 it'll be like four people.</v>

4335
02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:13.911
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

4336

4338
02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:17.960
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is the show is still sold out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And also the best shit,</v>

4348
02:04:32.781 --> 02:04:34.850
<v Speaker 3>the crowd that comes out to see you for sure.</v>

4524
02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:13.570
<v Speaker 4>especially if you have a rifle,</v>

4525
02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:15.790
<v Speaker 4>but you still got to focus.</v>

4526
02:09:16.890 --> 02:09:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>For rifle you do.</v>

4528
02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:19.840
<v Speaker 4>But for a bow and Arrow,</v>

4529
02:09:19.841 --> 02:09:21.130
<v Speaker 4>that's when you really have to focus.</v>

4530
02:09:21.190 --> 02:09:21.710
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

4531
02:09:21.710 --> 02:09:22.543

<v Speaker 4>I don't think everybody should do it.</v>

4542
02:09:40.391 --> 02:09:41.224
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't have to,</v>

02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:42.350
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't want to win.</v>

4544
02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:45.010
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people wouldn't if you told the average person,</v>

4545
02:09:45.630 --> 02:09:46.120

4551
02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.170
<v Speaker 4>But that's just how we're being raised.</v>

4552
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:04.090
<v Speaker 4>It's a denial issue.</v>

4553
02:10:04.210 --> 02:10:05.590
<v Speaker 4>It's not a reality issue.</v>

4554
02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:08.500
<v Speaker 4>Cause the reality is we're still eating animals like crazy.</v>

4555
02:10:08.770 --> 02:10:10.420
<v Speaker 4>The denial is no one's killing them.</v>

02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:11.410
<v Speaker 4>There's like a tiny,</v>

02:10:11.771 --> 02:10:12.131
<v Speaker 4>tiny,</v>

4559
02:10:12.131 --> 02:10:12.491
<v Speaker 4>tiny,</v>

4560
02:10:12.491 --> 02:10:14.260
<v Speaker 4>tiny got to get somebody to do your dirty work.</v>

4561
02:10:14.410 --> 02:10:15.071
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4562
02:10:15.071 --> 02:10:16.780
<v Speaker 4>So because someone's doing your dirty work,</v>

4563
02:10:16.781 --> 02:10:17.740
<v Speaker 4>you don't think it's dirty,</v>

4564
02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.500
<v Speaker 4>but everybody's went,</v>

4565
02:10:20.570 --> 02:10:23.560
<v Speaker 4>this is how this is the shit to get vegans caught out there.</v>

4566
02:10:23.690 --> 02:10:24.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4567
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:27.610
<v Speaker 4>This conversation will turn them off into a Vegan a little bit.</v>

4568
02:10:28.330 --> 02:10:28.840
<v Speaker 4>There's something.</v>

4569
02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:29.471
<v Speaker 4>This does.</v>

4570
02:10:29.471 --> 02:10:29.711
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

4571
02:10:29.711 --> 02:10:30.280
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>

4572
02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:34.490
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why so many people except veganism is because there's a lot of</v>

4573
02:10:34.491 --> 02:10:36.040
<v Speaker 4>really good points with a bill.</v>

4574
02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:38.540
<v Speaker 4>The biggest point is less animal cruelty.</v>

4575
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:39.860
<v Speaker 4>You don't wanna see animal suffer.</v>

4576
02:10:39.861 --> 02:10:41.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to see animals suffer.</v>

4577
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4578
02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:41.961
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

4579
02:10:41.961 --> 02:10:42.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't hear you.</v>

4580
02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:43.850
<v Speaker 3>You are absolutely right,</v>

4581
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:49.270
<v Speaker 3>but I don't hear people push that side of it as much as the,</v>

4582
02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:52.393
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

4583
02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:55.910
<v Speaker 3>dietary habits of it.</v>

4584
02:10:56.220 --> 02:10:57.500
<v Speaker 3>You know my side,</v>

4585
02:10:57.501 --> 02:10:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I hear like it's carrots in this,</v>

4586
02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:00.380
<v Speaker 3>but you don't hear about,</v>

4587
02:11:00.381 --> 02:11:00.621
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4588
02:11:00.621 --> 02:11:01.610
<v Speaker 3>it's more about the animals.</v>

4589
02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.750
<v Speaker 4>You know what it really is?</v>

4590
02:11:02.751 --> 02:11:03.584
<v Speaker 4>There's two things.</v>

4591
02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:04.040
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4592
02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:06.290
<v Speaker 4>it really is all about the animals for a lot of them,</v>

4593
02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:11.450
<v Speaker 4>and they're really right that it's better than the standard American diet that</v>

4594
02:11:11.470 --> 02:11:12.141
<v Speaker 4>he eaten.</v>

4595
02:11:12.141 --> 02:11:15.350
<v Speaker 4>Vegan food and healthy vegetable food all the time.</v>

4596
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:18.290
<v Speaker 4>As long as you do it correctly is way better than a standard American diet.</v>

4597
02:11:18.850 --> 02:11:20.900
<v Speaker 4>That's also like fish is good for you.</v>

4598
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:22.790
<v Speaker 4>She says it's good for you.</v>

4599
02:11:22.860 --> 02:11:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Peace Salmon piece of salmon is good for you.</v>

4600
02:11:25.190 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 4>Wild Salmon,</v>

4601
02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:27.400
<v Speaker 4>that shit's really good for you.</v>

4602
02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:28.340
<v Speaker 4>Good for you.</v>

4603
02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:29.240
<v Speaker 4>It is good for you.</v>

4604
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:31.640
<v Speaker 4>This idea that it's not good for you is kind of crazy,</v>

4605
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:33.380
<v Speaker 4>like meat is good for you.</v>

4606
02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:35.720
<v Speaker 4>The real problem is sugar and bullshit.</v>

4607
02:11:35.810 --> 02:11:38.630
<v Speaker 4>And when you guys got that sorted out with the Vegan Diet and some people have</v>

4608
02:11:38.631 --> 02:11:39.800
<v Speaker 4>it sorted out with another diet,</v>

4609
02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:41.630
<v Speaker 4>the whole idea is to keep the poison out.</v>

4610
02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:42.560
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is.</v>

4611
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:44.210
<v Speaker 4>They just get overzealous.</v>

4612
02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:47.960
<v Speaker 4>And then when people have an idea of something that they're doing that they</v>

4613
02:11:47.961 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 4>think everybody should do,</v>

4614
02:11:49.011 --> 02:11:50.690
<v Speaker 4>then they start telling everybody they should do it.</v>

4615
02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:51.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4616
02:11:51.221 --> 02:11:52.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't want people to tell him.</v>

4617
02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:53.860
<v Speaker 3>Then I listen dude.</v>

4618
02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:54.830
<v Speaker 3>When I was a little kid,</v>

4619
02:11:54.831 --> 02:11:55.700
<v Speaker 3>it's like what the fuck?</v>

4620
02:11:55.701 --> 02:11:56.534
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

4621
02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:00.630
<v Speaker 3>the straws and the turtle shit straws.</v>

4622
02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:01.380
<v Speaker 3>A turtle.</v>

4623
02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:01.741
<v Speaker 3>The two.</v>

4624
02:12:01.741 --> 02:12:02.574
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

4625
02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:03.311
<v Speaker 3>the whole shit.</v>

4626
02:12:03.311 --> 02:12:04.690
<v Speaker 3>That's toxic straws.</v>

4627
02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:05.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4628
02:12:05.021 --> 02:12:10.021
<v Speaker 3>It was like one motherfucker turtle and understand it reached out,</v>

4629
02:12:10.991 --> 02:12:13.930
<v Speaker 3>but now you can't fuck with plastic straws.</v>

4630
02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:14.411
<v Speaker 3>He had,</v>

4631
02:12:14.411 --> 02:12:15.101
<v Speaker 3>there was someone,</v>

4632
02:12:15.101 --> 02:12:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I retweeted their posts.</v>

4633
02:12:16.331 --> 02:12:17.980
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could remember who the fuck's at it,</v>

4634
02:12:17.981 --> 02:12:18.490
<v Speaker 3>but they were,</v>

4635
02:12:18.490 --> 02:12:21.760
<v Speaker 3>they were laughing about how you can't buy straws,</v>

4636
02:12:21.761 --> 02:12:23.830
<v Speaker 3>but at Starbucks they still have those plastic lids.</v>

4637
02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:24.740
<v Speaker 3>I quit.</v>

4638
02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:25.110

4641
02:12:27.271 --> 02:12:28.081
<v Speaker 3>You gotta ask for it.</v>

4642
02:12:28.081 --> 02:12:28.870
<v Speaker 3>I want us.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

4655
02:12:53.921 --> 02:12:54.754
<v Speaker 3>really dope.</v>

4656

<v Speaker 3>The canvas people doing natural cannabis,</v>

4657
02:12:57.010 --> 02:12:57.843
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

4658
02:12:57.940 --> 02:12:58.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4659
02:12:58.311 --> 02:13:00.130
<v Speaker 3>and now business people always hand on us.</v>

4660
02:13:00.230 --> 02:13:00.820

02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:07.060
<v Speaker 3>it was like just little nugs of each strand.</v>

4762
02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:06.730
<v Speaker 2>But you can't underestimate weed in some places.</v>

4763
02:16:06.731 --> 02:16:08.650
<v Speaker 2>One Time Ari and Joey Diaz and I,</v>

4764
02:16:08.651 --> 02:16:09.610
<v Speaker 2>we got cocky.</v>

4765
02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.790
<v Speaker 2>We were doing a show in Philly and they gave us some weed,</v>

4766
02:16:12.791 --> 02:16:14.620
<v Speaker 2>but like it's Philly weed man.</v>

4767
02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:18.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst when you name it after the city is filling,</v>

4768
02:16:18.890 --> 02:16:20.530
<v Speaker 2>we thought it was going to be like,</v>

4769
02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:23.800
<v Speaker 2>like low grade weed because it's in Philadelphia.</v>

4770
02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:29.220
<v Speaker 2>But the guy got ahold of some oh Gee Kush strains from like 2001 and brought it</v>

4771
02:16:31.211 --> 02:16:32.950
<v Speaker 2>back to Philly and we were crippled.</v>

4772
02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:36.910
<v Speaker 2>We wish you guys had to be the type of company that you knew you would have to</v>

4773
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:38.250
<v Speaker 2>find the best shit yet.</v>

4774
02:16:38.251 --> 02:16:39.970
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't know it was going to be that good.</v>

4775
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4776
02:16:40.210 --> 02:16:40.361
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4777
02:16:40.361 --> 02:16:41.440
<v Speaker 2>if I knew it was California,</v>

4778
02:16:41.441 --> 02:16:42.730
<v Speaker 2>we'd I would have backed off.</v>

4779
02:16:42.810 --> 02:16:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4780
02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:44.021
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing.</v>

4781
02:16:44.021 --> 02:16:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Was just say Nay California.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

4790
02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:58.750
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be like Philly.</v>

4791

02:18:45.670 --> 02:18:46.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a USB port.</v>

4868
02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Screws into the bottom of the base of the battery.</v>

4869
02:18:49.130 --> 02:18:49.361
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

4884
02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Once you got a disposable battery.</v>

4885
02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:06.213
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4886

<v Speaker 2>That's the issue.</v>

4925
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:03.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what the problem was.</v>

4926
02:20:03.201 --> 02:20:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Somebody in Boston told me that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4928
02:20:04.881 --> 02:20:05.930

02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:11.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't do it.</v>

4933
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.301
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4934
02:20:11.301 --> 02:20:12.111
<v Speaker 2>it's still stupid.</v>

4935
02:20:12.111 --> 02:20:13.490
<v Speaker 2>And like a bunch of states.</v>

4936
02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:14.750
<v Speaker 2>It's only legal in what,</v>

4937
02:20:14.751 --> 02:20:15.950
<v Speaker 2>nine states now?</v>

4938
02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it's legal in nine states.</v>

4939
02:20:18.471 --> 02:20:21.500
<v Speaker 2>And maybe a few more magnetically.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How many all tolls or for legality?</v>

4941

<v Speaker 2>Recreational.</v>

4942
02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's still only four.</v>

4943
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.701
<v Speaker 2>So what is that?</v>

4944
02:20:28.701 --> 02:20:29.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's Nevada too.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What's that smell that you gotta be careful of?</v>

5065
02:23:11.310 --> 02:23:11.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is it a put you the oil?</v>

5068
02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:19.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like a type of oil that like people were wearing,</v>

5069
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:22.370
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of hipsters were wearing Ryan,</v>

5070
02:23:22.410 --> 02:23:22.711
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

5071
02:23:22.711 --> 02:23:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Is it a hipster thing or a hippie?</v>

5072
02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:24.811
<v Speaker 2>More hippie,</v>

5073
02:23:24.811 --> 02:23:25.111
<v Speaker 2>Hippie,</v>

5074
02:23:25.111 --> 02:23:25.500
<v Speaker 2>hippie.</v>

5075
02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:26.670
<v Speaker 2>But what it's supposed to do,</v>

5076
02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:29.940
<v Speaker 2>just a sticky oil people put on it's petroleum oil.</v>

5077
02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Up here in here,</v>

5078
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:32.280
<v Speaker 2>I have some lotion.</v>

5079
02:23:32.310 --> 02:23:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a witness like organic,</v>

5080
02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:37.620
<v Speaker 2>which some magical elements.</v>

5081
02:23:37.650 --> 02:23:39.300
<v Speaker 2>There's pretty good magical elements.</v>

5082
02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5083
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5084
02:23:40.050 --> 02:23:43.050
<v Speaker 2>So what does John Mayer trying to do with this aroma therapy wand?</v>

5085
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:44.330
<v Speaker 2>He's waving around everyone.</v>

5086
02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:47.100
<v Speaker 2>She just wants sinuses to be open,</v>

5087
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.943
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5088
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I think he cares about people breathing.</v>

5089
02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:51.180
<v Speaker 2>That's considerate,</v>

5090
02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:52.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5091
02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:53.010
<v Speaker 2>But he was,</v>

5092
02:23:53.010 --> 02:23:53.551
<v Speaker 2>when he has,</v>

5093
02:23:53.551 --> 02:23:55.680
<v Speaker 2>and he's like a different person.</v>

5094
02:23:57.390 --> 02:23:57.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5095
02:23:57.751 --> 02:23:58.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like he like,</v>

5096
02:23:58.710 --> 02:24:02.460
<v Speaker 2>like it's powerful and he brings it around people that have been drinking.</v>

5097
02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:06.530
<v Speaker 2>So now you've got to mix the smell of fucking rum and his got damn lavender</v>

5098
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:09.000
<v Speaker 2>machine and he only has one machine.</v>

5099
02:24:09.001 --> 02:24:10.470
<v Speaker 2>So once he gets you addicted to it,</v>

5100
02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:12.900
<v Speaker 2>you got to chase him.</v>

5101
02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:15.270
<v Speaker 2>And he's a little too handsome.</v>

5102
02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:18.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't even care about that part.</v>

5103
02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want him to have me chasing him for smells because the last two</v>

5104
02:24:23.131 --> 02:24:23.911
<v Speaker 2>times I've seen him,</v>

5105
02:24:23.911 --> 02:24:24.271
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5106
02:24:24.271 --> 02:24:25.104
<v Speaker 2>John Man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>vapor thing?</v>

5109
02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:28.561

02:24:28.561 --> 02:24:29.101
<v Speaker 2>you like that,</v>

5111
02:24:29.101 --> 02:24:29.760
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

5112
02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Like he's got like a pimp.</v>

5113
02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:32.610
<v Speaker 2>He wants to hold it back from you.</v>

5114
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm a find out who makes it?</v>

<v Speaker 4>like right now we have a real professional setup.</v>

5282
02:28:39.861 --> 02:28:40.521
<v Speaker 4>We have a desk,</v>

5283
02:28:40.521 --> 02:28:41.301
<v Speaker 4>we have microphones.</v>

5284
02:28:41.301 --> 02:28:43.250
<v Speaker 4>Jamie's a real audio engineer.</v>

5285
02:28:43.251 --> 02:28:44.570
<v Speaker 4>He knows exactly what he's doing.</v>

5286
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Everything sounds amazing,</v>

5287
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:49.850
<v Speaker 4>but as long as you put the effort to give people a good solid product,</v>

5288
02:28:49.851 --> 02:28:52.190
<v Speaker 4>occasionally you can have one where you just talking on a phone,</v>

5289
02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:54.080
<v Speaker 4>they won't be upset.</v>

5290
02:28:54.110 --> 02:28:55.480
<v Speaker 4>It'll acts to be kind of cool.</v>

5291
02:28:55.650 --> 02:28:57.590
<v Speaker 4>Like people will know all these guys are on a plane.</v>

5292
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:58.381
<v Speaker 4>You can hear the,</v>

5293
02:28:58.381 --> 02:28:58.591
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5294
02:28:58.591 --> 02:28:59.990
<v Speaker 4>the stewardess comes over with,</v>

5295
02:29:00.700 --> 02:29:01.760
<v Speaker 4>that's not normal.</v>

5296
02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:03.533
<v Speaker 4>It's not normal.</v>

5297
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:04.310
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

5298
02:29:04.310 --> 02:29:05.870
<v Speaker 4>but you could totally do that too.</v>

5299
02:29:05.871 --> 02:29:08.750
<v Speaker 4>The thing is like if you just started doing that,</v>

5300
02:29:08.751 --> 02:29:11.690
<v Speaker 4>people would love it and then let it to sort of figure its own,</v>

5301
02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:12.470
<v Speaker 4>you know as,</v>

5302
02:29:12.470 --> 02:29:14.540
<v Speaker 4>as it gets bigger figure it's own path,</v>

5303
02:29:14.541 --> 02:29:15.290
<v Speaker 4>but you don't,</v>

5304
02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:17.150
<v Speaker 4>you don't need a big investment to start.</v>

5305
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:19.220
<v Speaker 4>You just need one of them little zoom recorders.</v>

5306
02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:20.120
<v Speaker 4>I got a zone.</v>

5307
02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:20.510
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

5308
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:21.343
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

5309
02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Microphone to my grandma.</v>

5310
02:29:22.810 --> 02:29:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Got My,</v>

5311
02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:24.290
<v Speaker 4>I need to just do it bro.</v>

5312
02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:24.771
<v Speaker 4>Just do it.</v>

5313
02:29:24.771 --> 02:29:25.604
<v Speaker 4>That's got to do it.</v>

5314
02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:26.210
<v Speaker 4>And you could,</v>

5315
02:29:26.210 --> 02:29:27.530
<v Speaker 4>you could do this.</v>

5316
02:29:27.531 --> 02:29:28.364
<v Speaker 4>The thing,</v>

5317
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:30.200
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing with me,</v>

5318
02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:32.420
<v Speaker 4>why I was probably somewhat hesitant.</v>

5319
02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:33.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm like man,</v>

02:29:36.290 --> 02:29:36.891
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

5324
02:29:36.891 --> 02:29:40.910

<v Speaker 4>And it feels better.</v>

5365
02:30:38.330 --> 02:30:40.490
<v Speaker 4>It feels better when everybody's doing great,</v>

5366
02:30:41.810 --> 02:30:42.111
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5367
02:30:42.111 --> 02:30:42.561
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>

5368
02:30:42.561 --> 02:30:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm with you 100% on that.</v>

5369
02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:45.280
<v Speaker 4>And that's like I,</v>

5370
02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:46.450
<v Speaker 4>which 100% on it?</v>

5371
02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:48.033
<v Speaker 4>It is not.</v>

5372
02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:49.160
<v Speaker 4>It's really simple.</v>

5373
02:30:49.350 --> 02:30:49.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5374
02:30:49.641 --> 02:30:50.474
<v Speaker 4>it's really simple.</v>

5375
02:30:50.810 --> 02:30:51.111
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5376
02:30:51.111 --> 02:30:51.640
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5377
02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:54.620
<v Speaker 4>it's hard when you're struggling because when you're struggling and you feel</v>

5378
02:30:54.621 --> 02:30:55.830
<v Speaker 4>isolated and you feel alone,</v>

5379
02:30:55.850 --> 02:30:57.350
<v Speaker 4>you feel like it's you versus everybody else.</v>

5380
02:30:57.680 --> 02:30:58.700
<v Speaker 4>But it's really not.</v>

5381
02:30:58.701 --> 02:31:01.310
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things about comedians is we've,</v>

5382
02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:03.290
<v Speaker 4>we've had this conversation many times.</v>

5383
02:31:03.291 --> 02:31:04.790
<v Speaker 4>We were trying to figure out what the number is.</v>

5384
02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:05.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the number is,</v>

5385
02:31:05.841 --> 02:31:08.930
<v Speaker 4>but it might be less than a thousand on the whole planet,</v>

5386
02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:10.280
<v Speaker 4>on the whole planet earth,</v>

5387
02:31:10.281 --> 02:31:13.670
<v Speaker 4>a 7 billion people that might be a thousand legit Comedians,</v>

5388
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:17.840
<v Speaker 4>and I'm probably being a real generous when I say that I went through 100% if I</v>

5389
02:31:17.841 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 4>run into a dude like you or</v>

5390
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:20.491
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

5391
02:31:20.491 --> 02:31:20.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5392
02:31:20.821 --> 02:31:23.250
<v Speaker 2>any other real legit comedian does a,</v>

5393
02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:25.080
<v Speaker 2>that is a rare human being.</v>

5394
02:31:25.081 --> 02:31:26.340
<v Speaker 2>There's not a whole lot of us.</v>

5395
02:31:26.730 --> 02:31:27.960
<v Speaker 2>If we don't stick together,</v>

5396
02:31:27.961 --> 02:31:30.660
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck will whose farms going off?</v>

5397
02:31:31.370 --> 02:31:32.203
<v Speaker 2>Did you go to sleep?</v>

5398
02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:34.260
<v Speaker 2>The only guy wearing a dream?</v>

5399
02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:36.233
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if we just,</v>

5400
02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:38.610
<v Speaker 2>that alarm went off and I woke up to pee and I was like,</v>

5401
02:31:38.611 --> 02:31:39.031
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

5402
02:31:39.031 --> 02:31:39.864
<v Speaker 2>I was dreaming.</v>

5403
02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it as the epic podcast.</v>

5404
02:31:45.750 --> 02:31:45.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5405
02:31:45.991 --> 02:31:46.320
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5406
02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:46.801
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

5407
02:31:46.801 --> 02:31:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that.</v>

5408
02:31:48.530 --> 02:31:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe that.</v>

5409
02:31:49.681 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

5410
02:31:49.950 --> 02:31:51.480
<v Speaker 2>but I believe that about all that shit.</v>

5411
02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:52.440
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

5412
02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:53.550
<v Speaker 2>it's good for everybody.</v>

5413
02:31:53.610 --> 02:31:54.550
<v Speaker 2>It's good for all of them.</v>

5414
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.863
<v Speaker 2>As I was saying,</v>

5415
02:31:56.370 --> 02:31:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I was making a point that if funding but making a point and I was like black</v>

5416
02:31:59.851 --> 02:32:01.110
<v Speaker 2>folk that are listening right now,</v>

5417
02:32:01.111 --> 02:32:04.860
<v Speaker 2>listen to this strategy and listened to what he just said.</v>

5418
02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Listen to what he just said.</v>

5419
02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:06.780
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5420
02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:10.530
<v Speaker 2>it has nothing to do with anything other than community.</v>

5421
02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:14.610
<v Speaker 2>All the other shit that's in your head in terms of competitiveness is in your</v>

5422
02:32:14.611 --> 02:32:15.330
<v Speaker 2>own head.</v>

5423
02:32:15.330 --> 02:32:16.830
<v Speaker 2>When you have that stage,</v>

5424
02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:18.300
<v Speaker 2>that's your stage.</v>

5425
02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:20.430
<v Speaker 2>You're there for 15 minutes or 20 minutes,</v>

5426
02:32:20.431 --> 02:32:21.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever you said is that's yours.</v>

5427
02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:24.240
<v Speaker 2>What everybody else does should be fuel.</v>

5428
02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:26.400
<v Speaker 2>It should inspire you and you should.</v>

5429
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:30.060
<v Speaker 2>We should support each other because there's not so many of us telling you bro,</v>

5430
02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:35.420
<v Speaker 2>and that's the I'm with you 100% but that is the one of the troubling factors</v>

5431
02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:41.130
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of communities like to support goes away.</v>

5432
02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:41.700
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

5433
02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I made motherfuckers talk,</v>

5434
02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:44.033
<v Speaker 2>they talk,</v>

5435
02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:45.120
<v Speaker 2>everybody talk,</v>

5436
02:32:45.210 --> 02:32:47.160
<v Speaker 2>but you know why I really believe this.</v>

5437
02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Why is it support goes away,</v>

5438
02:32:48.301 --> 02:32:49.560
<v Speaker 2>famine mentality,</v>

5439
02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:50.161
<v Speaker 2>feminine.</v>

5440
02:32:50.161 --> 02:32:52.980
<v Speaker 2>What do they fit it feel like there's not enough for everybody.</v>

5441
02:32:53.220 --> 02:32:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had this feeling for the longest time with is not enough for</v>

5442
02:32:55.801 --> 02:32:56.250
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

5443
02:32:56.250 --> 02:32:58.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a crazy way to think of things.</v>

5444
02:32:58.021 --> 02:32:59.280
<v Speaker 2>There's more than enough for everybody.</v>

5445
02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:01.500
<v Speaker 2>There's 300 million people.</v>

5446
02:33:01.501 --> 02:33:04.020
<v Speaker 2>How many fucking people do you need in your audience?</v>

5447
02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>

5448
02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:05.940
<v Speaker 2>he should realize if you,</v>

5449
02:33:05.941 --> 02:33:07.560
<v Speaker 2>if you really enjoyed doing standup,</v>

5450
02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:09.480
<v Speaker 2>you'd want these people to become fans of stand up.</v>

5451
02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:11.550
<v Speaker 2>So you'd want to tell him about all these other comedians.</v>

5452
02:33:11.700 --> 02:33:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Tell him about Joey Diaz Talin Bout,</v>

5453
02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:14.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5454
02:33:14.161 --> 02:33:14.971
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank,</v>

5455
02:33:14.971 --> 02:33:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Tony Hinchcliffe,</v>

5456
02:33:15.811 --> 02:33:17.680
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is that you think is Hilaire tell them,</v>

5457
02:33:17.730 --> 02:33:18.430
<v Speaker 2>tell them.</v>

5458
02:33:18.430 --> 02:33:19.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot out there to see Matt.</v>

5459
02:33:20.330 --> 02:33:21.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a separate time.</v>

5460
02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:21.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

5461
02:33:21.871 --> 02:33:22.651
<v Speaker 2>certain communities,</v>

5462
02:33:22.651 --> 02:33:23.760
<v Speaker 2>they just don't want to,</v>

5463
02:33:24.450 --> 02:33:26.630
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to tell motherfuckers be just on this,</v>

5464
02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:29.130
<v Speaker 2>on himself and themselves so much.</v>

5465
02:33:29.570 --> 02:33:31.440
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to help.</v>

5466
02:33:31.470 --> 02:33:32.880
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to reach out to.</v>

5467
02:33:32.881 --> 02:33:33.361
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

5468
02:33:33.361 --> 02:33:33.901
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

5469
02:33:33.901 --> 02:33:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Like the conversation you're having with me right now,</v>

5470
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:38.910
<v Speaker 2>it's simple for you because you know,</v>

5471
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:41.610
<v Speaker 2>those are the type of friends and those type of people you deal with.</v>

5472
02:33:41.690 --> 02:33:42.523
<v Speaker 2>But some people,</v>

5473
02:33:42.570 --> 02:33:43.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

5474
02:33:43.170 --> 02:33:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I do know what you mean.</v>

5475
02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Other fuck that shit.</v>

5476
02:33:45.991 --> 02:33:46.201
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5477
02:33:46.201 --> 02:33:46.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5478
02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I look at it like people I hang with Chappelle and these other guys like we are</v>

5479
02:33:52.050 --> 02:33:52.231
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5480
02:33:52.231 --> 02:33:52.771
<v Speaker 2>I'm went brown,</v>

5481
02:33:52.771 --> 02:33:54.930
<v Speaker 2>some powerful motherfuckers,</v>

5482
02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.760
<v Speaker 2>but we're friends first and foremost.</v>

5483
02:33:56.761 --> 02:33:58.560
<v Speaker 2>But everybody don't think like that.</v>

5484
02:33:58.820 --> 02:33:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5485
02:33:59.160 --> 02:33:59.993
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough one.</v>

5486
02:34:00.180 --> 02:34:01.230
<v Speaker 2>It is a tough one,</v>

5487
02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:05.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a matter of a shift in the way you view things.</v>

5488
02:34:05.431 --> 02:34:06.241
<v Speaker 2>Just look at it.</v>

5489
02:34:06.241 --> 02:34:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Just try it.</v>

5490
02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:07.081
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

5491
02:34:07.081 --> 02:34:08.460
<v Speaker 2>don't let go of your beliefs.</v>

5492
02:34:08.461 --> 02:34:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Just try to look at it in another way.</v>

5493
02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Try to look at it another way.</v>

5494
02:34:11.941 --> 02:34:12.141
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5495
02:34:12.141 --> 02:34:12.630
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

5496
02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:13.620
<v Speaker 2>you're way better off.</v>

5497
02:34:13.621 --> 02:34:14.550
<v Speaker 2>If you're a team,</v>

5498
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.040
<v Speaker 2>you're way better off of this comradery.</v>

5499
02:34:17.050 --> 02:34:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Like when you do a show,</v>

5500
02:34:18.090 --> 02:34:20.260
<v Speaker 2>so we do a show with someone who is a murderer,</v>

5501
02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:21.273
<v Speaker 2>a murderer,</v>

5502
02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:22.510
<v Speaker 2>and they go on in front of you.</v>

5503
02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You're way better off.</v>

5504
02:34:23.561 --> 02:34:24.460
<v Speaker 2>If you're laughing,</v>

5505
02:34:24.730 --> 02:34:24.910
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

5506
02:34:24.910 --> 02:34:25.900
<v Speaker 2>you're go on that stage.</v>

5507
02:34:25.901 --> 02:34:27.340
<v Speaker 2>You're way better off if you're loose.</v>

5508
02:34:27.341 --> 02:34:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Like you just had a good time laugh.</v>

5509
02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:29.651
<v Speaker 2>But if you're tense,</v>

5510
02:34:29.651 --> 02:34:30.550
<v Speaker 2>like I told you I bombed.</v>

5511
02:34:30.551 --> 02:34:31.384
<v Speaker 2>But Jim Brewer,</v>

5512
02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I was backstage freaking out.</v>

5513
02:34:32.951 --> 02:34:33.221
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5514
02:34:33.221 --> 02:34:33.731
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

5515
02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:34.564
<v Speaker 2>I got to file this.</v>

5516
02:34:34.660 --> 02:34:37.640
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck am I going to find when I was way younger but I was going to,</v>

5517
02:34:37.641 --> 02:34:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at eat shit.</v>

5518
02:34:38.921 --> 02:34:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I knew I probably wasn't and it was a problem.</v>

5519
02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:45.610
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get away from whatever your first experiences is going to be.</v>

5520
02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:48.070
<v Speaker 2>You got to say it's probably your first experience.</v>

5521
02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:49.270
<v Speaker 2>It happened like that.</v>

5522
02:34:49.300 --> 02:34:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Like a real bombs.</v>

5523
02:34:50.201 --> 02:34:51.034
<v Speaker 2>I go like,</v>

5524
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:53.020
<v Speaker 2>oh I could do shit about it.</v>

5525
02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:53.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5526
02:34:53.261 --> 02:34:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I was supposed to do 45 minutes.</v>

5527
02:34:54.641 --> 02:34:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I got offstage at 35 but you went back in the gym.</v>

5528
02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:57.671
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

5529
02:34:57.671 --> 02:34:58.504
<v Speaker 2>I had to.</v>

5530
02:34:58.690 --> 02:34:58.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5531
02:34:58.841 --> 02:34:59.230
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

5532
02:34:59.230 --> 02:35:02.380
<v Speaker 2>the thing is like Jim and I've always been friends and I've been friends with a</v>

5533
02:35:02.381 --> 02:35:04.480
<v Speaker 2>lot of people that made me eat shit going on after him.</v>

5534
02:35:04.690 --> 02:35:05.970
<v Speaker 2>It didn't matter that the,</v>

5535
02:35:05.971 --> 02:35:06.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5536
02:35:06.130 --> 02:35:08.080
<v Speaker 2>the thing about it is that like an,</v>

5537
02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

5538
02:35:08.610 --> 02:35:09.760
<v Speaker 2>even after all these years,</v>

5539
02:35:09.761 --> 02:35:11.380
<v Speaker 2>I feel genuinely,</v>

5540
02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:17.080
<v Speaker 2>genuinely honored to be a part of this group of people cause we do something</v>

5541
02:35:17.471 --> 02:35:19.060
<v Speaker 2>that is my favorite thing to watch.</v>

5542
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:21.010
<v Speaker 2>That's a group of people,</v>

5543
02:35:21.250 --> 02:35:22.210
<v Speaker 2>but like you say,</v>

5544
02:35:22.290 --> 02:35:26.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like a limited circle of light as no other way to say it,</v>

5545
02:35:26.141 --> 02:35:27.240
<v Speaker 2>but real motherfuckers,</v>

5546
02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:28.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a small circle.</v>

5547
02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:29.200
<v Speaker 2>This some.</v>

5548

5572
02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:08.050
<v Speaker 2>It's too confusing right now because it's too dangerous to have any</v>

5573
02:36:08.051 --> 02:36:09.250
<v Speaker 2>controversial ideas.</v>

5596
02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:43.600
<v Speaker 2>But he hasn't already done it himself.</v>

5597
02:36:43.930 --> 02:36:44.750
<v Speaker 2>The guy was on here,</v>

5598
02:36:44.750 --> 02:36:45.421
<v Speaker 2>NBC good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ah Right.</v>

5604
02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:56.793
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

5605
02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:58.110
<v Speaker 2>If he would've got me today,</v>

5606
02:36:58.210 --> 02:37:00.550
<v Speaker 2>he had been the headlights and he would have failed to show somewhere.</v>

5607
02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that collectively.</v>

5608
02:37:02.651 --> 02:37:05.680
<v Speaker 2>There was a period of time where Hollywood lost her fucking mind and they were</v>

5609
02:37:05.681 --> 02:37:08.920
<v Speaker 2>giving out these deals where if you got a certain amount of episodes,</v>

5610
02:37:08.921 --> 02:37:12.430
<v Speaker 2>they signed you up for a hundred episodes and that's what happened with anger</v>

5611
02:37:12.431 --> 02:37:13.120
<v Speaker 2>management.</v>

5612
02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Sheen show Charlie Sheen more money off</v>

5613
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:17.900
<v Speaker 4>that show that he did it even off three and a half men.</v>

5614
02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:19.040
<v Speaker 4>But people don't know that.</v>

5615
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:20.511
<v Speaker 4>People don't know that.</v>

5616
02:37:20.511 --> 02:37:21.740
<v Speaker 4>He knows that he's only one.</v>

5617
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:22.311
<v Speaker 4>Denise.</v>

5618
02:37:22.311 --> 02:37:22.580
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

5619
02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:22.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5620
02:37:22.851 --> 02:37:23.201
<v Speaker 4>he's young.</v>

5621
02:37:23.201 --> 02:37:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Little bit.</v>

5622
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:24.470
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy story.</v>

5623
02:37:24.471 --> 02:37:26.270
<v Speaker 4>They used to sign shows,</v>

5624
02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:29.390
<v Speaker 4>TV's $200 million Charlie Sheen experiment.</v>

5625
02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:33.740
<v Speaker 4>They used to sign these shows and they would sign these shows in the</v>

5626
02:37:33.741 --> 02:37:36.440
<v Speaker 4>anticipation of the dual goal of success.</v>

5627
02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5628
02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:38.120
<v Speaker 4>So they did that with him.</v>

5629
02:37:38.121 --> 02:37:39.370
<v Speaker 4>They did it with George Lopez.</v>

5630
02:37:39.390 --> 02:37:40.670
<v Speaker 4>He would cut money from shows.</v>

5631
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:42.650
<v Speaker 4>They give you a certain percentage,</v>

5632
02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:42.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5633
02:37:42.981 --> 02:37:43.560
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

5634
02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:44.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how it's structured,</v>

5635
02:37:44.901 --> 02:37:48.440
<v Speaker 4>but apparently the point is that they sign up for a giant number of shows,</v>

5636
02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:53.560
<v Speaker 4>not 13 not 22 they sign you up for a giant number of shows and by doing that</v>

5637
02:37:54.621 --> 02:37:55.700
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another,</v>

5638
02:37:55.701 --> 02:37:56.021
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

5639
02:37:56.021 --> 02:37:56.420
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

5640
02:37:56.420 --> 02:37:56.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5641
02:37:56.990 --> 02:38:00.980
<v Speaker 4>right after Charlie Sheen had his whole scandal leaving two and a half men,</v>

5642
02:38:00.981 --> 02:38:02.350
<v Speaker 4>he went on to have a wake,</v>

5643
02:38:02.351 --> 02:38:04.220
<v Speaker 4>make way more money than ever before.</v>

5644
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:05.600
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

5645
02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:06.030
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

5646
02:38:06.030 --> 02:38:07.400
<v Speaker 4>he's got a crazy career man.</v>

5647
02:38:07.730 --> 02:38:08.900
<v Speaker 4>Legit movie star.</v>

5648
02:38:08.910 --> 02:38:12.470
<v Speaker 4>Gigantic TV star also talks about smoking,</v>

5649
02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:14.240
<v Speaker 4>smoking a lot of crack.</v>

02:38:38.660 --> 02:38:41.330
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain darkness to giving it to that glass Dick.</v>

5668
02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Once you start going down that road,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5672
02:38:46.730 --> 02:38:48.290
<v Speaker 4>there's no critical thinking involved there.</v>

5673
02:38:48.291 --> 02:38:49.640
<v Speaker 4>That's debauchery.</v>

02:39:38.690 --> 02:39:40.550
<v Speaker 4>He never wanted to be alone with his thoughts.</v>

5711
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:43.190
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough one for a lot of people.</v>

5712
02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:46.550
<v Speaker 4>It was a real one for him because he was brilliant.</v>

5713
02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:47.600
<v Speaker 4>He's a brilliant guy,</v>

02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:50.150
<v Speaker 4>but he was also homeless half the time.</v>

02:39:54.890 --> 02:39:55.970
<v Speaker 4>he could help him.</v>

5722
02:39:56.250 --> 02:39:57.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5723
02:39:57.440 --> 02:39:58.550
<v Speaker 4>he was too stubborn.</v>

5724
02:39:58.580 --> 02:39:59.301
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't listen.</v>

5725
02:39:59.301 --> 02:39:59.750
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

5726
02:39:59.750 --> 02:40:03.440
<v Speaker 4>he would just vanished and disappear in two drugs for a few days and then come</v>

5727
02:40:03.441 --> 02:40:05.720
<v Speaker 4>back and he could do math in his head.</v>

5728
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:06.620
<v Speaker 4>Like you could say to him,</v>

5729
02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:11.630
<v Speaker 4>99 times 54 times six minus five divided by three and even when he was sold,</v>

02:40:11.670 --> 02:40:11.900
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5731
02:40:11.900 --> 02:40:12.860
<v Speaker 4>and he would just bang it out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We just tell you what it is.</v>

5743
02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:26.190
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't manage his own brain to the point where we could stay away from hard</v>

5744
02:40:26.191 --> 02:40:28.770
<v Speaker 2>drugs and eventually died of an overdose.</v>

5745
02:40:30.170 --> 02:40:31.300
<v Speaker 2>That's usually,</v>
