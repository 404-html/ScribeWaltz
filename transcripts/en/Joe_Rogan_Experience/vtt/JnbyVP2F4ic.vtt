00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I've fouling when I go to pitch ain't,</v>

4
00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to pitch and idea about a new show or something.</v>

5
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And they're all,</v>

7
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.330
<v Speaker 1>and like this one guys is like,</v>

8
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.231
<v Speaker 1>that's a horrible idea.</v>

9
00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever tell anyone that idea again.</v>

10
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 1>That's always the best idea I've found.</v>

11
00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Like if an executive session sucks,</v>

12
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.600
<v Speaker 1>goats go digital and do it because it'll fucking kid.</v>

13
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Once I pitched over the phone and the guy actually like said,</v>

15
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>you're kidding,</v>

16
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.561
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

18
00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you waste my time with this?</v>

19
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.631
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

20
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:26.464
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

21
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

22
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I guess she didn't like my idea.</v>

23
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I pitched over the phone,</v>

24
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

25
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.311
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

26
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea for a show.</v>

27
00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just a silly idea,</v>

28
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

29
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a comedy and it's about these girls that work at a bikini pizza place in</v>

30
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:45.811
<v Speaker 1>the day called pizza sluts and at night they fight crime and they're,</v>

31
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.071
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

32
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>they're super hot chicks that are recruited by the police force and,</v>

33
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>and trained to infiltrate into areas where other cops could never get checked.</v>

34
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause people would never believe that these hot girls were actually secret agent</v>

35
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 1>slats were actually secret agents.</v>

36
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Why did they have to work at the pizza place and then a full time job though?</v>

38
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Well because they got to have a cover part of the cover and then get to see them</v>

39
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>in their underwear is the smart county and fucking dude was mad at me.</v>

40
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.121
<v Speaker 1>This is chuck.</v>

41
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>He pitched it.</v>

42
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>The dude was mad as a long time ago by the way.</v>

43
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>And the dude was mad at me.</v>

44
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

45
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be a silly show.</v>

46
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't think they could be like a ton of jokes and you get 2 million</v>

47
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:25.224
<v Speaker 1>viewers</v>

48
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>completely over the top.</v>

49
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever pitched something just to fuck with somebody?</v>

50
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.743
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

51
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Have you waste time?</v>

52
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>If you do sometimes,</v>

53
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

54
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.480
<v Speaker 1>This is not at first this was,</v>

56
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:40.751

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.151
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

60
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:43.720
<v Speaker 1>And I make my,</v>

61
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.100
<v Speaker 1>my real money is made on speeches.</v>

62
00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I go to do motivational speeches at colleges,</v>

63
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>teaching kids to get their shit together and stop being busy.</v>

64
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.000
<v Speaker 1>It's up to stop being a whiny little bitch,</v>

65
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.631
<v Speaker 1>right speech.</v>

66
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just this entitlement by college.</v>

67
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Kids in college is really like me coming and I do about an hour speech and then</v>

68
00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>a half hour Q and a and then I'll do a live podcast.</v>

69
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

70
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean for me that's amazing money.</v>

71
00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.700
<v Speaker 1>It changes our family's life.</v>

72
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

73
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.920
<v Speaker 1>So now it's like if I can do TV,</v>

74
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:06.251
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

75
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.690
<v Speaker 1>If I don't that's fine too.</v>

76
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.553
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to do it.</v>

77
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>But like I'll have an idea.</v>

78
00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had an idea of hoarder road trip.</v>

79
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to take a bunch of hoarders and I went to Vega.</v>

80
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Take them cross country.</v>

81
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 1>You make him clean up someone else's house.</v>

82
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's a good idea.</v>

83
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be fascinating to see.</v>

84
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I like that cross country.</v>

85
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

86
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>At first it was a joke,</v>

87
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>but then the more I started pitching and I was like,</v>

88
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>actually I like to actually take this.</v>

89
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>But the first time I was just trying to piss off the executive cause he had sat</v>

90
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>on my pilot for a year and so I was just mad at him.</v>

91
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.610
<v Speaker 1>He sat on the pilot.</v>

92
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.061
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

93
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I've done two pilots and I didn't realize this is everyone's done 10 pilots.</v>

94
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>

95
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

96
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I was devastated because my first pilot didn't make show.</v>

97
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

98
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:42.621
<v Speaker 1>I was devastated.</v>

100
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:43.071
<v Speaker 1>Devastated.</v>

101
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:43.371
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

102
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.204
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna.</v>

103
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

104
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.823
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

105
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I put all my eggs in that basket and I was just emotionally and I was like,</v>

106
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:52.310
<v Speaker 1>this is so important that I get to show and by the time the network and the</v>

107
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>production company and they got done with it.</v>

108
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a shitty show and I didn't want to do it.</v>

109
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And I was like praying that it wouldn't get to pick it up.</v>

110
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>But then when it didn't get picked up,</v>

111
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I got all upset and I got,</v>

112
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I got personal with it and I just,</v>

113
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>I've learned now it is what it is.</v>

114
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just business.</v>

115
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

116
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to be on a show and watch it fall apart because too many people</v>

117
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:11.990
<v Speaker 1>have their input and they fuck with you.</v>

118
00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I had no input.</v>

119
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

120
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

121
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>and it was like,</v>

122
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.271
<v Speaker 1>my name's on that.</v>

123
00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:16.700
<v Speaker 1>It's my company's name is on it,</v>

124
00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't,</v>

125
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.751
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

126
00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

127
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>well executive always think they always think that they have a way to tweak it</v>

128
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.804
<v Speaker 1>and to make it better.</v>

129
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm brilliant or anything.</v>

131
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:26.261
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

132
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I was personally upset.</v>

133
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.031
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

134
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

136
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>the collaborative effort,</v>

137
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>like a real true creative,</v>

138
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>collaborative effort only works with people who respect each other creatively.</v>

139
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Like people will actually approve and to be creative in order to bring someone</v>

140
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>like an executive and to a creative meeting.</v>

141
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you a creative person who do you write a lot?</v>

142
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

143
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have good ideas or is this like an ego bullshit thing here and</v>

144
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>your greasy fingerprints on this and add your little ingredients to the soup.</v>
