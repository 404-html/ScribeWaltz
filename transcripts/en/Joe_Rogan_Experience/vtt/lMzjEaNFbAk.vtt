<v Speaker 1>Doo doo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.</v>

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

4
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Joe.</v>

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie had a question.</v>

7
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not related to that.</v>

8
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Other fellow to other one team fell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in trouble right now.</v>

9
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

10
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>That's your brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guy.</v>

11
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein or the other guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>That other guy's in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like two more women.</v>

14
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Angelina Jolie and they both came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

15
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to stop there.</v>

16
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like you might've had a little bit</v>

17
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>of an issue and that amazing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can get away with something like</v>

18
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:46.954
<v Speaker 1>that for so long and then one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>people come clean and the walls come </v>

19
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:52.264
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oppressive fist of just his fucking </v>

20
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that guy did.</v>

21
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:01.444
<v Speaker 1>I think it does speak to the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>power really exists in an industry in a </v>

23
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>town like this.</v>

24
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.370
<v Speaker 1>It's always been the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been the Cliche,</v>

25
00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The casting couch,</v>

26
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

27
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't know in the modern era how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

28
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much power any still had.</v>

29
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

30
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

31
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and it's also like super left wing guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 1>like really politically connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice ideologies,</v>

33
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:31.690
<v Speaker 1>fighting gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.524
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting gun control and stumping for </v>

35
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.103
<v Speaker 1>it seems like overcompensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to bring this up right up </v>

37
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>front about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were going to talk about cuddle fish.</v>

38
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.183
<v Speaker 1>I asked you to save the cuttlefish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just cuddled conversation about little </v>

39
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:50.734
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

40
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about,</v>

41
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of these are just incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot button topics,</v>

42
00:01:57.311 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 2>but we were talking before about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ra,</v>

43
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.703
<v Speaker 2>your conversation on um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male and female programming in the mind </v>

44
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.410
<v Speaker 2>on male and female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a biological frames.</v>

45
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 2>And what I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to talk about there was</v>

46
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.443
<v Speaker 2>that you can actually have in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>species which aren't nearly as </v>

47
00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:20.284
<v Speaker 2>controversial as humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm irrational basis for something like </v>

48
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 2>transphobia in an evolutionary context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the giant cuttle fish,</v>

49
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 2>which I think is called Sepia Pama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a biologist.</v>

50
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.803
<v Speaker 2>I'm the males are incredibly large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very sexually dimorphic and </v>

51
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.133
<v Speaker 2>you've got these tiny or smaller males </v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't have a good strategy for </v>

52
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:46.294
<v Speaker 2>keeping a lot of females underneath them</v>
<v Speaker 2>were so the males are incredibly larger </v>

53
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 2>that females are incredibly large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The females tend to be much smaller when</v>

54
00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:56.164
<v Speaker 2>the females are impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They accept shelter underneath one of </v>

55
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:01.624
<v Speaker 2>these giant males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have these other males who </v>

56
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.320
<v Speaker 2>aren't nearly as big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

57
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>which might be called sneaker males.</v>

58
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 2>And the sneaker males start retracting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tentacles that identify them as male</v>

59
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 2>and changing through their chromatin </v>
<v Speaker 2>fours.</v>

60
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>They're sort of their presentation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look female.</v>

61
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.943
<v Speaker 2>And then the giant males invite these </v>
<v Speaker 2>males disguised as females through </v>

62
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>behavioral change underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've now proven,</v>

63
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I believe that these sneaker males </v>
<v Speaker 2>inseminate the females.</v>

64
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the larger males are getting duped now.</v>

65
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:41.194
<v Speaker 2>Are the larger males larger because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just have better genetics or are they </v>

66
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>larger because they're older?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

67
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question about better genetics.</v>

68
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Key question is who leaves the lineages </v>
<v Speaker 2>that matter over time?</v>

69
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560
<v Speaker 2>So if you're wasting all of your energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a strategy,</v>

70
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.213
<v Speaker 2>and in fact what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>providing protection for sneaker males </v>

71
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:03.814
<v Speaker 2>to get busy with the females who seemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be equally happy to reward a devious </v>

72
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>male as a strong one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

73
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm a put in mind of the old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Willie Dixon Blues Song.</v>

74
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm a backdoor man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The men don't know,</v>

75
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but the little girls understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

76
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely a female's favor.</v>

77
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 2>A variety of strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether communicating strengthened,</v>

78
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 2>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleverness,</v>

79
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 2>a or anything that females are likely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

80
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will benefit their offspring.</v>

81
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

82
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a great name for them to sneaker </v>
<v Speaker 2>males.</v>

83
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Is that like the tactical mail at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical term for those small males?</v>

84
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it in lizards and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sepia Pama giant cuttle fish system,</v>

85
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with cephalopod,</v>

86
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 2>so I should probably go back and do some</v>
<v Speaker 2>homework on them.</v>

87
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know we would be starting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Harvey Weinstein again.</v>

88
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.323
<v Speaker 2>Giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant cuttle fish Weinstein versus </v>

89
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference.</v>

90
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely keeping that distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

91
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a good distinction now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>

92
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.933
<v Speaker 2>It's good to make a separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm cephalopods including cuttlefish </v>

93
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 2>octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squids,</v>

94
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.803
<v Speaker 2>novelists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they all sort of came from </v>

95
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.580
<v Speaker 2>mollusks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

96
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 2>This is the craziest thing in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

97
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

98
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 2>we're not guaranteed to meet an alien </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence during our lifetimes,</v>

99
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.130
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that such genius exists in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mollusks where you least expect it and,</v>

100
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably the closest we're ever going</v>

101
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 2>to get to aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

102
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's sort of,</v>

103
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 2>international conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

105
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 2>people who have realized this and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 2>just freak out on cephalopods and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

107
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 2>they know every crazy thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cephalopods have been proven to,</v>

108
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.370
<v Speaker 2>to understand and um,</v>

109
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where their cognitive capabilities,</v>

110
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sort of wow us,</v>

111
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 3>have the cognitive capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their camouflage capabilities,</v>

112
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 3>the strategies that they use for </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking a bait fish.</v>

113
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:11.324
<v Speaker 3>And there's a video that I put up on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter really recently have a cuddle </v>

114
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:20.141
<v Speaker 3>fish that opens up like a flower and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoots its tongue out and gets this fish</v>

115
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.014
<v Speaker 3>and then just sucks it into his body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you're looking at some </v>

116
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.450
<v Speaker 3>kind of an alien that's totally an mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget,</v>

117
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.770
<v Speaker 3>is that like seven fold symmetry or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

118
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.643
<v Speaker 3>it's really on a different branch of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>phylogenetic tree and I think that the </v>

119
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.704
<v Speaker 3>dazzled patterns where you just start </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing these neon signs that are </v>

120
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:38.234
<v Speaker 3>effectively made out of the chromatin </v>
<v Speaker 3>fours and if you've seen the videos </v>

121
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:43.514
<v Speaker 3>where people put them on against like </v>
<v Speaker 3>really artificial patterns like chess </v>

122
00:06:46.441 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 3>boards or Chins are things and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cuttlefish has to figure out,</v>

123
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I blend in with that?</v>

124
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 3>And they do their best to market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the natural world,</v>

126
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 3>they mimicked perfectly well not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think was it octopus can do it,</v>

127
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 3>some octopus can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens is the pie.</v>

128
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

129
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

130
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.253
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's Octopi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what they do is they actually </v>

131
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 3>sort of do much less than we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagining.</v>

132
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 3>And they used the fact that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our brains are interpolated.</v>

133
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.973
<v Speaker 3>So they're in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not matching the background as well as </v>

134
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.224
<v Speaker 3>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're doing it well enough that </v>

135
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 3>our brains sort of make up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

136
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

137
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be the difference between the</v>

138
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 3>way we interpret their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their visual,</v>

139
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.221
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

140
00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:39.054
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

141
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 3>whatever camouflage they're giving off </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a visual camouflage,</v>

142
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:43.581
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

143
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 3>If you look at some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

144
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 3>some of the camouflage videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the first seven times you see it,</v>

145
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 3>you can't imagine.</v>

146
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

147
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 3>but then after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after awhile you say,</v>

148
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there really is a difference.</v>

149
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.450
<v Speaker 3>And Somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

150
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the interpolation to help out that</v>

151
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 3>which is trying to escape my detection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

152
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's definitely a distinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kinda tell once you look at it,</v>

153
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's so insanely impressive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison to pretty much,</v>

154
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 3>almost every other life form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

155
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 3>what they can do in terms of like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could change their texture.</v>

156
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when they,</v>

157
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 3>when they sit on a coral reef and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>start looking like a coral reef,</v>

158
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:23.654
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

159
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

160
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 3>have you checked out the mimic octupus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

161
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that one,</v>

162
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.590
<v Speaker 3>five or six different disguises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

163
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

164
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I can't even imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually when you have mimicry,</v>

165
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:38.120
<v Speaker 3>it's dedicated or obligate like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

166
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 3>a stick bug or a leaf insect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only going to do that one trick.</v>

167
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:42.951
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

168
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.784
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting too is like I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard a real legitimate argument for </v>

169
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:46.874
<v Speaker 3>people that are opposed to eating animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>protein that a mollusks especially like </v>

170
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 3>clams and mussels and things along those</v>
<v Speaker 3>lines are more primitive</v>

171
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.260
<v Speaker 1>in terms of their ability to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>or have any,</v>

172
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>any sense of what pain is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of communication,</v>

173
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:08.781
<v Speaker 1>any sort of interpretation of danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all they do is just close.</v>

174
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.043
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that in closing we've interpreted </v>

175
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:16.040
<v Speaker 1>that to being an animal and that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal life form is like,</v>

176
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>it's like eating a living thing versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>like eating plants.</v>

177
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 1>But I've heard it argued it actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris was the first one to bring it</v>

178
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.124
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually a moral argument that </v>

179
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 1>they sense less than plants do and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more,</v>

180
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:35.030
<v Speaker 1>they're more primitive than plants are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet from the [inaudible] family,</v>

181
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.233
<v Speaker 1>you have octopus and there's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that you probably shouldn't be </v>

182
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.850
<v Speaker 1>knocked a post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't beat monkeys,</v>

183
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an octopus is fucking smart.</v>

184
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sneaky.</v>

185
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's them or us,</v>

186
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

187
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

188
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 1>in that case they are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I think if you ever look at Humboldt </v>
<v Speaker 1>Squid,</v>

190
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>schooling and descending as one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest nightmares of all time.</v>

192
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen a humboldt squid as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>humboldt squid sometimes if we get.</v>

193
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:03.324
<v Speaker 1>They called the red devils are the coast</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Baja California and they're just </v>

194
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.203
<v Speaker 1>social in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're terrifying because they attack </v>

195
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.194
<v Speaker 1>in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the planet or the coordinate in some </v>

196
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:16.910
<v Speaker 1>way</v>

197
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 2>in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

198
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.920
<v Speaker 2>obviously the chromatophores must have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some ability to do signaling.</v>

199
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think that with respect to w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to figure out,</v>

200
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.123
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's really intelligence that </v>

201
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:35.891
<v Speaker 2>causes us to become empathic because </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously if you're at war and you think</v>

202
00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:37.064
<v Speaker 2>highly of your enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to guard against your own </v>

203
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:41.750
<v Speaker 2>empathy so that you can be an effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior.</v>

204
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.030
<v Speaker 2>You have to ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

205
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if monkeys and apes are among the most </v>

206
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:48.224
<v Speaker 2>intelligent beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I actually feel some revulsion for </v>

207
00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:56.030
<v Speaker 2>just how savage chimpanzees are as </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to say bonobos are givens.</v>

208
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the real argument or the,</v>

209
00:10:58.221 --> 00:10:59.054
<v Speaker 1>the real fascinating conversation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened on in the evolutionary </v>

210
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:04.494
<v Speaker 1>chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why did banabos become these </v>

211
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:11.421
<v Speaker 1>peaceful sexual creatures and champs </v>
<v Speaker 1>become these warring savage psychos,</v>

212
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>like what they look so similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened?</v>

213
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:17.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

214
00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:18.230
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

215
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.063
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an interesting system in </v>

216
00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Dung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beetles were,</v>

217
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.603
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the armaments that they </v>

218
00:11:26.891 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 2>have on their head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

219
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for warring between males,</v>

220
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.393
<v Speaker 2>there's a conserved quantity between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>length of the Copula Tory apparatus and </v>

221
00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:40.000
<v Speaker 2>the size of the weaponry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the more weapons,</v>

222
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.840
<v Speaker 2>the smaller the penises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

223
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:44.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are all these crazy tradeoffs in </v>

224
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.740
<v Speaker 2>apes between relative testicular size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in peanut size</v>

225
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>for gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorillas have tiny little</v>

226
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.933
<v Speaker 3>penises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but enormous bodies and giant fangs and </v>

227
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.930
<v Speaker 3>tiny penis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

228
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

229
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 3>And chimpanzees have big penises and </v>
<v Speaker 3>testicles both.</v>

230
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See they said that chimpanzees,</v>

231
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:08.554
<v Speaker 3>there's a direct correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 3>promiscuous females and the size of </v>

232
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.530
<v Speaker 3>their testicles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

233
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember that one.</v>

234
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question about.</v>

235
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.550
<v Speaker 3>I also worry that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

236
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 3>we've idealized the banabos too much and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 3>we were sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to be empathetic with the</v>

238
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 3>chimps after Jane Goodall showed us what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're capable of.</v>

239
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in part,</v>

240
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

241
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.010
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cold logic of the natural world,</v>

242
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.693
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

243
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

244
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 3>it's usually some reason that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>complete sense.</v>

245
00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:49.874
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't be sentimental anytime you </v>

246
00:12:51.051 --> 00:12:53.010
<v Speaker 3>bring sentimentality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

247
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.030
<v Speaker 3>and you usually screw up a good theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

248
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.640
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

249
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:59.510
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

250
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.110
<v Speaker 3>I worry that our comparisons are driven </v>
<v Speaker 3>by our needs to,</v>

251
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 3>to locate ourselves a farther away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees and closer to something that</v>

252
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.010
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we feel comfortable.</v>

253
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.083
<v Speaker 3>So are idealizing the Banabos is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily based on what they actually </v>

254
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:15.794
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but based on like our little sort of </v>

255
00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:18.680
<v Speaker 3>hippie version of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

256
00:13:18.681 --> 00:13:19.514
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could be like the banabos loving and </v>

257
00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:25.730
<v Speaker 3>sexual and affectionate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we can be like the warring horrible,</v>

258
00:13:25.731 --> 00:13:28.010
<v Speaker 3>horrible chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

259
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also the case that,</v>

260
00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:30.404
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how great does it feel to be sexual if </v>

261
00:13:32.031 --> 00:13:34.130
<v Speaker 3>you're being sexually out competed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>others?</v>

262
00:13:34.131 --> 00:13:37.040
<v Speaker 3>It's always unfunded to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

263
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.083
<v Speaker 3>low status and nature has different ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>of punishing and rewarding a status and </v>

264
00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:45.410
<v Speaker 3>achievement in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in various,</v>

265
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the various different species.</v>

266
00:13:47.751 --> 00:13:48.584
<v Speaker 3>So my guess is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there is a kind of concise </v>

267
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.670
<v Speaker 3>conserved,</v>

268
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.743
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

269
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unpleasantness and losing each </v>

270
00:13:56.671 --> 00:14:00.150
<v Speaker 3>particular game and a pleasure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning each particular game.</v>

271
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.303
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's essentially how nature keeps </v>

272
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:04.380
<v Speaker 3>moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

273
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

274
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that,</v>

275
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wasting energy.</v>

276
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm warring when you could be being </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructive or being more strategic,</v>

277
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.103
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get out competed by </v>

278
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.810
<v Speaker 3>whichever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

279
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.430
<v Speaker 3>members,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

280
00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:21.690
<v Speaker 3>of your species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

281
00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:24.050
<v Speaker 3>figure out the puzzle first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that,</v>

282
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.733
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

283
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this concept of the naturalistic</v>

284
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:31.540
<v Speaker 3>fallacy of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of viewing that which,</v>

285
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.171
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

286
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 3>if you assume that we carry some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judeo Christian baggage and all of this,</v>

287
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:38.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was thought to come from a,</v>

288
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:43.590
<v Speaker 3>a creator who was thought to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive characteristics than,</v>

289
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:44.883
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously the natural world is God's </v>

290
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:47.944
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean if you actually look at the </v>

291
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:50.674
<v Speaker 3>systems that fascinate me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the creator would have to be about the </v>

292
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:54.884
<v Speaker 3>most twisted consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A consciousness you could possibly </v>

293
00:14:57.591 --> 00:14:58.424
<v Speaker 3>imagine.</v>

294
00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's,</v>

295
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.083
<v Speaker 1>it's the long game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The creators playing the creators not </v>

296
00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:03.624
<v Speaker 1>playing the game that favors the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the health and the welfare of the </v>

297
00:15:06.251 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the current day.</v>

298
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:08.763
<v Speaker 1>It's the matter of like figuring out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get through this brutal game and </v>

299
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.033
<v Speaker 1>advancing and evolving along the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where some day in the future </v>

300
00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.860
<v Speaker 1>you find a more complex and evolving</v>

301
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.100
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is</v>

302
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.310
<v Speaker 1>the most complex and evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This us,</v>

303
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.600
<v Speaker 1>you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

304
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.920
<v Speaker 1>most complex and evolved system in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its ability to change its environment</v>

305
00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:34.560
<v Speaker 1>that we've ever come across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're not too happy with ourselves.</v>

306
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I do think that despite our </v>

307
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.353
<v Speaker 3>barbarism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are that which can contemplate the </v>

308
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:42.644
<v Speaker 3>game and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some point you've obviously had my </v>

309
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:47.414
<v Speaker 3>brother on the street on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked him as an evolutionary </v>

310
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:50.721
<v Speaker 3>theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brett,</v>

311
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

312
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 3>you're married to one woman and you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>had two kids,</v>

313
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an evolutionary theorists,</v>

314
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:57.710
<v Speaker 3>don't you think you're throwing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game?</v>

315
00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.140
<v Speaker 3>And his response was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

316
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.310
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a.</v>

317
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 3>and tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>

318
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.003
<v Speaker 3>if you understood the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you want to continue to play </v>

319
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:09.530
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

320
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.020
<v Speaker 3>So for him it was almost like a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>proof that,</v>

321
00:16:14.021 --> 00:16:16.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really get,</v>

322
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one of his good quotes is that a</v>

323
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 3>life when properly understood is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spelling bee that ends in genocide.</v>

324
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.620
<v Speaker 3>That we're also focused on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>nucleotide sequences.</v>

325
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you really care about the particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>way in which you did digest lactose?</v>

326
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different from how I do it that you want</v>

327
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:38.954
<v Speaker 3>to go to war with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can spell the future using your </v>

328
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 3>version rather than mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you,</v>

329
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.850
<v Speaker 3>you'd feel this way about your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

330
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your songs,</v>

331
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 3>your stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really you really want to fight over</v>

332
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Speaker 3>like things that neither of us care </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

333
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>

334
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're trying to think about like,</v>

335
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:03.590
<v Speaker 3>I want to leave seven children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

336
00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:05.360
<v Speaker 3>why do you want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

337
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 3>because I want to see more copies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

338
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Well you will see a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>copies of yourself,</v>

339
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:10.904
<v Speaker 3>but that's going to get diluted very </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly by the time we get to your </v>

340
00:17:13.821 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great grandchildren's can be hard to see</v>

341
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:16.784
<v Speaker 3>yourself in your offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's sort of an illusion of one </v>

342
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 3>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two generations.</v>

343
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Most of the things that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>determine your genes a propagating.</v>

344
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm have to do with the fact that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a team.</v>

345
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 3>There are a bunch of people who digest </v>
<v Speaker 3>milk the way you do.</v>

346
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 3>And so the key question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

347
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.700
<v Speaker 3>team Rogan on the milk digestion is some</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge number of people you've never met.</v>

348
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.753
<v Speaker 3>That's what I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why I don't understand the </v>

349
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:43.454
<v Speaker 3>connection to milk digestion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just one thing that your body is </v>

350
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 3>doing in a particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

351
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.913
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

352
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 3>let's</v>

353
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 1>take eichler maybe that's more familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

354
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

355
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.393
<v Speaker 1>I know that I have a blue illegal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is being suppressed in terms of its </v>

356
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:01.380
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I really care that um,</v>

357
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my wife has two brown illegals,</v>

358
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.813
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it matter to me that my blue </v>

359
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:08.364
<v Speaker 1>somehow survives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I care that I want it to survive </v>

360
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:13.134
<v Speaker 1>enough against some brown eyed person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be interesting if you had a </v>

361
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 1>checklist of like what things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would agree upon,</v>

362
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.220
<v Speaker 1>like you and the wife get together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

363
00:18:20.221 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

364
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ability,</v>

365
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

366
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 1>who's who side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go on with intelligence.</v>

367
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 1>You're a little smarter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give it to you.</v>

368
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with your brains.</v>

369
00:18:30.431 --> 00:18:31.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

370
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm better at smelling things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you.</v>

371
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.333
<v Speaker 1>I'm just allergic to cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have none of the kids fucking </v>

372
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 1>sneeze.</v>

373
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Every time they go near a litter box was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great thing was just flip a coin.</v>

374
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it a couple of times and </v>

375
00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:43.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever we get we get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

376
00:18:43.541 --> 00:18:44.374
<v Speaker 1>I worry about a crispr cas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine people are going to be having </v>

377
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

378
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll trade you this for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna have crazy.</v>

379
00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by crispr.</v>

380
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think most people aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of it.</v>

381
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 1>People like you of course are people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are paying attention are,</v>

382
00:18:59.011 --> 00:18:59.844
<v Speaker 1>but I think to the general public has no</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that crispr even exists and it's </v>

383
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.103
<v Speaker 1>potentially world changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're literally looking at the </v>

384
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:10.350
<v Speaker 1>tools that will eventually lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much like,</v>

385
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Graham Bell's invention led to</v>

386
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:16.310
<v Speaker 1>you having the Internet in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

387
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

388
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.673
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at the tools that will </v>

389
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:20.664
<v Speaker 1>one day lead to us engineering some </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely new organism that you're </v>

390
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 1>going to call human beings.</v>

391
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:27.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's going to be a long time </v>

392
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.533
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Graham Bell was a long time </v>

393
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 1>off and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

394
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's less time than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

395
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.930
<v Speaker 1>When was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the 18 hundreds?</v>

396
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.800
<v Speaker 1>What are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 17 to the late 18 hundreds.</v>

397
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.053
<v Speaker 1>You don't take 21 slash 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to behave a fucking </v>

398
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Speaker 1>incredible hulks and thor's and women </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like wonder woman.</v>

399
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.073
<v Speaker 1>There's not going to be a single troll </v>
<v Speaker 1>like looking person left and the one </v>

400
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.480
<v Speaker 1>that I think we're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a lockdown.</v>

401
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to be able to do a </v>

402
00:19:58.201 --> 00:19:59.034
<v Speaker 1>lot more competent torics of swapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in that's known to work and </v>

403
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:02.544
<v Speaker 1>swapping something out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when we actually get to like </v>

404
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.070
<v Speaker 1>authorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

405
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this great idea for a human being.</v>

406
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start from scratch.</v>

407
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of optimism that,</v>

408
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for which I am the pessimist,</v>

409
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uploading the mind to a computer.</v>

410
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pet Kurzweil's ideas.</v>

411
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

412
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 1>not in the sense that we're never going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get anywhere close,</v>

413
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.180
<v Speaker 1>but just 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're aiming for.</v>

414
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm optimistic about certain things that</v>

415
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:37.650
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be a lot easier than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected.</v>

416
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.723
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot of things that are or</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought were going to require </v>

417
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.850
<v Speaker 1>artificial general intelligence are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to succumb to much simpler systems</v>

418
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.740
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might've thought that,</v>

419
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

420
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 3>if you played through the great chess </v>
<v Speaker 3>games,</v>

421
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:52.090
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

422
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 3>the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like morphe in Anderson and things,</v>

423
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.613
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's just a uniquely human </v>

424
00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 3>activity and then you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

425
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 3>no computers can trounce humans at chess</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not.</v>

426
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.793
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't what you thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe music will be the next thing to </v>

427
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 3>succumb because that's really highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular,</v>

428
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 3>but music is also intensely creative and</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotive,</v>

429
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

430
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

431
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sparks feeling in humans and,</v>

432
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think you could really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

433
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:24.574
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think you really could </v>

434
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:26.674
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to engineer or have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer engineer something that makes </v>

435
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:34.420
<v Speaker 3>you feel like led Zepplin the immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 3>song.</v>

436
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:35.763
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just like a bizarre feeling to </v>

437
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 3>someone's art that comes through when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you listened to it and you're like,</v>

438
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fucking great.</v>

439
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:44.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where I don't,</v>

440
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.863
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily know you could do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that with something that doesn't </v>

441
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:53.200
<v Speaker 3>understand emotions or is using a </v>
<v Speaker 3>replica of emotions.</v>

442
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Whereas chess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

443
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:55.384
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rook move this way upon can move that </v>

444
00:21:57.161 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the rules.</v>

445
00:21:58.241 --> 00:22:00.760
<v Speaker 3>This is how it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what once you get here,</v>

446
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:01.594
<v Speaker 3>you're in check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those things seem pretty </v>

447
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 3>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with squares.</v>

448
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 3>It's very mathematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

449
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 3>one person moves in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one moves.</v>

450
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.453
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like there's like this fluid </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature to art literature and music and </v>

451
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.770
<v Speaker 3>the other half of that I think I </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree.</v>

452
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

453
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:19.504
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know why you chose the </v>

454
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:21.274
<v Speaker 3>immigrant that that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm going to go to cryotherapy </v>

455
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:26.020
<v Speaker 3>after this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the domino's to do.</v>

456
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 3>It's just a good song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we,</v>

457
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.830
<v Speaker 3>if you'd taken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you'd,</v>

458
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 3>if you'd taken a Roy orbison's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

459
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

460
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.253
<v Speaker 3>So do you have the main riff from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>song had like walking down the street </v>

461
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 3>due to come to America or that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going after the um,</v>

462
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.360
<v Speaker 3>the riff is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

463
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.890
<v Speaker 3>dude did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Do do it?</v>

464
00:22:55.891 --> 00:22:56.301
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

465
00:22:56.301 --> 00:22:57.440
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did it right,</v>

466
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.353
<v Speaker 3>so if you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take a guitar string and you </v>

467
00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.923
<v Speaker 3>split it into four equal parts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put your finger over a one quarter </v>

468
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:11.040
<v Speaker 3>of the string and then you start just </v>
<v Speaker 3>plucking a string and hovering above the</v>

469
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 3>string so you don't actually push it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fret board.</v>

470
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.273
<v Speaker 3>Those notes occur naturally as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>harmonics in the expansion of the </v>

471
00:23:19.361 --> 00:23:24.270
<v Speaker 3>vibrating string so that those notes </v>
<v Speaker 3>were not really chosen by Roy orbison or</v>

472
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.113
<v Speaker 3>whoever wrote the song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were really chosen by like a four </v>

473
00:23:26.961 --> 00:23:31.030
<v Speaker 3>day series and it feels like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rift.</v>

474
00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:31.864
<v Speaker 3>But I discovered this when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia as I would start playing that </v>

475
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.600
<v Speaker 3>and people would react and I felt like </v>
<v Speaker 3>why that song?</v>

476
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:38.763
<v Speaker 3>What about more complex creative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of improvisational song like food </v>

477
00:23:42.951 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>who child from Hendrix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know</v>

478
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 2>about Voodoo child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean take take.</v>

479
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.823
<v Speaker 2>It changes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the first couple of </v>

480
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.104
<v Speaker 2>cords of red house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like some seventh or diminished </v>

481
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 2>chord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's arpeggiated Nana,</v>

482
00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:07.094
<v Speaker 2>and then he moves it down a half step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has to do with this tritone </v>

483
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:14.810
<v Speaker 2>substitution and the symmetry inside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the seventh chord.</v>

484
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.200
<v Speaker 2>So if I recall correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a chord like C,</v>

485
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:21.230
<v Speaker 2>e,</v>
<v Speaker 2>g,</v>

486
00:24:21.231 --> 00:24:22.064
<v Speaker 2>e,</v>
<v Speaker 2>b flat would be a c seven chord and the </v>

487
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 2>e and the b flat would form this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>called a triton.</v>

488
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.840
<v Speaker 2>And now if you went in the blues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

489
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 2>there are three elements of the chord </v>
<v Speaker 2>progression,</v>

490
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:38.981
<v Speaker 2>the dominant subdominant and the tonic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go down a half step,</v>

491
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.480
<v Speaker 2>you effectively invert the third in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat seventh.</v>

492
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you go one half step below that,</v>

493
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.340
<v Speaker 2>it's the flat seventh and the third I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

494
00:24:49.341 --> 00:24:50.600
<v Speaker 2>of the subdominant court.</v>

495
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:55.600
<v Speaker 2>So Hendrix is actually playing with math</v>
<v Speaker 2>in something as basic as.</v>

496
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.063
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he's aware of it or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think he's doing it sort of just </v>

497
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 2>instinctual?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

498
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.263
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're visited by an alien </v>

499
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:04.754
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went through cuddle fish and we now </v>

500
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.830
<v Speaker 2>we've gotten into Jimi Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's like,</v>

501
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.373
<v Speaker 2>these are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the best alien sightings we </v>

502
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to speculate,</v>

503
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:14.474
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

504
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.553
<v Speaker 2>I just look at everything I've been able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand about what he did and you </v>

505
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:21.554
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a supermind as well </v>

506
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 2>as an intuitive mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mastery of the instrument,</v>

507
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.153
<v Speaker 2>complete understanding of the chords and</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressions and just the ability to </v>

508
00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 2>improvise and to make it sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

509
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Adding the Wah Wah pedal and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>distortion and all the shit that he used</v>

510
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that he imparts more into </v>
<v Speaker 2>one note,</v>

511
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.413
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even know how to notate mean </v>

512
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 2>what is even the instrument.</v>

513
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.680
<v Speaker 2>You didn't play the guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played the guitar amplification.</v>

514
00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.740
<v Speaker 2>You signal processing system as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

515
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 2>So there are these people who are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some multidimensional space.</v>

516
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Another one of my favorites is a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>named Roy Buchanan,</v>

517
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.923
<v Speaker 2>who somehow these guys who understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>harmonics gravitate to telecasters and </v>

518
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

519
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:10.874
<v Speaker 2>pull a song called Roy's blues and watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>him just go into the multiverse and </v>

520
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:19.940
<v Speaker 2>start playing with things that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even imagine are possible.</v>

521
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.403
<v Speaker 2>So I do think that there's a very close </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between algorithms and </v>

522
00:26:26.661 --> 00:26:31.661
<v Speaker 2>emotion and I just did this one for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>old tweet of mine where I wrote a python</v>

523
00:26:33.651 --> 00:26:34.484
<v Speaker 2>program that actually runs from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweets of the entire program is in the </v>

524
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:43.310
<v Speaker 2>tweet and it's purpose is to generate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chord progression for Pachelbel's,</v>

525
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 2>which is if you want people to cry at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding,</v>

526
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.483
<v Speaker 2>that's the chord progression to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that it's actually an </v>

527
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:55.071
<v Speaker 2>algorithm that breaks your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very frightening.</v>

528
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:56.443
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

529
00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.620
<v Speaker 1>some insane noise in the background here</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

530
00:26:59.621 --> 00:27:02.830
<v Speaker 1>They're doing some shit to our roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the last days that were in the</v>

531
00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:03.664
<v Speaker 1>studio by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious that it's sort of </v>

532
00:27:05.471 --> 00:27:07.480
<v Speaker 1>highlighting why we need to get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>outta here.</v>

533
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.110
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know what they're doing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

534
00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he even ran anymore?</v>

535
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Why will they do with fixing the roof?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put a fucking top up their assholes.</v>

536
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.370
<v Speaker 1>The guy even asked me right before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

537
00:27:18.371 --> 00:27:19.300
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what time do you take?</v>

538
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

539
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.113
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's right about the time we're </v>

540
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.240
<v Speaker 1>letting explosions right above your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

541
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Sorry for people listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

542
00:27:28.421 --> 00:27:29.254
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that noise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the noises banging around the </v>

543
00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 1>roof pinned down by enemy fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

544
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's also me as a,</v>

545
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.380
<v Speaker 1>as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably have some bias,</v>

546
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.790
<v Speaker 1>some stupid idea that creativity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to recreate.</v>

547
00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:51.150
<v Speaker 1>You know that whatever it leads to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person being able to make some beautiful</v>

548
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:52.024
<v Speaker 1>song or create some amazing book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for some sort of a computer </v>

549
00:27:56.321 --> 00:27:57.520
<v Speaker 1>to figure that out on its own.</v>

550
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.753
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've.</v>

551
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.003
<v Speaker 2>I would go ahead and hang out in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern recording studio and watch the </v>

552
00:28:04.661 --> 00:28:08.410
<v Speaker 2>move the beat around and mutated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>change it.</v>

553
00:28:08.411 --> 00:28:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Or if you think about like that moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>where share said,</v>

554
00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:14.020
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think autotune should be used to</v>

555
00:28:14.021 --> 00:28:14.854
<v Speaker 2>correct my voice in a sly way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to use this as the instrument </v>

556
00:28:18.341 --> 00:28:23.341
<v Speaker 2>itself and suddenly this metallic voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually isn't,</v>

557
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.820
<v Speaker 2>becomes an anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you start,</v>

558
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robo share is incredibly inspiring.</v>

559
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:32.993
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember a Peter Frampton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the first guys to use it </v>

560
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 1>in a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like I do.</v>

561
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.050
<v Speaker 2>So he used that thing with his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a tube in his mouth.</v>

562
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.300
<v Speaker 2>So he's really actually using his body </v>
<v Speaker 2>to shape.</v>

563
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.943
<v Speaker 2>He's using the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this five dimensional lattice </v>

564
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.333
<v Speaker 2>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your mouth to produce the </v>

565
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 2>international phonemic alphabet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>

566
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.940
<v Speaker 2>your nose could be on or off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one degree of freedom.</v>

567
00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.740
<v Speaker 2>You can have vocalization on or off </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocalization,</v>

568
00:29:00.741 --> 00:29:03.810
<v Speaker 2>meaning you can have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like F,</v>

569
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.190
<v Speaker 2>F,</v>
<v Speaker 2>F as in Frank Versus v as in victory.</v>

570
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:11.060
<v Speaker 2>They're the same mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

571
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.270
<v Speaker 2>But right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just vibrating your throat so you</v>

572
00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:19.271
<v Speaker 2>can have no vocalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is in the throat somewhere.</v>

573
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking boomer like s versus z would</v>

574
00:29:26.901 --> 00:29:28.400
<v Speaker 2>be another pair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

575
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:29.523
<v Speaker 2>so the sound that you're making with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your throat and then you have like your </v>

576
00:29:33.231 --> 00:29:37.760
<v Speaker 2>lips and one of three positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a third degree of freedom than</v>

577
00:29:37.761 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>your tongue can be in one of five </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions and it can be fully elevated,</v>

578
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.023
<v Speaker 3>half elevated or not elevated at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's like five parameter family </v>

579
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 3>that generates what's called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>international phonemic alphabet.</v>

580
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

581
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:56.674
<v Speaker 3>one of the cool things to think about is</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you create an instrument that </v>

582
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:02.044
<v Speaker 3>naturally allowed you phonemic </v>
<v Speaker 3>productions that you're not just doing </v>

583
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 3>these simple ringing tones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

584
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be a way to just recreate </v>
<v Speaker 3>it physically,</v>

585
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:13.624
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just make an artificial head and </v>

586
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 3>maybe we just made an artificial head </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

587
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:18.514
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like we do something that's </v>

588
00:30:19.121 --> 00:30:21.640
<v Speaker 3>impossible to recreate with a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

589
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:26.670
<v Speaker 3>But like in terms of if you take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>collection of all major instruments,</v>

590
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 3>what comes closest to the human voice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people think it's the,</v>

591
00:30:31.241 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian violin called the Sarangi.</v>

592
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

593
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 3>You never check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a Sarangi?</v>

594
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.083
<v Speaker 3>A Sarangi is like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we use it to drown out the pounding </v>

595
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:44.440
<v Speaker 3>on the roof?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd win a Sarangi yeah.</v>

596
00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:46.760
<v Speaker 3>I've never even heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds bad ass.</v>

597
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:47.860
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange.</v>

598
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Violin is a strange violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of sympathetic strings and um,</v>

599
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of you can power into a note.</v>

600
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 3>You if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have a guitar and I pluck a string,</v>

601
00:31:02.141 --> 00:31:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to get decay unless I </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive the sound right.</v>

602
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 3>But if I do with my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look how cool that thing looks.</v>

603
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:11.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

604
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.620
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Louder.</v>

605
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.893
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

606
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to imagine like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those are sympathetic strings.</v>

607
00:31:23.191 --> 00:31:25.650
<v Speaker 3>So they ring when you hit the tone </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly.</v>

608
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.993
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

609
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.953
<v Speaker 3>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you've never gotten into north </v>

612
00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:44.390

613
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My guess is,</v>

614
00:31:46.431 --> 00:31:47.264
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't recall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but very often you will need to know </v>

615
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.480
<v Speaker 3>what that one looks kind of old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks beat up fucking amazing.</v>

619
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.790
<v Speaker 3>It almost died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like,</v>

620
00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:11.400
<v Speaker 3>it was used for guzzle singing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>courtesans used to play it.</v>

622
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:15.343
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of song that would be popular in what </v>

623
00:32:17.031 --> 00:32:22.031
<v Speaker 3>would now be Pakistan in northern India </v>
<v Speaker 3>funded Drumna Ryan decided to check this</v>

<v Speaker 3>That should have died off quicker.</v>

627
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:37.683
<v Speaker 3>I am that old.</v>

628
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:38.960
<v Speaker 5>That</v>

629
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.960
<v Speaker 1>pamphlet thing really never caught on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is way better than the pamphlets.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it goes at the speed of speech and if </v>

00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:29.611
<v Speaker 2>bowls and to speak the bowls is to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you would instruct your hands to do</v>

644
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.773

00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:31.090
<v Speaker 3>through an entire performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

699
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.390
<v Speaker 3>of Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>north Indian classical music.</v>

700
00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:34.290
<v Speaker 3>And I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

701
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 3>my jaw was on the floor.</v>

702
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:40.790
<v Speaker 3>How has the entire form of classical </v>
<v Speaker 3>music much closer to our jazz.</v>

703
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.380
<v Speaker 3>So much more impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

704
00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 3>visually to watch one of these drummers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of these soloists,</v>

705
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:48.803
<v Speaker 3>the soloists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll try to lose the drummer and the </v>

706
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:53.760
<v Speaker 3>drummer's got these mirror neurons that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be beat and he'll just like follow</v>

707
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:56.470
<v Speaker 3>him everywhere and so you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

708
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.251
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

709
00:36:57.251 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 3>a poor white kid in America saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody told me this existed.</v>

710
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:02.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird how we just choose a certain </v>

711
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:06.804
<v Speaker 3>series of instruments that represent </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock and roll certain series of </v>

712
00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:11.460
<v Speaker 3>instruments that represent jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

713
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.653
<v Speaker 3>it's really strange when you think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wide range of musical instruments </v>

714
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:20.340
<v Speaker 3>that exist all over the world that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just never utilized in modern music.</v>

715
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:21.683
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do think that we've become too </v>

716
00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:25.524
<v Speaker 3>complacent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should be like Ian Anderson with </v>

717
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Jethro Tull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

718
00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to the flute Solo and </v>
<v Speaker 3>locomotive breath,</v>

719
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:36.510
<v Speaker 3>that'll get me going every God damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

720
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 3>And why didn't I take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't take it off.</v>

721
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

722
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

723
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.853
<v Speaker 3>the clarinet was lost to jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be this incredibly dominant </v>

724
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.340
<v Speaker 3>instrument and coming out of the Klezmer</v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition,</v>

725
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it rocked and then it sort of became </v>

726
00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:55.590
<v Speaker 3>this non thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at some point I saw a guy named Tony</v>

727
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.423
<v Speaker 3>Scott who was like the last great </v>
<v Speaker 3>clarinetist and jazz who went off to </v>

728
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.223
<v Speaker 3>Japan to study zen for years and he came</v>
<v Speaker 3>back for a birthday concert and he blew </v>

729
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 3>dizzy Gillespie and Benny Carter off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

730
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.270
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

731
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.253
<v Speaker 3>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clarinet can be the kick kickass </v>

732
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:13.560
<v Speaker 3>instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

733
00:38:13.561 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Most people think of it as something </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're forced to take in high school.</v>

734
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:17.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But fundamentally that's where like the </v>

735
00:38:19.991 --> 00:38:22.860
<v Speaker 3>youth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ukulele has come back like crazy.</v>

736
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:28.670
<v Speaker 3>The UKULELE was a Mexican instrument </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was introduced to Hawaii.</v>

737
00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what your gaze?</v>

738
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it got an.</v>

739
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big thing</v>

740
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.330
<v Speaker 6>in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

741
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.223
<v Speaker 6>Are they into the Ukulele?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it came over with cattle </v>

742
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:42.574
<v Speaker 6>ranchers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was introduced to Hawaii by </v>

743
00:38:45.551 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 6>people who brought over like cowboys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if I remember,</v>

744
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 6>I might be butchering the story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So forgive me my Hawaiian friends.</v>

745
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.073
<v Speaker 6>But I think what it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it was was they had introduced </v>

746
00:38:56.411 --> 00:39:00.970
<v Speaker 6>cattle at some point in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hawaii and when they introduced cattle,</v>

747
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:01.481
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

748
00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:02.314
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you keep these fucking things </v>

749
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 6>from wandering all over the place?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So man,</v>

750
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:07.540
<v Speaker 6>we got to find some cowboys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>teach us how to do this shit.</v>

751
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.613
<v Speaker 6>And they got some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was either Mexican or South American </v>

752
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:15.181
<v Speaker 6>cowboys to come over and show them how </v>
<v Speaker 6>to wrangle these cows,</v>

753
00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:16.990
<v Speaker 6>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how to corral them,</v>

754
00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 6>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how to take care of them.</v>

755
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:22.810
<v Speaker 6>And then when they did these cowboys </v>
<v Speaker 6>came over and introduced the Ukulele,</v>

756
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.310
<v Speaker 6>which is really kind of uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hawaiian in art in America.</v>

757
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.840
<v Speaker 6>When we think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

758
00:39:28.841 --> 00:39:31.150
<v Speaker 6>you hear like a sound of the Ukulele.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

759
00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.183
<v Speaker 6>we sort of think about it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like my daughter's a musician and when </v>

760
00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:38.820
<v Speaker 6>we're in Hawaii I got her Ukulele.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like she,</v>

761
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:39.970
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she plays it.</v>

762
00:39:39.971 --> 00:39:42.550
<v Speaker 6>We think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like in a lot of people's eyes,</v>

763
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:43.384
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of like what we think of as </v>
<v Speaker 6>classic Hawaiian Music is played with a </v>

764
00:39:46.731 --> 00:39:47.410
<v Speaker 6>Ukulele.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

765
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:48.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think I'm going to fuck up that </v>

766
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:53.500
<v Speaker 1>history was I thought it was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>portrait.</v>

767
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Oakland Lily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like jumping flee.</v>

768
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's on wine name on a Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>instrument.</v>

769
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:59.440
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

770
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.273
<v Speaker 1>Make a pdf says they attributed to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>three Portuguese immigrants and the 18 </v>

771
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:06.603
<v Speaker 1>eighties that developed it from three </v>
<v Speaker 1>other guitar lick instruments from </v>

772
00:40:09.821 --> 00:40:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Portugal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quality Cava keynote.</v>

773
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.223
<v Speaker 1>That's the origin of the Ukulele.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how did it get to Hawaii as they </v>

774
00:40:16.211 --> 00:40:17.380
<v Speaker 1>were in Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

775
00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.390
<v Speaker 1>they were in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys were in Hawaii.</v>

776
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they brought it to a why the guys who</v>

777
00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 1>made it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what wikipedia says.</v>

778
00:40:23.261 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not wikipedia.</v>

779
00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:25.334
<v Speaker 1>I'll say Brian Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother and I have some weird </v>

780
00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 1>diseases that I don't really have.</v>

781
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:33.223

<v Speaker 1>I just love the fact that he's led </v>

782
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.093
<v Speaker 1>people just edit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like anytime there's a podcast and </v>

783
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:38.374
<v Speaker 1>something fucked up happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to the person's wikipedia page </v>

784
00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:42.070
<v Speaker 1>and they'll totally butcher it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

785
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:44.170
<v Speaker 1>the amazing thing is is that it works at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

786
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.011
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'd stressed about distrustful,</v>

797
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.920
<v Speaker 1>distrustful of snopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

798
00:41:13.921 --> 00:41:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Why do you feel like they're left </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaning or do you feel like they're just</v>

799
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.650
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily 100 percent honest or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think well,</v>

800
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.653

<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes guys,</v>

802
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.980
<v Speaker 1>the history of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hilarious guy.</v>

803
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>He just shacks up with some escort and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she becomes the main editor.</v>

804
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have some more dmt before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that a one.</v>

805
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:42.404
<v Speaker 2>I think that the ICU not needed to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact from fiction at the moment is </v>

806
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:49.580
<v Speaker 2>enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of money you'd need would be.</v>

807
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.493
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

808
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually today with Hashtag fake news.</v>

809
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 2>So I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

810
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.283
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of feeling like I'm witnessing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle for whether any authority </v>

811
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.140
<v Speaker 2>exists at all and the claim that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact check has been synonymized with the</v>

812
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:19.220
<v Speaker 2>fact that you're truthful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is total nonsense.</v>

813
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.833
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I accurately represent three people </v>

814
00:42:22.611 --> 00:42:25.130
<v Speaker 2>who were in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a scene and I,</v>

815
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:30.250
<v Speaker 2>and I leave out to others and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>says that fact you know,</v>

816
00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 2>that that picture is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

817
00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:34.430
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

818
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.190
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These three people really were there.</v>

819
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you filtered out those other things,</v>

820
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:39.284
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell lies by leaving things out </v>

821
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:43.450
<v Speaker 2>by insinuation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

822
00:42:43.451 --> 00:42:46.110
<v Speaker 2>I have this whole riff on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

823
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.180
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

824
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.303
<v Speaker 2>frequently refer to as Russell </v>
<v Speaker 2>conjugation that other people call it </v>

825
00:42:51.311 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>motive conjugation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

826
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:53.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between fink versus </v>

827
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 2>whistle blower is how I usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce this.</v>

828
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.823
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are technically synonyms in </v>

829
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:03.014
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you cannot substitute one for the </v>

830
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:06.830
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whistleblower don't.</v>

831
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:08.483
<v Speaker 2>Well with whistleblowers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only is usually one of the only </v>

832
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:11.743
<v Speaker 2>positive ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chelsea manning is a highly regarded </v>

833
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:14.620
<v Speaker 2>rat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

834
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.160
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work because of the emotional</v>
<v Speaker 2>shading.</v>

835
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Like another thing is to get somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>proximate to something very disturbing.</v>

836
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:24.914
<v Speaker 2>So Ben Shapiro and I were in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>article about how the alt right was </v>

837
00:43:29.391 --> 00:43:30.224
<v Speaker 2>outraged and we were like the two people</v>
<v Speaker 2>cited neither supposed to be outright </v>

838
00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

839
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright thing is a weird thing to know.</v>

840
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a great game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to appreciate what it is.</v>

841
00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:43.903
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're trying to silence the very </v>

842
00:43:48.081 --> 00:43:48.914
<v Speaker 2>small number of people who are probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>your guests [inaudible] I'm the right </v>

843
00:43:53.811 --> 00:43:54.644
<v Speaker 2>thing to do is to make sure that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>proximate to lots of terrible stuff so </v>

844
00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 2>that people who are too busy to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>things out so well,</v>

845
00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:02.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I neither condemned nor condone because </v>

846
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:06.620
<v Speaker 2>all you're trying to do is to muddle </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

847
00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.753
<v Speaker 2>You need enough fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty and doubt in order to get </v>

848
00:44:10.221 --> 00:44:11.054
<v Speaker 2>the job done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it doesn't matter that the </v>

849
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:14.250
<v Speaker 2>article says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

850
00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:19.251
<v Speaker 2>in the banner headline outright enraged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the two people you know,</v>

851
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:24.281
<v Speaker 2>listed are like Jews who opposed trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because when,</v>

852
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.640
<v Speaker 2>when those articles are parsed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

853
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>it shows up as while</v>

854
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.930
<v Speaker 3>you were in a bunch of articles about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outright.</v>

855
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

856
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:36.203
<v Speaker 3>So I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really not paying attention and </v>

857
00:44:38.851 --> 00:44:39.684
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

858
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:40.583
<v Speaker 3>the point isn't to inform the reader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is to tag that which you wish </v>

859
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:48.540
<v Speaker 3>to neutralize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's working very well.</v>

860
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Do people in the alt right consider </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves outright,</v>

861
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or did they use to when it's become sort</v>

862
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:56.660
<v Speaker 3>of a pejorative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

863
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.890
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's go through the craziness here.</v>

864
00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Assume that you are not a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a Democrat,</v>

865
00:45:02.761 --> 00:45:06.270
<v Speaker 3>might translate to libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more Republicans,</v>

866
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Republican translates to right of </v>
<v Speaker 3>center,</v>

867
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of Center,</v>

868
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.170
<v Speaker 3>translates to right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>translates to far,</v>

869
00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:14.004
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>translates to outright translates to </v>

870
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:19.230
<v Speaker 3>white supremacist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>translates to Neo Nazi,</v>

871
00:45:19.231 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 3>translates to Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

872
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:25.740
<v Speaker 3>And so you have these very strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>chains on the left were Republican,</v>

873
00:45:25.741 --> 00:45:27.830
<v Speaker 3>keeps bleeding into Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

874
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Because of this very weird thing.</v>

875
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:31.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

876
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 3>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said you didn't vote Democrat.</v>

877
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 3>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I say that you're right wing.</v>

878
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:36.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean your far right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

879
00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically outright,</v>

880
00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.300
<v Speaker 3>she's holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

881
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:43.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved somebody who's a country club </v>

882
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Republican into being a Capo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a agent,</v>

883
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:49.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and does not necessarily mean white </v>

884
00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 3>supremacists are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they conveniently glued those two things</v>

885
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Richard Spencer,</v>

886
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>considers himself all right.</v>

887
00:45:58.741 --> 00:46:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he coined outright so,</v>

888
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:02.903
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideas,</v>

889
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:03.743
<v Speaker 3>white supremacy with a human face and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human faces as opposed to wildland a </v>

890
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.340
<v Speaker 3>goat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

891
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.660
<v Speaker 3>he was trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to change the,</v>

892
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.983
<v Speaker 3>it was trying to come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendlier version of Nazi or a white </v>

893
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:18.950
<v Speaker 3>supremacist Solaris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

894
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:24.110
<v Speaker 3>And so at some level that was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting intellectual master stroke,</v>

895
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.630
<v Speaker 3>but then alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became the play thing.</v>

896
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.561
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

897
00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:33.561
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people who are tired of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>told what to think and who to be started</v>

898
00:46:34.381 --> 00:46:35.214
<v Speaker 3>blurring these distinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you've got this frog and </v>

899
00:46:38.311 --> 00:46:41.550
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you put a hat on the frog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's the Nazi hat,</v>

900
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:43.290
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the trump hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

901
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:45.330
<v Speaker 3>And so the whole idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

902
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.373
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those of us who got used to those </v>

903
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:53.811
<v Speaker 3>lines that we do not cross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were major transgressions to other</v>

904
00:46:55.621 --> 00:46:56.401
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

905
00:46:56.401 --> 00:46:58.380
<v Speaker 3>well why should there be a rule about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>frog?</v>

906
00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.333
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have this crazy discussion </v>

907
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.560
<v Speaker 3>where you have people with terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>insidious intent,</v>

908
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:06.743
<v Speaker 3>people who are just clowning around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody is mixed in in a way that </v>

909
00:47:10.321 --> 00:47:11.730
<v Speaker 3>nobody can sort out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

910
00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Like the frog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Keck,</v>

911
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

912
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you really pay attention and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's been some sort of a study </v>

913
00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:22.410
<v Speaker 3>done on what percentage of the frog is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually used for,</v>

914
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump or racism or outright.</v>

915
00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 3>And what percentage of the frog is used </v>
<v Speaker 3>just for goof.</v>

916
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:32.900
<v Speaker 3>It's the vast majority is like feels </v>
<v Speaker 3>good man type things.</v>

917
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:37.090
<v Speaker 3>But like maybe seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get sent to many Nazi frogs during the</v>

918
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:38.590
<v Speaker 3>election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been sent a few,</v>

919
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:39.843
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anybody could make one make a Nazi </v>

920
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:45.840
<v Speaker 3>and people have made this mickey mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

921
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:46.953
<v Speaker 3>we didn't use to like there's still a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of stigma around reproducing </v>

922
00:47:52.961 --> 00:47:53.794
<v Speaker 3>swastikas with the color scheme and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>orientation of the Third Reich to have </v>

923
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:00.620
<v Speaker 3>you seen that the gay folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what?</v>

924
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.473
<v Speaker 3>For a very short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to co op the swastika and </v>

925
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:06.490
<v Speaker 3>turned into a rainbow swastika.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take it back.</v>

926
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.413
<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

927
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.460
<v Speaker 3>when you go to India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

928
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.620
<v Speaker 3>You have the swastikas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

929
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.560
<v Speaker 3>pointing the other direction with dots </v>
<v Speaker 3>in them.</v>

930
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.020
<v Speaker 3>And so if you come from an American </v>
<v Speaker 3>context,</v>

931
00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:19.750
<v Speaker 3>you're just fucking triggered all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>place up here.</v>

932
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 3>There's a place in Chatsworth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

933
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:24.243
<v Speaker 3>that is in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very old Indian temple that has </v>

934
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:30.110
<v Speaker 3>swastikas on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a large sign but it's not.</v>

935
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 3>It's reverse swastika is a large sign </v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining,</v>

936
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:34.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

937
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:38.410
<v Speaker 3>this is an ancient Hindu symbol and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had it for a long time and longer.</v>

938
00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

939
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:41.740
<v Speaker 3>my guess I haven't looked at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the etymology,</v>

940
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 3>but I would guess that swag comes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful in Sanskrit or something.</v>

941
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.630
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

942
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:48.483
<v Speaker 3>the question about who does assemble </v>
<v Speaker 3>belong to and when is an inexorable and </v>

943
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:57.260
<v Speaker 3>when is it an extra bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when is it a,</v>

944
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.143
<v Speaker 3>like that symmetry pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no question that you might find </v>

945
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:04.750
<v Speaker 3>that symmetry pattern in nature or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

946
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.800
<v Speaker 3>in like ninth century Islamic art </v>
<v Speaker 3>architecture or something.</v>

947
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

948
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:11.230
<v Speaker 3>the hexagon they found on top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter,</v>

949
00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.420
<v Speaker 3>remember that the storm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

950
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.550
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was a swastika,</v>

951
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:20.110
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine instead of a hexagon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a swastika on top of Jupiter.</v>

952
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ you think is really take at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter was a Saturday.</v>

953
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Was it Saturday?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter might've been saturn there,</v>

954
00:49:28.581 --> 00:49:31.240
<v Speaker 3>but there was some very bizarre pattern </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern.</v>

955
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.590
<v Speaker 3>That's a very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

956
00:49:32.591 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 3>But it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's uniform.</v>

957
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:36.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like pretty close to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual hexagon.</v>

958
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:40.880
<v Speaker 3>I believe so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

959
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.533
<v Speaker 3>it is very weird that we get so wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in symbols and symbols are so huge </v>

960
00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:47.524
<v Speaker 3>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they are efficient compressions and </v>

961
00:49:49.991 --> 00:49:51.480
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

962
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.670
<v Speaker 3>and then you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

963
00:49:54.671 --> 00:49:59.671
<v Speaker 3>assemble like you can lose the name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

964
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's calling a kid's Dick was gay,</v>

965
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:05.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get it used to be gay old time.</v>

966
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 3>The flintstones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a gay old time.</v>

967
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:07.743
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the last uses of gay in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that my grandfather claimed that the </v>

968
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 3>emotion of gaiety was lost with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

969
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 3>He claimed that there was actually an </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion that went with it,</v>

970
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.140
<v Speaker 3>but no one actually experiences anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

971
00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how does he describe it?</v>

972
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:27.340
<v Speaker 3>That it was a sort of a careless </v>
<v Speaker 3>frivolity</v>

973
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 2>that had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a certain,</v>

974
00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:30.854
<v Speaker 2>sort of a combination of like innocence </v>
<v Speaker 2>tinge with a little bit of a mischief </v>

975
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:42.080
<v Speaker 2>like sexual mischief really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

976
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:42.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we become aware of words that opened </v>

977
00:50:45.851 --> 00:50:48.930
<v Speaker 2>up new territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the concept of Synack,</v>

978
00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Thai and lots of people go through </v>

979
00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Thailand come back and they need the </v>
<v Speaker 2>words and look,</v>

980
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 2>which is the quality of fun that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something has to have in order for it to</v>

981
00:50:59.031 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 2>be worth doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

982
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:03.680
<v Speaker 2>did you pay your electrical bill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know why there was no snuck in it,</v>

983
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

984
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.430
<v Speaker 2>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a concept or Chutzpah,</v>

985
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:11.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from Yiddish or Turkish has Yakka</v>

986
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:12.533
<v Speaker 2>Mo's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the trail of light left on the </v>

987
00:51:14.631 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 2>water by the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

988
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:20.120
<v Speaker 2>And so once you have a word for Yakima </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

989
00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard not to use it even though</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody in English speaking context knows</v>

990
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the way the word Selfie,</v>

991
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:29.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you recall when that came in,</v>

992
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:34.871
<v Speaker 2>we'd seen all these weird pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like ladies and you know,</v>

993
00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:35.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restrooms taking pictures of themselves </v>

994
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.450
<v Speaker 2>in the mirror and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is that?</v>

995
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.721
<v Speaker 2>Somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

996
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:43.040
<v Speaker 2>that's a selfie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

997
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

998
00:51:45.021 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 2>And then suddenly that word was </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

999
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 2>So once we get the symbolic compression </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes with a concept,</v>

1000
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.730
<v Speaker 1>we become pretty dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife has a friend and so stupid,</v>

1001
00:51:55.731 --> 00:51:58.100
<v Speaker 1>she has no one a selfie means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she takes,</v>

1002
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:00.830
<v Speaker 1>she uses Hashtag selfie and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else takes the picture.</v>

1003
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nature of her,</v>

1004
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.500
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't have a fucking camera in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and she's standing there with their</v>

1005
00:52:06.501 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Speaker 1>hands on her hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to joke with you.</v>

1006
00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I have definitely used that Hashtag </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfie.</v>

1007
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I've thought Selfie when it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Selfie at all.</v>

1008
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just her picture of </v>

1009
00:52:21.411 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she set up the camera.</v>

1010
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm the Asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1011
00:52:24.051 --> 00:52:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a selfie?</v>

1012
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 1>If you put a timer on a camera and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepped back and will fuck me.</v>

1013
00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a talmudic questions of our right.</v>

1014
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's got a.</v>

1015
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:37.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you just have a husband that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so dominant,</v>

1016
00:52:37.251 --> 00:52:39.660
<v Speaker 1>just sit around and take pictures of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can put them on instagram.</v>

1017
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1018
00:52:40.381 --> 00:52:41.214
<v Speaker 1>you basically programmed itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a program monkey that'll take </v>

1019
00:52:43.581 --> 00:52:44.930
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extend itself.</v>

1020
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:52:46.731 --> 00:52:47.564
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1022
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:48.763
<v Speaker 1>if you shoot a pheasant and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog that will fetch that bird and bring </v>

1023
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:53.570
<v Speaker 1>it back to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still shot the bird a pheasant?</v>

1024
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1026
00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1027
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.550
<v Speaker 1>you flushed the birds out with dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birds go up in the air,</v>

1028
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.220
<v Speaker 1>they shoot them out with a shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birds hit the ground,</v>

1029
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.780
<v Speaker 1>the dog gets it and brings it back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1030
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:07.210
<v Speaker 1>But you shot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they only call them </v>

1032
00:53:09.291 --> 00:53:11.090
<v Speaker 1>retrievers and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1033
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1034
00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're learning a lot of shit.</v>

1035
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just go over all we covered.</v>

1036
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:19.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no quiz,</v>

1037
00:53:19.851 --> 00:53:20.684
<v Speaker 1>but we recovered why we're moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a fucking earthquake </v>

1038
00:53:23.661 --> 00:53:25.880
<v Speaker 1>going on on the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1039
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Indian music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cephalopods sneaker males,</v>

1040
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.010
<v Speaker 1>sneaker sneaker males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know so many things I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about.</v>

1042
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:38.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a common thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody kind of knows that's what</v>

1043
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:40.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of male feminists are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1044
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:44.300
<v Speaker 1>like sneaker males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like sliding in closer proximity to</v>

1045
00:53:44.301 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 1>the females by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1046
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:51.321
<v Speaker 1>by trying to sort of as pals some ideals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they think would be more attractive</v>

1047
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:54.450
<v Speaker 1>to the females because they don't find </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in nature.</v>

1048
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the problem is that the </v>

1049
00:53:57.841 --> 00:53:58.674
<v Speaker 1>ambulatory window comes along and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly there's a desire for something </v>

1050
00:54:01.261 --> 00:54:03.430
<v Speaker 1>completely different and they go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some biker right?</v>

1051
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Immediately it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened with that?</v>

1052
00:54:05.401 --> 00:54:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1053
00:54:06.301 --> 00:54:08.880
<v Speaker 1>It was strangely appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1054
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 1>it's that fucking gene poll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1055
00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.450
<v Speaker 1>the Goddamn genetics they've got us put.</v>

1056
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It is really amazing how we're conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>

1057
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:21.120
<v Speaker 1>we're aware of all these issues that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with,</v>

1058
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:21.954
<v Speaker 1>but yet we're still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still at the firm to a certain </v>

1059
00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:29.170
<v Speaker 1>extent at the whim of these genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these,</v>

1060
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.043
<v Speaker 1>these poles that we have inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the argument that people </v>

1061
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:38.481
<v Speaker 1>always make for why some people find </v>
<v Speaker 1>like subsistence living,</v>

1062
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:39.444
<v Speaker 1>like those shows in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So oddly comforting you ever see those </v>

1063
00:54:42.481 --> 00:54:46.950
<v Speaker 1>shows is you're really close with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that brought you here.</v>

1064
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:47.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Alaska,</v>

1065
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:49.730
<v Speaker 1>the final frontier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that show notes,</v>

1066
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:50.603
<v Speaker 1>folks just live up in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually related to that woman </v>

1067
00:54:54.931 --> 00:54:57.330
<v Speaker 1>jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that beautiful singer jewel?</v>

1068
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.253
<v Speaker 1>Remember some amazing voice and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is related to those folks that live </v>

1069
00:55:02.851 --> 00:55:07.350
<v Speaker 1>in Alaska and they have this show where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they live mean they live way the fuck up</v>

1070
00:55:07.351 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 1>there with nobody around them.</v>

1071
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:12.540
<v Speaker 1>They are literally in just bumfuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere,</v>

1072
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Alaska to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's oddly comforting.</v>

1073
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd love those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I love those shows.</v>

1074
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:23.330
<v Speaker 1>What really do I think you might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see you doing that,</v>

1075
00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.970
<v Speaker 1>delivered like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

1076
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to do it in little bursts.</v>

1077
00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy a movie theater,</v>

1078
00:55:28.771 --> 00:55:30.780
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a highway.</v>

1079
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I like to drive cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1080
00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy television.</v>

1081
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I like cooking in a home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked doing that.</v>

1082
00:55:39.151 --> 00:55:39.984
<v Speaker 1>I like sitting down with electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like all the trappings of </v>

1083
00:55:42.691 --> 00:55:45.630
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do enjoy going to nature.</v>

1084
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I have no desire to be a trapper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

1085
00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying around in a Bush plane,</v>

1086
00:55:50.911 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>landing places and checking my steel </v>
<v Speaker 1>traps for minx and stuff.</v>

1087
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the folks.</v>

1088
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that her in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

1089
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Super Old picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is she one of them?</v>

1090
00:56:00.841 --> 00:56:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Is she the girl with the red sweater?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1091
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:06.250
<v Speaker 1>probably I forget the name of the family</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

1092
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1093
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is it.</v>

1094
00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean these fucking people,</v>

1095
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:12.630
<v Speaker 1>they make their own houses up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

1096
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:16.860
<v Speaker 1>And somehow or another she escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She probably lives in Venice now.</v>

1097
00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Arch Nemesis is this guy,</v>

1098
00:56:21.121 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Garrett Lee see lives in Maui.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1099
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Why you guys?</v>

1100
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Arch Nemesis is you don't have one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1101
00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should totally get one.</v>

1102
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.680
<v Speaker 3>What are they good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1103
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:30.514
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of billionaires for cotton to have </v>

1104
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 3>an arch nemesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to movies about arch nemeses.</v>

1105
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the plural is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

1106
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.150
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely one of these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost nobody has.</v>

1107
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.900
<v Speaker 3>And your arch nemesis has to be somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>

1108
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:43.743
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there is tension that there should </v>

1109
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:47.420
<v Speaker 3>only be one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1110
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an,</v>

1111
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.230
<v Speaker 3>there should only be one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a tribal guy.</v>

1112
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:51.723
<v Speaker 3>I think you should gather up as many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are like you and support </v>

1113
00:56:54.101 --> 00:56:55.080
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1114
00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 3>you do end up supporting your economics </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you keep each other going.</v>

1115
00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's some sort of a way,</v>

1116
00:56:59.651 --> 00:57:00.484
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1117
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean definitely.</v>

1118
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.990
<v Speaker 3>We definitely need some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

1119
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:06.580
<v Speaker 3>I definitely believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>

1120
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:11.610
<v Speaker 3>my arch nemesis took me out into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>jungles of northern Mali.</v>

1121
00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought so really?</v>

1122
00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.770
<v Speaker 3>We wonder if you have an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

1123
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to go hiking?</v>

1124
00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck bro.</v>

1125
00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1126
00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 3>I was down for it because I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

1127
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:25.420
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that he's the one is coming</v>

1128
00:57:25.421 --> 00:57:26.110
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1129
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:26.870
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on this trail and um,</v>

1131
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.600
<v Speaker 3>we're visiting this phd mathematician in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jungles.</v>

1132
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:39.100
<v Speaker 3>It is without question the most mosquito</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridden place I've ever been.</v>

1133
00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1134
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:43.360
<v Speaker 3>it's unlivable now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has some incredible rainforest.</v>

1135
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.253
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we get out along this trail hike </v>

1136
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:51.180
<v Speaker 3>like a mile or two in and this guy has </v>
<v Speaker 3>built Shangrila.</v>

1137
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.270
<v Speaker 3>He's taken this river and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1138
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.870
<v Speaker 3>he's been there for like 25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

1139
00:57:55.871 --> 00:57:56.704
<v Speaker 3>40 years and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like a phd in differential </v>

1140
00:57:59.561 --> 00:58:00.220
<v Speaker 3>geometry.</v>

1141
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.053
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He like lives into this amazing jury in </v>

1142
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:07.780
<v Speaker 3>tree fruit Durian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

1143
00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that stinky fruit.</v>

1144
00:58:09.271 --> 00:58:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would he do that?</v>

1145
00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:11.973
<v Speaker 3>Because if you've ever had great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the great pleasures of </v>

1146
00:58:14.171 --> 00:58:15.660
<v Speaker 3>life really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

1147
00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.380
<v Speaker 3>So it stinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it tastes good.</v>

1148
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like limburger cheese.</v>

1149
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1150
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.630
<v Speaker 3>That's a good analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

1151
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:27.010
<v Speaker 3>this guy has built this solitary world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that nobody is watching,</v>

1152
00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:27.893
<v Speaker 3>like it's a performance for one and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this naturally sculpted wonderland </v>

1153
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.243
<v Speaker 3>that he lives in with all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes that he doesn't notice under </v>

1154
00:58:38.291 --> 00:58:40.150
<v Speaker 3>his diary entries where you can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematics.</v>

1155
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Why does he not notice him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has.</v>

1156
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Because you've been there for 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can't.</v>

1158
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.610
<v Speaker 3>You can't focus on that for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needs to get one of those.</v>

1159
00:58:48.611 --> 00:58:50.800
<v Speaker 3>A thermo sells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen those things?</v>

1160
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're amazing.</v>

1161
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to anywhere where the </v>

1162
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.740
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes are particularly aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>because like if you go to a Alaska,</v>

1163
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:01.940
<v Speaker 3>if you've been to Alaska before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>

1164
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:07.110
<v Speaker 3>one thing about Alaska that's fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the mosquitoes are fucking rabid.</v>

1165
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.553
<v Speaker 3>They are like pit polls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and my friend Ari went fishing in </v>

1166
00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:14.580
<v Speaker 3>Alaska and I am not exaggerating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1167
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:15.410
<v Speaker 3>we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1168
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:16.243
<v Speaker 3>we spread ourselves up with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible chemicals that probably took a </v>

1169
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:21.470
<v Speaker 3>year off my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you step out of the car,</v>

1170
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1171
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.510
<v Speaker 6>mean when we opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at that,</v>

1172
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:24.344
<v Speaker 6>that's like legitimately what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We opened up the door to the car and </v>

1173
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:35.260
<v Speaker 6>within three to five seconds there was </v>
<v Speaker 6>100 mosquitoes inside the car.</v>

1174
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:39.050
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking insane because they're only</v>
<v Speaker 6>alive for like a month,</v>

1175
00:59:39.051 --> 00:59:39.884
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's only warm enough for them to exist </v>

1176
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:43.520
<v Speaker 6>for a short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they're insanely aggressive.</v>

1177
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:44.623
<v Speaker 6>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this product called thermacell </v>

1178
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 6>that outdoors people use and what it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>is it's like a small pad that looks like</v>

1179
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:51.824
<v Speaker 6>a large square,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like piece of gum or something like </v>

1180
00:59:53.631 --> 00:59:54.464
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you slide this blue pad under this </v>

1181
00:59:57.021 --> 01:00:00.380
<v Speaker 6>screen and then you ignite it by </v>
<v Speaker 6>pressing a button.</v>

1182
01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:01.214
<v Speaker 6>This little heating element goes off and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it has like a little fuel canister that </v>

1183
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.350
<v Speaker 6>keeps this very tiny fire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's immensely small.</v>

1184
01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 6>You have to look into see if it's lit </v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1185
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.520
<v Speaker 6>It's probably not even a fire.</v>

1186
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 6>It's like somehow or another element is </v>
<v Speaker 6>heating up this fuel.</v>

1187
01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 6>It takes a long time to go through a </v>
<v Speaker 6>small canister,</v>

1188
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:22.670
<v Speaker 6>but it emits this very fine mist and </v>
<v Speaker 6>this missed.</v>

1189
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:23.504
<v Speaker 6>We'll keep a like an 18 square foot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get out window of protection from Ms </v>

1190
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.570
<v Speaker 6>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

1191
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.433
<v Speaker 6>It is impossible to be in the outdoors </v>
<v Speaker 6>with it without it rather once you've </v>

1192
01:00:34.401 --> 01:00:35.130
<v Speaker 6>had it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1193
01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:35.670
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1194
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.890
<v Speaker 6>I've found out about it from a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1195
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:39.570
<v Speaker 6>my friends in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1196
01:00:39.571 --> 01:00:39.951
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were,</v>

1197
01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:40.784
<v Speaker 6>the first turned me on about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They live in Alberta and the same thing </v>

1198
01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:43.304
<v Speaker 6>in Alberta that mosquitoes are super,</v>
<v Speaker 6>super aggressive because it's only warm </v>

1199
01:00:45.591 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 6>enough for them to exist for short </v>
<v Speaker 6>period of time.</v>

1200
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm so glad I did the show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

1201
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.760
<v Speaker 6>Thermacell is amazing and you can strap </v>
<v Speaker 6>them to your hip.</v>

1202
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 6>You just put one on right there and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't even smell it.</v>

1203
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:58.250
<v Speaker 6>And the mosquitoes don't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing to do with it.</v>

1204
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.170
<v Speaker 6>They just keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They try some,</v>

1205
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.350
<v Speaker 6>like really aggressive ones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go,</v>

1206
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.890
<v Speaker 6>you motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna give up.</v>

1207
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:04.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing.</v>

1208
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 6>It makes a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>being in the woods incredibly bearable.</v>

1209
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:11.240
<v Speaker 6>Like a meet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My daughters wanted to go camping in the</v>

1210
01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:13.440
<v Speaker 6>back yard one night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was bugs out there and I said,</v>

1211
01:01:13.441 --> 01:01:14.420
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got the solution now.</v>

1212
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 6>When I got my thermacell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let that sucker put it there.</v>

1213
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:20.510
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's a alcohol sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just no problems at all.</v>

1214
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:22.930
<v Speaker 6>Bugs and civilians can purchase this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1215
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 6>well it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not toxic,</v>

1216
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:28.190
<v Speaker 6>but it's super easy to use.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it right there.</v>

1217
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that.</v>

1218
01:01:29.241 --> 01:01:34.090
<v Speaker 6>Thanks to that blue thing in the top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a piece of the thermacell,</v>

1219
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.963
<v Speaker 6>the chewing gum looking stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These slide under that screen and when </v>

1220
01:01:37.671 --> 01:01:40.640
<v Speaker 6>it gets used up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that blue thing becomes all white.</v>

1221
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.550
<v Speaker 6>It's so easy to use mat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go to like,</v>

1222
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:44.623
<v Speaker 6>come check it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just to say that they have a large one </v>

1223
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:47.870
<v Speaker 6>there that looks like a lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See that one?</v>

1224
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 6>That looks like a lamp up there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking dude.</v>

1225
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:53.120
<v Speaker 6>Those things are the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate mosquitoes.</v>

1226
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 6>Oh thermacell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So way to go.</v>

1227
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.460
<v Speaker 6>I mean I don't look google the negative </v>
<v Speaker 6>consequences.</v>

1228
01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:00.080
<v Speaker 6>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>See that one?</v>

1229
01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:00.943
<v Speaker 6>He's got like pouches on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>container and one pound she would have </v>

1230
01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Speaker 6>like your little extra fuel canisters </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the other side.</v>

1231
01:02:07.881 --> 01:02:10.910
<v Speaker 6>You'd probably have some of those little</v>
<v Speaker 6>extra thermacell paths,</v>

1232
01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:13.490
<v Speaker 6>but one little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those little blue things last for</v>

1233
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:14.324
<v Speaker 6>like eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I mean one of the great questions is </v>

1234
01:02:18.621 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 6>some of the most beautiful land,</v>

1235
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place like Maui is mosquito ridden.</v>

1236
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And so if some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that worked,</v>

1237
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>could you change the land value?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to burn them all the time and</v>

1238
01:02:28.771 --> 01:02:29.604
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's something you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to breathe in all the time and I just </v>

1239
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:32.514
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about negative </v>

1240
01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>consequences but I've used them a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of times and they've never even given me</v>

1241
01:02:37.801 --> 01:02:38.634
<v Speaker 1>a headache or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out if whatever's in thermacell is </v>

1242
01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>like safe for long term exposure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to use in a confined</v>

1243
01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1244
01:02:46.581 --> 01:02:47.414
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there is some sort of stuff </v>

1245
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.164
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously breathing in for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but permanent permit then than parent </v>

1246
01:02:53.741 --> 01:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how come.</v>

1247
01:02:55.591 --> 01:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1248
01:02:56.941 --> 01:03:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I've asked this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we were kids and you read comic</v>

1249
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like radiation,</v>

1250
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.430
<v Speaker 1>they always helped people turn people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into fucking superheroes.</v>

1251
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never hear that shit in real life.</v>

1252
01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.300
<v Speaker 1>You have to get lucky and get some hobby</v>
<v Speaker 1>attic mutations.</v>

1253
01:03:11.301 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 1>So you've got like straight arms coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your head and never does anything</v>

1254
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:16.760
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1255
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 1>no mutations in bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really cool.</v>

1256
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1257
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:21.343
<v Speaker 1>and bugs that I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in human beings like I mean I guess or </v>

1258
01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:28.200
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese experimented with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

1259
01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.100
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing about crispr that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to bring up earlier for sure.</v>

1260
01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.030
<v Speaker 1>They're doing that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making humans.</v>

1261
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:34.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the thing about like </v>

1262
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.833
<v Speaker 1>having this ethical moral stance on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of something like crisper to </v>

1263
01:03:42.031 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 1>genetically alter fetus that if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1264
01:03:45.871 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you've really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1265
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>if you have an opposition to altering </v>
<v Speaker 1>embryos,</v>

1266
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:51.653
<v Speaker 1>that's immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something we want to be a part </v>

1267
01:03:53.431 --> 01:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1268
01:03:54.451 --> 01:03:56.190
<v Speaker 1>but that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They already passed that.</v>

1269
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>The Russians don't give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1270
01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a ICARUS.</v>

1271
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:03.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

1272
01:04:03.001 --> 01:04:04.280
<v Speaker 1>You have to see that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right sir?</v>

1273
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Bryan Fogel on last week who is </v>

1274
01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:11.910
<v Speaker 1>the director and producer of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary on the doping,</v>

1275
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.490
<v Speaker 1>the Russian state sponsored doping </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

1276
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Russians don't play dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't play.</v>

1277
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>They had a state sponsored doping </v>
<v Speaker 1>program that was kind of overseen by,</v>

1278
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.120
<v Speaker 1>by Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like down the line,</v>

1279
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:24.954
<v Speaker 1>like there's a direct chain of command </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole entire Russian team is so </v>

1280
01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:29.970
<v Speaker 1>cheap was on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

1281
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.440
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who engineered the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the main scientist is in the United</v>

1282
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.780
<v Speaker 1>States now under protective custody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding.</v>

1283
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:38.063
<v Speaker 1>And Putin is trying to drag them back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia by stealing the homes from his </v>

1284
01:04:43.051 --> 01:04:45.240
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing his wives home,</v>

1285
01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:46.074
<v Speaker 1>turned him into homeless people in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a lure to get him to sacrifice </v>

1286
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:52.860
<v Speaker 1>himself to come back for the health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety of his family.</v>

1287
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:54.103
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what happened when?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit down that it didn't work out so </v>

1288
01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cell phone video,</v>

1289
01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:02.460
<v Speaker 1>that's when you know you fucked up cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

1290
01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Video footage of your execution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1291
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saddam's execution.</v>

1292
01:05:05.821 --> 01:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>But I think he learned his son and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>son in laws back,</v>

1293
01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:10.951
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>

1294
01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:13.100
<v Speaker 1>it's all forgiven than the southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Illinois came back and then.</v>

1295
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the,</v>

1296
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty skilled in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1297
01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:17.891
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1298
01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

1299
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.890
<v Speaker 2>was a different situation then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1300
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:20.221
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1301
01:05:20.221 --> 01:05:20.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1302
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:21.320
<v Speaker 2>The self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1303
01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.193
<v Speaker 2>even though that was a very strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation because he actually was the </v>

1304
01:05:25.091 --> 01:05:25.924
<v Speaker 2>only guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had his shit together when he was </v>

1305
01:05:27.641 --> 01:05:29.890
<v Speaker 2>being executed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He understood the game.</v>

1306
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:31.880
<v Speaker 2>He accepted the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got it right.</v>

1307
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:33.820
<v Speaker 2>But also he's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1308
01:05:33.821 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 2>How many people did I kill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the,</v>

1309
01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I think after you've killed like a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred thousand people,</v>

1310
01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:40.360
<v Speaker 2>you probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably deserve it.</v>

1311
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1312
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1313
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I know you've ever seen a Christopher </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitchens.</v>

1314
01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:51.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm narrating the original bath party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1315
01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to call it.</v>

1316
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.983
<v Speaker 2>Theatrical video where like half the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bath party was called out as being </v>

1317
01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:01.383
<v Speaker 2>revealed traders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other half of the bath </v>

1318
01:06:02.801 --> 01:06:03.634
<v Speaker 2>party was giving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given side arms with which to execute </v>

1319
01:06:05.591 --> 01:06:06.424
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making them complicit in the founding </v>

1320
01:06:07.361 --> 01:06:07.990
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>

1321
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 2>And there was all filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1322
01:06:10.151 --> 01:06:10.984
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know that Christopher </v>

1323
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 2>hitchens narrated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1324
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:17.800
<v Speaker 2>he did something where he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brought it to prominence,</v>

1325
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:18.773
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was aware of it with just </v>

1326
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Arabic and I couldn't tell what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1327
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And then he actually said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1328
01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:26.800
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to appreciate.</v>

1329
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.273
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a topic that I think would be </v>

1330
01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:31.450
<v Speaker 2>good to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I've ever talked about</v>

1331
01:06:31.451 --> 01:06:32.284
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but message violence is the glue that </v>

1332
01:06:35.261 --> 01:06:36.094
<v Speaker 2>keeps a lot of societies together and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't study it or talk about violence </v>

1333
01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 2>that is specifically constructed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>theatrical.</v>

1334
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm like public beheadings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1335
01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.513
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be it kind of message </v>

1336
01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:54.140
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1337
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:58.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or for example,</v>

1338
01:06:58.091 --> 01:06:58.924
<v Speaker 2>forcing families to pay for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ammunition with which their family </v>

1339
01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:08.410
<v Speaker 2>members were executed to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicit and emphasize their weakness.</v>

1340
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:09.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the stuff that the mind goes to </v>

1341
01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:16.800
<v Speaker 2>horror movies to explore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1342
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.400
<v Speaker 2>is often used structurally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1343
01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:22.540
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1344
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:23.320
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1345
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1346
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:25.923
<v Speaker 2>the Jordanian pilot video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I find that many people haven't </v>

1347
01:07:29.531 --> 01:07:30.364
<v Speaker 2>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole point of it was that the </v>

1348
01:07:33.371 --> 01:07:36.730
<v Speaker 2>pilots were raining down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death into particular forms,</v>

1349
01:07:36.731 --> 01:07:37.564
<v Speaker 2>rubble and fire when people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and isis captured one of the </v>

1350
01:07:43.571 --> 01:07:44.404
<v Speaker 2>Jordanian pilots and decided that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would theatrically execute him with a </v>

1351
01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:51.600
<v Speaker 2>version of exactly these two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1352
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:53.103
<v Speaker 2>that he was meeting out from the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the whole point of it was to </v>

1353
01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.570
<v Speaker 2>create the cinematic imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1354
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:02.583
<v Speaker 2>to sear into people's mind what it meant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to oppose isis that isis was in fact </v>

1355
01:08:05.801 --> 01:08:09.580
<v Speaker 2>just in a sort of eye for an eye kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1356
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1357
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:13.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my belief is,</v>

1358
01:08:13.251 --> 01:08:15.340
<v Speaker 2>is that we don't understand</v>

1359
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:20.930
<v Speaker 6>the role that message violence plays in </v>
<v Speaker 6>part because we are now denying it.</v>

1360
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.793
<v Speaker 6>If you think about Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have all of these images that were </v>

1361
01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:25.334
<v Speaker 6>burned into all of our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm with Pulitzer Prize winning </v>

1362
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 6>photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in the modern era,</v>

1363
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 6>you don't have images like that from </v>
<v Speaker 6>Iraq because there was a,</v>

1364
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.030
<v Speaker 6>there was a decision that we could not </v>
<v Speaker 6>afford in some sense,</v>

1365
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:42.403
<v Speaker 6>to have the kind of opposition that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>had to Vietnam when people suddenly </v>

1366
01:08:44.811 --> 01:08:45.590
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

1367
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:47.270
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing what in my name.</v>

1368
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.570
<v Speaker 6>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an issue that has always puzzled</v>

1369
01:08:50.571 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this issue is people that lean left,</v>

1370
01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:59.930
<v Speaker 6>people that consider themselves </v>
<v Speaker 6>progressives have a very distinct,</v>

1371
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:04.960
<v Speaker 6>very obvious bias against criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 6>Islam,</v>

1372
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.553
<v Speaker 6>criticizing Islamic terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>criticizing a Islamic suppression of </v>

1373
01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:13.240
<v Speaker 6>women.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1374
01:09:13.241 --> 01:09:16.850
<v Speaker 6>that these criticizing these cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1375
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:21.230
<v Speaker 6>under the guise of not wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 6>promote Islamophobia and things on those</v>

1376
01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:21.680
<v Speaker 6>lines.</v>

1377
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.070
<v Speaker 6>And I've always wondered how much of </v>
<v Speaker 6>what that is,</v>

1378
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.113
<v Speaker 6>is a fear of reprisal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of speaking out against them is </v>

1379
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:32.444
<v Speaker 6>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what they do instead is embraced the </v>

1380
01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.433
<v Speaker 6>cultural differences that these people </v>
<v Speaker 6>exhibit concentrate instead on the </v>

1381
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:46.070
<v Speaker 6>positive aspects of their community.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the good things about Muslim culture</v>

1382
01:09:46.071 --> 01:09:50.180
<v Speaker 6>and Islamic culture and not really does </v>
<v Speaker 6>not bring it up at all.</v>

1383
01:09:50.181 --> 01:09:51.014
<v Speaker 6>Like you very rarely hear people on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>left talk about how oppressive and </v>

1384
01:09:55.701 --> 01:10:00.080
<v Speaker 6>horrific some of the conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 6>women and homosexuals are forced to live</v>

1385
01:10:00.081 --> 01:10:00.821
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

1386
01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:02.180
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Muslim cultures.</v>

1387
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:03.263
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I've always wondered if that's what </v>

1388
01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:04.964
<v Speaker 6>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a fee because no one in </v>

1389
01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 6>modern day and no one ideology is more </v>
<v Speaker 6>brutal in there reprisal.</v>

1390
01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:13.790
<v Speaker 6>I mean they kill apostates,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1391
01:10:13.791 --> 01:10:15.830
<v Speaker 6>They killed people who leave.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you join,</v>

1392
01:10:15.831 --> 01:10:17.780
<v Speaker 6>you can join.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one's stopping them.</v>

1393
01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:18.140
<v Speaker 6>They're all.</v>

1394
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:23.140
<v Speaker 6>The whole idea of spreading Islam is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you should be proselytizing.</v>

1395
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:28.790
<v Speaker 6>You should be getting people to join </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it is the only truth is the only</v>

1396
01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:31.870
<v Speaker 6>way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But once you do join the urine like you,</v>

1397
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:34.910
<v Speaker 6>you're not allowed to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

1398
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:38.030
<v Speaker 6>let's actually do this one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's important,</v>

1399
01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:42.290
<v Speaker 6>but they didn't start that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We Jews started this so far as I know.</v>

1400
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.920
<v Speaker 6>So if you go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1401
01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:44.151
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1402
01:10:44.151 --> 01:10:44.984
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't.</v>

1403
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 6>We don't proselytize,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the.</v>

1404
01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:48.170
<v Speaker 6>Once you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're in a really?</v>

1405
01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you go to deuteronomy,</v>

1406
01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:53.030
<v Speaker 6>I think it says something to the effect </v>
<v Speaker 6>of if someone comes to you and says,</v>

1407
01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:53.864
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's worship God's not known to the </v>

1408
01:10:54.891 --> 01:10:57.860
<v Speaker 6>father's a set upon them with the stone </v>
<v Speaker 6>before anyone else gets there,</v>

1409
01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:03.130
<v Speaker 6>but are you supposed to do that to </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone who is already converted to?</v>

1410
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:05.700
<v Speaker 6>If you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're in,</v>

1411
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.400
<v Speaker 6>you're in and somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

1412
01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:09.860
<v Speaker 6>let's go worship other gods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're supposed to kill them,</v>

1413
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 6>but what if that was so interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1414
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 6>so it's</v>

1415
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>an old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an old idea and it's not an Islamic</v>

1416
01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Jewish idea in my opinion.</v>

1417
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does exist today,</v>

1418
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:23.063
<v Speaker 1>primarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked my rabbi about this and she </v>

1419
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.333
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

1420
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.950
<v Speaker 1>you have a female rabbi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you progressive motherfucker,</v>

1421
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you will look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:31.314
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

1423
01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of this.</v>

1424
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a rabbi who happens to be female </v>
<v Speaker 1>born female or was it one of them?</v>

1425
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>She's all woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All rabbi allegedly.</v>

1426
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:46.881
<v Speaker 1>They're all women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caitlyn Jenner's all incendiary topics.</v>

1427
01:11:46.951 --> 01:11:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1428
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:48.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1429
01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's just turn everything up to 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

1430
01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:52.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedian,</v>

1431
01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:57.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a boss in three minutes.</v>

1432
01:11:57.871 --> 01:11:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to be a target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1433
01:11:59.071 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a no targeting female rabbi.</v>

1434
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:03.840
<v Speaker 1>So her point was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1435
01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And we don't execute anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1436
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 1>because in ineffective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that portion of the code never runs.</v>

1437
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:11.543
<v Speaker 1>So the Jews have figured out how to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad code that is almost permanently </v>

1438
01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:19.320
<v Speaker 1>inoperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1439
01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.653
<v Speaker 1>If I could stop you there for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the unique things about Jews is </v>

1440
01:12:24.091 --> 01:12:24.924
<v Speaker 1>that there are so many Jewish people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know that it's still considered </v>

1441
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:30.900
<v Speaker 1>themselves Jewish but are almost totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

1442
01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend Ari,</v>

1443
01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.240
<v Speaker 1>like he was doing this video recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>where this podcast recently and was,</v>

1444
01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.193
<v Speaker 1>we were doing this challenge where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't drink or smoke pot or do anything </v>

1445
01:12:42.451 --> 01:12:43.284
<v Speaker 1>for a month and we have to do 15 hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga classes and he's going crazy and </v>

1446
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:46.914
<v Speaker 1>screaming during his podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a Jewish performer and I live in </v>

1447
01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to be doing drugs.</v>

1448
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to be drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked drinking.</v>

1449
01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

1450
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:57.990
<v Speaker 1>he's the biggest atheist I've ever met </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life,</v>

1451
01:12:58.290 --> 01:12:59.123
<v Speaker 1>or if not an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly at the very least agnostic </v>

1452
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:04.720
<v Speaker 1>at the very least.</v>

1453
01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.700
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely not as someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>considers himself a religious person,</v>

1454
01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.520
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1455
01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:11.363
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He escaped the clause of it when he was </v>

1456
01:13:13.081 --> 01:13:13.914
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's Jews many times think of </v>

1457
01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:17.643
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost a tribe as much as it is a </v>

1458
01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:20.280
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

1459
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:25.320
<v Speaker 1>you sit down and corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most Jews that I know about,</v>

1460
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:28.110
<v Speaker 1>like how much of the Talmud do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow?</v>

1461
01:13:28.111 --> 01:13:28.944
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of the Old Testament do you </v>

1462
01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:31.460
<v Speaker 1>think is legit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of the,</v>

1463
01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1464
01:13:32.050 --> 01:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>these teachings do you think are </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative for everyday living is.</v>

1465
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.010
<v Speaker 1>It was the vast majority don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have they,</v>

1466
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:42.810
<v Speaker 1>they're not connected to any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're following the Old Testament,</v>

1467
01:13:42.811 --> 01:13:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't recognize him as a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1468
01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to kill the apostates.</v>

1469
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.133
<v Speaker 1>I used to live in an ultra Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood in Jerusalem and at some </v>

1470
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:53.244
<v Speaker 1>point I was writing on the Sabbath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my final list for leaving and the kids </v>

1471
01:13:57.601 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 1>in the building next door started </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouting in Hebrew.</v>

1472
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It is forbidden to write on the Sabbath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill him.</v>

1473
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.073
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the parents had to kind of knock it </v>

1474
01:14:06.571 --> 01:14:07.404
<v Speaker 1>off like the ultra orthodox parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they wanted to kill you because you </v>

1475
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>were writing because it was</v>

1476
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.160
<v Speaker 3>literally that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

1477
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.850
<v Speaker 3>I was violated on a bunch of little </v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters.</v>

1478
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Now moms are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the word you're looking bastards.</v>

1479
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.073
<v Speaker 3>So Jews are big into observance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but part of the relationship is you get </v>

1481
01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:37.030
<v Speaker 3>to question things that are much deeper </v>
<v Speaker 3>level than in most religions.</v>

1482
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.013
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say six or seven rabbis well </v>

1483
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:42.550
<v Speaker 3>enough to ask the question about their </v>
<v Speaker 3>belief structure.</v>

1484
01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 3>None of them believe in the character of</v>
<v Speaker 3>God from the Old Testament.</v>

1485
01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.100
<v Speaker 3>So how do they sort of rationalized the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing?</v>

1486
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:51.963
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole point is you have </v>

1487
01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:57.460
<v Speaker 3>layers of abstraction and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1488
01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:59.470
<v Speaker 3>if you're really stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1489
01:14:59.471 --> 01:15:00.304
<v Speaker 3>do you believe that the supreme court is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nine black robed a super geniuses who </v>

1490
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 3>can channel the original intent of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>founding fathers?</v>

1491
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:08.800
<v Speaker 3>I think they're wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1492
01:15:08.801 --> 01:15:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like wizard.</v>

1493
01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:12.150
<v Speaker 3>Well then then that sounds it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1494
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:12.890
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1495
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:13.723
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a grownup way of loving your </v>

1496
01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:16.684
<v Speaker 3>country and there's a childish way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>loving your country and there's a </v>

1497
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:18.993
<v Speaker 3>grownup way of believing in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and the childish childish one </v>

1498
01:15:22.061 --> 01:15:22.841
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1499
01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:23.674
<v Speaker 3>it's all literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what is the grown up way of </v>

1500
01:15:25.001 --> 01:15:26.560
<v Speaker 3>believing in a religion?</v>

1501
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1502
01:15:29.481 --> 01:15:30.314
<v Speaker 3>in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's got a lot of hidden </v>

1503
01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:34.730
<v Speaker 3>instructions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1504
01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:36.043
<v Speaker 3>it's not resolved so that you have these</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of dialectical tensions that a sea </v>

1505
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:42.680
<v Speaker 3>of like ethical guidelines as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1506
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:45.050
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not telling you exactly what,</v>

1507
01:15:45.051 --> 01:15:47.600
<v Speaker 3>down from on high and giant stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>tablets,</v>

1508
01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.080
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1509
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:52.670
<v Speaker 3>thou shalt not kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thou shalt not kill has to go up against</v>

1510
01:15:52.671 --> 01:15:54.500
<v Speaker 3>an admission to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1511
01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:57.290
<v Speaker 3>And so these things are not resolved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1512
01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:04.250
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to swim back upstream to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your original point about Islam.</v>

1513
01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.693
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get waylaid here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you leave Israel or Jews </v>

1514
01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:10.740
<v Speaker 3>particularly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is an answer to this and I used to</v>

1515
01:16:10.741 --> 01:16:11.670
<v Speaker 3>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I forgot it.</v>

1516
01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:16.200
<v Speaker 3>What is the reason why so many European </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews have won Nobel prizes?</v>

1517
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:19.860
<v Speaker 3>So many European Jews are insanely </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>

1518
01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the modern social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer?</v>

1519
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:26.580
<v Speaker 3>It's because we cheated physics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want you that answer?</v>

1520
01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:27.900
<v Speaker 3>That's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a silly answer.</v>

1521
01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:28.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1522
01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1523
01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:31.890
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>

1524
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Why are so many insanely intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

1525
01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:40.010
<v Speaker 3>European Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>

1526
01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Is it hard for you to answer being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jew?</v>

1527
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>

1528
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Like if you asked me about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1529
01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:48.461
<v Speaker 3>well let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

1530
01:16:48.461 --> 01:16:49.540
<v Speaker 3>let's do a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1531
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from 18,</v>

1532
01:16:51.221 --> 01:16:56.221
<v Speaker 3>97 and 1987,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had all of these different countries</v>

1533
01:16:56.381 --> 01:16:57.214
<v Speaker 3>winning the Boston marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then from 1987 to the president </v>

1534
01:17:01.361 --> 01:17:06.361
<v Speaker 3>basically to Kenya and Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a Korean guy wins it or something.</v>

1535
01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1536
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 2>now you have this really uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing which is,</v>

1537
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it culture?</v>

1538
01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Is it that those guys in east Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>just have heart?</v>

1539
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Is it because they really run to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to school everyday?</v>

1540
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Twenty six miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People said that and then turns out they</v>

1541
01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:29.741
<v Speaker 2>take the bus like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there can be a genetic predisposition</v>

1542
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 2>in tradeoffs space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There can be a cultural premium.</v>

1543
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.033
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1544
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.620
<v Speaker 2>when you have the top marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>prospects,</v>

1545
01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:43.760
<v Speaker 2>do you marry them off to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the richest or the smartest?</v>

1546
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:49.750
<v Speaker 2>So in Judaism there is some weird way in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which intellectual prestige proxies for,</v>

1547
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>material wealth.</v>

1548
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.990
<v Speaker 2>So if you have somebody who's insanely </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>

1549
01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:57.853
<v Speaker 2>not very rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be very prestigious to marry </v>

1550
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.273
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1551
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.400
<v Speaker 2>your daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say to that a student of the tour.</v>

1552
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:10.720
<v Speaker 2>So there are all sorts of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange aspects of this.</v>

1553
01:18:11.361 --> 01:18:12.194
<v Speaker 2>Is it because money lending was </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribed and forbidden to Christians </v>

1554
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 2>that this particular facility with </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematics was highly selected for when</v>

1555
01:18:20.691 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 2>nobody else was selecting for it?</v>

1556
01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:24.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the answer is,</v>

1557
01:18:24.741 --> 01:18:28.820
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

1558
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:32.540
<v Speaker 2>getting a phd in mathematics using an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivy league education for that,</v>

1559
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.433
<v Speaker 2>or in my brother's case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving up an ivy league education to </v>

1560
01:18:36.741 --> 01:18:39.680
<v Speaker 2>make a point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing up for social justice.</v>

1561
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.800
<v Speaker 2>These are sort of self destructive </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in most cultures.</v>

1562
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Standing up for social justice against </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors.</v>

1563
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:48.870
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his case,</v>

1564
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:50.443
<v Speaker 2>he stood up because a Jewish fraternity </v>
<v Speaker 2>was using black strippers for sexual </v>

1565
01:18:56.691 --> 01:19:01.070
<v Speaker 2>entertainment to a lure in a incoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>freshman.</v>

1566
01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.510
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1567
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:03.440
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1568
01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:07.590
<v Speaker 2>this is some sort of class oriented </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where we're exploiting one.</v>

1569
01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:09.790
<v Speaker 2>This is a different situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1570
01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:09.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1571
01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:10.521
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:19:10.521 --> 01:19:12.350
<v Speaker 2>So he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to leave Penn,</v>

1573
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.330
<v Speaker 2>university of Pennsylvania under death </v>
<v Speaker 2>threats.</v>

1574
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1575
01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:17.591
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1576
01:19:17.591 --> 01:19:18.424
<v Speaker 2>this is the great irony of my brother's </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation is that for people who don't </v>

1577
01:19:21.921 --> 01:19:23.470
<v Speaker 2>know who your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bret Weinstein,</v>

1578
01:19:23.471 --> 01:19:23.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1579
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.470
<v Speaker 6>Is a Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Harvey Weinstein.</v>

1580
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:29.040
<v Speaker 6>Bret Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1581
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:30.223
<v Speaker 6>I'm Brett,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was the guy that was the part of the </v>

1582
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:36.920
<v Speaker 6>whole Evergreen college fiasco.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's been on this podcast twice.</v>

1583
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.280
<v Speaker 6>I suggest if you're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could either google his name and get</v>

1584
01:19:40.281 --> 01:19:41.114
<v Speaker 6>the story from a multitude of sources or</v>
<v Speaker 6>listen to the original podcast where he </v>

1585
01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.213
<v Speaker 6>sort of laid it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was before the settlement with the </v>

1586
01:19:47.871 --> 01:19:51.070
<v Speaker 6>college before he wound up leaving and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1587
01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.780
<v Speaker 6>I really hope that he goes the Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 6>Peterson route,</v>

1588
01:19:53.781 --> 01:19:58.670
<v Speaker 6>meaning that he starts putting up these </v>
<v Speaker 6>lectures and some of these ideas that he</v>

1589
01:19:58.671 --> 01:20:03.590
<v Speaker 6>has just putting them up on online.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just putting videos up and patriot.</v>

1590
01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:05.810
<v Speaker 6>I know he's got a patriot on page now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>correct?</v>

1591
01:20:05.811 --> 01:20:06.590
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that.</v>

1592
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 6>Which is a great way to do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

1593
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Jordan is making more money from doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that than he ever did.</v>

1594
01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.110
<v Speaker 3>From College.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:20:13.150 --> 01:20:15.330
<v Speaker 3>For Teaching University.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to support.</v>

1596
01:20:15.331 --> 01:20:16.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is,</v>

1597
01:20:16.291 --> 01:20:19.800
<v Speaker 3>is that we have to make the case because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't because it'll look wrong.</v>

1598
01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.653
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hire this motherfucker that </v>

1599

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:25.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a straight up genius.</v>

1601
01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:30.201
<v Speaker 3>I have a recommendation for him from his</v>
<v Speaker 3>old advisor who I think he said he's the</v>

1602
01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:31.944
<v Speaker 3>top student in 40 years of advising and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just we have to recognize that if you </v>

1603
01:20:37.501 --> 01:20:38.334
<v Speaker 3>want this stuff to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to make it not pay to drive </v>

1604
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:42.384
<v Speaker 3>super smart people who are courageous </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to be open in their thinking and </v>

1605
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:48.090
<v Speaker 3>just shared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1606
01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.393
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to share and to share their </v>

1608
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:54.330
<v Speaker 3>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fundamentally,</v>

1609
01:20:54.331 --> 01:20:57.630
<v Speaker 3>if we drive these people to extinction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's on us.</v>

1610
01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.820
<v Speaker 3>And so my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1611
01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:02.040
<v Speaker 3>University of Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard,</v>

1612
01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Princeton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanford,</v>

1613
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:04.283
<v Speaker 3>where are you?</v>

1614
01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:05.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1615
01:21:05.710 --> 01:21:07.620
<v Speaker 3>some people are terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 3>repercussions,</v>

1616
01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 3>but they think that he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a guy from evergreen state,</v>

1617
01:21:12.661 --> 01:21:16.040
<v Speaker 3>so he's lower rank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

1618
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:20.040
<v Speaker 3>let me use my tiny megaphone to say he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not lower rank.</v>

1619
01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:21.543
<v Speaker 3>He's unfucking believably smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at his work on Elongate of </v>

1620
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.903
<v Speaker 3>telomeres in laboratory animals where he</v>
<v Speaker 3>predicted what Nobel laureate Carol </v>

1621
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Greider found from first principles that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mice that are being used to test our</v>

1622
01:21:34.801 --> 01:21:38.190
<v Speaker 3>drugs have wildly exaggerated telomere </v>
<v Speaker 3>lengths.</v>

1623
01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Giving them amazing capacities for </v>
<v Speaker 3>histological repair,</v>

1624
01:21:41.851 --> 01:21:45.150
<v Speaker 3>but pop possibly putting drugs to market</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shouldn't be there.</v>

1625
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:49.470
<v Speaker 3>This is somebody you want to be taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually serious and stop treating</v>

1626
01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:50.304
<v Speaker 3>this like the clown act that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>running and this just happens to be a </v>

1627
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:55.350
<v Speaker 3>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1628
01:21:55.351 --> 01:21:56.184
<v Speaker 3>Evergreen college is an amazing example </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what can go wrong if you let these </v>

1629
01:21:59.551 --> 01:22:00.384
<v Speaker 3>crazy children sort of dictate the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are allowed to behave and </v>

1630
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:07.553
<v Speaker 3>the way discourse takes place on campus </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the cliff notes what I was going to </v>

1631
01:22:10.941 --> 01:22:13.350
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to have a day of absence.</v>

1632
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:16.140
<v Speaker 3>They've added traditionally had a day of</v>
<v Speaker 3>absence where people of color would take</v>

1633
01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 3>the day off to school for where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would miss them.</v>

1634
01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't they engineer that in La,</v>

1635
01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:22.740
<v Speaker 3>David Without Mexicans who was a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1636
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:26.460
<v Speaker 3>It would shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just tell you right now.</v>

1637
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:30.020
<v Speaker 3>LS shuts down without Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but too,</v>

1638
01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:30.893
<v Speaker 3>but instead of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social justice warrior mentality </v>

1639
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.943
<v Speaker 3>that thinks that every white man is some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of an oppressor and you need to </v>

1640
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.920
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to eradicate them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

1641
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:46.340
<v Speaker 3>They decided to go the opposite route </v>
<v Speaker 3>and force white staff and white students</v>

1642
01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:47.214
<v Speaker 3>to stay home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brother rightly protested saying </v>

1643
01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:53.440
<v Speaker 3>that is inherently racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what you're proposing is is an anti</v>

1644
01:22:53.441 --> 01:22:54.061
<v Speaker 3>racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1645
01:22:54.061 --> 01:22:54.894
<v Speaker 3>he's anti.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that the diversity </v>

1646
01:22:56.461 --> 01:22:58.740
<v Speaker 3>movement which has now become the equity</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>

1647
01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:01.350
<v Speaker 3>is actually racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist against white people.</v>

1648
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:03.120
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1649
01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to say it's reverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>racism and racism against white.</v>

1650
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.980
<v Speaker 2>It's openly racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reverse either racism or not racism.</v>

1651
01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:12.363
<v Speaker 2>That whole proposal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that racism against white people is </v>

1652
01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:15.394
<v Speaker 2>reverse race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a cult and the way you know </v>

1653
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:18.724
<v Speaker 2>that it's a cult is you ask for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of racism and if somebody </v>

1654
01:23:21.641 --> 01:23:26.641
<v Speaker 2>tells you it's power plus prejudice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore certain groups can't be racist</v>

1655
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:31.750
<v Speaker 2>because they have no power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you know somebody in the cult</v>

1656
01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.030
<v Speaker 2>because if you look it up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictionary,</v>

1657
01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:34.864
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't say anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one would be a gender has </v>

1658
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:41.800
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to the Oxford English dictionary.</v>

1659
01:23:41.801 --> 01:23:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Look at the difference between three </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus three.</v>

1660
01:23:44.471 --> 01:23:45.304
<v Speaker 2>Be a gender and sex have been closely </v>
<v Speaker 2>tied and sometime like in the 19 </v>

1661
01:23:50.261 --> 01:23:51.094
<v Speaker 2>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of fields in the US started </v>

1662
01:23:52.901 --> 01:23:53.734
<v Speaker 2>using gender to be behavior sex to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that which is your dedicated genotype </v>

1663
01:23:57.641 --> 01:23:58.474
<v Speaker 2>phenotype.</v>

1664
01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:00.043
<v Speaker 2>What what is going on is is that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are changing the definition of </v>

1665
01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:09.031
<v Speaker 2>words in order to push a cult into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact place where it must not go.</v>

1666
01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:13.990
<v Speaker 2>It must not go in the diversity office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must not go in hr.</v>

1667
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:15.783
<v Speaker 2>You cannot have this openly racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openly sexist cult in the place where </v>

1668
01:24:21.191 --> 01:24:24.640
<v Speaker 2>the which is the immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's.</v>

1669
01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:25.503
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the key thing is that we're used </v>

1670
01:24:27.011 --> 01:24:29.980
<v Speaker 2>to thinking of our immune system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being there to protect us,</v>

1671
01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:32.200
<v Speaker 2>but if you think about an auto immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

1672
01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:33.813
<v Speaker 2>it's when your immune system starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking the self that you're in real </v>

1673
01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:39.220
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So learn the signs and learn the tells.</v>

1674
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:41.770
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to sign up for Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson's postmodernism.</v>

1675
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Just ask somebody whether black people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be racist against whites and as soon</v>

1676
01:24:46.421 --> 01:24:47.254
<v Speaker 2>as you hear power plus prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're talking to a cult </v>

1677
01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:51.310
<v Speaker 2>member.</v>

1678
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:54.910
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you hear the gender and sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>have nothing to do with each other,</v>

1679
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.073
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have recourse to dictionaries </v>

1680
01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.280
<v Speaker 2>and you start talking about the history </v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody starts,</v>

1681
01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:01.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your white fragility.</v>

1682
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:04.750
<v Speaker 2>That's your white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you in denial?</v>

1683
01:25:04.751 --> 01:25:09.751
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't you accepting allyship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So suddenly it's like,</v>

1684
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:10.624
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Xenu in the volcanoes and the </v>

1685
01:25:12.071 --> 01:25:12.904
<v Speaker 2>clams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1686
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:13.940
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1687
01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:15.390
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1688
01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.393
<v Speaker 2>well one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one great piece of evidence about that </v>

1689
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:21.940
<v Speaker 2>was this whole google memo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Google memo thing,</v>

1690
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:22.833
<v Speaker 2>the difference between what that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually wrote on the memo and what was </v>

1691
01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.600
<v Speaker 2>published in so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications.</v>

1692
01:25:28.730 --> 01:25:32.410
<v Speaker 2>So many different online websites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just straight up libelous like that</v>

1693
01:25:32.411 --> 01:25:33.244
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I mean I know he's going to sue </v>

1694
01:25:34.211 --> 01:25:34.980
<v Speaker 2>google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

1695
01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.813
<v Speaker 2>He could probably sue a host of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>once he's done with that because they </v>

1696
01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:42.310
<v Speaker 2>changed what he wrote and turned him </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this horrible evil,</v>

1697
01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:43.144
<v Speaker 2>sexist person to the point where the CEO</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Google have a youtube rather was </v>

1698
01:25:47.531 --> 01:25:48.260
<v Speaker 2>saying that she.</v>

1699
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.920
<v Speaker 2>She read it and it made her sad at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing,</v>

1700
01:25:50.921 --> 01:25:51.754
<v Speaker 2>made her sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1701
01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:52.983
<v Speaker 2>he wrote up a piece based on why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>of different genders are more inclined </v>

1702
01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:01.070
<v Speaker 2>to gravitate toward specific things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You made an error how,</v>

1703
01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.190
<v Speaker 2>what was the error?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The error that he made was,</v>

1704
01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:06.470
<v Speaker 2>is that he used a reserved term </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>

1705
01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.513
<v Speaker 2>the big five personality inventory where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a reserved term denoting a </v>

1706
01:26:10.861 --> 01:26:11.694
<v Speaker 2>particular psychometric and so rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than saying men are less conscientious </v>

1707
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.870
<v Speaker 2>than women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are more neurotic,</v>

1708
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:19.783
<v Speaker 2>women are more neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually brought that up with him and </v>

1709
01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:22.064
<v Speaker 2>he regretted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He regretted bringing that because I </v>

1710
01:26:23.691 --> 01:26:24.524
<v Speaker 2>told them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that's my only criticism is like </v>

1711
01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:28.430
<v Speaker 2>that's a derogatory term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1712
01:26:29.410 --> 01:26:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quite remembered that the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>five personality inventory,</v>

1713
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:36.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his openness,</v>

1714
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:37.700
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extroversion,</v>

1715
01:26:37.701 --> 01:26:39.410
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and neuroticism.</v>

1716
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.650
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see something that careful,</v>

1717
01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean most people just didn't read it.</v>

1718
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:44.833
<v Speaker 2>They went with the headline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing you should </v>

1719
01:26:48.951 --> 01:26:52.010
<v Speaker 2>guess somebody that's smart is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>using a term,</v>

1720
01:26:52.011 --> 01:26:54.920
<v Speaker 2>if I say moral hazard to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know economics,</v>

1721
01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:55.880
<v Speaker 2>you're going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh wow,</v>

1722
01:26:55.881 --> 01:26:56.714
<v Speaker 2>what is the moral hazard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that like reefer has nothing to do </v>

1723
01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.250
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reserved term,</v>

1724
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:01.123
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I keep talking about rent seeking </v>

1725
01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:04.460
<v Speaker 2>or moral hazard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm talking about landlords,</v>

1726
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or somebody offering your kid a Doobie </v>

1727
01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.660
<v Speaker 2>afterschool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1728
01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:09.141
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1729
01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:09.974
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was like the first intellectual </v>

1730
01:27:11.271 --> 01:27:12.091
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I and I,</v>

1731
01:27:12.091 --> 01:27:12.924
<v Speaker 2>I just have been dealing with this with </v>
<v Speaker 2>or I talk about power laws and </v>

1732
01:27:15.171 --> 01:27:16.004
<v Speaker 2>statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a particular type of </v>

1733
01:27:16.911 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 2>probability distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody says,</v>

1734
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power powerful people in our country</v>

1735
01:27:22.041 --> 01:27:24.110
<v Speaker 2>are so protected and privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we,</v>

1736
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.640
<v Speaker 2>why do we need laws to protect them?</v>

1737
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1738
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.243
<v Speaker 2>you said power law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that has nothing to do with </v>

1739
01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.633
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There used to be this character on </v>

1740
01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose name was emily Latella,</v>

1741
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:40.270
<v Speaker 2>played by Gilda radner and they bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>her in and she was hard of hearing.</v>

1742
01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

1743
01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I hear about a death penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The death have problems enough as it is,</v>

1744
01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 2>and then she'd riff for two minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the death penalty.</v>

1745
01:27:48.381 --> 01:27:48.771
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1746
01:27:48.771 --> 01:27:50.240
<v Speaker 2>that's entirely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevermind.</v>

1747
01:27:50.241 --> 01:27:53.990
<v Speaker 2>So she was trying to remember like </v>
<v Speaker 2>violins on television.</v>

1748
01:27:53.991 --> 01:27:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Can you read classical music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kitchen random was awesome.</v>

1749
01:27:56.931 --> 01:27:57.890
<v Speaker 2>She was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zana,</v>

1750
01:27:57.891 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Rosanna Danna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1751
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:01.070
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't do any of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1752
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.200
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really couldn't.</v>

1753
01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:06.490
<v Speaker 2>But I'm getting back to the demore </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1754
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:10.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm just checking our tree and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploding here.</v>

1755
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:11.623
<v Speaker 2>You know the thing about what he did was</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to write a pro diversity </v>

1756
01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:18.170
<v Speaker 2>memo.</v>

1757
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:21.080
<v Speaker 2>If you lie about the differences between</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women,</v>

1758
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.943
<v Speaker 2>what are your odds that you will be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hack a solution to get getting all </v>

1759
01:28:25.581 --> 01:28:26.414
<v Speaker 2>the brilliant women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In our country who care about stem into </v>

1760
01:28:29.511 --> 01:28:31.100
<v Speaker 2>the workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we need to do.</v>

1761
01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:36.440
<v Speaker 2>There's no shortage of brilliant women </v>
<v Speaker 2>know I've collaborated with them.</v>

1762
01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I know they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out as a society do we</v>

1763
01:28:41.091 --> 01:28:41.924
<v Speaker 2>need to pay women more so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get them out of working in the home and </v>

1764
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:50.060
<v Speaker 2>taking care of older parents and young </v>
<v Speaker 2>children during their prime years.</v>

1765
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:51.013
<v Speaker 2>We need to be very creative about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual differences between men and </v>

1766
01:28:53.781 --> 01:28:54.614
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should we have a rule not equal pay for </v>

1767
01:28:56.241 --> 01:28:57.074
<v Speaker 2>equal work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but equal pay for unequal salary </v>

1768
01:28:58.611 --> 01:29:01.770
<v Speaker 2>negotiation if we don't allow ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but please,</v>

1769
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:02.663
<v Speaker 2>please elaborate on that because that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue with why women sometimes make </v>

1770
01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 2>less than men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they don't have the same sort of</v>

1771
01:29:09.361 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 2>aggressive salary negotiating tendencies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of men do.</v>

1772
01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Aggressive testosterone driven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>

1773
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of things.</v>

1774
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1775
01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to mansplain any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a big issue too.</v>

1776
01:29:21.261 --> 01:29:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at Chekhov.</v>

1777
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:24.443
<v Speaker 2>Short story called the Nincompoop in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which an employer and a domestic worker </v>

1778
01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:31.734
<v Speaker 2>in his home and he talks to her about </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of her wages and then he starts </v>

1779
01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:36.870
<v Speaker 2>taking away little bit by little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1780
01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:37.704
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you broke a cup and you were a little </v>

1781
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:39.504
<v Speaker 2>bit late and he whittles her </v>
<v Speaker 2>compensation down to nothing and she </v>

1782
01:29:42.721 --> 01:29:45.600
<v Speaker 2>accepts it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he says,</v>

1783
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:47.420
<v Speaker 2>the employer says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1784
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you stupid fool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just cheated you out of your entire</v>

1785
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:53.130
<v Speaker 2>wages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give them to you,</v>

1786
01:29:53.131 --> 01:29:53.964
<v Speaker 2>but understand that this is how an </v>
<v Speaker 2>employer cheats and employee and you're </v>

1787
01:29:57.511 --> 01:29:58.680
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1788
01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.823
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1789
01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:00.773
<v Speaker 2>an old Russian speaking a truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is don't allow yourself to get </v>

1790
01:30:04.921 --> 01:30:05.970
<v Speaker 2>taken advantage of.</v>

1791
01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say that's really horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's called the Nincompoop,</v>

1792
01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:12.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say,</v>

1793
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:16.260
<v Speaker 2>actually that was an attempt to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a problem about needing to be more</v>

1794
01:30:16.261 --> 01:30:21.261
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and more assertive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So getting back to the Demora issue,</v>

1795
01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:26.910
<v Speaker 2>demore needed to set this thing up at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google differently.</v>

1796
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.773
<v Speaker 2>So I took my son to the local pinball </v>
<v Speaker 2>arcade and just think of it as a bunch </v>

1797
01:30:33.421 --> 01:30:35.840
<v Speaker 2>of workstations where nobody's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid.</v>

1798
01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:36.683
<v Speaker 2>Instead you're paying for the privilege </v>
<v Speaker 2>of staring at this thing for hours with </v>

1799
01:30:40.111 --> 01:30:40.944
<v Speaker 2>the bells and lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something with balls and </v>

1800
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:44.460
<v Speaker 2>mechanical systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no.</v>

1801
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:45.773
<v Speaker 2>They're not a lot of women trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrate the pinball arcade because </v>

1802
01:30:50.251 --> 01:30:52.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a loser activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1803
01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:56.340
<v Speaker 2>That's how they see us for losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I play pinball.</v>

1804
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know these things.</v>

1805
01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now my owns a pinball arcade,</v>

1806
01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:04.170
<v Speaker 2>was kind of restaurant pinball and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second to hurt me.</v>

1807
01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just joking.</v>

1808
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:09.480
<v Speaker 2>The point is this is something which has</v>
<v Speaker 2>low prestige.</v>

1809
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.800
<v Speaker 2>It's anti compensated and compensated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1810
01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:14.643
<v Speaker 2>Could we appointing right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like you're just plugging the </v>

1811
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:21.870
<v Speaker 2>money into the machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my point is is that what you said was</v>

1812
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:26.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not cognitive ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Idiots.</v>

1813
01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:30.240
<v Speaker 2>It's interest in temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hugely liberating,</v>

1814
01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:34.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not basically cognitive ability.</v>

1815
01:31:34.471 --> 01:31:35.304
<v Speaker 2>If men are as smart as women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but men can do something for hours and </v>

1816
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.863
<v Speaker 2>hours often uncompensated in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>robotic monomaniacal tunnel focus kind </v>

1817
01:31:43.651 --> 01:31:44.484
<v Speaker 2>of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that necessarily a great thing but </v>

1818
01:31:48.991 --> 01:31:49.824
<v Speaker 2>happens to be compensated now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only a great thing if that's what </v>

1819
01:31:52.411 --> 01:31:54.370
<v Speaker 2>you choose to go into for a career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1820
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I program and I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not programming.</v>

1821
01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Play</v>

1822
01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.370
<v Speaker 3>that funky Indian violent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1823
01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 3>But I'll spend hours doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1824
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:07.930
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is is that coding turns me</v>

1825
01:32:07.931 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 3>into like this autistic spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He guy.</v>

1826
01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I get speech APP apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1827
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:18.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say anything against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more you get into coding,</v>

1828
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:19.534
<v Speaker 3>you just sort of adopt a code mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he started talking to me while I'm </v>

1829
01:32:22.601 --> 01:32:23.670
<v Speaker 3>coding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1830
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:24.681
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Eric,</v>

1831
01:32:24.681 --> 01:32:26.450
<v Speaker 3>do you want to go out for a beer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll start say</v>

1832
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:30.490
<v Speaker 7>maybe</v>

1833
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:32.220
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:35.380
<v Speaker 3>What I'm doing is I'm being annoying and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm distracting you from your.</v>

1835
01:32:35.381 --> 01:32:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1836
01:32:36.490 --> 01:32:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see you as annoying.</v>

1837
01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

1838
01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to follow something as </v>
<v Speaker 3>annoying too,</v>

1839
01:32:40.601 --> 01:32:42.300
<v Speaker 3>if that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1840
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:43.243
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing Brazilian Jujitsu and I </v>

1841
01:32:46.571 --> 01:32:47.700
<v Speaker 3>come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey joe,</v>

1842
01:32:47.701 --> 01:32:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you want to go out for a beer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I got my hands full choked,</v>

1843
01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:50.701
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1844
01:32:50.701 --> 01:32:52.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1845
01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:56.950
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The issue is that a lot of us,</v>

1846
01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have male hardware,</v>

1847
01:32:59.501 --> 01:33:00.334
<v Speaker 3>male software,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize that we get obsessive </v>

1848
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:05.170
<v Speaker 3>compulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not always thinking about reward.</v>

1849
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessarily the most attractive</v>

1850
01:33:09.761 --> 01:33:11.800
<v Speaker 3>set of characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I do math,</v>

1851
01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:15.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely wildly on the spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm proud by the way,</v>

1852
01:33:15.011 --> 01:33:15.844
<v Speaker 3>I'm proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it's not a derogatory </v>

1853
01:33:18.341 --> 01:33:19.174
<v Speaker 3>term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're actually talking about </v>

1854
01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:22.150
<v Speaker 3>yourself when I'm socializing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1855
01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.190
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to think that I'm fairly </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>

1856
01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly normal,</v>

1857
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.500
<v Speaker 3>but when I'm doing math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1858
01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

1859
01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:32.230
<v Speaker 3>I want to kill that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to think through that thing.</v>

1860
01:33:32.231 --> 01:33:36.700
<v Speaker 3>I want to have that theorem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not on the spectrum in any way,</v>

1861
01:33:36.701 --> 01:33:37.534
<v Speaker 3>but I'm that way with writing for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm writing and someone came over to </v>

1862
01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:41.210
<v Speaker 3>talk to me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1863
01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 3>I can't talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1864
01:33:43.001 --> 01:33:46.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife will come over and she'll say,</v>

1865
01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.830
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really sharp with me.</v>

1866
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:48.843
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1867
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.530
<v Speaker 3>I barely even noticed that you were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1868
01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:51.850
<v Speaker 3>she's needy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1869
01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:57.820
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we've collaborated on.</v>

1870
01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:58.893
<v Speaker 3>She brought a geometry from quantum </v>
<v Speaker 3>field theory into economics and so at </v>

1871
01:34:06.371 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 3>the level of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1872
01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.320
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's really,</v>

1873
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:09.183
<v Speaker 3>she occupies brain space with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she will kick out of that space if </v>

1874
01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:14.500
<v Speaker 3>the kids need something.</v>

1875
01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I'll just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure the kids will be fine.</v>

1876
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:18.110
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1877
01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:19.600
<v Speaker 3>they're two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>

1878
01:34:19.601 --> 01:34:20.434
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1879
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:22.840
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to be able to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>care of themselves,</v>

1880
01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:24.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1881
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:27.790
<v Speaker 3>and so she'll have a much more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She always has her compassion running.</v>

1882
01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.713
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I can turn it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn it on for periods of time when I'm </v>

1883
01:34:31.331 --> 01:34:32.164
<v Speaker 3>focused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are these differences and you </v>

1884
01:34:35.391 --> 01:34:38.170
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to impart to teach women</v>

1885
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.170
<v Speaker 3>how to under deliver under deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.550
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1887
01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:47.551
<v Speaker 3>if you can't risk underdelivering then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't shoot for the,</v>

1888
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't swing for the fences as often.</v>

1889
01:34:49.811 --> 01:34:53.320
<v Speaker 3>You want to make sure that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to not disappoint.</v>

1890
01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Some men very often like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1891
01:34:55.811 --> 01:34:57.590
<v Speaker 3>I thought I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't quite work out.</v>

1892
01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:59.000
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take another couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

1893
01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:02.090
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird way of putting it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's a results oriented way of</v>

1894
01:35:02.091 --> 01:35:04.060
<v Speaker 3>putting them instead of an ambition </v>
<v Speaker 3>oriented.</v>

1895
01:35:04.061 --> 01:35:07.790
<v Speaker 3>This is what I'm trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if the real secret of life is over,</v>

1896
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:11.390
<v Speaker 3>promise over deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is though,</v>

1897
01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:14.720
<v Speaker 3>some that it is assumed that you were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bid.</v>

1898
01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.390
<v Speaker 3>If somebody else is going to promise </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than you,</v>

1899
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:21.830
<v Speaker 3>and then if you can't overdeliver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that you've already over promised,</v>

1900
01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:22.993
<v Speaker 3>then you can't actually delight people </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they're going to want to do </v>

1901
01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:26.710
<v Speaker 3>multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1902
01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.470
<v Speaker 3>go rounds with economy of bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1903
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we really want even promote that?</v>

1904
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Like why not just why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>

1905
01:35:36.291 --> 01:35:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Just be honest about what you can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't know what you can do.</v>

1906
01:35:39.970 --> 01:35:40.803
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing that I will be honest </v>

1907
01:35:41.721 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 3>about what you think you can do.</v>

1908
01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1909
01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:46.761
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1910
01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:49.160
<v Speaker 3>let's use it in a practical sense like </v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1911
01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.490
<v Speaker 3>So this was the whole Watson to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>you a car and I say,</v>

1912
01:35:52.491 --> 01:35:53.324
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the transmission's gone on his </v>

1913
01:35:54.921 --> 01:35:55.754
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you not a fixed one of those things </v>

1914
01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.980
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely,</v>

1915
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 3>I know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do it.</v>

1916
01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:01.990
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile you don't write well I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to go to you man.</v>

1917
01:36:02.110 --> 01:36:02.943
<v Speaker 3>Well I'll go to the guy down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've given it to them for 25 </v>

1918
01:36:05.181 --> 01:36:09.630
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's given me the car right now.</v>

1919
01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:10.910
<v Speaker 3>I go home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1920
01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.060
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to open this thing.</v>

1921
01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:15.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1922
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:17.770
<v Speaker 3>I better learn transmissions fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1923
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:20.540
<v Speaker 3>So now I go into crazy mode because now </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm terrified.</v>

1924
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:22.970
<v Speaker 3>This is called crossing the adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 3>value.</v>

1925
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.710
<v Speaker 3>What if it's something you can't learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast,</v>

1926
01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:25.820
<v Speaker 3>like Brazilian Jujitsu?</v>

1927
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if I come to you and I say,</v>

1928
01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you a Jujitsu expert,</v>

1929
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Eric?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

1930
01:36:31.371 --> 01:36:32.660
<v Speaker 3>yes I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1931
01:36:32.661 --> 01:36:33.494
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

1932
01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:34.543
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you meet me in two weeks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do Jujitsu and you have </v>

1933
01:36:37.461 --> 01:36:39.830
<v Speaker 3>two weeks to go fucking crazy and learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

1934
01:36:39.831 --> 01:36:40.664
<v Speaker 3>you know about Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we're talking about now is this </v>

1935
01:36:44.781 --> 01:36:49.190
<v Speaker 3>is not a trivial skill and transmissions</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1936
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's slow it down.</v>

1937
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:53.323
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to have a feel for </v>

1938
01:36:56.091 --> 01:36:59.180
<v Speaker 3>what adaptive valleys you can cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1939
01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>

1940
01:37:01.521 --> 01:37:03.350
<v Speaker 3>if you just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1941
01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.780
<v Speaker 3>I could run this country country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1942
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:07.603
<v Speaker 3>I run businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to have a problem </v>

1943
01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:16.280
<v Speaker 3>because you really have to learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington in order to run it.</v>

1944
01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you have no plan to do that,</v>

1945
01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:20.240
<v Speaker 3>then you're just bullshitting your way </v>
<v Speaker 3>through everything.</v>

1946
01:37:20.410 --> 01:37:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Like hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1947
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:26.830
<v Speaker 3>like this hypothetical situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically now.</v>

1948
01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.413
<v Speaker 3>But my point is that there are lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that don't have those </v>

1949
01:37:32.391 --> 01:37:37.391
<v Speaker 3>characteristics were um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something is really hard,</v>

1950
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:39.920
<v Speaker 3>but you may have to invent something in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to get out of it.</v>

1951
01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:40.880
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1952
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 3>dumb enough to get in smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get out is kind of the magic formula.</v>

1953
01:37:45.490 --> 01:37:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bite off more than you can chew,</v>

1954
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.600
<v Speaker 3>but if you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1955
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:54.560
<v Speaker 3>feel cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can summon the will,</v>

1956
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:56.790
<v Speaker 3>you can summon the intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can summon your friends,</v>

1957
01:37:56.791 --> 01:37:59.570
<v Speaker 3>your resources to somehow get across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptive value,</v>

1958
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it a problem that it leaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>open?</v>

1959
01:38:01.321 --> 01:38:04.050
<v Speaker 3>The possibility won't be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>across that valley.</v>

1960
01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:04.933
<v Speaker 3>We just put someone who is an expert in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the field and who's worked very hard </v>

1961
01:38:08.821 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 3>through apprenticeship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through schooling,</v>

1962
01:38:11.371 --> 01:38:12.204
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is to get to become an </v>
<v Speaker 3>expert in this field can tell you </v>

1963
01:38:14.341 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 3>definitively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1964
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:17.160
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can fix your computer.</v>

1965
01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:18.023
<v Speaker 3>I've fixed computers for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly how to attach a </v>

1966
01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:20.694
<v Speaker 3>motherboard to let's at least agree that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making the point that you know </v>

1967
01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:29.180
<v Speaker 3>don't over promise and under deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1968
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:32.220
<v Speaker 3>but we all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know that.</v>

1969
01:38:32.221 --> 01:38:34.980
<v Speaker 3>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the general good advice.</v>

1970
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:35.833
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're advising women to do </v>

1971
01:38:36.781 --> 01:38:38.910
<v Speaker 3>something that they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the problem.</v>

1972
01:38:38.911 --> 01:38:39.744
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to give advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more women that over promise and </v>

1973
01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:45.390
<v Speaker 3>under deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more people are going to go,</v>

1974
01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:47.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are these chicks?</v>

1975
01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Because they don't deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that's right.</v>

1976
01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.170
<v Speaker 3>You don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what's happening is,</v>

1977
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:54.013
<v Speaker 3>is that there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristics that are very valuable </v>

1978
01:38:57.691 --> 01:38:58.524
<v Speaker 3>in low variance processes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are certain things that you want </v>

1979
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:03.270
<v Speaker 3>every time to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1980
01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1981
01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:06.373
<v Speaker 3>child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>child rearing or particular kinds of </v>

1982
01:39:08.881 --> 01:39:10.080
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1983
01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a simple APP and a appendectomy.</v>

1984
01:39:12.641 --> 01:39:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get fancy,</v>

1985
01:39:14.071 --> 01:39:16.980
<v Speaker 3>just do the APP and an appendectomy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't screw it up.</v>

1986
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1987
01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are low variance processes.</v>

1988
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:22.343
<v Speaker 3>Now you've got some sort of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>conjoined twins that nobody's ever seen </v>

1989
01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:25.854
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1990
01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:29.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the question is what are we going to</v>

1991
01:39:29.001 --> 01:39:29.960
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1992
01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.453
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that that is potentially </v>

1993
01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:34.693
<v Speaker 3>within your ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though nobody's ever successfully </v>

1994
01:39:36.651 --> 01:39:41.210
<v Speaker 3>pulled it off before you have to over </v>
<v Speaker 3>promise to some extent.</v>

1995
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:43.700
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a guy who's going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a head transplant,</v>

1996
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:45.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1997
01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.393
<v Speaker 3>we had somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a head transplant with monkeys in the </v>

1998
01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:49.730
<v Speaker 3>early seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert White or something.</v>

1999
01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:50.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2000
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:52.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this came out of um,</v>

2001
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Jim Watson said this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is just brilliant,</v>

2002
01:39:56.541 --> 01:39:58.640
<v Speaker 3>which is if you're going to do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>

2003
01:39:58.850 --> 01:40:01.160
<v Speaker 3>you are by definition unqualified to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2004
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:03.410
<v Speaker 3>That's Watson and Crick and Watson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2005
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:05.083
<v Speaker 3>Now the point was is that those guys did</v>
<v Speaker 3>not know enough biochemistry to do the </v>

2006
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:09.343
<v Speaker 3>Double Helix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do you think that that's good </v>

2007
01:40:12.421 --> 01:40:14.640
<v Speaker 3>advice to give to women to overprice </v>
<v Speaker 3>over promise.</v>

2008
01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2009
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:22.820
<v Speaker 3>If you cannot over promise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may not be able to win a bidding war</v>

2010
01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:28.730
<v Speaker 3>for the right to do a project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're playing it very,</v>

2011
01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:33.620
<v Speaker 3>very safe and other people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2012
01:40:33.621 --> 01:40:38.140
<v Speaker 3>I can get that done faster and cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2013
01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.360
<v Speaker 3>the cynic in me says you're telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to bullshit.</v>

2014
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:43.943
<v Speaker 3>I like Bill Gates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to know whether or not someone </v>

2015
01:40:46.111 --> 01:40:48.350
<v Speaker 3>can actually deliver on what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

2016
01:40:48.351 --> 01:40:51.210
<v Speaker 3>When Bill Gates talked to IBM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have an operating system.</v>

2017
01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:54.490
<v Speaker 3>He said that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That created a panic situation.</v>

2018
01:40:56.170 --> 01:40:57.003
<v Speaker 3>How often do you have a product and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>announced the date for the product </v>

2019
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:04.480
<v Speaker 3>before the engineering is done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but are you talking about outliers?</v>

2020
01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:05.493
<v Speaker 3>Then you talking about people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled things off that you know the </v>

2021
01:41:08.201 --> 01:41:09.034
<v Speaker 3>average person probably doesn't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of you talked about the </v>

2022
01:41:10.781 --> 01:41:13.840
<v Speaker 3>wayside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people do over promise and this</v>

2023
01:41:13.841 --> 01:41:17.080
<v Speaker 3>is what I'm trying to get at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is if you value regularity,</v>

2024
01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.060
<v Speaker 3>then under promise over deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2025
01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:23.463
<v Speaker 3>If you value shackleton like outliers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may have to over promise and over </v>

2026
01:41:28.151 --> 01:41:29.250
<v Speaker 3>deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So wait,</v>

2027
01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:29.680
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>

2028
01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:30.513
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go ahead and you may have to risk </v>

2029
01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.450
<v Speaker 3>over promising and under delivering</v>

2030
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:37.740
<v Speaker 3>another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women are averse to that.</v>

2031
01:41:37.770 --> 01:41:38.603
<v Speaker 3>Oh absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So women are averse to bullshitting </v>

2032
01:41:40.081 --> 01:41:41.860
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely they are.</v>

2033
01:41:42.110 --> 01:41:43.910
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not hiring chicks.</v>

2034
01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:47.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna start hiring chicks for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason you're telling them to not be the</v>

2035
01:41:47.011 --> 01:41:49.570
<v Speaker 3>way they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're failing to communicate show.</v>

2036
01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2037
01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:50.751
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2038
01:41:50.751 --> 01:41:51.584
<v Speaker 3>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just playing devil's advocate and </v>

2039
01:41:52.651 --> 01:41:53.940
<v Speaker 3>picking you apart a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

2040
01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:57.900
<v Speaker 3>But I think in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when when you start hearing people say,</v>

2041
01:41:57.901 --> 01:42:02.901
<v Speaker 3>why aren't there more female founders of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a billion dollar plus tech companies,</v>

2042
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:06.953
<v Speaker 3>my feeling is that a lot of those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do found such companies are in this </v>

2043
01:42:11.491 --> 01:42:12.324
<v Speaker 3>kind of fast and loose outlier idiom and</v>
<v Speaker 3>very often females specifically because </v>

2044
01:42:19.321 --> 01:42:24.321
<v Speaker 3>of the crazy demands of child rearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is something you cannot screw up.</v>

2045
01:42:25.201 --> 01:42:28.230
<v Speaker 3>You have to be on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be incredibly regular,</v>

2046
01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.550
<v Speaker 3>have a very strong ethic of not screwing</v>
<v Speaker 3>up branches positive.</v>

2047
01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say that it's negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2048
01:42:36.641 --> 01:42:37.474
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I am saying is that if you are not </v>

2049
01:42:42.591 --> 01:42:45.530
<v Speaker 3>happy because you were not represented </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the outlier category,</v>

2050
01:42:46.130 --> 01:42:46.963
<v Speaker 3>understand that not screwing up is not a</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior pattern that leads to outlier </v>

2051
01:42:52.581 --> 01:42:54.230
<v Speaker 3>level results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>

2052
01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:55.423
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they almost have to go away from </v>

2053
01:42:57.291 --> 01:43:01.880
<v Speaker 3>their natural instincts in adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different pattern or behavior to achieve</v>

2054
01:43:01.881 --> 01:43:03.020
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2055
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:04.670
<v Speaker 3>I would like to tell a lot more men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2056
01:43:04.671 --> 01:43:07.580
<v Speaker 3>you can't keep promising and failing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come through.</v>

2057
01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:09.653
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be better if we had higher </v>

2058
01:43:11.181 --> 01:43:12.014
<v Speaker 3>regularity from some men who chronically</v>
<v Speaker 3>over promise and chronically under </v>

2059
01:43:15.561 --> 01:43:20.120
<v Speaker 3>deliver and we had more women who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to swing for the fences.</v>

2060
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:21.403
<v Speaker 3>If the feeling is why are we not </v>
<v Speaker 3>represented at the highest level of </v>

2061
01:43:25.611 --> 01:43:28.910
<v Speaker 3>certain kinds of activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all right,</v>

2062
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:30.403
<v Speaker 3>so what I'm trying to get at is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we are not currently feeling </v>

2063
01:43:33.501 --> 01:43:38.501
<v Speaker 3>safe enough to have these style of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations where we're saying,</v>

2064
01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:40.273
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what extent are we holding ourselves </v>

2065
01:43:42.141 --> 01:43:44.720
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we holding you back?</v>

2066
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:46.183
<v Speaker 3>What is it that we need to be doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or are we talking about the glass floor </v>

2067
01:43:48.621 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 3>as well as the glass ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So know the brick layer</v>

2068
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.813
<v Speaker 2>unions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The is a famous example where if you </v>

2069
01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.670
<v Speaker 2>look for pictures of brick layers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll generally see a bunch of guys,</v>

2070
01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:00.093
<v Speaker 2>a very few women and there is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaint that these have not been </v>

2071
01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:03.134
<v Speaker 2>integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are ways in which you don't </v>

2072
01:44:05.361 --> 01:44:06.194
<v Speaker 2>find women in the pinball arcades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't find them in brick layers </v>

2073
01:44:08.781 --> 01:44:11.210
<v Speaker 2>unions and you find fewer of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>founding,</v>

2074
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multibillion dollar tech companies.</v>

2075
01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.840
<v Speaker 2>So how do we feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2076
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:18.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key question is if you want to see </v>

2077
01:44:20.571 --> 01:44:21.404
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be risking having a real </v>

2078
01:44:23.271 --> 01:44:24.104
<v Speaker 2>conversation about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what demore tried to do was to </v>

2079
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:28.334
<v Speaker 2>decouple intelligence from this problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say it's much more temperament and </v>

2080
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:34.154
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the person who made that point on </v>

2081
01:44:36.921 --> 01:44:37.754
<v Speaker 2>Dave Rubin show a month before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google memo leak was my wife and she </v>

2082
01:44:43.341 --> 01:44:45.500
<v Speaker 2>didn't get attacked because she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2083
01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in an incredibly,</v>

2084
01:44:47.710 --> 01:44:49.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically an all male environment.</v>

2085
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:51.103
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't happy because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament and interest when it got </v>

2086
01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:56.180
<v Speaker 2>highly competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2087
01:44:56.181 --> 01:44:58.880
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to spend my energy and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>time fighting.</v>

2088
01:44:59.550 --> 01:45:00.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has,</v>

2089
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.590
<v Speaker 2>she has like a Nobel quality result in </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics.</v>

2090
01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:08.710
<v Speaker 2>And her feeling was it's just not worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to get into some multi-decade pissing</v>

2091
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:12.260
<v Speaker 2>match with incredibly powerful people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2092
01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.140
<v Speaker 2>my feeling about this is those guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going down.</v>

2093
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:17.130
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2094
01:45:17.131 --> 01:45:17.964
<v Speaker 2>I read my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out called the physics of Wall </v>

2095
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:22.874
<v Speaker 2>Street that I encourage women to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chapter called a new Manhattan </v>

2096
01:45:28.101 --> 01:45:28.934
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the epilogue discusses her </v>

2097
01:45:31.461 --> 01:45:33.300
<v Speaker 2>contribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2098
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.903
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact we sort of walked away from it </v>

2099
01:45:36.711 --> 01:45:37.544
<v Speaker 2>in part because she didn't want to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>war and there's nothing wrong with not </v>

2100
01:45:41.271 --> 01:45:44.150
<v Speaker 2>wanting to go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is a very big,</v>

2101
01:45:44.151 --> 01:45:47.600
<v Speaker 2>temperamental difference that is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive difference.</v>

2102
01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:51.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I think the more we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying now,</v>

2103
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:52.603
<v Speaker 2>I think you and I would both agree that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we would never want anyone to </v>

2104
01:45:56.121 --> 01:45:56.954
<v Speaker 2>discriminate against women for a job </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're qualified for and that they're </v>

2105
01:46:00.591 --> 01:46:02.660
<v Speaker 2>looking to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're good at it,</v>

2106
01:46:02.661 --> 01:46:07.520
<v Speaker 2>we would like to see people who would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to see in a quality of opportunity.</v>

2107
01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than that.</v>

2108
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.920
<v Speaker 2>More than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you think about how many women</v>
<v Speaker 2>are offline and you think of it as like,</v>

2110
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:16.700
<v Speaker 2>just stop thinking about in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social good.</v>

2111
01:46:16.701 --> 01:46:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And think about it as like when you like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an oil field that hasn't been tapped,</v>

2112
01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.370
<v Speaker 2>just their neuro field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what you're saying is essential.</v>

2113
01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2114
01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2115
01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:30.200
<v Speaker 2>you're just talking about Jews and </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>

2116
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:34.100
<v Speaker 2>So one quarter of one percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's population of 1:25</v>

2117
01:46:34.101 --> 01:46:36.270
<v Speaker 2>percent of the Nobel prizes in physics </v>
<v Speaker 2>or thereabout.</v>

2118
01:46:36.330 --> 01:46:37.163
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few Asian females have Nobel </v>

2119
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:41.810
<v Speaker 2>prizes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

2120
01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:44.040
<v Speaker 2>if I were trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with oilfields,</v>

2121
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:47.930
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go to Texas to try to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>more oil because I'd figured pretty well</v>

2122
01:46:47.931 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 2>picked over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd try find some other place.</v>

2123
01:46:50.041 --> 01:46:53.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm going to find great waves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In Hawaii,</v>

2124
01:46:53.341 --> 01:46:55.200
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to go to the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2125
01:46:55.201 --> 01:46:56.034
<v Speaker 2>So let's say Asian females have a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage of the world's neurons </v>

2126
01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:03.690
<v Speaker 2>basically untapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to make tons of money,</v>

2127
01:47:03.691 --> 01:47:05.880
<v Speaker 2>if you want to cure cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do all these things,</v>

2128
01:47:05.881 --> 01:47:08.430
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to bring those neurons </v>
<v Speaker 2>fully online.</v>

2129
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just a question of nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to keep them out.</v>

2130
01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge prize to be won for </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out the puzzle.</v>

2131
01:47:16.090 --> 01:47:16.923
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it has not been proved that gender </v>

2132
01:47:19.781 --> 01:47:22.930
<v Speaker 6>and sex have a role in what people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>attracted to,</v>

2133
01:47:22.931 --> 01:47:23.764
<v Speaker 6>are interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So why should we assume that just </v>

2134
01:47:25.601 --> 01:47:29.440
<v Speaker 6>because we have these systems,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether they're economic systems,</v>

2135
01:47:29.441 --> 01:47:30.250
<v Speaker 6>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2136
01:47:30.250 --> 01:47:31.083
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>starting a business or whether it's </v>

2137
01:47:32.831 --> 01:47:33.664
<v Speaker 6>working in tech,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why should we assume that women would </v>

2138
01:47:36.821 --> 01:47:37.654
<v Speaker 6>want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why should we encourage them to do that </v>

2139
01:47:40.001 --> 01:47:40.834
<v Speaker 6>if they're not interested in it and why </v>
<v Speaker 6>do we put so much value in it just </v>

2140
01:47:43.601 --> 01:47:45.400
<v Speaker 6>because it generates incredible amount </v>
<v Speaker 6>of money.</v>

2141
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:50.780
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that maybe what we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>looking at is natural patterns?</v>

2142
01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.940
<v Speaker 6>There's natural patterns where,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is what demore argued,</v>

2143
01:47:54.941 --> 01:47:58.300
<v Speaker 6>that men gravitate towards certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>things more often than women.</v>

2144
01:47:58.450 --> 01:47:59.283
<v Speaker 6>And that was one of the things that was </v>
<v Speaker 6>so disturbing to me that was overlooked </v>

2145
01:48:01.421 --> 01:48:02.254
<v Speaker 6>about his memo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had a full page and a half dedicated </v>

2146
01:48:05.770 --> 01:48:06.603
<v Speaker 6>to trying to encourage and various ways </v>
<v Speaker 6>to try to encourage women to get into </v>

2147
01:48:09.881 --> 01:48:10.714
<v Speaker 6>tech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2148
01:48:10.810 --> 01:48:11.643
<v Speaker 6>Nobody talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The other thing that they didn't do is </v>

2149
01:48:13.511 --> 01:48:15.580
<v Speaker 6>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not no one,</v>

2150
01:48:15.581 --> 01:48:16.414
<v Speaker 6>but many of the people that read </v>
<v Speaker 6>published his work and took snippets of </v>

2151
01:48:19.541 --> 01:48:21.580
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't publish the citations or the</v>

2152
01:48:21.581 --> 01:48:23.830
<v Speaker 6>Bibliography,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like Reno.</v>

2153
01:48:23.890 --> 01:48:27.500
<v Speaker 6>It's immoral,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's what it is,</v>

2154
01:48:27.501 --> 01:48:29.810
<v Speaker 6>is back to your analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2155
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:33.250
<v Speaker 6>these people are in a cult and this was </v>
<v Speaker 6>a challenge to,</v>

2156
01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.160
<v Speaker 6>to the ideology of the cult,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so no,</v>

2157
01:48:35.190 --> 01:48:35.850
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

2158
01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:36.683
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at it from the felt </v>

2159
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:42.180
<v Speaker 2>experience in the felt experience is if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2160
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:47.720
<v Speaker 2>if you've already struggled as a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>against incredible odds to be in tech to</v>

2161
01:48:48.751 --> 01:48:49.584
<v Speaker 2>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's somebody </v>

2162
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.300
<v Speaker 2>whispering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2163
01:48:54.301 --> 01:48:55.134
<v Speaker 2>she's not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only hired her because she was </v>

2164
01:48:56.611 --> 01:48:58.640
<v Speaker 2>female and you're sick of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2165
01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:02.880
<v Speaker 2>So you have to appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lived experience of the women inside</v>

2166
01:49:02.881 --> 01:49:06.240
<v Speaker 2>of Google is that they know that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage of those guys were saying,</v>

2167
01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:07.283
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to talk about studies are </v>

2168
01:49:08.971 --> 01:49:10.760
<v Speaker 2>actually pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2169
01:49:11.730 --> 01:49:15.270
<v Speaker 2>So their bullshit detectors are set </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2170
01:49:15.271 --> 01:49:16.104
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they're hearing dog whistles </v>

2171
01:49:18.631 --> 01:49:19.464
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2172
01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.680
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't think we should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>blaming women who have been subjected to</v>

2173
01:49:25.081 --> 01:49:28.680
<v Speaker 2>this as if this is not a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There really are dog whistles.</v>

2174
01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:29.514
<v Speaker 2>There really are people who don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>women in tech and want to go back to an </v>

2175
01:49:33.211 --> 01:49:34.210
<v Speaker 2>all boys club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

2176
01:49:34.211 --> 01:49:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah for sure.</v>

2177
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:37.130
<v Speaker 2>But that's not really what we're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2178
01:49:37.210 --> 01:49:38.510
<v Speaker 2>we aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2179
01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:39.873
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the issue is what if I need to do </v>

2180
01:49:42.031 --> 01:49:46.720
<v Speaker 2>some amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some relatively minimal amount of um,</v>

2181
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:47.943
<v Speaker 2>kind of intellectual terraforming to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these female neurons to work on </v>

2182
01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:55.540
<v Speaker 2>all of these amazing problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what if,</v>

2183
01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.433
<v Speaker 2>what if the people who have the answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>for let's say cancer or Agi or who </v>

2184
01:50:00.761 --> 01:50:02.240
<v Speaker 2>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to be female [inaudible],</v>

2185
01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:04.763
<v Speaker 2>what if I needed to do some things in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to make the environment more </v>

2186
01:50:08.111 --> 01:50:09.760
<v Speaker 2>attract?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>

2187
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:13.480
<v Speaker 2>programming in teams has to some extent </v>
<v Speaker 2>per replaced.</v>

2188
01:50:13.481 --> 01:50:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Cowboy programming was just some guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his code and you know,</v>

2189
01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:21.160
<v Speaker 2>a set of headphones and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes to it.</v>

2190
01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what he was talking about.</v>

2191
01:50:24.431 --> 01:50:25.264
<v Speaker 2>Like what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what extent can you actually change </v>

2192
01:50:28.541 --> 01:50:29.374
<v Speaker 2>the nature of work to bring these extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurons online now that's the right </v>

2193
01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.230
<v Speaker 2>reason to do this.</v>

2194
01:50:35.230 --> 01:50:38.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we should value like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is coding?</v>

2195
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:39.723
<v Speaker 2>It's some sort of highly logical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very technical persnickety activity if </v>

2196
01:50:44.411 --> 01:50:46.790
<v Speaker 2>it's highly compensated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants in.</v>

2197
01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:47.643
<v Speaker 2>If it's poorly compensated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only people who are sort of addicted to </v>

2198
01:50:50.531 --> 01:50:51.570
<v Speaker 2>it would want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2199
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And it happens to be sort of high status</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment.</v>

2200
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:56.583
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay this must be an all boys club and </v>

2201
01:50:59.231 --> 01:51:02.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe it grew up as an all boys club and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it has particular attributes,</v>

2202
01:51:02.951 --> 01:51:05.830
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at maybe different from what</v>

2203
01:51:05.831 --> 01:51:06.664
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at is that I'm thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about particular high ability females </v>

2204
01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:12.573
<v Speaker 2>who have left the game or who have sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of gone into a lower intensity mode </v>

2205
01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:20.740
<v Speaker 2>because there's just sick of being in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>all male environment.</v>

2206
01:51:20.770 --> 01:51:23.140
<v Speaker 2>So if I can interject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try and discourage attrition.</v>

2207
01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:25.443
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to discourage attrition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the amazing people who have something </v>

2208
01:51:28.991 --> 01:51:30.760
<v Speaker 2>deep and powerful and important to say.</v>

2209
01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:31.593
<v Speaker 2>So the environment of these places is </v>
<v Speaker 2>contrary to them establishing whatever </v>

2210
01:51:36.071 --> 01:51:37.440
<v Speaker 2>strengths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me give.</v>

2211
01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.153
<v Speaker 2>I would rather not talk about women and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather talk about something I know </v>

2212
01:51:41.891 --> 01:51:42.760
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well,</v>

2213
01:51:42.761 --> 01:51:43.970
<v Speaker 2>which is myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2214
01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:48.820
<v Speaker 2>So four and a half years ago I gave some</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks on physics,</v>

2215
01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:49.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were terrifying to me because I </v>

2216
01:51:51.521 --> 01:51:52.354
<v Speaker 2>wasn't trained as a physicist and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a lot of attention and publicity at </v>

2217
01:51:54.671 --> 01:51:55.504
<v Speaker 2>Oxford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the unpleasantness of </v>

2218
01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:05.100
<v Speaker 2>intellectual oneupsmanship and negging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

2219
01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:08.740
<v Speaker 2>that takes place in particle theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a turn off to me.</v>

2220
01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:09.813
<v Speaker 2>And so I've sort of stayed away for four</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half years because I didn't like </v>

2221
01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:18.900
<v Speaker 2>how unpleasant and hyper like </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggeratedly masculine it was.</v>

2222
01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that exists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2223
01:52:22.421 --> 01:52:23.920
<v Speaker 2>because it's a huge prize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2224
01:52:23.921 --> 01:52:25.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to get,</v>

2225
01:52:25.570 --> 01:52:28.220
<v Speaker 2>gain Einstein's mantle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2226
01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:30.490
<v Speaker 2>it's still a game worth winning because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2227
01:52:30.491 --> 01:52:31.324
<v Speaker 2>Einstein was times out of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's still because of this huge </v>

2228
01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:35.164
<v Speaker 2>prize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also a lot of critical thinking </v>

2229
01:52:36.521 --> 01:52:37.880
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of criticizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2230
01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:41.090
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of just wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:43.870
<v Speaker 2>There's like a Dick measuring contest </v>
<v Speaker 2>that does nothing for me.</v>

2232
01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2233
01:52:45.650 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2234
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.000
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my point is,</v>

2235
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:50.150
<v Speaker 3>is that is a guy who's been in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematics,</v>

2236
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.460
<v Speaker 3>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economics,</v>

2237
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:54.110
<v Speaker 3>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tech.</v>

2238
01:52:54.111 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 3>That's five hyper male fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some of them that I just can't</v>

2239
01:52:58.281 --> 01:52:59.114
<v Speaker 3>stand because there two exaggeratedly </v>
<v Speaker 3>male and you feel like criticism is </v>

2240
01:53:03.651 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 3>exaggeratedly male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just criticism,</v>

2241
01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:08.120
<v Speaker 3>it's just like snarky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid,</v>

2242
01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:13.430
<v Speaker 3>mean spirited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonconstructive main girl show,</v>

2243
01:53:14.610 --> 01:53:17.090
<v Speaker 3>female show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe housewives of Beverly Hills.</v>

2244
01:53:17.150 --> 01:53:18.920
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take downy.</v>

2245
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a different version.</v>

2246
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:23.263
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is made you avoid these particular </v>

2247
01:53:26.511 --> 01:53:27.344
<v Speaker 3>person makes lots of us men and women </v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be more likely to avoid and </v>

2248
01:53:31.581 --> 01:53:35.030
<v Speaker 3>you would lose the contribution trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sell a lot of these brilliant minds.</v>

2249
01:53:35.031 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 3>That part of the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that every time you have an extremely</v>

2250
01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:44.390
<v Speaker 3>kind of overly like an exaggeratedly </v>
<v Speaker 3>toxic culture,</v>

2251
01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:46.993
<v Speaker 3>you get attrition from people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at it or just don't like to </v>

2252
01:53:50.151 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 3>go into work.</v>

2253
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.380
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And putting that on women is not fair.</v>

2254
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:56.053
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do labor economics at </v>

2255
01:53:57.201 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 3>Harvard for the same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really unpleasant.</v>

2256
01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I understand that once they've actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten to the game,</v>

2257
01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:05.533
<v Speaker 3>but is that what keeps them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursuing the game or is it natural </v>

2258
01:54:09.531 --> 01:54:12.380
<v Speaker 3>inclinations towards other pursuits?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's a mixture.</v>

2259
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:13.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most things,</v>

2260
01:54:13.941 --> 01:54:14.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this is,</v>

2261
01:54:14.830 --> 01:54:16.820
<v Speaker 3>this is really what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Demora was saying.</v>

2262
01:54:17.010 --> 01:54:20.630
<v Speaker 3>He was saying there's a 50 slash 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>default baseline that you've adopted.</v>

2263
01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ju,</v>

2264
01:54:23.850 --> 01:54:26.750
<v Speaker 3>I James Damore don't think that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should accept 50 slash 50.</v>

2265
01:54:26.751 --> 01:54:31.110
<v Speaker 3>We should figure out what percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this has to do with um,</v>

2266
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.050
<v Speaker 3>interest and inclination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2267
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:37.123
<v Speaker 3>and that should be an adjustment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're sending tests do with </v>

2268
01:54:39.321 --> 01:54:40.350
<v Speaker 3>prejudice and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2269
01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.960
<v Speaker 3>So break it into two components were off</v>
<v Speaker 3>of 50 per,</v>

2270
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:46.610
<v Speaker 3>it's a plus b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where a is the natural amount that it,</v>

2271
01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:49.400
<v Speaker 3>it should favor one gender or sex over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other.</v>

2272
01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:53.360
<v Speaker 3>And then b is the extent of systematic </v>
<v Speaker 3>bias.</v>

2273
01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:55.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a very analytical and I think a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

2274
01:54:55.321 --> 01:54:57.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it's exactly what he was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>is exactly right.</v>

2275
01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:00.410
<v Speaker 3>You're one of the very few people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has broken down like that.</v>

2276
01:55:00.710 --> 01:55:03.080
<v Speaker 3>It became this weird ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle,</v>

2277
01:55:03.090 --> 01:55:07.700
<v Speaker 3>but I got into tremendous trouble </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I let off a tweet that was about</v>

2278
01:55:07.701 --> 01:55:09.050
<v Speaker 3>biologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2279
01:55:09.051 --> 01:55:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Because Richard Dawkins had just been </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep platformed at Berkeley where he was</v>

2280
01:55:12.771 --> 01:55:15.080
<v Speaker 3>going to speak as a biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother.</v>

2281
01:55:15.130 --> 01:55:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that about?</v>

2282
01:55:16.011 --> 01:55:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Why did they do platform?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

2283
01:55:19.551 --> 01:55:21.500
<v Speaker 3>he said something on charitable about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>

2284
01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.260
<v Speaker 3>which means we have to get back to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2285
01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:24.613
<v Speaker 3>But the key point was is that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>three biologists to more Dawkins and </v>

2286
01:55:28.730 --> 01:55:32.480
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein who had all been d platform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I let off a tweet about,</v>

2287
01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:34.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for God's sake,</v>

2288
01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:37.400
<v Speaker 3>stop teaching people that they should </v>
<v Speaker 3>run to hr,</v>

2289
01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:39.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than code,</v>

2290
01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:42.200
<v Speaker 3>which had nothing to do with harassment </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

2291
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:44.250
<v Speaker 3>It was really just about seeing</v>

2292
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:45.420
<v Speaker 2>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2293
01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:46.553
<v Speaker 2>who deleted her tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't talked about this until now </v>

2294
01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.750
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt that I,</v>

2295
01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I reacted to her deleted tweet and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>

2296
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I still have it on my computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want to bring it up.</v>

2297
01:55:57.121 --> 01:55:59.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I was left holding the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2298
01:55:59.710 --> 01:56:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the tweet?</v>

2299
01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.640
<v Speaker 2>It was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear Google,</v>

2300
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:08.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't teach my daughter to run to hr </v>
<v Speaker 2>for financial freedom rather than code.</v>

2301
01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Thanks a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was interpreted as like,</v>

2302
01:56:12.841 --> 01:56:13.770
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck it up.</v>

2303
01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:16.050
<v Speaker 2>If you're being harassed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace,</v>

2304
01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:18.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not suck it up.</v>

2305
01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 2>If you were being harassed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace,</v>

2306
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:21.713
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to make that clearer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's about if somebody is talking </v>

2307
01:56:25.231 --> 01:56:27.480
<v Speaker 2>like a biologist and they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2308
01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:31.760
<v Speaker 2>well there's pre prenatal testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2309
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the psychometrics and there,</v>

2310
01:56:33.690 --> 01:56:36.840
<v Speaker 2>these are the conserved differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>across cultures.</v>

2311
01:56:37.710 --> 01:56:38.543
<v Speaker 2>That's not a reason to go to hr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a reason to figure out whether </v>

2312
01:56:40.711 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 2>the person is making sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not making sense to take them on,</v>

2313
01:56:44.221 --> 01:56:46.490
<v Speaker 2>in the arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2314
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:47.363
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel very passionately that discourse </v>

2315
01:56:50.281 --> 01:56:52.960
<v Speaker 2>and free speech is incredibly important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

2316
01:56:53.210 --> 01:56:54.043
<v Speaker 2>you distort what that guy was saying and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you turn it into this hateful attack on </v>

2317
01:56:57.661 --> 01:56:58.494
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've shut down discourse and you </v>

2318
01:57:00.610 --> 01:57:01.443
<v Speaker 2>discourage anybody else that has any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of unusual opinion or unusual </v>

2319
01:57:05.671 --> 01:57:09.960
<v Speaker 2>observation from coming forth because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're essentially,</v>

2320
01:57:09.961 --> 01:57:12.750
<v Speaker 2>you're limiting free speech to free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech that you agree with.</v>

2321
01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.790
<v Speaker 2>And this is what happened while I agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>

2322
01:57:14.791 --> 01:57:16.590
<v Speaker 2>but think about how difficult it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

2323
01:57:17.010 --> 01:57:18.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as I say,</v>

2324
01:57:18.090 --> 01:57:23.090
<v Speaker 2>learn how to over promise and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver on risk under delivering that,</v>

2325
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:27.000
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can take up 10 minutes.</v>

2326
01:57:27.010 --> 01:57:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you telling me to bullshit and not,</v>

2327
01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:29.820
<v Speaker 2>not come through?</v>

2328
01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:31.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that what I'm saying,</v>

2329
01:57:31.590 --> 01:57:36.590
<v Speaker 2>but all of these higher level points all</v>
<v Speaker 2>have lower level misinterpretations.</v>

2330
01:57:36.650 --> 01:57:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in this circumstance,</v>

2331
01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.193
<v Speaker 2>it's also important to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>after so many years of putting up with </v>

2332
01:57:44.191 --> 01:57:48.660
<v Speaker 2>sort of whisper campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is understandable that women are sick</v>

2333
01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:49.530
<v Speaker 2>of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2334
01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 2>So that's true to that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2335
01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:53.363
<v Speaker 2>So the key question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we going to just deep platform all </v>

2336
01:57:55.771 --> 01:57:56.604
<v Speaker 2>the biologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we going to pretend that there are </v>

2337
01:57:59.101 --> 01:57:59.934
<v Speaker 2>no differences?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to pretend that gender and </v>

2338
01:58:01.201 --> 01:58:03.840
<v Speaker 2>sex have absolutely nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other?</v>

2339
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:05.183
<v Speaker 2>Like this sort of fantasy life that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can try to lead a in a progressive </v>

2340
01:58:11.461 --> 01:58:15.960
<v Speaker 2>context is going to destroy the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings of Western civilization.</v>

2341
01:58:16.490 --> 01:58:18.600
<v Speaker 2>And I have nothing against eastern </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>

2342
01:58:18.601 --> 01:58:20.490
<v Speaker 2>but I'm an exponent of Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

2343
01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2344
01:58:22.291 --> 01:58:23.124
<v Speaker 2>this gets back to the issue of will we </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to talk anywhere in a safe </v>

2345
01:58:27.211 --> 01:58:28.044
<v Speaker 2>enough fashion that we can have really </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful conversations so that we can </v>

2346
01:58:31.801 --> 01:58:34.780
<v Speaker 2>actually fix these fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2347
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:35.633
<v Speaker 2>And the only way you're going to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>these problems is if you cut out all </v>

2348
01:58:38.041 --> 01:58:39.910
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2349
01:58:39.970 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideological biases</v>

2350
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:44.240
<v Speaker 3>on the right and the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2351
01:58:44.241 --> 01:58:46.690
<v Speaker 3>the male and the female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just look at the problem for what it</v>

2352
01:58:46.691 --> 01:58:47.380
<v Speaker 3>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2353
01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:52.380
<v Speaker 3>and it's tough and we're challenged </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we also don't see ourselves,</v>

2354
01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:57.210
<v Speaker 3>but just firing that guy for that memo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then here's the,</v>

2355
01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.770
<v Speaker 3>my favorite part of my all time favorite</v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

2356
01:59:01.330 --> 01:59:05.440
<v Speaker 3>They invited women to take time off </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was so stressful.</v>

2357
01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:07.291
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

2358
01:59:07.291 --> 01:59:11.230
<v Speaker 3>you are reinforcing the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>stereotypes that someone couldn't ever.</v>

2359
01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:12.073
<v Speaker 3>You've actually read the memo and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>so disturbing to you that you had to </v>

2360
01:59:15.761 --> 01:59:16.594
<v Speaker 3>take time off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are insanely fragile or you're </v>

2361
01:59:20.711 --> 01:59:23.560
<v Speaker 3>looking for time off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking to take time off.</v>

2362
01:59:23.650 --> 01:59:24.483
<v Speaker 3>Either one of those things reinforces </v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst stereotypes that people have </v>

2363
01:59:27.461 --> 01:59:29.520
<v Speaker 3>against women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2364
01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:30.363
<v Speaker 3>but what if the idea is different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if the idea is that they've </v>

2365
01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:37.600
<v Speaker 3>actually been experiencing trauma at </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else's hands?</v>

2366
01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.580
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't James Demore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2367
01:59:39.581 --> 01:59:44.130
<v Speaker 3>but that's not about the James Damore </v>
<v Speaker 3>memo and I have it done right?</v>

2368
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.033
<v Speaker 3>Why have it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're having it directly in </v>

2369
01:59:47.621 --> 01:59:48.454
<v Speaker 3>response to that guy's a memo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which wasn't in any way derogatory </v>

2370
01:59:51.251 --> 01:59:52.084
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to India and I see a bunch of </v>

2371
01:59:53.441 --> 01:59:56.800
<v Speaker 3>backwards swastikas with dots and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have nothing to do with Nazis.</v>

2372
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:59.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking triggered when we're going</v>

2373
01:59:59.081 --> 02:00:00.760
<v Speaker 3>far though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're pretty far away from that.</v>

2374
02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Let's just talk about the internal memo </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Google sense like why?</v>

2375
02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Why give women off if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2376
02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.620
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fire that fucking guy.</v>

2377
02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Have a conversation with them and have </v>
<v Speaker 3>open discourse.</v>

2378
02:00:11.201 --> 02:00:14.800
<v Speaker 3>The biggest problem was firing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that establishes the precedent.</v>

2379
02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:19.120
<v Speaker 3>That truck look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called him up specifically to ask what</v>

2380
02:00:19.121 --> 02:00:21.790
<v Speaker 3>the hell happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know you've talked to him.</v>

2381
02:00:21.791 --> 02:00:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's soft spoken.</v>

2382
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Very kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very nice guy.</v>

2383
02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:30.220
<v Speaker 3>James is pretty open so I'm going to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's wildly introverted,</v>

2384
02:00:30.221 --> 02:00:32.230
<v Speaker 3>almost certainly on the spectrum for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2385
02:00:32.231 --> 02:00:33.064
<v Speaker 3>And his reaction was that I went to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting where they tried to teach </v>

2386
02:00:35.501 --> 02:00:37.480
<v Speaker 3>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biology was wrong.</v>

2387
02:00:37.481 --> 02:00:40.900
<v Speaker 3>They asked if I had any feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told them and he wrote an 18 page man,</v>

2388
02:00:40.901 --> 02:00:43.840
<v Speaker 3>but don't write this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how his brain thinks,</v>

2389
02:00:44.130 --> 02:00:47.110
<v Speaker 3>which is why he's a coder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why he was a biologist,</v>

2390
02:00:47.111 --> 02:00:49.660
<v Speaker 3>which is why champion the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2391
02:00:49.661 --> 02:00:50.494
<v Speaker 3>This is how it's very important that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people not be made unwelcome </v>

2392
02:00:54.401 --> 02:00:55.234
<v Speaker 3>because fundamentally we're going 11 </v>
<v Speaker 3>this untried social justice stuff in </v>

2393
02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:00.340
<v Speaker 3>absolutely every well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

2394
02:01:00.341 --> 02:01:03.850
<v Speaker 3>he was labeled as a misogynist over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over again,</v>

2395
02:01:03.851 --> 02:01:06.480
<v Speaker 3>and you don't even giving the guy a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance to have a communication.</v>

2396
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:10.510
<v Speaker 3>We have open communication like if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit down with them instead of firing.</v>

2397
02:01:10.511 --> 02:01:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you say,</v>

2398
02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:17.260
<v Speaker 3>come to the seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to teach you things.</v>

2399
02:01:17.290 --> 02:01:19.870
<v Speaker 3>The things are wrong and now we want </v>
<v Speaker 3>your feedback.</v>

2400
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:23.140
<v Speaker 3>You're just setting certain minds up for</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing for sure.</v>

2401
02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:26.260
<v Speaker 3>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is something I,</v>

2402
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:27.163
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2403
02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:29.440
<v Speaker 3>this is much harder to bring to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>

2404
02:01:30.190 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 3>this room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this room.</v>

2405
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:32.590
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2406
02:01:32.650 --> 02:01:33.483
<v Speaker 3>because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm part of this constellation of </v>

2407
02:01:34.931 --> 02:01:36.970
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we keep doing this.</v>

2408
02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 3>We keep making a mistake in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is we</v>

2409
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:40.933
<v Speaker 2>keep seeing these wrong things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen in the space and we lose the </v>

2410
02:01:44.631 --> 02:01:49.631
<v Speaker 2>empathy in some sense because people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not representing themselves well,</v>

2411
02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:55.580
<v Speaker 2>so I believe having watched my wife and </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics,</v>

2412
02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:01.120
<v Speaker 2>that it is really corrosive to go in </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday to work in an environment which</v>

2413
02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:03.800
<v Speaker 2>does not feel welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2414
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:05.210
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very toxic,</v>

2415
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:06.403
<v Speaker 2>very bad for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that something breaks the </v>

2416
02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:12.710
<v Speaker 2>camel's back and it's approximate cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the actual problem.</v>

2417
02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On how they framed it,</v>

2418
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:19.080
<v Speaker 2>they're saying they're giving people </v>
<v Speaker 2>time off because there's diversity memos</v>

2419
02:02:19.081 --> 02:02:22.220
<v Speaker 2>that he targets versus hard targets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2420
02:02:22.221 --> 02:02:24.770
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is is that he was a soft </v>
<v Speaker 2>target,</v>

2421
02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:26.080
<v Speaker 2>but they may have had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2422
02:02:26.150 --> 02:02:26.983
<v Speaker 2>many of these women may have had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manager who passed them over for </v>

2423
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:31.303
<v Speaker 2>promotions three times when they'd been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The major contributors sort of </v>

2424
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:34.754
<v Speaker 2>reinforces a rational ideas about his </v>
<v Speaker 2>memo without actually reading the core </v>

2425
02:02:37.941 --> 02:02:39.560
<v Speaker 2>components of it and look at objects.</v>

2426
02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:40.423
<v Speaker 2>Why I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I was outspoken on the point </v>

2427
02:02:44.211 --> 02:02:47.600
<v Speaker 2>is even well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am outspoken on demaurice.</v>

2428
02:02:48.330 --> 02:02:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Think there's issues that believed are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>

2429
02:02:50.721 --> 02:02:51.554
<v Speaker 2>we are in danger of breaking empathy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people who do not express </v>

2430
02:02:54.321 --> 02:02:57.290
<v Speaker 2>themselves at our idiom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't like the fragility,</v>

2431
02:02:57.380 --> 02:02:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2432
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>there's this confusion between strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>people versus very aggressive people and</v>

2433
02:03:06.201 --> 02:03:07.034
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger people are much less </v>

2434
02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:09.464
<v Speaker 2>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2435
02:03:09.530 --> 02:03:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like loud yelling.</v>

2436
02:03:11.601 --> 02:03:12.434
<v Speaker 2>People think that they're winning an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument because they're loud and </v>

2437
02:03:14.031 --> 02:03:14.864
<v Speaker 2>yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2438
02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:18.650
<v Speaker 2>if you watch like the jungle book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shere Khan,</v>

2439
02:03:18.651 --> 02:03:23.030
<v Speaker 2>the tiger is portrayed as unfailingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>polite,</v>

2440
02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's just,</v>

2441
02:03:25.401 --> 02:03:27.350
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't need to prove himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2442
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:31.820
<v Speaker 2>So part of the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we are waiting for the strongest</v>

2443
02:03:31.821 --> 02:03:36.821
<v Speaker 2>voices to rise above the din and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2444
02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:41.540
<v Speaker 2>we can't be this aggressive about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything all the time.</v>

2445
02:03:41.710 --> 02:03:42.543
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to actually think what's a </v>

2446
02:03:44.451 --> 02:03:45.950
<v Speaker 2>misdemeanor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a felony,</v>

2447
02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:48.330
<v Speaker 2>what's a foot fault?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2448
02:03:48.590 --> 02:03:49.423
<v Speaker 2>So just to boil it all down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think there's any issue with </v>

2449
02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:56.180
<v Speaker 2>inviting women to take time off from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>memo that you didn't even disagree with?</v>

2450
02:03:57.020 --> 02:03:57.853
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely think that there's a </v>

2451
02:04:00.381 --> 02:04:01.214
<v Speaker 2>problem there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that that's the right </v>

2452
02:04:03.951 --> 02:04:07.160
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google sitting on a pile of cash.</v>

2453
02:04:07.161 --> 02:04:08.870
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't need all these people to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2454
02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.450
<v Speaker 2>They botched this thing as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell.</v>

2455
02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:13.730
<v Speaker 2>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why tell women take some time off?</v>

2456
02:04:13.731 --> 02:04:14.564
<v Speaker 2>You just got assaulted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were just attacked by some horrible </v>

2457
02:04:18.201 --> 02:04:21.890
<v Speaker 2>thing that doesn't discourage or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourages diversity.</v>

2458
02:04:22.710 --> 02:04:26.000
<v Speaker 2>That discourages the right thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be to retain demore.</v>

2459
02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to say,</v>

2460
02:04:28.941 --> 02:04:29.774
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to be able to talk about this </v>

2461
02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:31.993
<v Speaker 2>without silencing each other with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying each other without assuming </v>

2462
02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:37.190
<v Speaker 2>that we've heard the other's argument.</v>

2463
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.093
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps some public speeches where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have people opposes ideas and have them </v>

2464
02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:41.153
<v Speaker 2>discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2465
02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2466
02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.073
<v Speaker 2>and make it public so that maybe people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can learn from it instead of making it </v>

2467
02:04:45.661 --> 02:04:50.661
<v Speaker 2>this gigantic campaign against one guy's</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea and just destroying his credibility</v>

2468
02:04:52.261 --> 02:04:57.261
<v Speaker 2>in a very sort of perverse way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about just google has youtube,</v>

2469
02:04:57.300 --> 02:04:58.133
<v Speaker 2>they have all the resources in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn this into an educational </v>

2470
02:05:01.711 --> 02:05:02.640
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2471
02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the big problem was firing demore.</v>

2472
02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:07.253
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with what that did was it puts </v>

2473
02:05:08.411 --> 02:05:09.300
<v Speaker 2>out a precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2474
02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:10.493
<v Speaker 2>here's how this game should go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you hear somebody say genotype </v>

2475
02:05:13.891 --> 02:05:17.220
<v Speaker 2>versus phenotype complain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2476
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.353
<v Speaker 2>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When something makes you uncomfortable </v>

2477
02:05:19.861 --> 02:05:20.694
<v Speaker 2>about psychometrics complaint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody starts to agree with the </v>

2478
02:05:24.511 --> 02:05:25.344
<v Speaker 2>implicit association tests and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't own their own bigotry and bias </v>

2479
02:05:29.641 --> 02:05:30.710
<v Speaker 2>complain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2480
02:05:31.210 --> 02:05:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Well that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2481
02:05:32.911 --> 02:05:33.744
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of the same type of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>that got your brother in hot water in </v>

2482
02:05:38.191 --> 02:05:41.610
<v Speaker 2>Evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm trying to get at is that we</v>

2483
02:05:41.690 --> 02:05:44.580
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we who understand this problem,</v>

2484
02:05:44.581 --> 02:05:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I think better than others and are </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to talk about it in public,</v>

2485
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:48.893
<v Speaker 2>are losing empathy because we're so sick</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being worn down by these terrible </v>

2486
02:05:54.571 --> 02:05:55.050
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>

2487
02:05:55.050 --> 02:05:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2488
02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:58.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we,</v>

2489
02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:01.380
<v Speaker 2>can we pop all the way back up to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>original point about Islam?</v>

2490
02:06:01.410 --> 02:06:02.243
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2491
02:06:05.630 --> 02:06:06.463
<v Speaker 2>You asked the question why does the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemingly weirdly supportive of </v>

2492
02:06:11.841 --> 02:06:14.630
<v Speaker 2>practices that include female genital </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutilation,</v>

2493
02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>honor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing a terror,</v>

2494
02:06:17.481 --> 02:06:18.181
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

2495
02:06:18.181 --> 02:06:19.014
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it has to do with the fact </v>

2496
02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:24.133
<v Speaker 2>that there is a fundamental inability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss these issues because nobody has </v>

2497
02:06:32.111 --> 02:06:36.760
<v Speaker 2>given us the right tools and language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the issue of Political Judaism,</v>

2498
02:06:36.761 --> 02:06:41.761
<v Speaker 2>political Christianity in political </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam is one category.</v>

2499
02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:44.920
<v Speaker 2>And then there's just sort of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaism,</v>

2500
02:06:44.921 --> 02:06:47.110
<v Speaker 2>cultural Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cultural Christianity.</v>

2501
02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Now quite honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2502
02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:53.793
<v Speaker 2>you can easily be embedded in a Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>community that is not devoted to </v>

2503
02:06:58.691 --> 02:06:59.524
<v Speaker 2>political Islam and feel that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>very much in another abrahamic faith </v>

2504
02:07:03.491 --> 02:07:06.910
<v Speaker 2>similar to Christianity and Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

2505
02:07:06.970 --> 02:07:11.970
<v Speaker 2>there is a much bigger issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that Islam has a totality to it</v>

2506
02:07:12.130 --> 02:07:12.963
<v Speaker 2>that Judaism no longer has and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity perhaps never had a Sam </v>

2507
02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Harris points the out the line render </v>
<v Speaker 2>unto Caesar what is Caesar's,</v>

2508
02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:22.553
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaves off the potential for political </v>

2509
02:07:24.791 --> 02:07:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Christianity at the same level as </v>
<v Speaker 2>political Islam.</v>

2510
02:07:28.031 --> 02:07:28.864
<v Speaker 2>So you're dealing with this different </v>
<v Speaker 2>object that doesn't quite seem to have </v>

2511
02:07:32.021 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 2>the same characteristics as the others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you haven't been given tools to sort</v>

2512
02:07:36.221 --> 02:07:37.054
<v Speaker 2>of pull it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've also been taught that if you're </v>

2513
02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:45.170
<v Speaker 2>proud of European civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2514
02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:49.600
<v Speaker 2>that you are like pro white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white is irrelevant to me.</v>

2515
02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:50.493
<v Speaker 2>I care about European civilization just </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I care about European barbarity </v>

2516
02:07:53.890 --> 02:07:55.750
<v Speaker 2>having sat through European barbarity.</v>

2517
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna give up on European </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

2518
02:07:58.890 --> 02:07:59.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2519
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:03.160
<v Speaker 2>so in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in part what you have is you have people</v>

2520
02:08:03.161 --> 02:08:08.161
<v Speaker 2>who are making the vanilla confusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they imagine that vanilla,</v>

2521
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:10.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we use it to mean the absence of </v>

2522
02:08:12.041 --> 02:08:12.874
<v Speaker 2>anything interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in fact it's like the most </v>

2523
02:08:15.401 --> 02:08:17.140
<v Speaker 2>interesting spice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's this,</v>

2524
02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.960
<v Speaker 2>it's this particular orchid that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly flavorful.</v>

2525
02:08:20.290 --> 02:08:22.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a linguistic mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2526
02:08:22.901 --> 02:08:26.500
<v Speaker 2>white is that to European civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no attachment to my whiteness.</v>

2527
02:08:26.501 --> 02:08:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I could care less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't care less.</v>

2528
02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:32.050
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a huge attachment to Newton,</v>

2529
02:08:32.770 --> 02:08:37.000
<v Speaker 2>to Mozart to the terrible things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

2530
02:08:37.001 --> 02:08:38.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2531
02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:39.233
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the killing lands in the mid 20th </v>

2532
02:08:41.321 --> 02:08:42.440
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2533
02:08:42.850 --> 02:08:44.290
<v Speaker 2>so the evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good,</v>

2534
02:08:44.590 --> 02:08:46.090
<v Speaker 2>the imperialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guilt,</v>

2535
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:51.430
<v Speaker 2>like that tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very resonant with the good,</v>

2536
02:08:51.431 --> 02:08:53.860
<v Speaker 2>the bad and the ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is my tradition.</v>

2537
02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:56.950
<v Speaker 2>So when I meet somebody coming from </v>
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>

2538
02:08:56.951 --> 02:08:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I expect them to be an exponent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese culture.</v>

2539
02:09:00.010 --> 02:09:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wish to say,</v>

2540
02:09:01.781 --> 02:09:02.614
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the right to have my own </v>

2541
02:09:03.491 --> 02:09:07.620
<v Speaker 2>culture because I have to erase myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2542
02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:09.003
<v Speaker 2>based on this confusion between this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canon that is incredibly value will and </v>

2543
02:09:13.331 --> 02:09:15.610
<v Speaker 2>the skin color that is completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant to me.</v>

2544
02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:16.503
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would much rather have western </v>

2545
02:09:18.791 --> 02:09:19.624
<v Speaker 2>civilization running between the ears of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't look anything like me </v>

2546
02:09:24.730 --> 02:09:25.420
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2547
02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:27.940
<v Speaker 2>be proud of what the software has </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced.</v>

2548
02:09:28.690 --> 02:09:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

2549
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:31.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of people who look like me </v>

2550
02:09:32.351 --> 02:09:33.184
<v Speaker 2>who don't think in any way that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize wherever the original point </v>

2551
02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:36.993
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does the left wider progressive's </v>

2552
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:42.910
<v Speaker 2>fail to criticize the homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sexism,</v>

2553
02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:45.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the honor killings,</v>

2554
02:09:45.250 --> 02:09:47.680
<v Speaker 2>all the horrific acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about.</v>

2555
02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about a particular example.</v>

2556
02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Rolla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of him?</v>

2557
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:52.623
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Revolutionary Afghan Women's </v>

2558
02:09:54.370 --> 02:09:55.203
<v Speaker 2>Association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the,</v>

2559
02:09:56.050 --> 02:09:58.330
<v Speaker 2>these are the most bad ass chicks on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

2560
02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>They are the ones who taught little </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls under the Taliban.</v>

2561
02:10:01.630 --> 02:10:04.150
<v Speaker 2>They are Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are proud Afghan women.</v>

2562
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:05.803
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have Afghan men who risked their </v>

2563
02:10:07.301 --> 02:10:09.100
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are people who take their lives in</v>

2564
02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:12.880
<v Speaker 2>their own hands to educate women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the most repressive places on</v>

2565
02:10:12.881 --> 02:10:17.881
<v Speaker 2>earth that is Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are Muslims right now.</v>

2566
02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:22.630
<v Speaker 2>My point is I try to get people </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in,</v>

2567
02:10:22.631 --> 02:10:23.464
<v Speaker 2>won't you take the side of the Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>who hold your values or the values </v>

2568
02:10:29.670 --> 02:10:30.503
<v Speaker 2>closest to yours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is where we get into trouble </v>

2569
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:34.633
<v Speaker 2>because for some reason we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive that there is almost an </v>

2570
02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:44.231
<v Speaker 2>intellectual civil war within Islam with</v>
<v Speaker 2>forces for modernity and forces that are</v>

2571
02:10:44.781 --> 02:10:47.270
<v Speaker 2>trying to reboot a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2572
02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:48.770
<v Speaker 2>from original texts.</v>

2573
02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:49.793
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So do you think that we associate Islam </v>

2574
02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:54.113
<v Speaker 6>with maybe even a smaller faction of it </v>
<v Speaker 6>than we really understand like the isis </v>

2575
02:10:58.321 --> 02:10:59.760
<v Speaker 6>faction,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2576
02:10:59.770 --> 02:11:00.630
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2577
02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:04.100
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Taliban like thing,</v>

2578
02:11:04.110 --> 02:11:05.630
<v Speaker 6>things that were terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2579
02:11:05.670 --> 02:11:07.680
<v Speaker 6>people that are throwing gay folks off </v>
<v Speaker 6>buildings,</v>

2580
02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:10.910
<v Speaker 2>we saw how weirdly view them as more </v>
<v Speaker 2>authentic.</v>

2581
02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2582
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:13.663
<v Speaker 2>in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't want to go against the </v>

2583
02:11:14.631 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 2>authentic in aversions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like for example,</v>

2584
02:11:17.391 --> 02:11:18.224
<v Speaker 2>the hobbyist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sort of Saudi Arabian variant I never </v>

2585
02:11:21.351 --> 02:11:22.184
<v Speaker 2>thought was going to be influential over</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan because South Asians tended to </v>

2586
02:11:25.701 --> 02:11:27.100
<v Speaker 2>look down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2587
02:11:27.590 --> 02:11:28.120
<v Speaker 2>but with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2588
02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:32.120
<v Speaker 2>all of this money that's been spent a </v>
<v Speaker 2>exporting the sort of,</v>

2589
02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:36.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly text oriented,</v>

2590
02:11:36.711 --> 02:11:39.500
<v Speaker 2>very literal interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2591
02:11:39.690 --> 02:11:40.523
<v Speaker 2>I think we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've gone down a terrible path where </v>

2592
02:11:42.321 --> 02:11:43.700
<v Speaker 2>we've sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdly,</v>

2593
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not understood that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict and that we actually have a dog</v>

2594
02:11:48.861 --> 02:11:50.090
<v Speaker 2>in this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the dog,</v>

2595
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:51.223
<v Speaker 2>in this fight is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who are trying to create cultural </v>

2596
02:11:55.281 --> 02:11:56.114
<v Speaker 2>Islam and cleaving off political Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live under Sharia law </v>

2597
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:02.143
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to feel bad about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live under anybody's </v>

2598
02:12:04.761 --> 02:12:05.594
<v Speaker 2>religious law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anyone to live under </v>

2599
02:12:06.531 --> 02:12:07.364
<v Speaker 2>Halakhic Jewish law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a mainstay of Western </v>

2600
02:12:11.661 --> 02:12:14.690
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we can't feel comfortable about</v>

2601
02:12:14.691 --> 02:12:15.231
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

2602
02:12:15.231 --> 02:12:16.064
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you to say whether we should </v>

2603
02:12:16.611 --> 02:12:17.870
<v Speaker 2>live in under sharia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Law?</v>

2604
02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come from a culture myself.</v>

2605
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:23.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I have no culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my culture.</v>

2606
02:12:23.181 --> 02:12:25.580
<v Speaker 2>We do not live under religious law </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

2607
02:12:25.581 --> 02:12:26.414
<v Speaker 2>The end.</v>

2608
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:27.313
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating to me how very how many</v>
<v Speaker 6>different ID allowed ideologies exist </v>

2609
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:33.343
<v Speaker 6>and how much they vary in how people can</v>
<v Speaker 6>just slot right into those and accept </v>

2610
02:12:37.161 --> 02:12:42.161
<v Speaker 6>them as the end all be all period and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's to me,</v>

2611
02:12:42.351 --> 02:12:45.740
<v Speaker 6>just from a evolutionary psychology </v>
<v Speaker 6>standpoint,</v>

2612
02:12:45.741 --> 02:12:46.574
<v Speaker 6>just looking at the broad spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 6>different ideologies that people slot </v>

2613
02:12:50.631 --> 02:12:52.700
<v Speaker 6>into.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so fascinating.</v>

2614
02:12:52.701 --> 02:12:53.534
<v Speaker 6>It's so fascinating how many different </v>
<v Speaker 6>mindsets that people adhere to that are </v>

2615
02:12:57.711 --> 02:13:01.610
<v Speaker 6>unwavering and rigid and how common it </v>
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>

2616
02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:04.700
<v Speaker 6>It's so uncommon to not have an </v>
<v Speaker 6>ideology.</v>

2617
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:05.833
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems like this idea of what will </v>

2618
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:12.020
<v Speaker 6>will the numbers that we have of </v>
<v Speaker 6>atheists and agnostics in America today,</v>

2619
02:13:12.021 --> 02:13:13.330
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is this unprecedented?</v>

2620
02:13:13.331 --> 02:13:14.164
<v Speaker 6>Is this the most,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the largest group of human beings ever </v>

2621
02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:19.670
<v Speaker 6>that are looking at things and going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe nobody has the answer.</v>

2622
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:21.350
<v Speaker 6>Maybe this isn't the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2623
02:13:21.351 --> 02:13:21.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2624
02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2625
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:23.263
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that a lot of those </v>

2626
02:13:24.441 --> 02:13:25.274
<v Speaker 2>agnostics and atheists have more </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious leanings than they'll open up </v>

2627
02:13:30.530 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>to and a lot more of the folks</v>

2628
02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:36.480
<v Speaker 3>are able to run the atheist agnostic </v>
<v Speaker 3>program almost perfectly,</v>

2629
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:38.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between their ears as well.</v>

2630
02:13:38.581 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's as clean as let's </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2631
02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:42.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam [inaudible],</v>

2632
02:13:42.690 --> 02:13:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris might make a difference what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to get to next.</v>

2633
02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:46.163
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that so many people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheists and agnostics adopt religious </v>

2634
02:13:51.151 --> 02:13:51.984
<v Speaker 3>tendencies in terms of cultural behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what they're willing to accept and </v>

2635
02:13:55.231 --> 02:13:56.064
<v Speaker 3>not willing to set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except a lot of the stuff that you see </v>

2636
02:13:58.651 --> 02:13:59.484
<v Speaker 3>that you're calling earlier when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were saying people that describe racism </v>

2637
02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:03.480
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

2638
02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:08.480
<v Speaker 3>do you describe it as power and </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence these cult member ideas?</v>

2639
02:14:10.110 --> 02:14:10.943
<v Speaker 3>You're a lot of times getting these cult</v>
<v Speaker 3>member ideas from people that will tell </v>

2640
02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you that they're not a part of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>

2641
02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:17.843
<v Speaker 3>They're not religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're exhibiting dogmatic </v>

2642
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:24.900
<v Speaker 3>religious ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was my question is,</v>

2643
02:14:24.930 --> 02:14:25.763
<v Speaker 3>is it just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing that we are inherently </v>

2644
02:14:29.491 --> 02:14:30.950
<v Speaker 3>programmed to slot into?</v>

2645
02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2646
02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:32.341
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2647
02:14:32.341 --> 02:14:33.174
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the big point where when Jordan </v>

2648
02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:38.213
<v Speaker 3>Peterson and Sam Harris got into it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time on Sam show that was so </v>

2649
02:14:40.771 --> 02:14:41.790
<v Speaker 3>confused and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2650
02:14:41.791 --> 02:14:45.090
<v Speaker 3>it was confusing and Sam would have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have appeared to have won that one</v>

2651
02:14:45.091 --> 02:14:45.924
<v Speaker 3>pretty decisively because Jordan tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fold in fitness to the definition of </v>

2652
02:14:49.831 --> 02:14:51.240
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does not work,</v>

2653
02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:54.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan's point,</v>

2654
02:14:54.151 --> 02:14:57.570
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was really deep and I don't think he did</v>

2655
02:14:57.571 --> 02:14:58.730
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2656
02:14:58.770 --> 02:15:01.080
<v Speaker 3>the service it needed to be to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2657
02:15:01.230 --> 02:15:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I think there would have been better off</v>
<v Speaker 3>in person.</v>

2658
02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:08.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't like conversations where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are talking on skype and I've refused so</v>

2659
02:15:08.431 --> 02:15:09.264
<v Speaker 3>far to do any podcast where I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the person because I believe </v>

2660
02:15:11.821 --> 02:15:13.700
<v Speaker 3>that the eye contact too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2661
02:15:13.710 --> 02:15:14.543
<v Speaker 3>it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done one so far that it was with </v>

2662
02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:18.533
<v Speaker 3>John Anthony West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that brilliant egyptologist and it just </v>

2663
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:23.330
<v Speaker 3>because he's was ill and he lives in New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York and it's just hard to get.</v>

2664
02:15:23.370 --> 02:15:24.590
<v Speaker 3>It was awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2665
02:15:24.610 --> 02:15:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I do it if I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in general,</v>

2666
02:15:27.241 --> 02:15:28.074
<v Speaker 3>it's like how many fights have happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>over unicode and asked exactly just bad </v>

2667
02:15:33.670 --> 02:15:34.503
<v Speaker 3>message board fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of them would even take place </v>

2668
02:15:36.601 --> 02:15:38.440
<v Speaker 3>when you were looking at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to each other.</v>

2669
02:15:38.730 --> 02:15:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Tone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tone,</v>

2670
02:15:40.111 --> 02:15:40.944
<v Speaker 3>social cues is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely with video conferencing </v>

2671
02:15:43.351 --> 02:15:46.850
<v Speaker 3>is that you find that you're staring </v>
<v Speaker 3>right above the person's eyes.</v>

2672
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:48.230
<v Speaker 3>So there's no trust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2673
02:15:48.650 --> 02:15:49.483
<v Speaker 3>So it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I was going to say is that </v>

2674
02:15:51.001 --> 02:15:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson's really deep point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I understand it.</v>

2675
02:15:55.021 --> 02:15:55.860
<v Speaker 3>So Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're out there,</v>

2676
02:15:55.861 --> 02:16:00.861
<v Speaker 3>please correct me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm his only archetype of the kind found</v>

2677
02:16:03.211 --> 02:16:04.044
<v Speaker 3>in religion is sufficiently rich and </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep to explain why humans behave the </v>

2678
02:16:08.941 --> 02:16:12.150
<v Speaker 3>way they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no scientific theory that's good</v>

2679
02:16:12.151 --> 02:16:13.920
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no purely logical.</v>

2680
02:16:13.921 --> 02:16:15.960
<v Speaker 3>There's no purely philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition.</v>

2681
02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 3>So as of the moment we're stuck with </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep cultural archetype.</v>

2682
02:16:21.210 --> 02:16:22.043
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Shakespeare would be the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing comparable to the religious </v>

2683
02:16:24.841 --> 02:16:25.674
<v Speaker 3>cannons and the claim that you're making</v>
<v Speaker 3>implicitly in the Jordan is making </v>

2684
02:16:29.291 --> 02:16:34.291
<v Speaker 3>perhaps more explicitly is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about our brains maybe that we</v>

2685
02:16:34.811 --> 02:16:35.644
<v Speaker 3>were parented and so we need to give the</v>
<v Speaker 3>parenting apparatus over to something </v>

2686
02:16:38.801 --> 02:16:39.634
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2687
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:43.270
<v Speaker 3>That fundamentally finds its way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

2688
02:16:44.350 --> 02:16:45.183
<v Speaker 3>Even if the computer that is our brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows that it's making leaps that don't </v>

2689
02:16:49.541 --> 02:16:51.310
<v Speaker 3>make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old are your kids?</v>

2690
02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Mine are 12 and 15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

2691
02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:55.293
<v Speaker 3>when you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you see things that are you and your </v>

2692
02:17:00.311 --> 02:17:02.620
<v Speaker 3>wife and wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

2693
02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:06.730
<v Speaker 3>how much of this is genetics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of this is them mimicking their</v>

2694
02:17:06.731 --> 02:17:08.620
<v Speaker 3>environment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of it as both.</v>

2695
02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:10.593
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the Sui generis stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that comes from God knows where that I </v>

2696
02:17:13.211 --> 02:17:15.010
<v Speaker 3>have no idea cut into their head at all.</v>

2697
02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:16.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

2698
02:17:17.490 --> 02:17:20.050
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>books and I mean don't,</v>

2699
02:17:20.051 --> 02:17:22.540
<v Speaker 3>don't discount individual invention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2700
02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:23.820
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That too.</v>

2701
02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:29.220
<v Speaker 3>So I believe that my son who's 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm has gravitated very strongly towards</v>

2702
02:17:31.421 --> 02:17:33.280
<v Speaker 3>Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2703
02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:37.030
<v Speaker 3>so we go to services.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he believes in a technical</v>

2704
02:17:37.031 --> 02:17:38.890
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he enjoys the service.</v>

2705
02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2706
02:17:39.911 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many of us just don't.</v>

2707
02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the music is beautiful sentiments.</v>

2708
02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:45.400
<v Speaker 3>The richness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2709
02:17:45.401 --> 02:17:49.120
<v Speaker 3>coming back to Jordan's point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

2710
02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Part of it was like hearing during a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>

2711
02:17:51.350 --> 02:17:52.183
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in like a star wars drama or </v>

2712
02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:59.280
<v Speaker 3>you're in Kung Fu panda and don't let go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some.</v>

2713
02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:01.071
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2714
02:18:01.071 --> 02:18:05.110
<v Speaker 3>you're going to a place whether it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>temple or a chapel or you know,</v>

2715
02:18:05.111 --> 02:18:05.944
<v Speaker 3>you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This place is uniquely ornate </v>

2716
02:18:09.610 --> 02:18:10.630
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2717
02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:12.430
<v Speaker 3>we have particular words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

2718
02:18:12.431 --> 02:18:13.660
<v Speaker 3>the rabbis tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2719
02:18:13.661 --> 02:18:17.530
<v Speaker 3>we usually don't say this because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is what we have stolen from the angels,</v>

2720
02:18:17.850 --> 02:18:18.683
<v Speaker 3>but this was the one time in the year </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we can actually shout it and it's </v>

2721
02:18:22.090 --> 02:18:27.090
<v Speaker 3>potent staff potent and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna to your original point.</v>

2722
02:18:27.850 --> 02:18:30.850
<v Speaker 3>So you have some weird tradition that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes no sense.</v>

2723
02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:31.713
<v Speaker 3>That produces it ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportionate number of the Nobel </v>

2724
02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:37.600
<v Speaker 3>prizes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say in science.</v>

2725
02:18:37.890 --> 02:18:40.360
<v Speaker 3>You would it be scientific to throw that</v>
<v Speaker 3>away?</v>

2726
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:42.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2727
02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you were a good scientist,</v>

2728
02:18:44.351 --> 02:18:45.184
<v Speaker 3>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on with these </v>

2729
02:18:45.821 --> 02:18:47.020
<v Speaker 3>weird rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2730
02:18:47.050 --> 02:18:48.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be the funky chicken,</v>

2731
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:50.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the Hokey Pokey,</v>

2732
02:18:50.111 --> 02:18:51.480
<v Speaker 3>but something is made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2733
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:52.323
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if most of the people who win Nobel </v>

2734
02:18:53.591 --> 02:18:55.660
<v Speaker 3>prizes were founded to do the Hokey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pokey,</v>

2735
02:18:55.661 --> 02:18:58.270
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably put more effort into it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not.</v>

2736
02:18:58.950 --> 02:19:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not attached to the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>that spawn from these religions at all.</v>

2737
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:05.823
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's that these people have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom to think about these other </v>

2738
02:19:08.591 --> 02:19:09.424
<v Speaker 3>things because they have intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence in their future and their </v>

2739
02:19:12.101 --> 02:19:12.934
<v Speaker 3>destiny and their God and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions and their ethics and their </v>

2740
02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:18.040
<v Speaker 3>also carved out that this.</v>

2741
02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:18.873
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought of religion in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways is almost being like a moral </v>

2742
02:19:21.221 --> 02:19:22.580
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2743
02:19:22.630 --> 02:19:24.850
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you got like a real clear structure</v>

2744
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:28.310
<v Speaker 3>to operate under and that that gives you</v>
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>

2745
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:31.130
<v Speaker 3>It gives you a frees up resources to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>

2746
02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:32.613
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is is that the atheist </v>

2747
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:37.783
<v Speaker 3>critique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like there is no bearded dude </v>

2748
02:19:39.741 --> 02:19:43.740
<v Speaker 3>in a cloud granting your wishes are </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to what you know,</v>

2749
02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:46.310
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my answer to you know,</v>

2750
02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:49.730
<v Speaker 3>because everybody who says there's No </v>
<v Speaker 3>God and nothing happens when you die,</v>

2751
02:19:49.731 --> 02:19:50.564
<v Speaker 3>like you don't know that to say that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>no different than someone saying they </v>

2752
02:19:53.391 --> 02:19:54.224
<v Speaker 3>know for sure there's a god in the cloud</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a harp and St Peter and you to go </v>

2753
02:19:57.450 --> 02:19:59.270
<v Speaker 3>look at a list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we conjure art,</v>

2754
02:19:59.530 --> 02:20:01.850
<v Speaker 3>if we conjure Sam and we tried to steal </v>
<v Speaker 3>me and sam,</v>

2755
02:20:01.851 --> 02:20:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Sam will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2756
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:06.050
<v Speaker 3>but there's all these explicit ways that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to worship God.</v>

2757
02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:07.573
<v Speaker 3>They can't all be right because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>mutual incompatibilities and so how do </v>

2758
02:20:09.861 --> 02:20:11.930
<v Speaker 3>you choose one among many and if and </v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

2759
02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:12.891
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2760
02:20:12.891 --> 02:20:13.724
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

2761
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:14.743
<v Speaker 3>None of this is the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is deep archetype is its own </v>

2762
02:20:18.171 --> 02:20:19.004
<v Speaker 3>thing and the mind seeks deep archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's white cares about the godfather </v>

2763
02:20:23.811 --> 02:20:27.470
<v Speaker 3>pictures differently than home alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Home alone is not deep archetype,</v>

2764
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:30.440
<v Speaker 3>godfather pictures or deep archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2765
02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I'm on Kung Fu.</v>

2766
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:34.760
<v Speaker 3>Kung Fu panda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like white on rice.</v>

2767
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:35.623
<v Speaker 3>That is deep archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are actually pretty God damn good </v>

2768
02:20:37.821 --> 02:20:39.170
<v Speaker 3>movies now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the first one.</v>

2769
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:41.720
<v Speaker 3>The second one is not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My kids liked it.</v>

2770
02:20:42.210 --> 02:20:45.480
<v Speaker 3>They're younger than yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't hide behind my kids.</v>

2771
02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Just I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it.</v>

2772
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed the lego movies,</v>

2773
02:20:50.181 --> 02:20:52.400
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I've never seen.</v>

2774
02:20:52.401 --> 02:20:55.640
<v Speaker 3>All of them are not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This last Ninjago one's not bad.</v>

2775
02:20:56.270 --> 02:21:00.140
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that just messing me.</v>

2776
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:05.780
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of fucking dumb shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I like though.</v>

2777
02:21:05.930 --> 02:21:06.900
<v Speaker 3>That said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2778
02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:07.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

2779
02:21:07.631 --> 02:21:10.580
<v Speaker 3>A lot of dumb shit musically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's some dumb shit that Jaylen Kiss?</v>

2780
02:21:11.290 --> 02:21:16.290
<v Speaker 3>That is dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then man,</v>

2781
02:21:17.391 --> 02:21:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm on my way to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll throw on.</v>

2782
02:21:19.101 --> 02:21:21.590
<v Speaker 3>I was made for loving you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>

2783
02:21:23.810 --> 02:21:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not so bad.</v>

2784
02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:28.070
<v Speaker 3>But I prefer angus young in school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy Pay.</v>

2785
02:21:28.090 --> 02:21:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like him as well.</v>

2786
02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2787
02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:33.160
<v Speaker 3>I like all kinds of music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2788
02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:36.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder when it comes to archetypes,</v>

2789
02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:37.333
<v Speaker 3>whether or not when I was getting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was talking about your sons and </v>

2790
02:21:41.061 --> 02:21:41.894
<v Speaker 3>your children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not their behavior is </v>

2791
02:21:43.191 --> 02:21:45.650
<v Speaker 3>genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's learned experience,</v>

2792
02:21:45.651 --> 02:21:47.030
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a combination of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

2793
02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:50.600
<v Speaker 3>how much of what we have is just in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2794
02:21:50.601 --> 02:21:51.434
<v Speaker 3>this sort of inclination towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies is because pretty much </v>

2795
02:21:55.821 --> 02:22:00.821
<v Speaker 3>everybody had them for the thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of years that we</v>

2796
02:22:00.951 --> 02:22:01.784
<v Speaker 3>had civilization and we are in some way </v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or form the product of all that </v>

2797
02:22:07.191 --> 02:22:08.690
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even genetically,</v>

2798
02:22:08.770 --> 02:22:11.810
<v Speaker 3>like whatever memories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't totally understand genetics,</v>

2799
02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:16.700
<v Speaker 3>but what I do understand is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot that we don't know about why ideas</v>

2800
02:22:16.701 --> 02:22:20.120
<v Speaker 3>get transferred from father to son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from children,</v>

2801
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:23.540
<v Speaker 3>from parents to children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's things that get transferred.</v>

2802
02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Even two adopted kids that come directly</v>

2803
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:29.430
<v Speaker 6>from their parents in a very eerie way </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you go,</v>

2804
02:22:29.431 --> 02:22:30.264
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where did,</v>

2805
02:22:30.390 --> 02:22:32.550
<v Speaker 6>is there some like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our instincts,</v>

2806
02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:33.443
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why are children are afraid of spiders </v>

2807
02:22:34.831 --> 02:22:36.720
<v Speaker 6>and monsters?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what is that?</v>

2808
02:22:36.721 --> 02:22:37.554
<v Speaker 6>Is it because at one point in time </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone near them was killed by a big </v>

2809
02:22:40.741 --> 02:22:42.000
<v Speaker 6>cat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2810
02:22:42.001 --> 02:22:43.670
<v Speaker 6>thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2811
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:44.543
<v Speaker 6>back when we were living in these </v>
<v Speaker 6>environments where we were preyed upon </v>

2812
02:22:48.091 --> 02:22:49.410
<v Speaker 6>by predators.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2813
02:22:49.411 --> 02:22:51.120
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are the reasons why?</v>

2814
02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:53.550
<v Speaker 6>And Rupert sheldrake had a great point </v>
<v Speaker 6>about that.</v>

2815
02:22:54.180 --> 02:22:56.550
<v Speaker 6>If you talk to children in New York </v>
<v Speaker 6>City,</v>

2816
02:22:56.970 --> 02:22:57.803
<v Speaker 6>they're not afraid of child molesters or</v>
<v Speaker 6>murderers or things that they might </v>

2817
02:23:00.991 --> 02:23:05.940
<v Speaker 6>encounter a car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're afraid of monsters like w why?</v>

2818
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.983
<v Speaker 6>What is a monster and that monster may </v>
<v Speaker 6>very well be the memory or the ancient </v>

2819
02:23:11.551 --> 02:23:13.790
<v Speaker 6>genetic memory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's this.</v>

2820
02:23:14.010 --> 02:23:15.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think if you look at,</v>

2821
02:23:15.091 --> 02:23:16.860
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the evil stepmother,</v>

2822
02:23:17.250 --> 02:23:18.210
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's real too,</v>

2823
02:23:18.211 --> 02:23:18.420
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2824
02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:18.990
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2825
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:22.230
<v Speaker 6>but what was that about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably it had to do with the fact that</v>

2826
02:23:22.231 --> 02:23:25.320
<v Speaker 6>the first thing that you want to teach </v>
<v Speaker 6>your children is,</v>

2827
02:23:25.321 --> 02:23:26.154
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I'm not around and daddy remarries </v>

2828
02:23:28.701 --> 02:23:31.290
<v Speaker 6>somebody who has no interest in you </v>
<v Speaker 6>genetically,</v>

2829
02:23:32.130 --> 02:23:35.520
<v Speaker 6>here's the emergency break glass in case</v>
<v Speaker 6>of emergency plan.</v>

2830
02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:36.990
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a little of that,</v>

2831
02:23:36.991 --> 02:23:37.824
<v Speaker 6>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many times does that play out where </v>

2832
02:23:40.321 --> 02:23:43.850
<v Speaker 6>someone has to tell that story because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so common.</v>

2833
02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:45.510
<v Speaker 6>We all know it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all know the story.</v>

2834
02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:46.553
<v Speaker 6>I have a good friend of mine who was </v>
<v Speaker 6>essentially tortured by a stepfather or </v>

2835
02:23:49.981 --> 02:23:51.570
<v Speaker 6>throughout growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2836
02:23:51.790 --> 02:23:56.310
<v Speaker 6>it has a horrific life story and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>just one of a million,</v>

2837
02:23:56.311 --> 02:23:59.300
<v Speaker 6>one of millions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But sometimes what we do is we,</v>

2838
02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:03.510
<v Speaker 6>we sort of go obliquely at these things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>

2839
02:24:03.511 --> 02:24:05.580
<v Speaker 6>in Little Red Riding Hood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2840
02:24:06.210 --> 02:24:08.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is the Fox Fox or there's the wolf,</v>

2841
02:24:08.701 --> 02:24:09.380
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a wolf.</v>

2842
02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:12.420
<v Speaker 6>A wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The wolf actually wolf stand in.</v>

2843
02:24:13.410 --> 02:24:14.243
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a wolf because throughout </v>

2844
02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:18.450
<v Speaker 6>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fourth fucking thousands of years.</v>

2845
02:24:18.570 --> 02:24:19.403
<v Speaker 6>Wolves preyed on the wolf is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 6>creepy in this kind of thing because </v>

2846
02:24:22.891 --> 02:24:24.630
<v Speaker 6>wolves are clever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2847
02:24:24.810 --> 02:24:25.643
<v Speaker 6>Do you know that in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in I think the early 14 hundreds wolves </v>

2848
02:24:28.861 --> 02:24:31.380
<v Speaker 6>killed something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what was the number,</v>

2849
02:24:31.410 --> 02:24:36.410
<v Speaker 6>some insane number of people in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like 14 people were killed by wolves.</v>

2850
02:24:37.011 --> 02:24:37.500
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know.</v>

2851
02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:40.530
<v Speaker 6>In Paris they're starting to show up in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Paris again.</v>

2852
02:24:40.590 --> 02:24:43.520
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was her fucking dangerous land?</v>

2853
02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:44.453
<v Speaker 6>It will look.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think everybody that everybody </v>

2854
02:24:46.090 --> 02:24:46.923
<v Speaker 6>respects the wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're clever yesterday about </v>

2855
02:24:48.901 --> 02:24:49.734
<v Speaker 6>wolves is they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have some sort of template for the </v>

2856
02:24:51.991 --> 02:24:54.630
<v Speaker 6>better to see you with my dear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2857
02:24:54.631 --> 02:24:57.630
<v Speaker 6>Because he was being clever mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

2858
02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:59.490
<v Speaker 6>but you asked the question about </v>
<v Speaker 6>predators.</v>

2859
02:24:59.590 --> 02:25:01.770
<v Speaker 6>Somebody the big bad wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the three pigs.</v>

2860
02:25:01.771 --> 02:25:04.490
<v Speaker 6>It's all wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of wolves and ancient folk</v>

2861
02:25:04.491 --> 02:25:05.324
<v Speaker 6>lore and stay the fuck out of the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always stay out of the woods </v>

2862
02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:09.970
<v Speaker 6>because there's wolves in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2863
02:25:10.730 --> 02:25:12.780
<v Speaker 6>So what's the woods is in central park?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2864
02:25:12.781 --> 02:25:15.210
<v Speaker 6>it's real woods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People live near the fucking woods.</v>

2865
02:25:15.211 --> 02:25:17.910
<v Speaker 6>They weren't new doors and those kinds </v>
<v Speaker 6>of cities.</v>

2866
02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:20.670
<v Speaker 6>When they wrote these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the grimm brothers were around,</v>

2867
02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.710
<v Speaker 6>there was no central park,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2868
02:25:23.130 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All I'm</v>

2869
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:24.813
<v Speaker 3>suggesting is that a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>information comes coated so that it </v>

2870
02:25:27.761 --> 02:25:30.490
<v Speaker 3>doesn't point to directly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

2871
02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:33.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe stepmothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zircons and wolves are dangerous.</v>

2872
02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Stepmothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take no responsibility for this man.</v>

2873
02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:39.573
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of amazing stepmothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now let's say 30 seconds worth of </v>

2874
02:25:42.041 --> 02:25:43.200
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wonderful step,</v>

2875
02:25:43.201 --> 02:25:48.100
<v Speaker 3>but there's amazing step mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's obviously some monsters.</v>

2876
02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:51.190
<v Speaker 3>There's obviously some monster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just to your point,</v>

2877
02:25:51.210 --> 02:25:52.640
<v Speaker 3>it's not always step mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>step father.</v>

2878
02:25:52.641 --> 02:25:56.620
<v Speaker 3>The question is what happens when Mommy </v>
<v Speaker 3>or daddy remarries?</v>

2879
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:59.500
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2880
02:25:59.710 --> 02:26:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Often it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2881
02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:02.133
<v Speaker 3>And why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of this issue about genetic </v>

2882
02:26:03.881 --> 02:26:05.790
<v Speaker 3>relatedness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sure to you,</v>

2883
02:26:05.970 --> 02:26:08.230
<v Speaker 3>to your earlier question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was stunned.</v>

2884
02:26:08.290 --> 02:26:12.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think about 23 and me as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious test,</v>

2885
02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:17.140
<v Speaker 3>but when I sent my saliva off to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>analyzed,</v>

2886
02:26:17.141 --> 02:26:17.974
<v Speaker 3>it came back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were a Jew like 98 point six </v>

2887
02:26:20.861 --> 02:26:22.390
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I didn't.</v>

2888
02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:24.250
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know my religion was in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>saliva.</v>

2889
02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:25.690
<v Speaker 3>It didn't even occur to me.</v>

2890
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a.</v>

2891
02:26:29.530 --> 02:26:31.360
<v Speaker 3>But that's the weird thing about Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2892
02:26:31.390 --> 02:26:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Is that it's a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was also an ethnicity.</v>

2893
02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:35.193
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2894
02:26:35.230 --> 02:26:36.063
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is that all of these </v>

2895
02:26:37.211 --> 02:26:37.931
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2896
02:26:37.931 --> 02:26:42.931
<v Speaker 3>dietary restrictions or rules for who </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets to Mary,</v>

2897
02:26:43.410 --> 02:26:47.320
<v Speaker 3>at what level in the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you put your resources?</v>

2898
02:26:47.321 --> 02:26:50.470
<v Speaker 3>Are you proselytizing or do you try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live at steady state?</v>

2899
02:26:50.471 --> 02:26:51.304
<v Speaker 3>Do discourage people converting in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these things or some sort of toolkit </v>

2900
02:26:54.821 --> 02:26:57.840
<v Speaker 3>for living and it has produced more </v>
<v Speaker 3>physicists,</v>

2901
02:26:57.920 --> 02:26:59.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

2902
02:26:59.611 --> 02:27:00.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2903
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:02.680
<v Speaker 3>outfielders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2904
02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:05.020
<v Speaker 3>So it's not good at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

2905
02:27:05.050 --> 02:27:05.883
<v Speaker 3>Some things at the exclusion of others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the question about how does the </v>

2906
02:27:08.671 --> 02:27:09.504
<v Speaker 3>stuff co travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it co travels in some way that's very </v>

2907
02:27:13.811 --> 02:27:15.600
<v Speaker 3>mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2908
02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:18.460
<v Speaker 3>do we pass on trauma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2909
02:27:18.730 --> 02:27:19.563
<v Speaker 3>I can say in my family for sure that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>family stopped being religious when my </v>

2910
02:27:24.250 --> 02:27:28.480
<v Speaker 3>great uncle Sasha was killed right at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of World War Two.</v>

2911
02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:32.110
<v Speaker 3>And my great grandmother said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2912
02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:35.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate God would kill somebody so</v>

2913
02:27:35.471 --> 02:27:37.200
<v Speaker 3>stupidly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2914
02:27:37.690 --> 02:27:38.523
<v Speaker 3>who had so much to give to their family </v>
<v Speaker 3>and change the family from some kind of </v>

2915
02:27:41.981 --> 02:27:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Orthodoxy to Orthodox atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2916
02:27:45.450 --> 02:27:46.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for three generations you have Jews </v>

2917
02:27:47.471 --> 02:27:50.020
<v Speaker 3>marrying Jews with nobody believing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2918
02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Why are they continuing to marry Jews?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they celebrating these holidays?</v>

2919
02:27:54.191 --> 02:27:55.024
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because fundamentally a switch got </v>

2920
02:27:57.671 --> 02:27:59.770
<v Speaker 3>flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my guess is that the Orthodox,</v>

2921
02:27:59.771 --> 02:28:01.840
<v Speaker 3>we're always questioning whether there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a god.</v>

2922
02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:02.733
<v Speaker 3>The atheists are always questioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether there's a god at some level </v>

2923
02:28:05.861 --> 02:28:10.850
<v Speaker 3>because our brains are not just simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers to be know,</v>

2924
02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:13.960
<v Speaker 3>rid of bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have particular needs.</v>

2925
02:28:13.961 --> 02:28:14.794
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my four things that I care about our </v>

2926
02:28:16.601 --> 02:28:19.600
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fitness meaning and grace,</v>

2927
02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 3>all of those tradeoff amongst</v>

2928
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.903
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I said something like this on </v>

2929
02:28:23.721 --> 02:28:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Sam Sam Harris's program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the people who wrote in said,</v>

2930
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2931
02:28:28.250 --> 02:28:31.930
<v Speaker 2>shows that he doesn't care about truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2932
02:28:31.931 --> 02:28:33.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like no,</v>

2933
02:28:33.141 --> 02:28:36.260
<v Speaker 2>it just shows that you guys don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how important.</v>

2934
02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:38.150
<v Speaker 2>What is the argument?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand the argument,</v>

2935
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.823
<v Speaker 2>Sam would like to make an argument that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the better and more rational our </v>

2936
02:28:43.941 --> 02:28:44.774
<v Speaker 2>thinking is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it can do everything that </v>

2937
02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:51.410
<v Speaker 2>religion once did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you've had a dmt or lsd experience</v>

2938
02:28:51.411 --> 02:28:53.810
<v Speaker 2>that can give you meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendence,</v>

2939
02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:55.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2940
02:28:55.791 --> 02:28:58.940
<v Speaker 2>if you can think your way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately through a problem,</v>

2941
02:28:58.941 --> 02:29:01.520
<v Speaker 2>that should increase your fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2942
02:29:01.521 --> 02:29:02.354
<v Speaker 2>maybe grace is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent and you have to figure out </v>

2943
02:29:05.361 --> 02:29:07.570
<v Speaker 2>whether that's important to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a choice that an,</v>

2944
02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:08.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an elected.</v>

2945
02:29:09.130 --> 02:29:09.963
<v Speaker 2>I'm objective and my belief is that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of these things are actually preset </v>

2946
02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:16.070
<v Speaker 2>and that there's more antagonism between</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2947
02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:18.590
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of myself as an atheist,</v>

2948
02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:23.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's only because there's a room in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind that I try to keep very,</v>

2949
02:29:23.751 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 2>very clean and analytical that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of make the first among equals,</v>

2950
02:29:28.310 --> 02:29:30.830
<v Speaker 2>but I have needs for these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

2951
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are times when the truth doesn't </v>

2952
02:29:33.171 --> 02:29:36.140
<v Speaker 2>give me enough meaning and I'll start </v>
<v Speaker 2>storytelling.</v>

2953
02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:37.881
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2954
02:29:37.881 --> 02:29:38.810
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're surrounded.</v>

2955
02:29:38.811 --> 02:29:40.250
<v Speaker 2>We've got to fight our way out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2956
02:29:40.251 --> 02:29:41.870
<v Speaker 2>like all that kind of narrative.</v>

2957
02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:44.373
<v Speaker 6>So Joseph Campbell's type stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't you think that there'd been the </v>

2958
02:29:46.770 --> 02:29:48.400
<v Speaker 6>end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's lessons to be learned in those,</v>

2959
02:29:48.401 --> 02:29:49.090
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's.</v>

2960
02:29:49.090 --> 02:29:53.590
<v Speaker 6>And there's meaning in all those stories</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's a longing that we have for a</v>

2961
02:29:53.591 --> 02:29:56.650
<v Speaker 6>lot of those hero's journey type </v>
<v Speaker 6>narratives.</v>

2962
02:29:57.130 --> 02:29:57.963
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but truth is significantly more </v>

2963
02:30:00.251 --> 02:30:03.670
<v Speaker 6>important than just these lessons that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we learned from hero's journeys.</v>

2964
02:30:03.671 --> 02:30:06.630
<v Speaker 6>Like learning the lessons is important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're fascinating.</v>

2965
02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:09.100
<v Speaker 6>They're interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The stories are amazing.</v>

2966
02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:10.113
<v Speaker 6>But what's really going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what biological processes are </v>

2967
02:30:14.441 --> 02:30:16.990
<v Speaker 6>responsible for certain types of </v>
<v Speaker 6>behavior.</v>

2968
02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:17.790
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

2969
02:30:17.790 --> 02:30:22.060
<v Speaker 6>what really is happening to human bodies</v>
<v Speaker 6>under certain conditions.</v>

2970
02:30:22.061 --> 02:30:22.894
<v Speaker 6>What is really happening to the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is really happening as far as the </v>

2971
02:30:25.551 --> 02:30:26.384
<v Speaker 6>mail.</v>

2972
02:30:26.470 --> 02:30:27.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Peter Teal critiques me on </v>

2973
02:30:28.881 --> 02:30:31.580
<v Speaker 2>this point just as you have where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says you eric,</v>

2974
02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:35.060
<v Speaker 2>under value and underweight the role of </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

2975
02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:37.880
<v Speaker 2>but I worry that we're not even having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

2976
02:30:37.881 --> 02:30:42.170
<v Speaker 2>If I think about my personal physics </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero rock,</v>

2977
02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:43.233
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the coyote came up with the </v>

2978
02:30:44.811 --> 02:30:48.200
<v Speaker 2>equation for the electron less well </v>
<v Speaker 2>known than the,</v>

2979
02:30:48.201 --> 02:30:51.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Einstein equations,</v>

2980
02:30:51.021 --> 02:30:51.854
<v Speaker 2>but arguably even more beautiful in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to predict that he needed a </v>

2981
02:30:57.081 --> 02:30:59.840
<v Speaker 2>positively charged in a negatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>charged particle.</v>

2982
02:30:59.841 --> 02:31:04.520
<v Speaker 2>And the only two known at the time with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the electron and the Proton to make up,</v>

2983
02:31:04.521 --> 02:31:07.040
<v Speaker 2>let's say a hydrogen atom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2984
02:31:07.610 --> 02:31:10.280
<v Speaker 2>the Proton is quite a bit heavier than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the electronic.</v>

2985
02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:11.953
<v Speaker 2>And so he told a story that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really true where the Proton was the </v>

2986
02:31:17.451 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 2>antiparticle of the electron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Heisenberg pointed</v>

2987
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:21.023
<v Speaker 3>out that couldn't be because the masses </v>
<v Speaker 3>are too far off and they'd have to be </v>

2988
02:31:23.251 --> 02:31:24.550
<v Speaker 3>equal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2989
02:31:24.551 --> 02:31:28.830
<v Speaker 3>a short time later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anti electron positron that is,</v>

2990
02:31:28.831 --> 02:31:29.664
<v Speaker 3>was found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess by Anderson at Caltech in the </v>

2991
02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:34.760
<v Speaker 3>early thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then an anti-proton was created some</v>

2992
02:31:34.761 --> 02:31:39.120
<v Speaker 3>time later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it turned out that the story had more</v>

2993
02:31:39.121 --> 02:31:42.330
<v Speaker 3>meaning than the exact version of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

2994
02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:44.093
<v Speaker 3>So the story was sort of more true than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the version of the story that was </v>

2995
02:31:47.191 --> 02:31:48.024
<v Speaker 3>originally told.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I could tell you a similar story </v>

2996
02:31:49.501 --> 02:31:50.970
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Einstein.</v>

2997
02:31:50.971 --> 02:31:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I could tell it to you with Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2998
02:31:53.940 --> 02:31:55.330
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2999
02:31:55.530 --> 02:31:56.363
<v Speaker 3>didn't fully understand the implications</v>
<v Speaker 3>of his theory as is evidenced by his </v>

3000
02:32:00.061 --> 02:32:03.270
<v Speaker 3>screwing up a particular kind of orchid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3001
02:32:03.271 --> 02:32:05.100
<v Speaker 3>in his later work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3002
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:08.190
<v Speaker 3>not understanding that his theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely explained that orchid.</v>

3003
02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:12.720
<v Speaker 3>So there's all sorts of ways in which we</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the truth wrong.</v>

3004
02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:13.553
<v Speaker 3>The first several times we try it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the meaning of the story that we </v>

3005
02:32:17.911 --> 02:32:22.911
<v Speaker 3>tell somehow remains intact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's a very difficult</v>

3006
02:32:23.101 --> 02:32:24.810
<v Speaker 3>lesson for people who just want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3007
02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:25.973
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3008
02:32:26.010 --> 02:32:27.180
<v Speaker 3>like fineman would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3009
02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:29.700
<v Speaker 3>if experiment disagrees with you than </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>

3010
02:32:31.020 --> 02:32:33.480
<v Speaker 3>And it's a very appealing story to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people,</v>

3011
02:32:33.481 --> 02:32:34.314
<v Speaker 3>but it's also worth noting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] never got a physical law of </v>

3012
02:32:36.811 --> 02:32:37.644
<v Speaker 3>nature and it may be that he was too </v>
<v Speaker 3>wedded to this kind of rude judgment of </v>

3013
02:32:44.401 --> 02:32:46.430
<v Speaker 3>the unforgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3014
02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:51.440
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine you were to innovate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Brazilian Jujitsu the first few times</v>

3015
02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:54.900
<v Speaker 3>it might not actually work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you told yourself a story,</v>

3016
02:32:54.901 --> 02:32:55.101
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3017
02:32:55.101 --> 02:32:56.910
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is actually genius,</v>

3018
02:32:56.911 --> 02:32:57.960
<v Speaker 3>and it's working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

3019
02:32:57.961 --> 02:33:00.390
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just lost three consecutive bouts.</v>

3020
02:33:01.170 --> 02:33:02.003
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that may give you the ability to </v>

3021
02:33:03.031 --> 02:33:04.500
<v Speaker 3>eventually perfect the move.</v>

3022
02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:05.453
<v Speaker 3>Perfect the technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you were lying to yourself </v>

3023
02:33:07.890 --> 02:33:09.810
<v Speaker 3>during the period in which it was being </v>
<v Speaker 3>set up,</v>

3024
02:33:09.811 --> 02:33:12.840
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit like the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between scaffolding and a building.</v>

3025
02:33:13.530 --> 02:33:17.370
<v Speaker 3>And too often people who are crazy about</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth rejects scaffolding,</v>

3026
02:33:17.730 --> 02:33:20.940
<v Speaker 3>which is an intermediate stage in </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to the final truth.</v>

3027
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:21.833
<v Speaker 3>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that analogy is that </v>

3028
02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:26.370
<v Speaker 3>some techniques work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just don't work for you.</v>

3029
02:33:26.490 --> 02:33:27.323
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why they don't work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you is you don't know them good enough </v>

3030
02:33:29.011 --> 02:33:30.450
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right or not.</v>

3031
02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:32.400
<v Speaker 3>You can eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:33.421
<v Speaker 3>We have a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

3033
02:33:33.421 --> 02:33:35.010
<v Speaker 3>We can just wrap this up if you're that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hungry.</v>

3034
02:33:35.490 --> 02:33:36.900
<v Speaker 3>We're on the homestretch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy.</v>

3035
02:33:36.901 --> 02:33:39.150
<v Speaker 3>We got seven more minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't take it anymore.</v>

3036
02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:42.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Insulin lower issues.</v>

3037
02:33:43.780 --> 02:33:45.560
<v Speaker 3>I crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3038
02:33:45.570 --> 02:33:46.680
<v Speaker 3>let me just wrap this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

3039
02:33:47.610 --> 02:33:49.860
<v Speaker 3>this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a really fun conversation.</v>

3040
02:33:49.890 --> 02:33:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Really feel like that eating that bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely has changed the butter.</v>

3041
02:33:54.121 --> 02:33:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Crashed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you.</v>

3042
02:33:55.571 --> 02:33:57.840
<v Speaker 3>You were so hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to eat in the middle of talking.</v>

3043
02:33:58.290 --> 02:34:00.960
<v Speaker 3>I was told I could go to the bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>here to go to.</v>

3044
02:34:01.170 --> 02:34:02.003
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said you could do it for like six </v>

3045
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:04.583
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go fucking crazy when you hear people </v>

3046
02:34:05.671 --> 02:34:06.504
<v Speaker 3>chewing on the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the number one thing that people </v>

3047
02:34:08.341 --> 02:34:11.460
<v Speaker 3>complain about on this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I apologize to them.</v>

3048
02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:12.533
<v Speaker 3>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had these fight companion podcast </v>

3049
02:34:14.131 --> 02:34:14.964
<v Speaker 3>and people fucking potato chips and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're eating potato chips on the </v>

3050
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:18.220
<v Speaker 3>podcast and I just would get</v>

3051
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:23.320
<v Speaker 1>my twitter would be filled with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking furious so slightly.</v>

3052
02:34:23.321 --> 02:34:25.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is hang in there too.</v>

3053
02:34:25.301 --> 02:34:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotTa.</v>

3054
02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Be comfortable being uncomfortable like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple minutes.</v>

3055
02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:32.133
<v Speaker 1>I can do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was gonna say is that analogy is </v>

3056
02:34:35.921 --> 02:34:38.500
<v Speaker 1>not the best analogy because some things</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

3057
02:34:38.501 --> 02:34:42.370
<v Speaker 1>They just don't work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm one of the analogies as used in</v>

3058
02:34:42.371 --> 02:34:43.204
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jujitsu is like someone will </v>
<v Speaker 1>try a technique and it doesn't work for </v>

3059
02:34:46.211 --> 02:34:46.751
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

3060
02:34:46.751 --> 02:34:47.890
<v Speaker 1>well that took me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no good.</v>

3061
02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:48.910
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3062
02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:51.880
<v Speaker 1>well you know that head kicks work </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3063
02:34:51.881 --> 02:34:54.310
<v Speaker 1>You've seen people kick people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head and knocked them unconscious.</v>

3064
02:34:54.311 --> 02:34:55.144
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3065
02:34:55.470 --> 02:34:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Try to kick me in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3066
02:34:56.681 --> 02:34:57.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to kick people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

3067
02:34:58.060 --> 02:34:58.893
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I show you how well you're not </v>

3068
02:35:00.691 --> 02:35:01.540
<v Speaker 1>gonna be able to do it.</v>

3069
02:35:01.570 --> 02:35:02.810
<v Speaker 1>If I show you how to kick people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

3070
02:35:02.811 --> 02:35:04.780
<v Speaker 1>do you think you gonna be able to kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that actually knows how to fight</v>

3071
02:35:04.781 --> 02:35:05.980
<v Speaker 1>and ed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3072
02:35:06.350 --> 02:35:08.260
<v Speaker 1>They're going to move that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to see it coming.</v>

3073
02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:09.153
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>

3074
02:35:09.170 --> 02:35:10.003
<v Speaker 1>Be too slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have your neural </v>

3075
02:35:11.191 --> 02:35:14.530
<v Speaker 1>pathways carved to the point where that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing just slices right in there.</v>

3076
02:35:14.770 --> 02:35:16.000
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to know how to set it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

3077
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have the confidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the experience to execute it.</v>

3078
02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:21.993
<v Speaker 1>The difference between that and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is very different because it </v>

3079
02:35:23.921 --> 02:35:28.921
<v Speaker 1>doesn't require some sort of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>process for you to master before you can</v>

3080
02:35:29.351 --> 02:35:34.030
<v Speaker 1>execute it with sufficient prowess to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be successful.</v>

3081
02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:37.270
<v Speaker 1>While I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has to do with placeholder truth.</v>

3082
02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3083
02:35:38.471 --> 02:35:42.010
<v Speaker 1>the famous example of tricky gnosis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pork,</v>

3084
02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:46.150
<v Speaker 1>where if you believe that God hates </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who eat the pig,</v>

3085
02:35:46.650 --> 02:35:48.130
<v Speaker 1>do you think that's what that's about?</v>

3086
02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about tricking most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3087
02:35:49.661 --> 02:35:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Or various other parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3088
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:52.543
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3089
02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you know how long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3090
02:35:57.611 --> 02:35:58.530
<v Speaker 1>malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3091
02:35:58.690 --> 02:36:00.790
<v Speaker 1>bad air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shellfish,</v>

3092
02:36:01.570 --> 02:36:02.920
<v Speaker 1>red tide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3093
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't eat shellfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3094
02:36:04.270 --> 02:36:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So all of these things have to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite sure that I can explain to</v>

3095
02:36:09.251 --> 02:36:10.084
<v Speaker 1>you why this is a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's have a placeholder and then </v>

3096
02:36:13.691 --> 02:36:17.710
<v Speaker 1>we'll refine it over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come to understand what it is that we're</v>

3097
02:36:17.890 --> 02:36:18.723
<v Speaker 1>doing less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're rigid with our ideology and we'd </v>

3098
02:36:20.831 --> 02:36:21.664
<v Speaker 1>go buy some ancient scripture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient scripture says that anything </v>

3099
02:36:24.311 --> 02:36:26.200
<v Speaker 1>with a cloven hooves that eats its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>cud.</v>

3100
02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:27.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's all these weird laws like </v>

3101
02:36:29.231 --> 02:36:30.640
<v Speaker 1>this is your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you're allowed to eat.</v>

3102
02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:31.773
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're not allowed to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except that that's very often not how </v>

3103
02:36:34.211 --> 02:36:35.044
<v Speaker 1>things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my fear is is that it's a little bit </v>

3104
02:36:39.731 --> 02:36:44.110
<v Speaker 1>the emily latella effect on religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the atheist concept of a religious</v>

3105
02:36:44.111 --> 02:36:49.111
<v Speaker 1>person is usually the sort of robot that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just looks right and in fact,</v>

3106
02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:55.480
<v Speaker 1>what you often find is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewarded for brilliance in a religion by</v>

3107
02:36:55.481 --> 02:36:58.030
<v Speaker 1>not having to follow the rules nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>closely.</v>

3108
02:36:58.060 --> 02:36:58.893
<v Speaker 1>If you become adept at argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like really Christian </v>

3109
02:37:01.241 --> 02:37:02.074
<v Speaker 1>people with a cross tattooed on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be right and you make some </v>

3110
02:37:06.311 --> 02:37:07.270
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well for example,</v>

3111
02:37:07.330 --> 02:37:08.163
<v Speaker 1>in Islam contract marriage where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to get married for a few hours so </v>

3112
02:37:12.251 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 1>that you can set your urges with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife who</v>

3113
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:18.410
<v Speaker 3>then becomes not your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A short time later,</v>

3114
02:37:18.770 --> 02:37:23.770
<v Speaker 3>your arbitrage in the letter of the law </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the need.</v>

3115
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:25.363
<v Speaker 3>For some sort of a human realism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they have contract marriages where </v>

3116
02:37:27.951 --> 02:37:29.570
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get married for a day.</v>

3117
02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really sweet.</v>

3118
02:37:32.290 --> 02:37:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody should do that.</v>

3119
02:37:34.611 --> 02:37:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Just to find out what the hell that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person's really like.</v>

3120
02:37:37.070 --> 02:37:38.780
<v Speaker 3>You don't know anybody until you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually marry him.</v>

3121
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.903
<v Speaker 3>Once it was shacked up with them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're living for awhile and they have </v>

3122
02:37:42.651 --> 02:37:43.990
<v Speaker 3>access to your money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you want.</v>

3123
02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Then you get to find out what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>really like.</v>

3124
02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.030
<v Speaker 3>One point 6 billion people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>considering your words right now.</v>

3125
02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:52.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's a good thing or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad thing.</v>

3126
02:37:52.131 --> 02:37:52.964
<v Speaker 3>I do think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that many people live in </v>

3127
02:37:54.090 --> 02:37:56.270
<v Speaker 3>this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're okay.</v>

3128
02:37:57.060 --> 02:37:58.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a situation I think in,</v>

3129
02:37:58.851 --> 02:37:59.684
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the late [inaudible] in Israel where </v>

3130
02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:05.520
<v Speaker 3>people were using bread crumbs to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3131
02:38:05.521 --> 02:38:06.354
<v Speaker 3>as bait.</v>

3132
02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:07.370
<v Speaker 3>And the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

3133
02:38:07.371 --> 02:38:12.320
<v Speaker 3>does that invalidate the entire water </v>
<v Speaker 3>supply of Israel during Passover?</v>

3134
02:38:12.380 --> 02:38:16.010
<v Speaker 3>And so rabbi rabbis had to be convened </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you know,</v>

3135
02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:19.610
<v Speaker 3>pay the sufficient amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genius level rabbis could figure out why</v>

3136
02:38:19.611 --> 02:38:21.830
<v Speaker 3>it was okay to drink the water during </v>
<v Speaker 3>Passover.</v>

3137
02:38:22.330 --> 02:38:23.163
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the issue of getting around your own </v>

3138
02:38:24.741 --> 02:38:29.741
<v Speaker 3>rules is a time honored religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition where,</v>

3139
02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:32.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any book that is not a book for,</v>

3140
02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:36.090
<v Speaker 3>for living in survival and thriving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3141
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:37.063
<v Speaker 3>is consigned to the dustbin of history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the fact that these things have </v>

3142
02:38:40.131 --> 02:38:40.964
<v Speaker 3>been around for so long in general means</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have their own means of </v>

3143
02:38:45.111 --> 02:38:49.610
<v Speaker 3>evading these self extinguishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs that would seem to doom them.</v>

3144
02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them,</v>

3145
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:55.520
<v Speaker 3>those self extinguishing programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they evaded is through fear,</v>

3146
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:56.361
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3147
02:38:56.361 --> 02:38:59.870
<v Speaker 3>isn't that the fear by Isel cheating on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

3148
02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:00.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3149
02:39:00.711 --> 02:39:02.720
<v Speaker 3>And so the is of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3150
02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:05.540
<v Speaker 3>if you attack on Yom Kippor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3151
02:39:05.930 --> 02:39:07.880
<v Speaker 3>does that mean you can't fight back </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you should.</v>

3152
02:39:07.970 --> 02:39:09.620
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be atoning for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>sins.</v>

3153
02:39:09.621 --> 02:39:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to survive,</v>

3154
02:39:10.881 --> 02:39:12.890
<v Speaker 3>you're going to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight on Yom Kippor.</v>

3155
02:39:12.930 --> 02:39:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about Ramadan?</v>

3156
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:17.060
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody,</v>

3157
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:19.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it were so easy to defeat people,</v>

3158
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:20.663
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using their own religious traditions </v>

3159
02:39:21.621 --> 02:39:22.620
<v Speaker 3>against them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3160
02:39:22.900 --> 02:39:24.950
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't know the name of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions and we wouldn't,</v>

3161
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:26.930
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't know the genius of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>

3162
02:39:26.931 --> 02:39:29.220
<v Speaker 3>How many did we lose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many religions,</v>

3163
02:39:29.221 --> 02:39:32.470
<v Speaker 3>if we forgot what they were and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe and Ted's excellent religion.</v>

3164
02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:36.840
<v Speaker 3>I would ever just didn't make the cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3165
02:39:36.841 --> 02:39:37.674
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many from epic of Gilgamesh from </v>

3166
02:39:39.681 --> 02:39:42.230
<v Speaker 3>those days I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would guess tons.</v>

3167
02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:44.600
<v Speaker 3>What'd they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the heaven's gate?</v>

3168
02:39:44.690 --> 02:39:45.523
<v Speaker 3>Remember the Nike's that killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves when the comment or the self </v>

3169
02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:51.190
<v Speaker 3>castrating yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3170
02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.033
<v Speaker 3>The one guy who led it was a self </v>
<v Speaker 3>cashiering issue with the Shaker </v>

3171
02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:56.053
<v Speaker 3>furniture that they were down to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>one or there were three shakers at some </v>

3172
02:39:59.481 --> 02:40:00.314
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there was like one and they were </v>

3173
02:40:01.071 --> 02:40:02.100
<v Speaker 3>accepting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No note,</v>

3174
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:04.610
<v Speaker 3>no new recruits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My favorite is the amish.</v>

3175
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:07.250
<v Speaker 3>They have that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that called Rom scholar?</v>

3176
02:40:07.251 --> 02:40:11.300
<v Speaker 3>What does that crazy thing go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go nuts for like a year from spring</v>

3177
02:40:11.301 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 3>it out is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one year where they just</v>

3178
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:16.470
<v Speaker 1>go fucking hog wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to follow the rules,</v>

3179
02:40:16.471 --> 02:40:19.080
<v Speaker 1>and then they usually feel so lost and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disconnected that they,</v>

3180
02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:22.200
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the majority of them returned to</v>

3181
02:40:22.201 --> 02:40:23.790
<v Speaker 1>being amish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

3182
02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:24.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3183
02:40:24.271 --> 02:40:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure find their way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning man.</v>

3184
02:40:27.130 --> 02:40:28.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they go that kind of now,</v>

3185
02:40:28.281 --> 02:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's more like booze and ACDC</v>
<v Speaker 1>type nuts.</v>

3186
02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:33.990
<v Speaker 1>They just fuck a lot and get crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw rocks.</v>

3187
02:40:34.580 --> 02:40:35.413
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look for the Amish camp </v>

3188
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:38.640
<v Speaker 1>next year.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Exceeded my expectations.</v>

3190
02:40:42.091 --> 02:40:44.490

<v Speaker 1>this more often,</v>
