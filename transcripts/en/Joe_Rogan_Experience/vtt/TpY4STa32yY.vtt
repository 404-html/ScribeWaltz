33
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>and I appreciate all your suggestions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know people get harsh with the </v>

34
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.441
<v Speaker 1>criticisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is that's your real </v>

35
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:48.441
<v Speaker 1>opinion and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

36
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:48.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I've got a thick skin.</v>

38
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I've been in show business for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and most people have been saying I </v>

39
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>suck ever since day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get used to it.</v>

40
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>But I think all your criticisms are </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid.</v>

41
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're working on the production quality.</v>

42
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>We have real microphones now of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this and then we also have.</v>

43
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to hold onto this for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

44
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>We bought some serious sennheiser </v>
<v Speaker 1>microphones just like you would use in a</v>

45
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:15.231
<v Speaker 1>recording studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of the day when all is </v>

46
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:18.881
<v Speaker 1>said and done alcohol swabs to clean </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit off and make it all nice.</v>

47
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to,</v>

48
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I guess get nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

49
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>so we're turning this thing into a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a production studio.</v>

50
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have cameras on tripods </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole deal.</v>

51
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And I'm stealing a page out of Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kumi.</v>

52
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:38.931
<v Speaker 1>His book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Kumiai is one of the dudes from </v>

53
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:38.931
<v Speaker 1>opiod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony.</v>

54
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Super Cool Guy and he does a bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio show from his house.</v>

55
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

56
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the ones that gave me really</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first inspiration to do it because I</v>

57
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>saw his son up and he set up his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad ass.</v>

58
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't set up basically just like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real radio show,</v>

59
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like real jam and microphones and </v>

60
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.080
<v Speaker 1>he has a backdrop and a green screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm basically stealing anthony's idea</v>

61
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.520
<v Speaker 2>with his blessing and with all due </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit to Mr Kumi,</v>

62
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I should add something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like a hot tub or something </v>

63
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.240
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony is do when you were with us in </v>

67
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.251
<v Speaker 3>to so you can carry a gun everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird when they brought it up </v>

68
00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:19.251
<v Speaker 3>because everyone else in the room was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

69
00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:19.251
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

70
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.180
<v Speaker 2>they were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all concerned about him.</v>

71
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.240
<v Speaker 2>They're all worried that he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go bananas and kill a bunch of people </v>

72
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.240

73
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.660

<v Speaker 3>If you bring a gun into a room,</v>

74
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:31.710
<v Speaker 3>even if you're comfortable with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun,</v>

80
00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:44.361

<v Speaker 2>yourself because there's a lot of crazy </v>

81
00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:44.730
<v Speaker 2>flux out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but carrying one everywhere.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

137
00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:09.470

<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

138
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 2>they're talking for like four hours at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

141
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I got to talk about it because I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very crazy,</v>

142
00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:22.840
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're following it </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

143
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.760
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't know,</v>

144
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 3>tell us what was supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tito was just arrested for allegedly </v>

145
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.160
<v Speaker 3>beating up Jenna Jamison and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he came out and said,</v>

146
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:35.140
<v Speaker 3>I never hit her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has a big.</v>

147
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Oxy was Oxycontin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxycontin problems,</v>

148
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's fucked up on drugs and that's </v>

149
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I thought,</v>

150
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was watching this clip on tmz</v>

151
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.860
<v Speaker 3>where it was Jenna saying he did not </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat me up.</v>

152
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.290
<v Speaker 3>We had a altercation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

153
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.840
<v Speaker 3>but he did not beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are thinking he's a wife beater.</v>

154
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Then like a half hour later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour later,</v>

155
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Tito puts out a press conference saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

156
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.630
<v Speaker 3>she is fucked up on Oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then immediately her story now is </v>

157
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.630
<v Speaker 3>wearing an arm brace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beat me up and threw me in a brace in</v>

158
00:07:07.631 --> 00:07:08.530
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in the beginning,</v>

159
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.070
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but saying that he beat me up and threw </v>

160
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.070
<v Speaker 3>me in a hot tub and all this,</v>

165
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:24.191
<v Speaker 3>so you should be allowed to throw her in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hot tub that comes along with a </v>

166
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:25.120

<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

172
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.330
<v Speaker 3>but it was kind of weird how the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>

173
00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

174
00:07:36.871 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 3>if she does have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have</v>

175
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.510
<v Speaker 2>that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible problem.</v>

176
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:43.980
<v Speaker 2>And I know a dude who had that problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time and he,</v>

177
00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:45.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got prescriptions from.</v>

178
00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:49.350
<v Speaker 2>He lived in Texas and he moved to La and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got prescriptions from both doctors.</v>

179
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.590
<v Speaker 2>You just couldn't help himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very self indulgent and he just got</v>

180
00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 2>whacked out on that Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it's,</v>

181
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.750
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get off and easy to get on.</v>

182
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you just start popping up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

183
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.310
<v Speaker 2>We've talked before on this show about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

184
00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:04.440
<v Speaker 2>and we'll just briefly say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't seen it,</v>

185
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:09.441
<v Speaker 2>just google the oxycontin express and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about how many people are </v>

186
00:08:10.651 --> 00:08:13.950
<v Speaker 2>addicted to this stuff in Florida where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wacky laws.</v>

187
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Florida doesn't have a database of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors,</v>

188
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 2>so the way my friend did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a prescription in Texas and he </v>

189
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.251
<v Speaker 2>got a prescription here in California </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he started using ballroom at </v>

190
00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:27.861
<v Speaker 2>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting both of them were filled and </v>

191
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:27.861
<v Speaker 2>I've got all fucking loony.</v>

192
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:28.470
<v Speaker 2>But in Florida you can go to like 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors.</v>

193
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a database of doctors.</v>

194
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's scary shit because it's like,</v>

195
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 2>for sure it's pharmaceutical companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They absolutely know what the fuck </v>

196
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.840
<v Speaker 2>they're doing with this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

197
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.870
<v Speaker 2>they've been accused and convicted or </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been proven rather than they lied </v>

198
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.850
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

199
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:50.851

<v Speaker 2>addiction qualities of Oxycontin that </v>

200
00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:52.170
<v Speaker 2>they knew and suppressed information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew that it was super,</v>

201
00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:53.040
<v Speaker 2>super addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

202
00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:58.041
<v Speaker 2>it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's heroin in a form when they call it </v>

203
00:08:58.041 --> 00:08:58.230

<v Speaker 2>that's really what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that she was going to leave him there.</v>

249
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

00:11:34.601 --> 00:11:37.301
<v Speaker 4>trying to get paid to and now he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just spilling the beans for just all </v>

<v Speaker 4>these magazines and he's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>his acting career and Larry King helped </v>

264
00:11:41.861 --> 00:11:45.341
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like kind of like Tito's telling the </v>

265
00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:46.370
<v Speaker 4>mother of his two children that my wife </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a meth meth head,</v>

266
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff like that.</v>

267
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.390
<v Speaker 4>Now that's kind of like breaking a weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of trust like,</v>

268
00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:55.391
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman that mother your two cheered </v>

269
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:55.391
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

270
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:55.391
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's on</v>

271
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Meth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>met Oxycontin,</v>

272
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 3>oxycontin or whatever.</v>

273
00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

274
00:11:58.381 --> 00:12:00.930
<v Speaker 2>I could see your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to help somebody,</v>

275
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe that would be the thing to do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it public.</v>

276
00:12:03.541 --> 00:12:06.390
<v Speaker 2>If someone's going wacky and accusing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you of doing shit that you didn't do,</v>

277
00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:11.391
<v Speaker 2>it's telling everybody the whole entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and trying to ruin that person's </v>

278
00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:11.430
<v Speaker 2>telling the whole entire world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a wife beater.</v>

279
00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 2>If that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

280
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.510
<v Speaker 2>but if you have a drug problem and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you love that person,</v>

281
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you know that then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

282
00:12:16.531 --> 00:12:17.430
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

283
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.880
<v Speaker 2>we both know people with drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we can't really talk about it,</v>

284
00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:23.070
<v Speaker 2>but we can't talk about people with drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

285
00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:25.260
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it interesting when someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a drug problem,</v>

286
00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:27.360
<v Speaker 2>like how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the interesting question is,</v>

287
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.020
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't know anybody that has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug problem out there,</v>

288
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.160
<v Speaker 2>well how lucky are you?</v>

289
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.400
<v Speaker 2>You're so lucky because it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfying things when you know someone </v>

290
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.881
<v Speaker 2>who's addicted to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known people that were addicted to </v>

291
00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:40.881
<v Speaker 2>gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:41.860
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of dudes that are addicted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pussy and that's real.</v>

293
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

294
00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:44.610
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things so they're not just trying to get</v>

295

<v Speaker 2>legs,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>

298
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.890
<v Speaker 2>there's drugs that will fucking for sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>take over someone's body.</v>

299
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.080
<v Speaker 2>And what do you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had the problem,</v>

300
00:12:55.081 --> 00:12:57.450
<v Speaker 2>we've had problems with friends of ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:12:57.451 --> 00:12:59.580
<v Speaker 2>like what do you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Johnny,</v>

302
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.450
<v Speaker 2>my best friend growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my good do that.</v>

303
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.680
<v Speaker 2>I used to play pool with and hang out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with in New York.</v>

304
00:13:04.681 --> 00:13:06.140
<v Speaker 2>He died from drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died.</v>

305
00:13:06.141 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 2>He was 33 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

306
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.940
<v Speaker 2>it could happen to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that fucks around with drugs </v>

307
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.140
<v Speaker 2>like Oxycontin's heroin and math and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that and coke.</v>

308
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.500
<v Speaker 2>You can get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you do?</v>

309
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you do if your friend gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught?</v>

310
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Your rat them out the fuck you do?</v>

311
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't think writing out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least not when you're in a situation </v>

312
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.581
<v Speaker 3>where you're not only writing out to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever authority you're reading them </v>

313
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:33.500
<v Speaker 3>out to every single person in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you're in a field where you are</v>

314
00:13:33.501 --> 00:13:36.230
<v Speaker 3>based off of your persona,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're an extrovert,</v>

315
00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:39.560
<v Speaker 3>she makes money if who she is and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing a role,</v>

316
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.100
<v Speaker 3>you think he fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it destroyed her,</v>

317
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:43.850
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:46.580
<v Speaker 3>tiger woods style with her in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

319
00:13:46.581 --> 00:13:48.410
<v Speaker 3>in front of everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of everything.</v>

320
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Her career and the mother</v>

321
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.070
<v Speaker 2>have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if he didn't do that,</v>

322
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.080
<v Speaker 2>let's just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just play devil's advocate.</v>

323
00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.320
<v Speaker 2>If he didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say that she just got super </v>

324
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.160
<v Speaker 2>dramatic and fell down and decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>call the cops.</v>

325
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe he grabbed her when she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something wacky and she fell down </v>

326
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:07.340
<v Speaker 2>and hurt herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just,</v>

327
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.121
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that happened that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly not defending anybody who </v>

328
00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 2>would do anything to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

329
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:17.510
<v Speaker 2>for no reason like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean anybody who loses their temper </v>

330
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:17.510
<v Speaker 2>and physically assaulted women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not defending that,</v>

331
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:22.170
<v Speaker 2>but I've been in situations where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have accused me of things that I haven't</v>

332
00:14:22.171 --> 00:14:27.171
<v Speaker 2>done and I know people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>accused of rape and I know you want to </v>

333
00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:27.171
<v Speaker 2>tell yourself.</v>

334
00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's us to luke.</v>

335
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Brian has a great store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

336
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of in the same situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day I,</v>

337
00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I dated a girl that was completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominate this a long time ago,</v>

338
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.720
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago.</v>

339
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.130
<v Speaker 3>I dated this girl that was a blackout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy drunk like every time,</v>

340
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like her parents were drunks since she </v>

341
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:48.210
<v Speaker 3>was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She black out every day,</v>

342
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:53.290
<v Speaker 3>just drank like boone's like five </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottles of beer machine when you were </v>

343
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.740
<v Speaker 3>dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say she was like 22,</v>

344
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty one,</v>

345
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 3>22,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

346
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:03.310
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I broke up with her because she uses </v>

<v Speaker 3>throw her outside.</v>

380
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.740
<v Speaker 3>I literally throw,</v>

382
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:17.401

<v Speaker 3>I just like pushed her out the front </v>

383
00:16:17.401 --> 00:16:17.401
<v Speaker 3>door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slammed the door,</v>

384
00:16:17.401 --> 00:16:21.030
<v Speaker 3>went upstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to bed and forgot all about </v>

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.590
<v Speaker 3>boulder.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you saw what if you saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit that she was doing in my.</v>

388
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.180
<v Speaker 3>I look out the door to see where she </v>
<v Speaker 3>went or not.</v>

389
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 3>I did not care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so upset because my.</v>

390
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I assume she would just start lighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>your house on fire.</v>

391
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think to a point I probably look </v>

392
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.951
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if like she walked down to her car </v>

<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

394
00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:49.260
<v Speaker 3>But what she did was go to my neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start banging on their door two in the </v>

395
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:49.260

<v Speaker 3>she could go through the phone book and </v>

464
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.580
<v Speaker 3>separate person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to say,</v>

465
00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:49.581
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went to high school together and </v>

466
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:49.581
<v Speaker 3>then they whispered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I had to go to this other view.</v>

467
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:50.070
<v Speaker 3>You but you got that off.</v>

468
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to go to court though.</v>

469
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next or what?</v>

470
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.980
<v Speaker 3>$10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

471
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Then finally what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dropped everything.</v>

472
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like $20,000</v>

473
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 3>worth of court fees going to court for </v>
<v Speaker 3>about two years.</v>

474
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:07.550
<v Speaker 3>They dropped everything for a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that ticket where you can go </v>

475
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>outside and just scream outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

476
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a minor ticket.</v>

477
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:12.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like a $50 tickets during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece.</v>

478
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disturbing the peace.</v>

479
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.320
<v Speaker 3>But it's called something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called something else.</v>

480
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.760
<v Speaker 3>But I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if any of these fucking.</v>

481
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 3>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Degenerates will know what that means.</v>

482
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

483
00:20:24.521 --> 00:20:26.550
<v Speaker 3>But so and so it got all that drop to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that end.</v>

484
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 3>The day Mr Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>9:30</v>

485
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's hear the real story.</v>

486
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.350
<v Speaker 3>You Chris Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bitch.</v>

487
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did know.</v>

488
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.930
<v Speaker 3>And what's funny is I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mugshot and in the mug shot,</v>

489
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.990
<v Speaker 3>I have a black guy and my nose is all </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up because she throws something </v>

490
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.490
<v Speaker 3>at me and hit me in the face and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know about it.</v>

491
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>So the moral of the story is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know crazy</v>

492
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.300
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck away from me.</v>

493
00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Disorderly conduct disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

494
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.820
<v Speaker 3>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the funniest thing is,</v>

495
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.920
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when I did that,</v>

496
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.350
<v Speaker 3>the next day after the trial where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended it and say,</v>

497
00:20:57.351 --> 00:20:58.370
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disorderly conduct,</v>

498
00:20:58.371 --> 00:20:59.310
<v Speaker 3>pay a ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

499
00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.380
<v Speaker 3>she called me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

500
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.450
<v Speaker 3>I want you to know I'm so sorry about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

501
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.700
<v Speaker 3>I actually didn't press charges or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

502
00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:07.190
<v Speaker 3>The police press charges and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't let me.</v>

503
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't drop the charges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The true,</v>

504
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.130
<v Speaker 3>true story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

505
00:21:10.131 --> 00:21:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I had nothing to do with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pissed off that night.</v>

506
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.720
<v Speaker 3>That's all that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to the cop.</v>

507
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.020
<v Speaker 2>It's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

508
00:21:16.021 --> 00:21:18.690
<v Speaker 2>that's the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is a part of the law.</v>

509
00:21:18.691 --> 00:21:21.810
<v Speaker 2>If you get accused of any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic violence,</v>

510
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.440
<v Speaker 2>the police have to try the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The law has to try the case.</v>

511
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't.</v>

512
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Woman can't just drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't drop domestic violent cases.</v>

513
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty nutty.</v>

514
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.880
<v Speaker 2>When you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the problem.</v>

515
00:21:32.881 --> 00:21:37.881
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up things to human beings for </v>

516
00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:37.881
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there should be last protect people,</v>

517
00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:40.230
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know who's telling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking truth.</v>

518
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.220
<v Speaker 2>And if you run in and bad circles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you hang out with crazy bitches,</v>

519
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you could have a bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

520
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.480
<v Speaker 3>So that's what sucks about this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing with them because they're </v>

521
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:51.480
<v Speaker 3>celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If all that shoot was on TMZ,</v>

522
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Tito and Jenna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all my shit was on TMZ.</v>

523
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 3>That would be great.</v>

524
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.390
<v Speaker 2>People would think that you're a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>beater.</v>

525
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already just told you.</v>

526
00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're probably half the people there.</v>

527
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Think I'm lying</v>

528
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.710
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a truck hit me.</v>

529
00:22:04.711 --> 00:22:09.711
<v Speaker 2>I have a check swing on me once and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>ducked under and grabbed her and then I </v>

530
00:22:09.711 --> 00:22:10.560
<v Speaker 2>calmed her down and then it got okay </v>
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>

531
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.410
<v Speaker 2>But I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

532
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.180
<v Speaker 2>never been in a situation where I hated </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody worlds with them.</v>

533
00:22:15.181 --> 00:22:17.610
<v Speaker 2>And I hated them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know people have man,</v>

534
00:22:17.611 --> 00:22:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I know people that are in relationships </v>
<v Speaker 2>with they fucking hate,</v>

535
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's almost always people that had </v>

536
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.791
<v Speaker 2>really fucked up parents and it's almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>always people that have parents that </v>

537
00:22:28.791 --> 00:22:32.991
<v Speaker 2>fought and for some reason they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's normal and especially when </v>

538
00:22:32.991 --> 00:22:36.921
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of like it because they think </v>

539
00:22:36.921 --> 00:22:37.320
<v Speaker 2>it makes them feel like an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're doing like adult type shit.</v>

540
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Like their parents did their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming and yelling at each other.</v>

541
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Like there's been many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when I was way,</v>

542
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.500
<v Speaker 2>way younger in my early days for how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grip on the type of girls to date type </v>

543
00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:48.810
<v Speaker 2>of girls.</v>

544
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.090
<v Speaker 2>If a girl is hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would date her.</v>

545
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.310
<v Speaker 2>It didn't matter if she yelled at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demean.</v>

546
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.800
<v Speaker 2>You had to be really fucked up for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>break up with,</v>

547
00:22:55.801 --> 00:23:00.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in Boston because it's so </v>

548
00:23:00.801 --> 00:23:03.060
<v Speaker 2>hard to get laid in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Boston if you're single,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I got all grinds.</v>

551

579
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Speaker 2>This is one people need to do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

580
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 2>you need to get your own shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like number one.</v>

581
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 2>You need to be a happy person and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

582
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:25.820
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't like weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's one thing that we'd is really</v>

583
00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:30.821
<v Speaker 2>good for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you smoke weed and get paranoid and </v>

584
00:24:30.821 --> 00:24:33.851
<v Speaker 2>you start freaking out about things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost always those things that you </v>

585
00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:37.750
<v Speaker 2>freaking out about are things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your subconscious that you're not </v>

586
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.141
<v Speaker 2>comfortable about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that had been bothering you </v>

587
00:24:41.141 --> 00:24:43.571
<v Speaker 2>for a long time and you've been trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to push them to the back of your head </v>

588
00:24:43.571 --> 00:24:44.200
<v Speaker 2>and when you smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is about pot,</v>

589
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.150
<v Speaker 2>especially when you get too hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

590
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:51.190
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a quality to marijuana that </v>

591
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 2>makes you think about shit that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppressing.</v>

592
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.980
<v Speaker 2>It makes you think about things from </v>
<v Speaker 2>your past that you don't like.</v>

593
00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.190
<v Speaker 2>It makes you think about like things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you did and it makes you think </v>

594
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.770
<v Speaker 2>about like your own issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

595
00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:04.880
<v Speaker 2>and especially like marijuana and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation tank together too.</v>

596
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.020
<v Speaker 2>You haven't even used my tag.</v>

597
00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Have you done the isolation tank lately?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been still doing?</v>

598
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always do it.</v>

599
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Want to do it last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was too tired to get up early in </v>

<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

612
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:43.950
<v Speaker 2>where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

614
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:52.390
<v Speaker 3>squatting your name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny is that when they </v>

615
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.350
<v Speaker 3>switch it over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just deleted Joe's Joe Rogan.net</v>

616
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:56.600

<v Speaker 3>and so I grabbed,</v>

618
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I noticed it right away and I grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

619
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.220
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't tell John looked at him </v>

<v Speaker 2>Somebody got my shit.</v>

621
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.290

<v Speaker 3>that was even going to do it.</v>

627
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.290

<v Speaker 3>you looked at the photo,</v>

628
00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:25.180

<v Speaker 3>the twitter,</v>

629
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.180
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the photo made his head </v>
<v Speaker 3>more tilted so it looked gay or.</v>

630
00:26:28.181 --> 00:26:30.010
<v Speaker 3>So you've been working with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like what?</v>

631
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

632
00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>May 7th,</v>

633
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 2>May 7th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a metropolis in Montreal.</v>

634
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.580
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about having crazy </v>

635
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:42.580
<v Speaker 2>people in your life and sex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation tanks,</v>

636
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 2>isolation tanks and get well about </v>
<v Speaker 2>having good,</v>

637
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.990
<v Speaker 2>good relationships like the best way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a good relationship.</v>

638
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be comfortable with who </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you are,</v>

639
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you've got a lot of issues,</v>

640
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:57.921
<v Speaker 2>a lot of stuff that's bothering you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that's going to fuck up any </v>

641
00:26:57.921 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 2>chance you have of communicating well </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other people because as soon as you</v>

642
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 2>get comfortable with another person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you first meet someone,</v>

643
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:07.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't really let them in and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of project who you want to be to </v>

644
00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.310
<v Speaker 2>this person and then the person does the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing to you.</v>

645
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 2>But after like a few months or few </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>

646
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:10.830
<v Speaker 2>depending on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

647
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:12.000
<v Speaker 2>how good your act is.</v>

648
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to know who the fuck they really</v>

649
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:16.470
<v Speaker 2>are and what their real issues are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

650
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:18.900
<v Speaker 2>after awhile there and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling at you and they get upset at you</v>

651
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:21.750
<v Speaker 2>for no reason or something and you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>tuning it all in and going,</v>

652
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

653
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:24.240
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

654
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.680
<v Speaker 2>you've got to not be bananas in order to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get someone who's not banana.</v>

655
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like people will do is we'll always</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

656
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking trying to find a good girl,</v>

657
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just tired.</v>

658
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 2>All these bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

659
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you're a mess bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking man.</v>

660
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.680
<v Speaker 2>You're a loon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hate your Stepdad,</v>

661
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.150
<v Speaker 2>you know you want to fucking beat dude's</v>
<v Speaker 2>up at stoplights,</v>

662
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 2>you know you're a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unless you stop being a mess,</v>

663
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.840
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to be involved in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good relationship.</v>

664
00:27:45.841 --> 00:27:48.510
<v Speaker 2>You never got to be able to recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

665
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:49.680
<v Speaker 2>other people that are fucked up.</v>

666
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Like I've always said that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things about trying to be like super </v>

667
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.180
<v Speaker 2>honest and I try to be literally as </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest as possible,</v>

668
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.300
<v Speaker 2>like it sounds really kind of gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really do try to very important </v>

669
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:02.300
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

670
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I try to be as nice to people as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and be as nice as possible.</v>

671
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:11.421
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could be nice to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people are fucking obsessive </v>

672
00:28:11.421 --> 00:28:11.421
<v Speaker 2>and they don't leave you alone or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bananas or they're,</v>

673
00:28:11.421 --> 00:28:16.371
<v Speaker 2>they're retarded or their abusive or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to take advantage of you if you're </v>

674
00:28:16.371 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 2>nice and there's some people that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be nice to.</v>

675
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately there's some people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what they need fucking years of</v>

676
00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:22.360
<v Speaker 2>therapy and when you run into them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

677
00:28:22.361 --> 00:28:24.110
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to go through,</v>

678
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 2>leave me the fuck alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>

679
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

680
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:31.190
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's unfortunate you have to do </v>

681
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.190
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you have to do that.</v>

682
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.790
<v Speaker 2>So I try to be as nice as is humanly </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible to get through my life.</v>

683
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.060
<v Speaker 2>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to be as honest as humanly </v>

684
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:38.060
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to always be honest.</v>

685
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

686
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.750
<v Speaker 2>make sure that everything I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing from a place where I can be </v>

687
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 2>honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't be honest about it,</v>

688
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:46.920
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing,</v>

689
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.880
<v Speaker 2>just one thing is being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing is like tmz type shit,</v>

690
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:55.881
<v Speaker 2>like revealing all sorts of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your personal life because people </v>

691
00:28:55.881 --> 00:28:55.881
<v Speaker 2>are creepy and they want to look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look into it.</v>

692
00:28:55.881 --> 00:29:00.020
<v Speaker 2>That's not honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a revealing thing and I'm </v>

693
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 2>not really into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really into like becoming,</v>

694
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 2>going on a reality show and having </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody seemed my bathroom,</v>

695
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:04.290
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck is that?</v>

696
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 2>That's not honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

697
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.660
<v Speaker 2>that's just weird voyeuristic shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get,</v>

698
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with.</v>

699
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.940
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

700
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:16.941
<v Speaker 2>what I am into is telling you where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>really coming from and what's going on </v>

701
00:29:16.941 --> 00:29:17.390
<v Speaker 2>in my own mind and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

702
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.440
<v Speaker 2>and be comfortable with that to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where I am so honest all the time </v>

703
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.240
<v Speaker 2>that I can recognize deception like </v>
<v Speaker 2>right away,</v>

704
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

705
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I find that to be really true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a really honest person,</v>

706
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.790
<v Speaker 2>when people are full of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just fucking spot it.</v>

707
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Like right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really difficult to lie to an </v>

708
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.861
<v Speaker 2>honest person really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that we did we videos</v>

709
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.640
<v Speaker 3>for awhile after every video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was going and it really,</v>

710
00:29:46.641 --> 00:29:51.641
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking awesome philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and Eddie Bravo would have a </v>

711
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:51.641
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who did it?</v>

712
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Best member tried to know I can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

713
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 3>What was that all about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least crazy.</v>

714
00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Very competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very competitive,</v>

715
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 3>very competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you have to be when you do that.</v>

716
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

717
00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he grew up in a situation where he had a</v>

718
00:30:05.881 --> 00:30:10.881
<v Speaker 2>Douche bag for a stepfather and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life has been trying to fight </v>

719
00:30:10.881 --> 00:30:11.610
<v Speaker 2>against people that are fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

720
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.560
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like he'd become,</v>

721
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.600
<v Speaker 2>he became hyper competitive because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

722
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's the worst show ever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's a perfect example.</v>

763
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.820
<v Speaker 3>We were an Ikea though the other day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had like a kid's room,</v>

00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:02.920
<v Speaker 3>like it was like a bunk bed and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really happy,</v>

765
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.470

784
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.790
<v Speaker 2>People who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

785
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.590
<v Speaker 2>have a really high falutin lifestyle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend tons of money and you know,</v>

786
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:56.591
<v Speaker 2>get used to it and get used to trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bling bling and then the shit hits the </v>

787
00:32:56.591 --> 00:32:59.981
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about moving the other </v>

788
00:32:59.981 --> 00:33:01.811
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get sick of a place and you just </v>

789
00:33:01.811 --> 00:33:01.811
<v Speaker 2>want to upgrade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always feel like you have to upgrade</v>

790
00:33:01.811 --> 00:33:01.811
<v Speaker 2>your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

791
00:33:01.811 --> 00:33:06.790
<v Speaker 2>it's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my carpet have wood floors </v>

792
00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:06.790
<v Speaker 2>underneath it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks great.</v>

793
00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

794
00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just needed a change.</v>

795
00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:08.200
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:13.210
<v Speaker 2>when I moved to Colorado that was a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for me to adjust to change </v>

797
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:13.210
<v Speaker 2>environments.</v>

798
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I think changing is good for your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it like refine your brand,</v>

799
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.940
<v Speaker 2>but your brand has to learn this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>new environment.</v>

800
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I had a whole new friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people I run into,</v>

801
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 2>a Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole new people.</v>

802
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I was meeting a whole new comedy clubs </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was working on my stuff.</v>

803
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.500
<v Speaker 2>It was a very interesting to me and made</v>
<v Speaker 2>me fire my brain up.</v>

804
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good thing to do if a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shock it once.</v>

805
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:38.710
<v Speaker 2>The problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is you build a base </v>

806
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.710
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a base in la.</v>

807
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.510
<v Speaker 2>I have all my friends live in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife's friends live in La.</v>

808

<v Speaker 2>you get real comfortable with that </v>

814
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.511

815
00:34:01.511 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 2>your whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is women,</v>

816

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're bringing women and then they have</v>

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

827
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I tell the story about the one time</v>

828
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:30.800
<v Speaker 2>that I hosted a Jack and Jill Strip club</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

829
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 2>and Rhode Island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've told you the story before,</v>

830
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:33.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

831
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:37.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a male and a woman stripper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was horrific.</v>

832
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.620
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were both disgusting.</v>

833
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:44.770
<v Speaker 2>There was like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe six to 10 people in the audience </v>

834
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.580
<v Speaker 2>at most during the whole night's </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance and I had to perform a bunch</v>

835
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:51.581
<v Speaker 2>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go up and do stand up and then </v>

836
00:34:51.581 --> 00:34:51.581
<v Speaker 2>the male stripper would go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go up and do standup in.</v>

837
00:34:51.581 --> 00:34:53.240
<v Speaker 2>A female strip would go on and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do shifts and they would take some</v>

838
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:58.241
<v Speaker 2>time off and then I'll go on stage again</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they would start to show all </v>

839
00:34:58.241 --> 00:35:00.911
<v Speaker 2>over again and the woman would go up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy will go do everyone in the </v>

840
00:35:00.911 --> 00:35:01.750
<v Speaker 2>audience was like these weird people </v>
<v Speaker 2>from this area,</v>

841
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 2>woonsocket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island,</v>

842
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.920
<v Speaker 2>but there was this one dude who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there who was a construction worker from</v>

843
00:35:06.921 --> 00:35:11.921
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey and he just happened to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>town because it was a marriage or </v>

844
00:35:11.921 --> 00:35:15.521
<v Speaker 2>something like that or wedding that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to go to for when someone's family </v>

845
00:35:15.521 --> 00:35:15.521
<v Speaker 2>and he was bored.</v>

846
00:35:15.521 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 2>So we've got out of the house to go have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a appear.</v>

847
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:21.251
<v Speaker 2>There's a bar down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he goes to this Jack and Jill Strip </v>

848
00:35:21.251 --> 00:35:22.790
<v Speaker 2>club and he was a totally normal dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>and me and him were talking having beers</v>

849
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.450
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

850
00:35:23.451 --> 00:35:25.840
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are we witnessing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You at least seen?</v>

851
00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 2>And this was like one normal dude in </v>
<v Speaker 2>May.</v>

852
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:33.130
<v Speaker 2>After first two beers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I had known this dude for </v>

853
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 2>fucking 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just joining one place to pull.</v>

854
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's fucking play some pool.</v>

855
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.290
<v Speaker 2>So there's a little corn operated pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

856
00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Were playing pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making fun of the whole situation.</v>

857
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I found a friend like for girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hard to do,</v>

858
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitches don't trust each other.</v>

859
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that from having dogs.</v>

860
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:50.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having pitbulls I had two female pit </v>

861
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.870
<v Speaker 2>bulls and one of them killed the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

862
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:55.430
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would fight and I would separate </v>

863
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.500
<v Speaker 2>them and I thought they worked their </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out because the way dogs work,</v>

864
00:35:55.501 --> 00:36:00.501
<v Speaker 2>the shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His one dog will dominate the other dog </v>

865
00:36:00.501 --> 00:36:00.570
<v Speaker 2>and then you figure out who the Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

866
00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:05.571
<v Speaker 2>They have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to figure out who gets to </v>

867
00:36:05.571 --> 00:36:05.571
<v Speaker 2>drink first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who gets to eat first?</v>

868
00:36:05.571 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 2>That's just the wild animal world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be number one.</v>

869
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.460
<v Speaker 2>That's why you can never let your dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>get away with Shit.</v>

870
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 2>You can never let her get a dog growl at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

871
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:15.550
<v Speaker 2>You can never let your dog do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not supposed to do because you </v>

872
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.550
<v Speaker 2>have to be the Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you have big dogs.</v>

873
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what doesn't work with females.</v>

874
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Females never accept dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would always come back and try to </v>

875
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.971
<v Speaker 2>battle it out again and that's what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did until one of them killed the other </v>

876
00:36:25.971 --> 00:36:29.391
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's how women are with </v>

877
00:36:29.391 --> 00:36:29.391
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men.</v>

878
00:36:29.391 --> 00:36:32.570
<v Speaker 2>I think women can be friends with women </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have really close friends and </v>

879
00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:36.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go all sex in the city and pal </v>

880
00:36:36.621 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 2>around together and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's real difficult for them to make</v>

881
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:40.550
<v Speaker 2>that kind of a bond to trust another </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman that trust them.</v>

882
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.060
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

883
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it's easier for dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

884
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

885
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like that's like the cat fight.</v>

886
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if there's dudes that are </v>

887
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 2>like doing stuff that you like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like comics,</v>

888
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.510
<v Speaker 2>like if I made comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go to a new town and uh,</v>

889
00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:00.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do stand up or there's some local </v>

890
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:02.001
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking meet local comics all the </v>

891
00:37:02.001 --> 00:37:02.001
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

892
00:37:02.001 --> 00:37:02.001
<v Speaker 2>we're out having a beer together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

893
00:37:02.001 --> 00:37:06.890
<v Speaker 2>we're hanging around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have something in common or Jujitsu </v>

894
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:09.690
<v Speaker 2>guys like there's like fucking 10 dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Jujitsu that are trained with all the</v>

895
00:37:09.691 --> 00:37:14.691
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could totally be good friends of </v>

896
00:37:14.691 --> 00:37:14.691
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just dudes that,</v>

897
00:37:14.691 --> 00:37:19.010
<v Speaker 2>especially Jujitsu guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have good control over the </v>

898
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.010
<v Speaker 2>ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

899
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu guys into to get good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

900
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 2>you have to battle it out all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be real objective.</v>

901
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:27.981
<v Speaker 2>You can't be delusional at Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to really know what your </v>

902
00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:28.590
<v Speaker 2>strengths are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your weaknesses are,</v>

903
00:37:28.591 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 2>and you've got to be able to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping out.</v>

904
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:35.390
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be able to deal with dudes</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominating you because in the beginning </v>

905
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.420
<v Speaker 2>for sure you're going to get dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets dominated the beginning.</v>

906
00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:41.421
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're just so big that nobody </v>

907
00:37:41.421 --> 00:37:41.421
<v Speaker 2>can touch you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm 300 pounds,</v>

908
00:37:41.421 --> 00:37:45.261
<v Speaker 2>brock lesnar character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're going to get tapped out </v>

909
00:37:45.261 --> 00:37:47.751
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to have the kind of ego to </v>

910
00:37:47.751 --> 00:37:47.751
<v Speaker 2>deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

912
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really difficult for my wife,</v>

913
00:37:50.881 --> 00:37:55.881
<v Speaker 2>especially when you have a little baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what are you going to meet some </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some law that you can only or </v>

922
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.230
<v Speaker 2>there's some studies that say that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can only keep like 150 people that you </v>

923
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 2>know in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've seen that.</v>

924
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.850
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen that.</v>

925
00:38:19.851 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 4>But I totally believe it because I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>mine's like 10 says,</v>

926
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:28.910
<v Speaker 4>well let's meet or I just don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many things when,</v>

927
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:29.800
<v Speaker 4>when like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

928
00:38:29.801 --> 00:38:34.100
<v Speaker 4>like I'll meet somebody or somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>tells me something if I don't care about</v>

929
00:38:34.101 --> 00:38:34.550
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just like,</v>

930
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 4>I put that on the coffee table and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's about to be thrown out,</v>

931
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:41.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting my deep storage.</v>

932
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I put in my random memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

933
00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

934
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.690
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

935
00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working memory.</v>

936
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

937
00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to find it on Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to waste too much time </v>

938
00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:58.420
<v Speaker 2>looking for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 100,</v>

939
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.390
<v Speaker 2>it's apparently you can only remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only have real relationships </v>

940
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.200
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>150 people were,</v>

941
00:39:04.201 --> 00:39:06.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their name and you know,</v>

942
00:39:06.151 --> 00:39:11.151
<v Speaker 2>you'll have a certain amount of space in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hard drive when it comes to human </v>

943
00:39:11.151 --> 00:39:14.871
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that to me reinforces my feelings </v>

944
00:39:14.871 --> 00:39:15.810
<v Speaker 2>that human beings are supposed to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in small tribes.</v>

945
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.840
<v Speaker 2>We're not supposed to live and have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic fucking tribes of hundreds of </v>

946
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:21.600
<v Speaker 2>millions of people.</v>

947
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:22.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also if you,</v>

948
00:39:22.741 --> 00:39:24.600
<v Speaker 4>if you ever get assignment says you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

949
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.890
<v Speaker 4>like you know where you follow the </v>
<v Speaker 4>colors,</v>

950
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 4>but it also is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a.</v>

951
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 4>we're supposed to live in small tribes </v>
<v Speaker 4>as in if I can do.</v>

952
00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Simon says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but right up to the 14th one,</v>

953
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 4>my brain falls off and it's always like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 14th one.</v>

954
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:41.500
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just my Max,</v>

955
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's my heart is full.</v>

956
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:47.350
<v Speaker 4>I can't do anything past this 14.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might be able to train myself to,</v>

957
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.800
<v Speaker 4>to like micromanage how many things I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can remember.</v>

958
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.330
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird,</v>

959
00:39:52.331 --> 00:39:54.400
<v Speaker 4>like if I pick up a Simon says right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

960
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 4>once I hit the 14th one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it.</v>

961
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.760
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just turns off.</v>

962
00:39:57.761 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 4>Almost everybody has a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>threshold for.</v>

963
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:02.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying everyone does the same for,</v>

964
00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for names.</v>

965
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.100
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty.</v>

966
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't that fall into the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>

967
00:40:06.731 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 4>Just maybe memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>memory.</v>

968
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

969
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

970
00:40:11.091 --> 00:40:12.800
<v Speaker 2>well think about how many words you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

971
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know thousands of words and words </v>

972
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:18.360
<v Speaker 2>that we don't even use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

973
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

974
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these serendipitous.</v>

975
00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That takes up more of our,</v>

976
00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.150
<v Speaker 4>most of our hard drives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scenario art take scenario.</v>

977
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:26.660
<v Speaker 4>People</v>

978
00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.940
<v Speaker 2>that just spout out you only use five </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of your brain.</v>

979
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 2>So some random night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only use 10 percent of Israeli </v>

980
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.930
<v Speaker 2>really to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you even know what the fuck you're </v>

981
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.561
<v Speaker 2>talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you just like reciting some shit </v>

982
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:38.561
<v Speaker 2>that someone told you in high school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the year of Glute,</v>

983
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:38.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

984
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's supposed to be just saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll use two percent of our Ra,</v>

985
00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't fucking know.</v>

986
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:44.540
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

987
00:40:44.541 --> 00:40:46.430
<v Speaker 2>this dude that I met at the grocery </v>
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>

988
00:40:46.431 --> 00:40:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I did not remember him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he is from Jujitsu.</v>

989
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:50.420
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you doing?</v>

991
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.600
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's just going to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those casual.</v>

992
00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:54.860
<v Speaker 2>What's up man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you doing things?</v>

993
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:59.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like a little taken aback that </v>

994
00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he'll like laugh.</v>

995
00:41:00.171 --> 00:41:01.940
<v Speaker 2>So I was a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awkward socially.</v>

996
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.590
<v Speaker 2>So take care of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some shopping.</v>

<v Speaker 2>leaving and when I'm going out to my </v>

998

<v Speaker 2>parking lot,</v>

1003
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:23.650
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1005
00:41:24.201 --> 00:41:25.160

<v Speaker 2>you could ever possibly use.</v>

1023
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:04.730
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't know the best example </v>

<v Speaker 2>only way I'm going to get to go have him</v>

1036
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.050
<v Speaker 2>go to heaven as Kirk Cameron style where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to fuck in,</v>

1037
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen Kirk Cameron go up to like</v>

1038
00:42:37.731 --> 00:42:42.731
<v Speaker 2>gang bangers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta look Google that Shit on </v>

1039
00:42:42.731 --> 00:42:45.041
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch Kirk Cameron's videos where he </v>

1040
00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:46.991
<v Speaker 2>goes up to people and uses his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>13 year old logic uses like fucking </v>

1041
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:50.140
<v Speaker 2>seventh grade logic on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you google it,</v>

1042
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 2>typing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kirk Cameron owned,</v>

1043
00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>even better.</v>

1044
00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Then he starts talking to people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually read fucked.</v>

1045
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.170
<v Speaker 2>He's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so bananas.</v>

1046
00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I think Kirk Cameron is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely gay.</v>

1047
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:08.300
<v Speaker 2>The more I watched them in these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I'm like this.</v>

1048
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:13.301
<v Speaker 2>Nothing masculine about this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very submissive and is desired for </v>

1049
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:16.130
<v Speaker 2>chastity and this desire for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1050
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met him.</v>

1051
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I think I would go over the edge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just tried to kiss him.</v>

1052
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:19.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1053
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1054
00:43:20.081 --> 00:43:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I pull out my dick starting to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1055
00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like go hit the.</v>

1056
00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.150
<v Speaker 2>I would go to jail for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1057
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm like fuck them.</v>

1058
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Just hold them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking pulled them down,</v>

1059
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Speaker 2>jerk off on his chest or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1060
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.350
<v Speaker 2>See what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was this time,</v>

1061
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.670
<v Speaker 2>no stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1062
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I used to like him back in the day with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this show and it growing.</v>

1063
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.170
<v Speaker 2>But I also thought that tracy golden was</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot.</v>

1064
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:49.340
<v Speaker 2>So I guess I'm just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1065
00:43:49.341 --> 00:43:51.380
<v Speaker 2>his wife was Super Hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1066
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Or she is still stills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1067
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's real life.</v>

1068
00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Real life is super hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something the matter with that </v>

1069
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:01.170
<v Speaker 2>dude is chasing down the Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.870
<v Speaker 2>I can understand you wanting to study </v>
<v Speaker 2>what Christianity was.</v>

1071
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.910
<v Speaker 2>What to me in my opinion is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an ancient philosophy.</v>

1072
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:10.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be incredibly flawed,</v>

1073
00:44:10.131 --> 00:44:15.131
<v Speaker 2>but there's some very good things to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some very good ideas that love </v>

1074
00:44:15.131 --> 00:44:15.980
<v Speaker 2>one another as you would love yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.500
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1076
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.340
<v Speaker 2>treat each other as brothers and sisters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff is very good,</v>

1077
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's got a lot of wacky nonsense in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it that makes no fucking sense.</v>

1078
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And if you really want to study it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's your thing,</v>

1079
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:26.570
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1080
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>studying like Greek mythology,</v>

1081
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like getting into like Zeus and Mithra </v>

1082
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:34.540
<v Speaker 2>and all that crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of cool.</v>

1083
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.360
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you really get into like </v>

1084
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Christianity and start thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the real stuff,</v>

1085
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:41.510
<v Speaker 2>like this is the what the fuck are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about?</v>

1086
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.700
<v Speaker 2>And then you're got to grab other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need to listen to me.</v>

1087
00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:47.160
<v Speaker 2>You need to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all parents though,</v>

1088
00:44:47.161 --> 00:44:52.161
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never have thought that if my </v>

1089
00:44:52.161 --> 00:44:52.161
<v Speaker 2>parents were when I was a kid though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people know though,</v>

1090
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:57.910
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are born again so that it's </v>

1091
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.910
<v Speaker 2>not their kid or it's not their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:02.271
<v Speaker 2>But those are really hard to be born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never learned it growing up and then </v>

1093
00:45:02.271 --> 00:45:02.280
<v Speaker 2>going straight into it.</v>

1094
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it is of your life falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if your life falls apart and all</v>

1095
00:45:05.641 --> 00:45:10.641
<v Speaker 2>these people that are into Jesus seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy and they seem like they have a </v>

1096
00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:11.070
<v Speaker 2>path because that's really what it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1097
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1098
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:13.860
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a path and today </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1099
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:19.070
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about the way we used to </v>

1100
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:21.471
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way our bodies are programmed to </v>

1101
00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:23.421
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're supposed to be living in </v>

1102
00:45:23.421 --> 00:45:24.110
<v Speaker 2>fucking huts and caves and shared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

1103
00:45:24.111 --> 00:45:27.450
<v Speaker 2>the hardware that we have right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically the same hardware,</v>

1104
00:45:27.451 --> 00:45:32.451
<v Speaker 2>the same adrenal system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same neuro synapses that connect the</v>

1105
00:45:32.641 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 2>same way as people that lived 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1106
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:40.461
<v Speaker 2>If you took a person from 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and sat them in the corner </v>

1107
00:45:40.461 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 2>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would be unrecognizable.</v>

1108
00:45:40.921 --> 00:45:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be totally normal.</v>

1109
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.830
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1110
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:46.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a caveman now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would look just like us,</v>

1111
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 2>but yet 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago they had very different needs.</v>

1112
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a.</v>

1113
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had shit.</v>

1114
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:55.260
<v Speaker 2>You had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had tasks.</v>

1115
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to go out.</v>

1116
00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 2>You gotta find that fucking food every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day you had a hunt.</v>

1117
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:04.431
<v Speaker 2>That shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like a visceral thrill </v>

1118
00:46:04.431 --> 00:46:04.560
<v Speaker 2>involved in hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like hunters will tell you,</v>

1119
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 2>if you ever watch like Ted Nugent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

1120
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.030
<v Speaker 2>A key makes it very appealing and Brock </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lesnar,</v>

1121
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 2>he's got videos with him hunting like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a rush he gives.</v>

1122
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:15.180
<v Speaker 2>These guys are rushed to kill the animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get their meat and it's not like a a</v>

1123
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:20.181
<v Speaker 2>cruelty rush and they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to kill and fucking hurt and </v>

1124
00:46:20.181 --> 00:46:20.181
<v Speaker 2>destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1125
00:46:20.181 --> 00:46:24.611
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a man is supposed to be out there </v>

1126
00:46:24.611 --> 00:46:24.611
<v Speaker 2>shooting animals and killing them.</v>

1127
00:46:24.611 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 2>You ever plant food and then eat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>food?</v>

1128
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 2>There's something very exciting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1129
00:46:28.231 --> 00:46:33.231
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rewarding and fulfilling and to a </v>

1130
00:46:33.231 --> 00:46:35.580
<v Speaker 2>lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their life is filled with nothingness.</v>

1131
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.760
<v Speaker 2>There's no task everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a show up at work.</v>

1132
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Do what you're told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do your paperwork,</v>

1133
00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 2>stare at the clock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beg for 5:00,</v>

1134
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.800
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to your wife,</v>

1135
00:46:46.801 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a beer.</v>

1136
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Watch law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say what the fuck is going on?</v>

1137
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Fall Asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it all over again.</v>

1138
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 2>There's no tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no real,</v>

1139
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.260
<v Speaker 2>there's no real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there has to be some meaning to it </v>

1140
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:00.260
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone comes up to you and says,</v>

1141
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you feel that way.</v>

1142
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I used to feel that too until I met the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord.</v>

1143
00:47:03.151 --> 00:47:05.550
<v Speaker 2>That emptiness in your life is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the Lord.</v>

1144
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.420
<v Speaker 2>When really that emptiness in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just you're fucking hardware and it's</v>

1145
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.160
<v Speaker 2>just your hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1146
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you think about the way we're wired?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not wired to deal with this world</v>

1147
00:47:16.471 --> 00:47:21.471
<v Speaker 2>that we live in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are wired to deal with thousands of </v>

1148
00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:21.480
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

1149
00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:23.790
<v Speaker 2>30 something was when they figured out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the camera.</v>

1150
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 2>That means everything before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less than 200 years ago.</v>

1151
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:29.200
<v Speaker 2>If you want to know what someone looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1152
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 2>someone had a draw</v>

1153
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 6>that person for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it how crazy that is?</v>

1154
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:37.510
<v Speaker 6>They had a draw your how many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>people can draw.</v>

1155
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:39.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many?</v>

1156
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.920
<v Speaker 6>How many people do we really know from </v>
<v Speaker 6>before?</v>

1157
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:43.570
<v Speaker 6>1,800.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What they really looked like.</v>

1158
00:47:43.571 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking guesswork.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unless you were Napoleon Napoleon.</v>

1159
00:47:48.101 --> 00:47:49.850
<v Speaker 6>We have hundreds of drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That guy,</v>

1160
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 6>we got a pretty good idea what he looked</v>
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>

1161
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:54.280
<v Speaker 6>Abraham Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pretty good idea what he looked like.</v>

1162
00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.900
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you don't go way,</v>

1163
00:47:55.901 --> 00:48:00.901
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>way back 500 years ago with the fuck </v>

1164
00:48:00.901 --> 00:48:03.180
<v Speaker 6>black people didn't exist back then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1165
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.580
<v Speaker 6>white people have only existed for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>short amount of time.</v>

1166
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:11.581
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a recent study where they </v>

1167
00:48:11.581 --> 00:48:11.581
<v Speaker 6>figured out how long white people </v>
<v Speaker 6>around,</v>

1168
00:48:11.581 --> 00:48:12.340
<v Speaker 6>I believe it was like $10,000</v>

1169
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:14.320
<v Speaker 1>years or something silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

1170
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to google that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an important thing.</v>

1171
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:17.320
<v Speaker 1>How long have Caucasians</v>

1172
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:22.910
<v Speaker 3>see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think black people came before white </v>

1173
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.681
<v Speaker 3>people and I'm sure I'm sure a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't believe that you think </v>

1174
00:48:24.681 --> 00:48:28.710
<v Speaker 3>black people came from art kind of way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like using pallets and colors.</v>

1175
00:48:28.711 --> 00:48:31.020
<v Speaker 3>It has to go that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1176
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.430
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make,</v>

1177
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.140
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't go that way.</v>

1178
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black turns into white but white,</v>

1179
00:48:36.451 --> 00:48:40.740
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to turn in black in color</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise if you're mixing colors.</v>

1180
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:46.200
<v Speaker 1>When did people evolve to be white?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do I work for,</v>

1181
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did people change become white?</v>

1182
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do people come up?</v>

1183
00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Why did people become what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

1184
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:03.440
<v Speaker 1>that's why vitamin D probably you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying between 100,000,</v>

1185
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.060
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1186
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:14.820
<v Speaker 1>lower levels of vitamin vitamin D at </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher latitudes where the sun is less </v>

1187
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.031
<v Speaker 1>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caused the lightening effect where </v>

1188
00:49:18.031 --> 00:49:18.031
<v Speaker 1>modern humans became who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1189
00:49:18.031 --> 00:49:19.960
<v Speaker 1>who began darker skin first migrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>

1190
00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:23.680
<v Speaker 1>So human beings have been black until </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 50,000</v>

1191
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:26.710
<v Speaker 1>years ago when we started moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the climate changed.</v>

1192
00:49:26.711 --> 00:49:29.070
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty fucking chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you pretty crazy shit.</v>

1193
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's banana had tried to convert </v>
<v Speaker 1>me into Jesus,</v>

1194
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:36.580
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

1195
00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:39.570
<v Speaker 6>At least with Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're allowed to fucking draw a picture</v>

1196
00:49:39.571 --> 00:49:42.930
<v Speaker 6>of him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How nutty is the fucking South Park?</v>

1197
00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.860
<v Speaker 6>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you watch the episode?</v>

1198
00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:46.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>both of them.</v>

1199
00:49:46.741 --> 00:49:47.940
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't watch it.</v>

1200
00:49:47.941 --> 00:49:52.941
<v Speaker 6>It was driving me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was so mad at comedy central for </v>

1201
00:49:52.941 --> 00:49:53.370
<v Speaker 6>beeping out every.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1202
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:58.910
<v Speaker 6>Go see the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they didn't do anything on the first </v>

1203
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.910
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The second one because the first one.</v>

1204
00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:03.180
<v Speaker 6>It's so annoying though when you see </v>
<v Speaker 6>every time they say Mohammed it beeps.</v>

1205
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:08.270
<v Speaker 6>And then how about when he's in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking the bear suit and it comes out </v>

1206
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:11.880
<v Speaker 6>with Santa Claus and the bear suit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like did the first episode he was in a u</v>

1207
00:50:11.881 --> 00:50:16.881
<v Speaker 6>haul and it's was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like legally that's what they thought </v>

1208
00:50:17.011 --> 00:50:18.340
<v Speaker 6>that they wouldn't get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1209
00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:21.420
<v Speaker 6>So they just drove,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they drove Mohammed around in a u haul.</v>

1210
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.100
<v Speaker 6>He just sit there like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is this okay?</v>

1211
00:50:23.101 --> 00:50:23.820
<v Speaker 6>Mohamad bub?</v>

1212
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:28.850
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1213
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Pendula said something on his twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

1214
00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:36.701
<v Speaker 1>and I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically said the measure of a </v>

1215
00:50:36.701 --> 00:50:37.310
<v Speaker 1>religion is a how much you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid.</v>

1216
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what way you can say about a religion is</v>

1217
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:43.160
<v Speaker 1>how much you are afraid to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or when you're afraid to talk about</v>

1218
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:45.110
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how crazy they are.</v>

1219
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Basically what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Penn is a very staunch atheist and </v>

1220
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been friends with that guy for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and he doesn't,</v>

1221
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 1>he won't even consider the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some sort of an intelligent</v>

1222
00:50:54.891 --> 00:50:57.620
<v Speaker 1>life to it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very scientific,</v>

1223
00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:58.520
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1224
00:50:58.521 --> 00:51:00.890
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately he's never done any </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs.</v>

1225
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.330
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he had,</v>

1226
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.340
<v Speaker 1>he's never done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never had a drop of alcohol.</v>

1227
00:51:04.341 --> 00:51:09.341
<v Speaker 1>He's never even had a single drug except</v>
<v Speaker 1>for when he's had to have surgery when </v>

1228
00:51:09.341 --> 00:51:09.341
<v Speaker 1>they had a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1229
00:51:09.341 --> 00:51:12.290
<v Speaker 1>he like takes it very seriously to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sober all the time.</v>

1230
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.970
<v Speaker 1>We saw well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

1231
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really understand what's </v>

1232
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:19.040
<v Speaker 1>happening in the psychedelic experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you've had one,</v>

1233
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point is this fucking Mohamad thing,</v>

1234
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1235
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.140
<v Speaker 3>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like how they compared it.</v>

1236
00:51:25.141 --> 00:51:30.141
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they did in the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode and the first thing they </v>

1237
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:31.620
<v Speaker 3>compared it to a the Tom cruise suing </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone that says he's gay.</v>

1238
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:34.130
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like the Muhammad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1239
00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:36.750
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to talk about him </v>
<v Speaker 3>being gay.</v>

1240
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you right now.</v>

1241
00:51:38.311 --> 00:51:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1242
00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:41.200
<v Speaker 1>You talked about being gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being gay all day long at Cox.</v>

1243
00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:47.490
<v Speaker 1>If you go online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pictures of me with dicks all </v>

1244
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:47.490
<v Speaker 1>over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the golden rule.</v>

1245
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:47.490
<v Speaker 1>The Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1249
00:51:52.781 --> 00:51:55.240
<v Speaker 3>I was watching this show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching orgasmic last night.</v>

1250
00:51:55.241 --> 00:51:56.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever seen that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

1251
00:51:56.261 --> 00:52:01.261
<v Speaker 3>It's a movie at Trey Parker wrote and </v>
<v Speaker 3>directed and stuff and where he's a </v>

1252
00:52:01.261 --> 00:52:03.790
<v Speaker 3>mormon and he gets into porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that alone is a great movie.</v>

1253
00:52:03.791 --> 00:52:08.791
<v Speaker 3>How they're always battling religion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trey is at least something that it's </v>

1254
00:52:08.791 --> 00:52:08.810
<v Speaker 3>just a fucking love.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're the most prolific there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shows the best.</v>

1257
00:52:12.841 --> 00:52:16.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the mall to speak to Mike Sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor the most.</v>

1258
00:52:16.291 --> 00:52:19.440
<v Speaker 1>It's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's spot on and brilliant.</v>

1259
00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Just the fucking Barbara streisand </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur monster,</v>

1269
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:50.580
<v Speaker 3>uncensored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

1270
00:52:50.581 --> 00:52:52.980
<v Speaker 3>you could do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncensored.</v>

1271

<v Speaker 3>It's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>best videos I've ever seen in my life.</v>

1299
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:03.351
<v Speaker 3>And I wish Trey Parker and Matt Stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>would finish that because it was one of </v>

1300
00:54:03.351 --> 00:54:03.351
<v Speaker 3>the funniest things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>they just take things the deepest,</v>

1303
00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:13.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I remember when we saw team </v>

<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember being in a theater,</v>

1305
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:13.760
<v Speaker 2>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe where they're going with</v>

1306
00:54:13.761 --> 00:54:14.780
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1307
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1308
00:54:15.471 --> 00:54:20.471
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the dude starts throwing up and </v>

1309
00:54:20.471 --> 00:54:20.471
<v Speaker 2>keeps throwing up,</v>

1310
00:54:20.471 --> 00:54:20.940
<v Speaker 3>that's where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1311
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh fucking football field full of puke </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's laying in the center of it.</v>

1312
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean they took it to the utmost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took it to its total shock humor,</v>

1313
00:54:29.001 --> 00:54:31.400
<v Speaker 2>but brilliant shock humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1314
00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:32.930
<v Speaker 2>like it's not as funny the second time </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

1315
00:54:32.931 --> 00:54:37.931
<v Speaker 2>like the throw up seen the thrust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time around when you don't </v>

1316
00:54:37.931 --> 00:54:37.931
<v Speaker 2>know it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just God damn.</v>

1317
00:54:37.931 --> 00:54:40.660
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the best there.</v>

1318
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:45.850
<v Speaker 2>If they have a movie coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always more excited than anything </v>

1319
00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:48.851
<v Speaker 2>else except them in Bora Bora or dam and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ology like close.</v>

1320
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:50.690
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1321
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's ever going to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>on me anymore.</v>

1322
00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:59.070
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what he's doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there's like a third movie </v>

1323
00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.070
<v Speaker 3>because I know that</v>

1324
00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.720
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if it takes time off,</v>

1325
00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:02.420
<v Speaker 2>if he goes to places where people aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of it,</v>

1326
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:07.450
<v Speaker 2>like if he goes to like the south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's what we try to do before I </v>

1327
00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:07.450
<v Speaker 2>try to go to the south.</v>

1328
00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Well it's almost like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Mike Myers,</v>

1329
00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 3>it's falling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It fell in the same category.</v>

1330
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:11.340
<v Speaker 3>I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1331
00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:14.430
<v Speaker 3>like the last gold finger movie or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever he did.</v>

1332
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.890
<v Speaker 3>He's just playing the same character </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over again.</v>

1333
00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:19.810
<v Speaker 3>And the other day I watched one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>old favorite movies was.</v>

1334
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 3>So I married an ax murderer and I used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to love that movie.</v>

1335
00:55:22.741 --> 00:55:25.590
<v Speaker 3>I've watched you the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to fucking puke and beat people</v>

1336
00:55:25.591 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 3>up because it was so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Mike Myers to me as died almost.</v>

1337
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:30.340
<v Speaker 3>They do</v>

1338
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.440
<v Speaker 2>his last movie looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know those movies where they </v>

1339
00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.790
<v Speaker 2>have a guy who used to be funny and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the sudden,</v>

1340
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:41.240
<v Speaker 2>like in the movie he takes a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn and now he's not funny anymore.</v>

1341
00:55:41.241 --> 00:55:46.241
<v Speaker 2>It's putting out crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the were shaking their heads and </v>

1342
00:55:46.241 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 2>ease and the downward spiral of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That last movie where he played the </v>

1343
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 2>Indian guy the love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like this is like a guy who forgot </v>

1349
00:56:01.481 --> 00:56:01.950
<v Speaker 2>what funny is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1350
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.760
<v Speaker 3>but what's crazy is if you go back as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far as swipe merit and ax murder,</v>

1351
00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:10.030
<v Speaker 3>which was way before Austin powers or </v>
<v Speaker 3>any of that stuff,</v>

1352
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:15.270
<v Speaker 3>it destroyed that movie because that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same character as all his other </v>

1353
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:16.240
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so awful.</v>

1354
00:56:16.241 --> 00:56:17.680
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's man.</v>

1355
00:56:17.681 --> 00:56:21.430
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine like Timpson Wayne's </v>
<v Speaker 3>world worries coming out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Shrek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shrek guy.</v>

1357
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Wayne's world was fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and Dana Carvey were awesome.</v>

1358
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:33.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when those movies were on the wrong </v>

1359
00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:33.661
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

1360
00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:33.661
<v Speaker 2>Those were great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great fun,</v>

1361
00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:36.020
<v Speaker 2>fun movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the new stuff he does like,</v>

1362
00:56:36.021 --> 00:56:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like the Austin powers </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

1363
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I never got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about the iphone leak?</v>

1365
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.750
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know about this iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the iphone four,</v>

1368
00:56:56.071 --> 00:56:57.220
<v Speaker 2>think that this is all bullshit and hype</v>

<v Speaker 2>apple would ever release a thing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Not a lot of companies a virus.</v>

1374
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:17.780
<v Speaker 4>The viral marketing nowadays that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>being used on the Internet is so </v>

1375
00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.690
<v Speaker 4>amazingly deep in like you would not </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of the shift that's happening,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Chocolate down the reebok commercial.</v>

1377
00:57:23.731 --> 00:57:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Exactly where he's native and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1378
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:26.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>

1379
00:57:26.791 --> 00:57:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I could almost see this to build hype </v>
<v Speaker 4>with cell phones because if you look at,</v>

1380
00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:35.800
<v Speaker 4>there's a website called boy genius </v>
<v Speaker 4>report dot Com and you could totally </v>

1381
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.330
<v Speaker 4>tell this guy's in bed or he was in bed </v>
<v Speaker 4>with blackberry at one point.</v>

1382
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Like there was times where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1383
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:46.100
<v Speaker 4>you got this phone like a year ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else and you already have and </v>

1384
00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.060
<v Speaker 4>already a video of using it and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1385
00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.120
<v Speaker 4>That seems a little fishy that your </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends let you borrow it.</v>

1386
00:57:51.121 --> 00:57:53.370
<v Speaker 4>And when it comes out like a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1387
00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:53.730
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>

1388
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.190
<v Speaker 4>And I almost think it's just shifting </v>
<v Speaker 4>the leaked out,</v>

1389
00:57:56.191 --> 00:58:01.191
<v Speaker 4>kind of like on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see what people's </v>

1390
00:58:01.191 --> 00:58:01.191
<v Speaker 4>reactions are trying to tweak things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1391
00:58:01.191 --> 00:58:02.620
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like we're the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1392
00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.380
<v Speaker 4>some of them are living,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

1393
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.510
<v Speaker 4>So don't believe know about this apple </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing though,</v>

1394
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.510
<v Speaker 4>that it seems to me like the dude got </v>
<v Speaker 4>fired.</v>

1395
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Didn't get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1396
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:12.330
<v Speaker 4>He got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Police are involved now.</v>

1397
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.810
<v Speaker 4>You hear about the Gizmodo God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they broke down his house.</v>

1398
00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 4>He broke down his fucking front door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took all his computers because the </v>

1399
00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 4>reporter that that recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1400
00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:22.680
<v Speaker 4>he got a copy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They paid $5,000</v>

1401
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:25.030
<v Speaker 2>dollars for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the actual phone.</v>

1402
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:30.240
<v Speaker 2>So they paid money for the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently apple saying that that's </v>

1403
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.241
<v Speaker 2>their stolen property and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be having that reporting on </v>

1404
00:58:33.241 --> 00:58:36.001
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they went to the guy's house who </v>

1405
00:58:36.001 --> 00:58:36.001
<v Speaker 2>wrote this whole report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke down his house,</v>

1406
00:58:36.001 --> 00:58:38.440
<v Speaker 2>took all of his fucking computers to two</v>
<v Speaker 2>servers servers in his house.</v>

1407
00:58:38.441 --> 00:58:39.190
<v Speaker 2>That's a super geek.</v>

1408
00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he is a super geek.</v>

1409
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:44.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean the main editor of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest tech websites,</v>

1410
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:50.190

1412
00:58:53.681 --> 00:58:57.121

<v Speaker 4>That's why it freaks me out or to </v>

1413
00:58:57.121 --> 00:58:57.121
<v Speaker 4>because a computer and nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the self.</v>

1414
00:58:57.121 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 4>I think nowadays that's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>scariest things ever.</v>

1415
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:03.960
<v Speaker 4>Ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody can now come in and take your </v>

<v Speaker 4>diary and put it into their database,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your whole diary.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Every feeling,</v>

1420
00:59:11.171 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 4>every thing I'm thinking now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what our computers,</v>

1421
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:15.010
<v Speaker 4>our diaries now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1422
00:59:15.011 --> 00:59:17.710
<v Speaker 4>You get all your emails from like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking million years.</v>

1423
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 4>So this Guy Bob and iphone and now his </v>
<v Speaker 4>diary is owned by the every photo you've</v>

1424
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 4>ever</v>

1425
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.050
<v Speaker 2>taken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all as computers.</v>

1426
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Like why do they think that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just take your computers?</v>

1427
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Is it to get a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1428
00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:33.520
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a track tracking of the emails to see </v>

1429
00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:33.520
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1430
00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an open door that if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1431
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:37.070
<v Speaker 2>they can</v>

1432
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:39.140
<v Speaker 3>pretty much just like searching your </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

1433
00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.150
<v Speaker 3>The cops want to search a car </v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless.</v>

1434
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Even if they're just trying to pull you </v>
<v Speaker 3>over for a seatbelt,</v>

1435
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 3>they want to search a car and see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>else I can find.</v>

1436
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 2>But I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1437
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:51.161
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are saying that this </v>

1438
00:59:51.161 --> 00:59:51.161
<v Speaker 2>warrant was unlawful and that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have.</v>

1439
00:59:51.161 --> 00:59:52.430
<v Speaker 3>It's totally online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>La.</v>

1440
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you a lawyer?</v>

1441
00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:58.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody bought A cell phone from </v>

1442
00:59:58.850 --> 00:59:58.850
<v Speaker 3>another step.</v>

1443
00:59:58.850 --> 00:59:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they bought a stolen cell phone,</v>

1444
00:59:58.941 --> 01:00:01.100
<v Speaker 2>a cell phone that's basically stolen </v>
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>

1445
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:06.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy lost his cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the property of apple and it's </v>

1446
01:00:06.101 --> 01:00:07.460
<v Speaker 2>very sensitive property because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prototype.</v>

1447
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1448
01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:08.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1449
01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think basically they fucked up in,</v>

1450
01:00:12.071 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 2>in stealing the phone or in buying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

1451
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 2>What they should have done is given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking phone back to apple.</v>

1452
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:22.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean the company doesn't want you </v>
<v Speaker 2>reviewing their shit before it's out </v>

1453
01:00:22.031 --> 01:00:22.031
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1454
01:00:22.031 --> 01:00:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge request.</v>

1455
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:25.280
<v Speaker 2>If you know that it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shit.</v>

1456
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:26.240
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something illegal.</v>

1491
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:06.810

<v Speaker 2>I was really weird connection.</v>

1492
01:02:06.811 --> 01:02:09.190
<v Speaker 2>That was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So strange with the dude who came to the</v>

1493
01:02:09.191 --> 01:02:10.230
<v Speaker 2>show with it.</v>

1494
01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:15.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to hook you all up and then </v>

1495
01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:15.840
<v Speaker 3>we'd go to lunch and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the laptop,</v>

1496
01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.900
<v Speaker 3>this is the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1497
01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 3>And then like put it back in is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were we supposed to there?</v>

1498
01:02:19.411 --> 01:02:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Was there a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was going to get it all to us</v>

1499
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.320
<v Speaker 2>and we started making fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that'S right.</v>

1500
01:02:24.321 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>We weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

1501
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:26.970
<v Speaker 2>what if it cuts out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is silly,</v>

<v Speaker 2>am I going to do?</v>

1503
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.120
<v Speaker 2>And we decided that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous and they were like,</v>

1504
01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to be like broadcast shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have enough problems with people.</v>

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 2>You tubing my shit before it's done at </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>

1506
01:02:39.901 --> 01:02:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Like when you come up with new bits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1507
01:02:42.281 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes when a bit like is out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a cd,</v>

1508
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's to me when it's an old bit.</v>

1509
01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:54.890
<v Speaker 2>But if I got bits that aren't on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't been on television have </v>

1510
01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:54.890
<v Speaker 2>been seeded annual urge you to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you've seen it.</v>

1512
01:02:55.741 --> 01:02:59.130
<v Speaker 2>How have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I also saw youtube clips some asshole</v>

1513
01:02:59.131 --> 01:03:04.131
<v Speaker 2>and the audience is videotaping it now </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are saying that like it's old </v>

1514
01:03:04.131 --> 01:03:04.131
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like god damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't even done yet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know like you can't.</v>

1517
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.020
<v Speaker 2>So like when they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we want to use stream,</v>

1520
01:03:14.811 --> 01:03:16.530
<v Speaker 2>the material comes out I want at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people you know,</v>

1521
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 2>to watching the television show other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the people that have seen me in the</v>

1522
01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:20.820
<v Speaker 2>clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be new shit.</v>

1523
01:03:20.821 --> 01:03:25.821
<v Speaker 2>I want it to the dvd to be all shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not on another dvd and it's not </v>

1524
01:03:25.821 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 2>going to work that way if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking these ustream clips.</v>

1525
01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:32.970
<v Speaker 2>And justin tv shows eveRywhere and so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought the whole thing was too much,</v>

1526
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not that entertaining to like </v>

1527
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.000
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to broadcast every fucking thing you do.</v>

1528
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean with this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think we sit down,</v>

1529
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.830
<v Speaker 2>we do it for two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're Banging out and that's it.</v>

1530
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:49.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to just keep having </v>
<v Speaker 2>content where you're watered down what </v>

1531
01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:49.100
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1532
01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.880
<v Speaker 3>but you have no personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to be a website called gab,</v>

1533
01:03:51.881 --> 01:03:54.580
<v Speaker 3>gab.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to be addicted to,</v>

1534
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:59.020
<v Speaker 3>which was about maybe eight years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was this girl named gabriel gabriel.</v>

1535
01:03:59.021 --> 01:04:04.021
<v Speaker 3>And she's an author in New York city and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she livecast herself via webcam where </v>

1536
01:04:04.601 --> 01:04:09.601
<v Speaker 3>would like refresh every 10 seconds </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was when the internet was </v>

1537
01:04:09.601 --> 01:04:09.601
<v Speaker 3>new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1538
01:04:09.601 --> 01:04:09.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now he's like,</v>

1539
01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.800
<v Speaker 3>that was actually kind of cool back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day.</v>

1540
01:04:11.801 --> 01:04:14.290
<v Speaker 3>So would have three cameras that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>just refresh every 10 seconds.</v>

1541
01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:17.170
<v Speaker 3>But I got addicted to watching it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was so weird.</v>

1542
01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:20.240
<v Speaker 3>She would come home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to the husband,</v>

1543
01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 3>would make dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they would bring the camera into </v>

1544
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:25.550
<v Speaker 3>the bedroom and have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the part I liked the most,</v>

1545
01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:26.620
<v Speaker 3>so I'll watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

1546
01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.930
<v Speaker 3>bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely naked.</v>

1547
01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Was this when people couldn't record </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on?</v>

1548
01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is way before that,</v>

1549
01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:37.270
<v Speaker 3>but it was so addicting and the one day </v>
<v Speaker 3>she just left and it felt like she broke</v>

1550
01:04:37.271 --> 01:04:39.910
<v Speaker 3>up with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beaten off just right.</v>

1551
01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Like if you turned it on there in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of stroke,</v>

1552
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:46.480
<v Speaker 3>15 seconds later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stroke,</v>

1553
01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.220
<v Speaker 3>they stopped.</v>

1554
01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Someone stopped answering the phone or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1555
01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a show.</v>

1556
01:04:53.281 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that movie with William </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baldwin?</v>

1557
01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like william,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Sharon Stone or something.</v>

1558
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 2>A splinter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called.</v>

1559
01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.290
<v Speaker 2>It was about those people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>

1560
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that's moving out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there.</v>

1561
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there a movie where a these </v>
<v Speaker 2>peoples all their whole lives before </v>

1562
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:10.840
<v Speaker 2>mtv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somewhat.</v>

1563
01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I've got the premise totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

1564
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.720
<v Speaker 2>but like something like mtv is a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

1565
01:05:15.721 --> 01:05:20.721
<v Speaker 2>Member ed tv mean that basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicted the rise of the kim </v>

1566
01:05:20.721 --> 01:05:25.441
<v Speaker 2>kardashians type shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean basically that's what that show </v>

1567
01:05:25.441 --> 01:05:27.190
<v Speaker 2>was like and people in the movie was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like so ridiculous.</v>

1568
01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 2>The idea that people would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast their entire lives,</v>

1569
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 2>like how ridiculous I look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the end the message was that it's</v>

1570
01:05:34.571 --> 01:05:35.690
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1571
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:37.830
<v Speaker 2>the message was that it fucked up this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's life.</v>

1572
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 2>He had to stop doIng it to get his shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1573
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile,</v>

1574
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:43.000
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more of those goddamn shows than</v>

1575
01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:44.590
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're real now.</v>

1576
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how many things from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

1577
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:49.630
<v Speaker 2>whatever sliver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1578
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how many things in the past </v>

1579
01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.420
<v Speaker 2>were um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the that people predicted or like a real</v>

1580
01:05:55.421 --> 01:05:58.060
<v Speaker 2>part of life now that were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous back then.</v>

1581
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:01.750
<v Speaker 2>like this idea of mtv doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real part of our life now.</v>

1582
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1583
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 2>it makes you wonder about like mad max </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit like that.</v>

1584
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:10.981
<v Speaker 2>And that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when peak oil comes and people are </v>

1585
01:06:10.981 --> 01:06:10.981
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking shooting at people trying to get</v>

1588
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:18.670
<v Speaker 2>fresh water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1589
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that really could go down </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1590
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:24.070
<v Speaker 6>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I totally believe that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>evangelists that claim they've seen </v>

1636
01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:14.700
<v Speaker 2>world floods is that there was no world </v>

<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you really don't have any idea.</v>

<v Speaker 2>organization of the ufc.</v>

1712
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:39.741

<v Speaker 2>doesn't get nearly as much attention as </v>

1713
01:11:39.741 --> 01:11:40.830
<v Speaker 2>the ufc and uh,</v>

1716
01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:47.150
<v Speaker 2>business contracts and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>jazz,</v>

1717
01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:51.561

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they were thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>because basically in my opinion,</v>

1729
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:17.720
<v Speaker 2>although that's dominated every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>round and at a certain point in time </v>

1730
01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.201
<v Speaker 2>just to had them mounted in a crucifix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just punched him in the face for like a </v>

<v Speaker 2>Their works really good and they kick </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard and he's just so good at </v>

1741
01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:45.920
<v Speaker 2>moving in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1742
01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.601
<v Speaker 2>soccer is all about moving side to side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quick moves to deal with the ball and </v>

1743
01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.680
<v Speaker 2>those guys that are real good at soccer </v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1744
01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 2>that really translates well to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kick,</v>

1745

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:12:56.901 --> 01:13:01.901

<v Speaker 2>and just the ability to spring forward </v>

1748
01:13:01.901 --> 01:13:03.210
<v Speaker 2>and spring back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soccer's a fucking,</v>

1749
01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.950
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place to start,</v>

1750
01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 2>tremendous base for certain types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

<v Speaker 2>How loud were those leg kicks?</v>

1756
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:26.030
<v Speaker 2>The thing about leg kicks is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goldbergs was talking about that it's </v>

1757
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.030

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:27.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a thump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ones that are really hard don't,</v>

1759
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:32.540
<v Speaker 2>they're not as loud because of like say </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hit someone's thigh with your </v>

<v Speaker 2>open hand like that and slap the skin of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his thought,</v>

1761
01:13:33.571 --> 01:13:38.571
<v Speaker 2>it'd be really loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But If you hit their thigh with a </v>

1762
01:13:38.571 --> 01:13:40.911
<v Speaker 2>baseball bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be like a midi thump in the </v>

<v Speaker 2>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shin just digging into the meat of </v>

<v Speaker 2>You really can't appreciate how bad a </v>

1767
01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:54.930

<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it is sanctioned as they invest </v>

1823
01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:07.220
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

<v Speaker 6>in case I forgot.</v>

1829
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:22.200
<v Speaker 6>I guess drawing was probably way more </v>
<v Speaker 6>important a couple of hundred years ago </v>

1832
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:27.610

01:23:14.701 --> 01:23:14.701
<v Speaker 4>of my paintings I look back and I'm </v>

<v Speaker 4>pool table with a monster coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and everything was melting.</v>

1979
01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:25.970

<v Speaker 4>I didn't have to draw it.</v>

1980
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.620
<v Speaker 4>She didn't make me do it.</v>

1981
01:23:27.450 --> 01:23:30.180
<v Speaker 2>My teacher used to say shit to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1982
01:23:30.181 --> 01:23:30.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1984
01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:35.160
<v Speaker 2>If you get a job where you have to draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>a baby for a diaper commercial,</v>

1985
01:23:35.161 --> 01:23:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to see you draw a baby for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>diaper commercial.</v>

1986
01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.790
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:45.360
<v Speaker 4>why are you fucking draw a baby for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>diaper</v>

1988
01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.110
<v Speaker 2>commercial?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1989
01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:51.080
<v Speaker 2>is that my future is what I have to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward to drawn diaper ads.</v>

1990
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Like he was like real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my dream was to do comic book </v>

1991
01:23:57.021 --> 01:24:02.021
<v Speaker 2>illustrations and he was telling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically you need to have skills </v>

1992
01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:05.390
<v Speaker 2>because you're not going to reach those </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams and what if you have a job that's</v>

1993
01:24:05.391 --> 01:24:10.391
<v Speaker 2>just you as an illustrator doing boring </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff where you have to drop boring </v>

1994
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:10.391
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1995
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:12.380
<v Speaker 2>You fucking buzz kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1996
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:16.970
<v Speaker 2>and this guy was just a dumpy physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of shape.</v>

1997
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Unhealthy person and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed all the time and so I killed </v>

1998
01:24:22.311 --> 01:24:24.920
<v Speaker 2>my effectively I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

1999
01:24:24.921 --> 01:24:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I only went for two years to our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our class,</v>

2000
01:24:27.471 --> 01:24:32.471
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was 14 and 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think by the time I went into my </v>

2001
01:24:32.471 --> 01:24:33.020
<v Speaker 2>junior year of high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I said,</v>

2002
01:24:33.021 --> 01:24:34.910
<v Speaker 2>fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of this is annoying.</v>

2003
01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:38.210
<v Speaker 2>So I just drew on my own from then on it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that effectively killed my,</v>

2004
01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.910
<v Speaker 2>my wanting to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to school for art.</v>

2005
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:45.950
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at art colleges and shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and had scholarships lined up and trying</v>

2006
01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:51.041
<v Speaker 2>to figure out where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the only thing I had a chance </v>

2007
01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:52.640
<v Speaker 2>of getting any sort of scholarship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then meanwhile it's just teachers,</v>

2008
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:58.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't realize what a gigantic </v>

2009
01:24:58.090 --> 01:24:58.970
<v Speaker 2>fucking effect having a good or a shitty</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher can have on.</v>

2010
01:24:58.971 --> 01:24:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2011
01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.390
<v Speaker 4>but don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2012
01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:02.900
<v Speaker 4>they're cutting their salaries over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over again.</v>

2013
01:25:02.901 --> 01:25:07.901
<v Speaker 4>I just saw they're cutting it again and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I think teachers should be one of the </v>

2014
01:25:07.901 --> 01:25:08.630
<v Speaker 4>most important things ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2015
01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.850
<v Speaker 4>like up there with doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>ThAt's junk.</v>

2016
01:25:10.851 --> 01:25:11.660
<v Speaker 4>Canton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2017
01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:16.770
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how we were so short when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes shortsighted when it comes to </v>

2018
01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:16.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2019
01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:17.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that?</v>

2020
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:19.780
<v Speaker 4>You're raising the child from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning.</v>

2021
01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:20.490
<v Speaker 4>That should be the most them</v>

2022
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:22.730
<v Speaker 2>important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be huge.</v>

2023
01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.240
<v Speaker 2>People that can influence your children </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people that say mean shit.</v>

2024
01:25:26.241 --> 01:25:31.241
<v Speaker 2>Like I will never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a math teacher in high school who </v>

2025
01:25:31.241 --> 01:25:34.491
<v Speaker 2>was just fucking boring and the class </v>
<v Speaker 2>was boring and she was this black lady </v>

2026
01:25:35.301 --> 01:25:36.680
<v Speaker 2>hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black accent.</v>

2027
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Like she would mispronounce words all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

2028
01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:43.601
<v Speaker 2>She had terrible grammar and yet she </v>
<v Speaker 2>would like shit all over you if you </v>

2029
01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:43.670
<v Speaker 2>didn't understand her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

2030
01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.720
<v Speaker 2>her math problems and she was in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing her math problem and I was bored </v>

2031
01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.590
<v Speaker 2>and I was like drawing or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They usually,</v>

2032
01:25:51.591 --> 01:25:54.890
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do in class and we'll draw</v>
<v Speaker 2>my notebooks and stuff like that and she</v>

2033
01:25:54.891 --> 01:25:59.891
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looks up and she sees me not paying </v>

2034
01:25:59.891 --> 01:25:59.891
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she goes,</v>

2035
01:25:59.891 --> 01:26:04.600
<v Speaker 2>mr rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you like to come up here and do </v>

<v Speaker 6>problems?</v>

2038
01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:12.510
<v Speaker 6>And everybody started fucking and so she</v>

<v Speaker 6>of those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mean eveRybody was laughing.</v>

2045
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 6>of my classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she kicked me out of that.</v>

2046
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2047
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:34.870
<v Speaker 2>that was like the beginning of my time </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a standup comedian because I felt </v>

2048
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:35.600
<v Speaker 2>like I was defending myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wasn't doing anything to you.</v>

2049
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll just sitting there scribbling in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>notebook.</v>

2050
01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I just wasn't paying attention because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was bored out of my fucking head and I </v>

2051
01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:43.550
<v Speaker 2>had problems with authority but she </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2052
01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked to be the,</v>

2053
01:26:44.901 --> 01:26:47.600
<v Speaker 2>the lady to call on you if you ain't </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention,</v>

2054
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she went to get mad.</v>

2055
01:26:49.401 --> 01:26:51.650
<v Speaker 2>But I mean meanwhile this fucking pitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>could even speak.</v>

2056
01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said both.</v>

2057
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to come up here and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>both?</v>

2058
01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I will never forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IT's like in my mind it's like a movie </v>

2059
01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:03.641
<v Speaker 2>playing out because the anger in my head</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this fucking dummy was trying to </v>

2060
01:27:03.641 --> 01:27:08.051
<v Speaker 2>make me look dumb in front of everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I was scribbling and I </v>

2061
01:27:08.051 --> 01:27:08.051
<v Speaker 2>wasn't paying attention to your.</v>

2062
01:27:08.051 --> 01:27:10.490
<v Speaker 2>My.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My opinion on math was always like,</v>

2063
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:12.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math is very essential,</v>

2064
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:16.040
<v Speaker 2>but don't you have calculators now we do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and isn't that like an endless supply of</v>

2065
01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:17.870
<v Speaker 2>batteries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is done.</v>

2066
01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm done [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only a finite amount of things </v>

2067
01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.841
<v Speaker 2>to pay attention to in the day and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give a fuck about these wacky </v>

2068
01:27:25.841 --> 01:27:26.300
<v Speaker 2>equations that you're making me solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>and figure out.</v>

2069
01:27:26.301 --> 01:27:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I know how to add.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to divide.</v>

2070
01:27:28.041 --> 01:27:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I know how to multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is it or are we done here?</v>

2071
01:27:30.961 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I have to keep going?</v>

2072
01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Is this really good that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making me be a fucking square peg</v>

2073
01:27:35.931 --> 01:27:38.090
<v Speaker 2>and fit into your fucking round hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2074
01:27:38.091 --> 01:27:43.091
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do what you want me to </v>

2075
01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:43.091
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is nonsense.</v>

2076
01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:47.290
<v Speaker 2>It's weird nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imaGine going to school </v>

2077
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:47.290
<v Speaker 2>with google</v>

2078
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:47.290
<v Speaker 6>because then I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2079
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:49.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can just search it if I need it.</v>

2080
01:27:49.191 --> 01:27:51.980
<v Speaker 6>I don't get what.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a problem.</v>

2081
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch a lot of documentaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>even when I was a kid and I got in </v>

2082
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:56.990
<v Speaker 2>trouble again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people will say like,</v>

2083
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.890
<v Speaker 2>you're a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you a class clown?</v>

2084
01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Like I was not really class clown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I used to do though is draw a lot </v>

2085
01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.390
<v Speaker 2>of cartoons about our teachers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>gettIng involved in shit.</v>

2086
01:28:05.391 --> 01:28:09.470
<v Speaker 2>And we had this one teacher that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really annoying Mr.</v>

2087
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Holman and h o l m a n very serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was wrong about a lot of shit.</v>

2088
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:15.500
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2089
01:28:15.501 --> 01:28:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking 15 years old and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>

2090
01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:21.260
<v Speaker 2>in class and I was again bored out of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking mind.</v>

2091
01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:26.261
<v Speaker 2>He had a science class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least science custOmers a little </v>

2092
01:28:26.261 --> 01:28:26.261
<v Speaker 2>more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started going on about lake erie,</v>

2093
01:28:26.261 --> 01:28:27.650
<v Speaker 2>lake erie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jerry's a dead lake and this and that.</v>

2094
01:28:27.651 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 2>It started talking about all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollution that's involved in lake erie,</v>

2095
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:35.530
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually I just saw a documentary </v>

2096
01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:35.530
<v Speaker 2>that was on pbs.</v>

2097
01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:35.540
<v Speaker 2>It was talking about the resurgence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lake eerie,</v>

2098
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:38.690
<v Speaker 2>about how leakier they've worked very </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to filter out the water and they've</v>

2099
01:28:38.691 --> 01:28:43.691
<v Speaker 2>done all these different things to cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the pollutants and they've seen a </v>

2100
01:28:43.691 --> 01:28:46.331
<v Speaker 2>resurgence in the fish population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he got all fucking mad at me and I </v>

2101
01:28:46.611 --> 01:28:47.900
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you seen this documentary?</v>

2102
01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.100
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not true.</v>

2103
01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.510
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>

2104
01:28:50.511 --> 01:28:52.460
<v Speaker 2>It's on pbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it last night.</v>

2105
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

2106
01:28:53.601 --> 01:28:54.830
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're just like them.</v>

2107
01:28:54.831 --> 01:28:56.900
<v Speaker 2>So the next time we're in class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2108
01:28:57.110 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 2>he had like these things that would pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>down like projection screens and I</v>

2109
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:07.070
<v Speaker 6>pulled the projection screens up and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>drew cartoons of him and then I,</v>

2110
01:29:08.001 --> 01:29:10.670
<v Speaker 6>I pulled the projection screens down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2111
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I covered him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he went to draw on the chalkboard and</v>

2112
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:18.471
<v Speaker 2>as you pulled the chalkboard up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these fucking cartoons of </v>

2113
01:29:18.471 --> 01:29:19.340
<v Speaker 2>him saying wacky shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had this thing that he would do.</v>

2114
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.630
<v Speaker 2>He would do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this crazy thing with his hands.</v>

2115
01:29:21.631 --> 01:29:24.870
<v Speaker 2>We would move his hands like this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I have this other teacher Mr.</v>

2116
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:26.310
<v Speaker 2>White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was only like five foot two.</v>

2117
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:31.400
<v Speaker 2>So I drew him all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every time I drew I drew him </v>

2118
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:31.400
<v Speaker 2>standing on something,</v>

2119
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:35.660
<v Speaker 6>standing on a box or still in the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>chair or sitting on a stool and I drew </v>

2120
01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:36.690
<v Speaker 6>it just like him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so funny,</v>

2121
01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:37.050
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

2122
01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:42.330
<v Speaker 2>and I had a one in anthropology teacher </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was obsessed with jane goodall and </v>

2123
01:29:42.330 --> 01:29:42.790
<v Speaker 2>the monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2124
01:29:42.791 --> 01:29:44.590
<v Speaker 2>jane goodall lived live with </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees.</v>

2125
01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.890
<v Speaker 2>So I drew this one kid who was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>football player who was a nice kid,</v>

2126
01:29:47.891 --> 01:29:49.990
<v Speaker 2>but he was always kissing her ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he wanted her to like him.</v>

2127
01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.330
<v Speaker 2>So you get better grades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I drew him,</v>

2128
01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.480
<v Speaker 2>banging her and like if I can look like </v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

2129
01:29:55.481 --> 01:29:57.660
<v Speaker 2>it looked like him and I drew him back </v>
<v Speaker 2>at her say,</v>

2130
01:29:57.670 --> 01:29:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

2131
01:29:58.451 --> 01:29:59.650
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give it to me monkeys.</v>

2132
01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.760
<v Speaker 6>I passed it around the class,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2133
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:06.900
<v Speaker 6>like I got suspended on two separate </v>
<v Speaker 6>occasions for drawing cartoons.</v>

2134
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:12.590
<v Speaker 6>I got sent home for trying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the only thing I would normally </v>

2135
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.590
<v Speaker 6>get in trouble for him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did the same things,</v>

2136
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:16.350
<v Speaker 6>but with overhead projectors I would </v>
<v Speaker 6>like penis as there was an indian guy in</v>

2137
01:30:16.351 --> 01:30:18.690
<v Speaker 6>our class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd always make fun of his parts because</v>

2138
01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:21.990
<v Speaker 6>he had really bad farts and then one </v>
<v Speaker 6>time they pulled the whole class out and</v>

2139
01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:23.090
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

2140
01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:28.340
<v Speaker 6>omar has really bad gas because of his </v>
<v Speaker 6>diet and it's not funny and if you guys </v>

2141
01:30:29.401 --> 01:30:34.401
<v Speaker 6>make fun of it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you guys are all going to be in trouble </v>

2142
01:30:34.401 --> 01:30:37.131
<v Speaker 6>and I remember this speech,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so of course then I only drew only for </v>

2143
01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:41.271
<v Speaker 6>the rest of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I draw this indian guy heart and on </v>

2144
01:30:41.271 --> 01:30:41.271
<v Speaker 6>people and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How ridiculous is that you,</v>

2145
01:30:41.290 --> 01:30:44.870
<v Speaker 6>you tell them kids not to make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 6>farts because it's not fun.</v>

2146
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:50.600
<v Speaker 6>How disingenuous is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You cannot tell someone that farts are </v>

2147
01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.060
<v Speaker 6>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As soon as you say farts are funny,</v>

2148
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:53.860
<v Speaker 6>I'm not listening to you because you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not being honest with you.</v>

2149
01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:57.670
<v Speaker 6>You can say farts don't smell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine if he loves fire?</v>

2150
01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.720
<v Speaker 6>It's the people that do this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like fart porn.</v>

2151
01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:03.390
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever seen fart?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fart porn?</v>

2152
01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:08.391
<v Speaker 6>We're dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>get their head right and girls' faces </v>

2153
01:31:08.391 --> 01:31:08.391
<v Speaker 6>and girls fart in their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

2154
01:31:08.391 --> 01:31:09.180
<v Speaker 6>I've got such a hard on now.</v>

2155
01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 6>We've talked about this before about how</v>
<v Speaker 6>your farts smell awesome,</v>

2156
01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:19.650
<v Speaker 6>but other people's foreign military,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your farts smell the bat.</v>

2157
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:22.860
<v Speaker 6>Except once in awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one lets out and you're like ashamed.</v>

2158
01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:26.190
<v Speaker 6>I had one the other daY was never not </v>
<v Speaker 6>wanted by myself,</v>

2159
01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.720
<v Speaker 6>by myself until it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2160
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:31.110
<v Speaker 6>smell my own farts and enjoyment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody does that.</v>

2161
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:33.090
<v Speaker 6>I think even girls do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just don't want to admit it.</v>

2162
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:36.270
<v Speaker 6>Girls cut,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what is that?</v>

2163
01:31:36.271 --> 01:31:36.810
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

2164
01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.040
<v Speaker 6>Why is there an evolution?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2165
01:31:38.041 --> 01:31:39.900
<v Speaker 6>it's got to be something if everyone </v>
<v Speaker 6>does it,</v>

2166
01:31:39.901 --> 01:31:44.901
<v Speaker 6>like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's like your body sending out </v>

2167
01:31:44.901 --> 01:31:45.170
<v Speaker 6>like a spray from mating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but probably from acclimation.</v>

2168
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:53.050
<v Speaker 6>Literally ridiculous theory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Knock up and get pregnant is stick your </v>

2169
01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:59.990
<v Speaker 6>dick fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to make myself what?</v>

2170
01:32:00.090 --> 01:32:05.090
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why do you think that people like </v>

2171
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.090
<v Speaker 4>their own forks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is that a,</v>

2172
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:09.560
<v Speaker 4>that sketch?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's it's food that you ate </v>

2173
01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.260
<v Speaker 4>already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this guy says it's called peaker.</v>

2174
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:11.710
<v Speaker 4>The urge to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smell,</v>

2175
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.300
<v Speaker 4>eat random things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

2176
01:32:13.301 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 4>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2177
01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:20.380
<v Speaker 4>it's people that have mineral </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficiencies to the point where they're </v>

2178
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.360
<v Speaker 4>the paint dirt and the other day how </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird that would be.</v>

2179
01:32:22.361 --> 01:32:24.400
<v Speaker 4>Eating dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like craving it like,</v>

2180
01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:26.560
<v Speaker 4>I need this tO her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you imagine?</v>

2181
01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:27.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kidding.</v>

2182
01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Could easily be wired wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about all the different </v>

2183
01:32:33.230 --> 01:32:36.641
<v Speaker 2>connections inside people's brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now think of people like my friend john </v>

2184
01:32:36.641 --> 01:32:37.280
<v Speaker 2>jacques machado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my original jujitsu instructor,</v>

2185
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:41.900
<v Speaker 2>he was born without his one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his left hand.</v>

2186
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:47.080
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have all of his fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His left hand only has like a thumb and </v>

2187
01:32:48.171 --> 01:32:49.640
<v Speaker 2>like nubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knoW,</v>

2188
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:52.700
<v Speaker 2>and that's how he was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deficient some.</v>

2189
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was exactly.</v>

2190
01:32:55.281 --> 01:32:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Some sort of a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's born without fingers.</v>

2191
01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:01.400
<v Speaker 2>If you're born without fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be born with crazy connections</v>

2192
01:33:01.401 --> 01:33:03.440
<v Speaker 2>in your head that make you love other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's farts.</v>

2193
01:33:03.441 --> 01:33:04.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be,</v>

2194
01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.260
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's possible.</v>

2195
01:33:06.261 --> 01:33:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean we look at like autism and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand about autism,</v>

2196
01:33:09.981 --> 01:33:12.470
<v Speaker 2>but some people who have autism can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy things.</v>

2197
01:33:12.471 --> 01:33:17.471
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a child that can see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place like lists look out the window at </v>

2198
01:33:18.451 --> 01:33:19.040
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>

2199
01:33:19.041 --> 01:33:24.041
<v Speaker 2>like a city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then draw the city and exact detail </v>

2200
01:33:24.041 --> 01:33:26.020
<v Speaker 2>like down to the fucking street signs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and down to the alleyways.</v>

2201
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

2202
01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:29.840
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's videos of a online doing it.</v>

2203
01:33:29.841 --> 01:33:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean he can just look at an image of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place or go to a place and see something</v>

2204
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:36.140
<v Speaker 2>and just completely recreated in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and it's,</v>

2205
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:38.750
<v Speaker 2>he has a version of autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2206
01:33:38.751 --> 01:33:41.150
<v Speaker 2>it's like the whole rain man thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2207
01:33:41.151 --> 01:33:42.080
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2208
01:33:42.130 --> 01:33:43.180
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2209
01:33:43.210 --> 01:33:48.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuCk is going on that you can </v>

2210
01:33:48.210 --> 01:33:49.910
<v Speaker 2>see something and record it like exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you and I have no chance.</v>

2211
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I had a drama backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be all off and I've been in my </v>

2212
01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:58.961
<v Speaker 2>backyard and fucking thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I had to draw it would be all </v>

2213
01:33:58.961 --> 01:33:59.100
<v Speaker 2>fucking wanky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2214
01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.780
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2215
01:34:00.781 --> 01:34:02.550
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a friend that.</v>

2216
01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:06.180
<v Speaker 4>Is that a friend's uncle is that I met </v>
<v Speaker 4>him once,</v>

2217
01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:10.260
<v Speaker 4>I met him once and he's always like </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about like how he used to sit on</v>

2218
01:34:10.261 --> 01:34:12.780
<v Speaker 4>his mom's shoulders during parades and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>

2219
01:34:12.810 --> 01:34:17.760
<v Speaker 4>He met me once though and then every </v>
<v Speaker 4>year he can't stop exactly.</v>

2220
01:34:17.761 --> 01:34:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Talking about me to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she's like,</v>

2221
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 4>where's brian?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And brian said he was going to the store</v>

2222
01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:24.750
<v Speaker 4>one one and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like remember everything about me,</v>

2223
01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:26.680
<v Speaker 4>he buys me gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2224
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:30.730
<v Speaker 4>we broke up a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like duty by guests and,</v>

2225
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:33.750
<v Speaker 4>and he knows everything about you not </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop talking about you,</v>

2226
01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:34.200
<v Speaker 4>but then</v>

2227
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:39.250
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're doing to fuck you did one in </v>

2228
01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:39.280
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's strange man.</v>

2229
01:34:39.281 --> 01:34:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like the potential of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human mind,</v>

2230
01:34:42.341 --> 01:34:43.960
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's because they,</v>

2231
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:49.030
<v Speaker 2>there's obviously something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a disconnect socially that </v>

2232
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:52.530
<v Speaker 2>with people that have autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's sort of like one of </v>

2233
01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:53.320
<v Speaker 2>those things where people who can't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>can hear incredibly.</v>

2234
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:55.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you were,</v>

2235
01:34:55.211 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 2>you were missing one sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your other senses like supercharged?</v>

2236
01:34:59.240 --> 01:34:59.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2237
01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:04.800
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know because sometimes I think </v>

2238
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 4>things like that or I think what if he </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows exactly everything that's going on</v>

2239
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:10.721
<v Speaker 4>but his mouth doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of like when you're so fucked up </v>

2240
01:35:10.721 --> 01:35:10.721
<v Speaker 4>and you're trying to say something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was like,</v>

2241
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:12.300
<v Speaker 4>you can't have your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2242
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:16.340
<v Speaker 4>what you're thinking out in maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

2243
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.090
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2244
01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:19.630
<v Speaker 4>There an affectionate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing with them though.</v>

2245
01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.730
<v Speaker 4>There's a social disconnect and a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>disconnect</v>

2246
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.370
<v Speaker 2>where they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't express themselves,</v>

2247
01:35:25.371 --> 01:35:30.371
<v Speaker 2>they don't smile as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't make eye contact as much as other </v>

2248
01:35:30.371 --> 01:35:30.371
<v Speaker 2>kids do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2249
01:35:30.371 --> 01:35:34.250
<v Speaker 2>but in so doing that and in doing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this incredible focus.</v>

2250
01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a friend whose child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his son has a mild form of asperger's,</v>

2251
01:35:39.531 --> 01:35:43.430
<v Speaker 2>was like an autism type of thing and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>son is a jujitsu wizard.</v>

2252
01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.220
<v Speaker 2>The kids or an assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's really,</v>

2253
01:35:46.221 --> 01:35:47.340
<v Speaker 2>really fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2254
01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.940
<v Speaker 2>like goes at a head to head with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>world champions.</v>

2255
01:35:49.941 --> 01:35:51.350
<v Speaker 2>He's like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

2256
01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:56.500
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good is he has this intense ability to </v>

2257
01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.610
<v Speaker 2>focus on things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not so good socially,</v>

2258
01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:00.830
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so good at like having buddies.</v>

2259
01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:02.900
<v Speaker 2>But goddamn you get on the mat with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

2260
01:36:02.901 --> 01:36:07.901
<v Speaker 2>he remembers every move and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>countering your moves and advancing and </v>

2261
01:36:07.901 --> 01:36:07.901
<v Speaker 2>moving forward.</v>

2262
01:36:07.901 --> 01:36:10.130
<v Speaker 2>And he taps like really high level black</v>
<v Speaker 2>belts all the time.</v>

2263
01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:15.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like autistic doesn't necessarily </v>

2264
01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:15.730
<v Speaker 2>mean super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super intelligent,</v>

2265
01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:19.430
<v Speaker 2>doesn't necessarily mean you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a rain man type genius.</v>

2266
01:36:19.431 --> 01:36:22.640
<v Speaker 2>But it has the potential it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which makes me think,</v>

2267
01:36:22.641 --> 01:36:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2268
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:27.020
<v Speaker 2>almost like there's so many people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are autistic dude.</v>

2269
01:36:27.021 --> 01:36:29.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like one out of 100 now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2270
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:34.010
<v Speaker 2>and it's advancing over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it's possible that,</v>

2271
01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:39.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people say that it's due to </v>

2272
01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:39.040
<v Speaker 2>environmental conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be due to pollution,</v>

2273
01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:43.690
<v Speaker 2>it could be due to diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be due to the hormones in our </v>

2274
01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:45.560
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different theories on</v>

2275
01:36:45.561 --> 01:36:50.561
<v Speaker 2>what causes autism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's happening in much greater </v>

2276
01:36:50.561 --> 01:36:55.061
<v Speaker 2>numbers than it ever has before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's debatable as well because </v>

2277
01:36:55.061 --> 01:36:55.061
<v Speaker 2>some people say it's not.</v>

2278
01:36:55.061 --> 01:36:58.990
<v Speaker 2>There's just more people are diagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 2>as being autistic now because they've </v>

2279
01:36:58.990 --> 01:36:58.990
<v Speaker 2>changed the diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

2280
01:36:58.990 --> 01:37:03.380
<v Speaker 2>that's under debate as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if it's sort of a next stage of</v>

2281
01:37:03.381 --> 01:37:06.740
<v Speaker 2>evolution would have emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with,</v>

2282
01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way a human beings.</v>

2283
01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I've always beeN like really emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what if that's not going to be </v>

2284
01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:17.711
<v Speaker 2>necessary in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if that's slowly being phased out </v>

2285
01:37:17.711 --> 01:37:21.550
<v Speaker 2>because human beings don't have to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>our fight or flight reflexes and </v>

2286
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:26.111
<v Speaker 2>instincts anymore because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not running from saber tooth </v>

2287
01:37:26.111 --> 01:37:26.111
<v Speaker 2>tigers and shed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

2288
01:37:26.111 --> 01:37:30.640
<v Speaker 2>We're just dealing with civilized </v>
<v Speaker 2>society and that society becomes more </v>

2289
01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.390
<v Speaker 2>and more civilized and as society </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes more and more modern,</v>

2290
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:36.260
<v Speaker 2>more people are born with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>detachment from emotions.</v>

2291
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:41.650
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is because of amish people and </v>

2292
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:46.760
<v Speaker 2>amish people live their life in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional old school,</v>

2293
01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:47.880
<v Speaker 2>sort of a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

2294
01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:50.020
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a fucked up wacky religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2295
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:55.030
<v Speaker 2>they drove around the horse driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>buggies and they build their own houses </v>

2296
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.990
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if</v>

2297
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:58.740
<v Speaker 6>they even use electricity to some of </v>
<v Speaker 6>these women use electricity,</v>

2298
01:37:58.741 --> 01:38:03.741
<v Speaker 6>some of them driving a regular car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of them have real jobs and they're </v>

2299
01:38:03.741 --> 01:38:04.000
<v Speaker 6>amish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just depends on what kind of learners</v>

2300
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:04.960
<v Speaker 6>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

2301
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000
<v Speaker 6>but the whole premise originally was </v>
<v Speaker 6>that these people lived like a certain </v>

2302
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.760
<v Speaker 6>group of people hundreds of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2303
01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 6>they have a much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much,</v>

2304
01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:17.410
<v Speaker 6>much lower.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a history or much,</v>

2305
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.430
<v Speaker 6>much lower numbers of autistic children,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much lower.</v>

2306
01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:24.030
<v Speaker 6>It might be just something like cell </v>
<v Speaker 6>phones and the signals are cell phones,</v>

2307
01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:27.030
<v Speaker 6>beepers and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and all this shit that started making it</v>

2308
01:38:27.031 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 6>increase orange,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like splenda,</v>

2309
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:34.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it could be something we're not even </v>

2310
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.310
<v Speaker 6>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't know.</v>

2311
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:37.311
<v Speaker 6>And that's what skip aspartame,</v>
<v Speaker 6>aspartame and shit like that could </v>

2312
01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:38.360
<v Speaker 6>easily be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't know the only way to do that.</v>

2313
01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:40.050
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of theories about,</v>

2314
01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:40.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2315
01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:43.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people say that a lot of people,</v>

2316
01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:48.351
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of anecdotal evidence </v>
<v Speaker 6>about vaccinations and there's a lot of </v>

2317
01:38:48.351 --> 01:38:51.471
<v Speaker 6>people say there's no scientific </v>
<v Speaker 6>connection whatsoever and people always </v>

2318
01:38:51.471 --> 01:38:51.810
<v Speaker 6>want to jump on that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your tinfoil hat.</v>

2319
01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:52.610
<v Speaker 6>But this whole thing about</v>

2320
01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.280
<v Speaker 2>autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people don't realize,</v>

2321
01:38:54.281 --> 01:38:59.281
<v Speaker 2>there's thousands of people have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid off by the autism court of America </v>

2322
01:38:59.281 --> 01:39:04.170
<v Speaker 2>because of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the exact title of the </v>

2323
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:04.170
<v Speaker 2>court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe it is autism court,</v>

2324
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:04.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not autism core,</v>

2325
01:39:04.781 --> 01:39:06.250
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccination court,</v>

2326
01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:07.850
<v Speaker 2>like the vac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

2327
01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:10.900
<v Speaker 2>let me find the exact number in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact,</v>

2328
01:39:10.901 --> 01:39:14.740
<v Speaker 2>a theory because I'm one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy's,</v>

2329
01:39:14.741 --> 01:39:19.741
<v Speaker 2>I think Robert Kennedy jr is a heavily </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in this shit and a lot of </v>

2330
01:39:19.741 --> 01:39:22.920
<v Speaker 2>people have been paid off by vaccine </v>
<v Speaker 2>court because a,</v>

2331
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:25.950
<v Speaker 2>and it's in the thousands of families </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of their,</v>

2332
01:39:25.951 --> 01:39:29.710
<v Speaker 2>their children suffering from brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage after being vaccinated,</v>

2333
01:39:29.711 --> 01:39:34.711
<v Speaker 2>that they had brain swelling and brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage and they received sizable a </v>

2334
01:39:34.711 --> 01:39:35.230
<v Speaker 2>rewards from the courts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2335
01:39:35.231 --> 01:39:39.970
<v Speaker 2>if that's really true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we not know that you know you,</v>

2336
01:39:39.971 --> 01:39:42.430
<v Speaker 2>you're not damaging other shit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccinations,</v>

2337
01:39:42.431 --> 01:39:47.431
<v Speaker 2>especially like heavy duty vaccinations </v>
<v Speaker 2>with through marisol and all that stuff </v>

2338
01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:47.431
<v Speaker 2>that's been linked.</v>

2339
01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean the stuff that they've removed </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

2340
01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:53.660
<v Speaker 2>from vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real heavy debated issue because </v>

2341
01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:55.690
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to thank a few people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have had their children vaccinated.</v>

2342
01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:00.840
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to think that they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done anything wrong to their children </v>

2343
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:00.840
<v Speaker 2>and people have children that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>autistic.</v>

2344
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.070
<v Speaker 2>They want to blame someone and so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to blame the vaccination.</v>

2345
01:40:03.071 --> 01:40:04.430
<v Speaker 2>But the bottom line is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2346
01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:09.450
<v Speaker 2>you're injecting chemicals into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby when you're not even supposed to </v>

2347
01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:12.661
<v Speaker 2>give kids fucking peanut butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not even supposed to give babies </v>

2348
01:40:12.661 --> 01:40:13.210
<v Speaker 2>peanut butter because they might have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>peanut allergy,</v>

2349
01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.030
<v Speaker 2>but yet you can shoot them up with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking chemicals.</v>

2350
01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.470
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2351
01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:20.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole jenny mccarthy debate.</v>

2352
01:40:20.171 --> 01:40:25.171
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she's running around saying </v>

2353
01:40:25.171 --> 01:40:25.171
<v Speaker 2>that vaccinations cause autism to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

2354
01:40:25.171 --> 01:40:29.611
<v Speaker 2>but I have friends that say their kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>were more and we have a friend that we </v>

2355
01:40:29.611 --> 01:40:32.611
<v Speaker 2>know that his kid got the measles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mumps and rubella and then instantly was</v>

2356
01:40:33.161 --> 01:40:35.950
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like instantly became detached,</v>

2357
01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:38.350
<v Speaker 2>got fucking weird and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2358
01:40:38.351 --> 01:40:42.400
<v Speaker 2>and the kid has some serious autism now </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's connected or whether</v>

2359
01:40:42.401 --> 01:40:47.401
<v Speaker 2>or not he had a preexisting condition </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was exacerbated by those </v>

2360
01:40:47.401 --> 01:40:47.401
<v Speaker 2>vaccinations.</v>

2361
01:40:47.401 --> 01:40:51.840
<v Speaker 2>That's possible as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But who the fuck knows what's causing </v>

2362
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.090
<v Speaker 2>all this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

2363
01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:53.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the of pollution,</v>

2364
01:40:53.801 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 2>the higher levels of carbon dioxide in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>

2365
01:40:56.501 --> 01:40:57.620
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2366
01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:00.040
<v Speaker 2>the preservatives in food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

2367
01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:01.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be a bunch of shit,</v>

2368
01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:06.660
<v Speaker 2>but it also could be the civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be the fact that as </v>

2369
01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:09.510
<v Speaker 2>civilization progress is the need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all these emotions and the need to,</v>

2370
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:12.940
<v Speaker 2>to exist the way people have always </v>
<v Speaker 2>existed as is morphing.</v>

2371
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.410
<v Speaker 2>It's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2372
01:41:14.411 --> 01:41:16.570
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be like fucking aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2373
01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:21.571
<v Speaker 2>if you think about like all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depictions of aliens and a science </v>

2374
01:41:21.571 --> 01:41:21.610
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the advanced aliens,</v>

2375
01:41:21.611 --> 01:41:24.460
<v Speaker 2>they're always super unemotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take me to your leader,</v>

2376
01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:25.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that type of shit.</v>

2377
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:30.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like we kind of inherently know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that emotions are sort of holding back </v>

2378
01:41:30.930 --> 01:41:34.150
<v Speaker 2>progress and as human beings become </v>
<v Speaker 2>super technical or super,</v>

2379
01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:39.180
<v Speaker 2>super technologically evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that eventually we're going to get to a </v>

2380
01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.600
<v Speaker 2>point where we're not irrational and </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional,</v>

2381
01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.800
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think about like the shit that </v>

2382
01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:45.800
<v Speaker 2>happened with that crazy girl that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>you arrested.</v>

2383
01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:45.800
<v Speaker 2>LIke what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

2384
01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.070
<v Speaker 2>It's nutty emotions like chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>

2385
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:50.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about almost all murder.</v>

2386
01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:55.220
<v Speaker 6>Why japanese people never have domestic </v>
<v Speaker 6>violence issues or have any issues to </v>

2387
01:41:58.171 --> 01:42:01.290
<v Speaker 6>support this one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2388
01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:01.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

2389
01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:04.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2390
01:42:04.081 --> 01:42:07.020
<v Speaker 2>but you think about that like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we think about like alien life,</v>

2391
01:42:07.021 --> 01:42:08.760
<v Speaker 2>super advanced alien life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2392
01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:14.180
<v Speaker 2>the guy from the day the earth stood </v>
<v Speaker 2>still was always super stoic and </v>

2393
01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:17.511
<v Speaker 2>unemotional and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we kind of inherently know that </v>

2394
01:42:17.611 --> 01:42:19.800
<v Speaker 2>that is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's where we're headed.</v>

2395
01:42:19.801 --> 01:42:21.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's autism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2396
01:42:21.991 --> 01:42:26.991
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a fucked up thing to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean maybe all these people like </v>

2397
01:42:26.991 --> 01:42:29.940
<v Speaker 2>one out of 100 have autism and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate as to whether or not it's been,</v>

2398
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do,</v>

2399
01:42:30.971 --> 01:42:34.380
<v Speaker 2>they've changed the diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the case and I'll</v>

2400
01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:34.860
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2401
01:42:34.861 --> 01:42:36.810
<v Speaker 2>either it debate as to what is causing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2402
01:42:36.811 --> 01:42:40.470
<v Speaker 2>but the only way you know what's causing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as you take the exact same biological</v>

2403
01:42:40.471 --> 01:42:42.960
<v Speaker 2>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do a bunch of shit to him.</v>

2404
01:42:43.110 --> 01:42:45.210
<v Speaker 2>He has autIsm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go back in time,</v>

2405

<v Speaker 2>If he develops autism,</v>

01:42:47.581 --> 01:42:48.840
<v Speaker 2>you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start removing things.</v>

2407
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:51.140
<v Speaker 2>other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just speculation when you're</v>

2408
01:42:51.141 --> 01:42:53.520

01:44:00.461 --> 01:44:01.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>off the internet.</v>

2443
01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:17.090

<v Speaker 4>like if you want to find this as certain</v>

2444
01:44:17.091 --> 01:44:18.320

<v Speaker 4>it was important.</v>

2445
01:44:18.610 --> 01:44:20.990
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these websites all work </v>
<v Speaker 4>together like these,</v>

2446
01:44:20.991 --> 01:44:23.710
<v Speaker 4>these unicorns and stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>their main movies off all these </v>

2449
01:44:31.151 --> 01:44:31.700
<v Speaker 4>websites,</v>

2558
01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:54.970
<v Speaker 2>they defraud people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shorted.</v>

2559
01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:58.180
<v Speaker 2>What they did was they sold people a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of,</v>

2560
01:48:58.181 --> 01:49:03.181
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they told people to buy things and then </v>

2561
01:49:03.181 --> 01:49:05.611
<v Speaker 2>they banked against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they told people that we're shorting </v>

2562
01:49:05.611 --> 01:49:06.580
<v Speaker 2>means is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if you decide that,</v>

2563
01:49:06.581 --> 01:49:07.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2564
01:49:07.481 --> 01:49:08.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the market and you say,</v>

2565
01:49:08.861 --> 01:49:10.450
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this company is going to take a shit.</v>

2566
01:49:10.451 --> 01:49:15.451
<v Speaker 2>They're going to fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you keep selling that company to </v>

2567
01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:15.910
<v Speaker 2>your clients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep telling them,</v>

2568
01:49:15.911 --> 01:49:20.911
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should invest in this company </v>

2569
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:20.911
<v Speaker 2>because this company is a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment.</v>

2570
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:24.630
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile you're shorting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means you're betting that that </v>

2571
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:25.450
<v Speaker 2>company is going to fail on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they made tons of money.</v>

2572
01:49:25.451 --> 01:49:30.451
<v Speaker 2>They basically fucked over their </v>
<v Speaker 2>customers and manipulated the whole </v>

2573
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:32.970
<v Speaker 2>system and made fucking hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars for this and there's</v>

2574
01:49:32.971 --> 01:49:37.971
<v Speaker 2>this guy matt taibbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's been writing about this in wall </v>

2575
01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:40.330
<v Speaker 2>street in a rolling stone magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating and infuriating articles all</v>

<v Speaker 2>about the corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's involved in wall street and it's </v>

2577
01:49:45.331 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 2>fucking mind blowing that they can still</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull that shit in 2010.</v>

2578
01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:50.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one thing that I sit on stage to</v>

2579
01:49:50.421 --> 01:49:52.180
<v Speaker 2>stage this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about this a lot.</v>

2580
01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Like you know when people talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you don't understand the economy is</v>

2581
01:49:54.551 --> 01:49:56.530
<v Speaker 2>complicated and here's what I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

2582
01:49:56.531 --> 01:49:58.150
<v Speaker 2>There's the same amount of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2583
01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the same amount of shit,</v>

2584
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.910
<v Speaker 2>the same amount of metal st,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of materials,</v>

2585
01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.750
<v Speaker 2>the same amount of people buying things.</v>

2586
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck did all the money go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

2587
01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Well good though the stoCk market </v>
<v Speaker 2>crashed and the housIng market was </v>

2588
01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.520
<v Speaker 2>inflated and fell upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you eating?</v>

2589
01:50:15.521 --> 01:50:20.521
<v Speaker 2>Saying what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me that means that the system is </v>

2590
01:50:20.521 --> 01:50:23.941
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means the whole system is fucking </v>

2591
01:50:23.941 --> 01:50:26.461
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone knows that system is </v>

2592
01:50:26.461 --> 01:50:28.231
<v Speaker 2>bullshit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he says it's not that </v>

2593
01:50:28.231 --> 01:50:30.571
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm surprised of is that it keeps </v>

2594
01:50:30.571 --> 01:50:30.571
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about this before,</v>

2595
01:50:30.571 --> 01:50:35.020
<v Speaker 2>that our system is like our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our system of government is like windows</v>

2596
01:50:35.021 --> 01:50:40.021
<v Speaker 2>98 and then the windows 95 was like 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>viruses and we're just throwing patches </v>

2597
01:50:40.031 --> 01:50:41.220
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to fix things,</v>

2598
01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:43.690
<v Speaker 2>trying to work around stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's really what it's like.</v>

2599
01:50:43.691 --> 01:50:48.691
<v Speaker 2>It's like this ancient fucking stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that doesn't work and it crashes </v>

2600
01:50:49.001 --> 01:50:52.060
<v Speaker 2>all the time and it's got all these bugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's filled with corruption,</v>

2601
01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:52.900
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2602
01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:56.320
<v Speaker 2>And yet still there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no solutions for it.</v>

2603
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Move to an island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do it?</v>

2604

<v Speaker 2>How about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going back to manual.</v>

2607
01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:11.920
<v Speaker 2>You have people to talk about how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate society the way it is right now.</v>

2608
01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:15.340
<v Speaker 2>You would be so fucking happy if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>move to an island.</v>

2609
01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:17.650
<v Speaker 2>You had to work for a living to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back here.</v>

2610
01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:22.770
<v Speaker 2>You'd be so happy to go back to wildlife</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean probably could never make enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>to buy like something huge or anything,</v>

2625
01:51:54.010 --> 01:51:58.120
<v Speaker 4>but it gets bought by a private relies </v>
<v Speaker 4>on credit and stuff like that as a life.</v>

2626
01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:58.720
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>dude that checks out.</v>

2631
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:07.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like an expatriate moves to </v>

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he could live 40 years.</v>

2663
01:53:28.521 --> 01:53:30.980
<v Speaker 4>What does he want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when he retired as you have a thing</v>

2664
01:53:30.981 --> 01:53:32.160
<v Speaker 4>that he wants,</v>

01:53:32.250 --> 01:53:37.250
<v Speaker 4>he's just like me but with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have computers so he does </v>

2666
01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:37.970
<v Speaker 4>everything else but like electronics and</v>
<v Speaker 4>building things.</v>

2667
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:41.420
<v Speaker 4>So he will make like a hot tub and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>living room,</v>

2668
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:43.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that build his own.</v>

<v Speaker 4>TheY keep people happy man.</v>

2673
01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:56.081
<v Speaker 4>Hobbies and things do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he can invent something and sell </v>

2674
01:53:56.081 --> 01:53:56.081
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he should concentrate on trying to</v>

2675
01:53:56.081 --> 01:54:00.491
<v Speaker 4>do that while he's been trying to break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was a perpetual motion for the longest </v>

2676
01:54:00.491 --> 01:54:03.641
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he has all these perpetual motion </v>

2677
01:54:03.641 --> 01:54:04.280
<v Speaker 4>machines in his basement and you'd go in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and just magnets with bike bikes,</v>

2678
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:05.960
<v Speaker 4>sickle tires and like.</v>

2679
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:09.010
<v Speaker 4>And he's got like 15 patents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he builds things all the time.</v>

2680
01:54:09.011 --> 01:54:14.011
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that it's like he builds a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer that gets right on out of your </v>

2681
01:54:14.011 --> 01:54:14.450
<v Speaker 4>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2682
01:54:14.451 --> 01:54:15.200
<v Speaker 4>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2683
01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:17.030
<v Speaker 4>What's radon gas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2684
01:54:17.031 --> 01:54:20.070
<v Speaker 4>why doesn't he just a co.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that seems like a,</v>

2685
01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:22.100
<v Speaker 4>like a really promising avenue to pursue</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2686
01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Is that creative?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he should just think about that.</v>

2687
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:28.580
<v Speaker 4>Think about retiring and using all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to try to come up with some new way</v>

2688
01:54:28.581 --> 01:54:29.640
<v Speaker 4>to make income.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2689
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.940
<v Speaker 4>That's what I told him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He needs to like make something.</v>

2690
01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:33.230
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

2693
01:54:39.261 --> 01:54:41.030
<v Speaker 4>better to take that chance at 60.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they'll take their chance.</v>

2694
01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.530
<v Speaker 4>When you're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're almost dead.</v>

2695
01:54:42.531 --> 01:54:43.130

<v Speaker 4>god,</v>

2696
01:54:43.131 --> 01:54:44.540
<v Speaker 4>I should have done something </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

2697
01:54:44.770 --> 01:54:45.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if he,</v>

01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:48.140
<v Speaker 4>what if he makes it and one falls </v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly starts making a good living off</v>

2699
01:54:48.141 --> 01:54:53.141
<v Speaker 4>of something he created and get up at </v>
<v Speaker 4>noon and fucking go to the coffee shop </v>

2700
01:54:53.661 --> 01:54:54.760
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2701
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:55.880
<v Speaker 4>check this out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check this out.</v>

2702
01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.220
<v Speaker 4>How crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes things happen in life,</v>

2703
01:54:58.221 --> 01:54:58.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2704
01:54:59.010 --> 01:55:02.300
<v Speaker 4>they were supposed to come out and visit</v>
<v Speaker 4>me next month and he was going to retire</v>

2705
01:55:02.301 --> 01:55:07.301
<v Speaker 4>the following month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my stepmom was thinking about </v>

2706
01:55:07.301 --> 01:55:07.301
<v Speaker 4>retiring the following month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2707
01:55:07.301 --> 01:55:09.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I broke up with my relationships.</v>

2708
01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:14.380
<v Speaker 4>So they decided not to come the </v>
<v Speaker 4>following day after deciding not to </v>

2709
01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:15.540
<v Speaker 4>come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're getting late.</v>

2710
01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:20.541
<v Speaker 4>My step mom's getting laid off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because she had like over a week of </v>

2711
01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:23.630
<v Speaker 4>vacation time set aside that she'd never</v>
<v Speaker 4>used.</v>

2712
01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:28.660
<v Speaker 4>They have to like force some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like year pension plan or whatever the </v>

2713
01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:31.280
<v Speaker 4>bottom line is just because she didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't take that vacation.</v>

2714
01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:34.520
<v Speaker 4>She gets paid for a year for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An extra year.</v>

2715
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:36.620
<v Speaker 4>So she would have visited me and bought </v>
<v Speaker 4>that ticket.</v>

2716
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:41.790
<v Speaker 4>She would have been screwed by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>corporate world because I love when the </v>

2717
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:45.860
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe in fate and stuff like </v>

2718
01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:45.860
<v Speaker 4>that and like things that happened for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

2719
01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:49.911
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's kind of set out and you </v>

2720
01:55:49.911 --> 01:55:50.240
<v Speaker 4>really can't change it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to be cynical.</v>

2721
01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:53.200
<v Speaker 2>I love that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also seems sometimes like,</v>

2722
01:55:53.201 --> 01:55:55.570
<v Speaker 2>it almost seems like life is scripted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2723
01:55:55.571 --> 01:55:58.660
<v Speaker 2>and in your situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it seems like at some time in my</v>

2724
01:55:58.661 --> 01:56:03.661
<v Speaker 2>situation in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sometimes it seems so ridiculous </v>

2725
01:56:03.661 --> 01:56:05.770
<v Speaker 2>that it almost seems like we are living </v>
<v Speaker 2>our own movie,</v>

2726
01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:06.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2727
01:56:06.610 --> 01:56:07.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>

2728
01:56:07.931 --> 01:56:12.020
<v Speaker 2>And the more gonzo the fucking news gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the more bizarro,</v>

2729
01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2730
01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:14.350
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture gets,</v>

2731
01:56:14.351 --> 01:56:15.640
<v Speaker 2>the more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a movie,</v>

2732
01:56:15.641 --> 01:56:18.340
<v Speaker 2>the more it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost seems fake.</v>

2733
01:56:18.610 --> 01:56:20.470
<v Speaker 2>It almost seems like we're living in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream,</v>

2734
01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:25.740
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at some of the things </v>

2735
01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:25.970
<v Speaker 2>that happen to certain people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2736
01:56:25.971 --> 01:56:26.650
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

2737
01:56:26.651 --> 01:56:27.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it attributable?</v>

2738
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Trivial is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

2739
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:34.830
<v Speaker 2>can you attribute it to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've lived positive life and so good </v>

2740
01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:36.640
<v Speaker 2>things are happening to them and is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>karma?</v>

2741
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:41.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's karma real because that's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the trippiest spiciest of notions</v>

2742
01:56:41.291 --> 01:56:43.540
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that what's really going on?</v>

2743
01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Or is it because there's a grand plot to</v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

2744
01:56:47.610 --> 01:56:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Is it because life is like a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematical equation and there's like a</v>

2745
01:56:51.131 --> 01:56:56.131
<v Speaker 2>set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a set result it's going to </v>

2746
01:56:56.131 --> 01:56:58.381
<v Speaker 2>happen no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all working towards that set </v>

2747
01:56:58.381 --> 01:56:59.560
<v Speaker 2>result and you getting a certain job and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you meeting a certain person is all part</v>

2748
01:56:59.561 --> 01:57:02.470
<v Speaker 2>of the grand plan of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking weird.</v>

2749
01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:03.410
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2750
01:57:03.570 --> 01:57:06.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you can't say one or the other.</v>

2751
01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:09.850
<v Speaker 2>You can't say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in fate and fate is real mean.</v>

2752
01:57:09.851 --> 01:57:12.580
<v Speaker 2>You should consider it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also can't say fate's not real.</v>

2753
01:57:12.581 --> 01:57:17.581
<v Speaker 2>And you know you decide your own destiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know if that's true </v>

2754
01:57:17.581 --> 01:57:17.581
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2755
01:57:17.581 --> 01:57:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are a weird combination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology,</v>

2756
01:57:20.230 --> 01:57:23.620
<v Speaker 2>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences of genetics.</v>

2757
01:57:23.621 --> 01:57:24.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2758
01:57:24.181 --> 01:57:25.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2759
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:29.200
<v Speaker 2>how you interpret the life experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people you come in contact with that</v>

2760
01:57:29.201 --> 01:57:31.030
<v Speaker 2>help you rethink the way you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2761
01:57:31.170 --> 01:57:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people have you ever met that </v>

2762
01:57:36.170 --> 01:57:36.170
<v Speaker 2>inspire you and literally change the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about those?</v>

2763
01:57:37.170 --> 01:57:42.170
<v Speaker 4>It makes me wonder if I was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet and go through this experience and </v>

2764
01:57:42.170 --> 01:57:46.130
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times I just want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like that last sound is going on </v>

2765
01:57:46.130 --> 01:57:46.420
<v Speaker 4>in the back of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2766
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:49.050
<v Speaker 4>because it just seems like it's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2767
01:57:49.051 --> 01:57:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just</v>

2768
01:57:50.410 --> 01:57:51.830
<v Speaker 2>a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like quick,</v>

2769
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:56.870
<v Speaker 2>like some shit just seems fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it is because you live </v>

2770
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:57.610
<v Speaker 2>in your life the right way or you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll a lot of is you live in real life</v>

2771
01:57:57.611 --> 01:57:59.780
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not being shitty to anybody.</v>

2772
01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:01.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>karma is a real thing.</v>

2773
01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:06.441
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe karma is or that's why this </v>

2774
01:58:06.441 --> 01:58:06.441
<v Speaker 4>fuck that's ratting out larry king's </v>
<v Speaker 4>wife.</v>

2775
01:58:06.441 --> 01:58:08.490
<v Speaker 4>He's going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit's gonna hit the fan for you son.</v>

2776
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:09.880
<v Speaker 4>You know he's gonna have nipple camp </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainty.</v>

2777
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:12.820
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2778
01:58:12.821 --> 01:58:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2779
01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:18.610
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those subjects where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are very polarized on it,</v>

2780
01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>

2781
01:58:20.231 --> 01:58:25.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will people will argue vehemently that </v>

2782
01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:25.840
<v Speaker 2>their size correct because it's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2783
01:58:25.930 --> 01:58:28.420
<v Speaker 2>like a windows versus mac argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2784
01:58:28.421 --> 01:58:30.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like a religion versus atheism </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

2785
01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:31.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2786
01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:35.110
<v Speaker 2>people want to be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have choose a stance,</v>

2787
01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.480
<v Speaker 2>they choose a camp that they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2788
01:58:37.481 --> 01:58:39.820
<v Speaker 2>and that's fate is one of the weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

2789
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fate.</v>

2790
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to the idea that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that life really is like some sort of a </v>

2791
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:49.750
<v Speaker 2>gigantic equation and that it's moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards something I don't know.</v>

2792
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I trY to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to keep an open mind about all of </v>

2793
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:57.050
<v Speaker 2>that stuff because I think as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you decide that you have the </v>

2794
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.050
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way or another,</v>

2795
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>you're being silly.</v>

2796
01:58:57.390 --> 01:59:02.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because Then you're going to block off </v>

2797
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.390
<v Speaker 4>with and only hear what you want to hear</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you're,</v>

2798
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.930
<v Speaker 4>you're living the right,</v>

2799
01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:04.050
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2800
01:59:04.051 --> 01:59:09.051
<v Speaker 2>we have friends that believe in nutty </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and we've had conversations with </v>

2801
01:59:09.051 --> 01:59:12.951
<v Speaker 2>these friends that believe in nutty </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and you can tell they are not </v>

2802
01:59:12.951 --> 01:59:14.940
<v Speaker 2>even considering the fact that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutty things they believe in are in fact</v>

2803
01:59:14.941 --> 01:59:16.600
<v Speaker 2>just nutty things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2804
01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2805
01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:19.100
<v Speaker 2>that's a disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2806
01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you said it best when you said </v>

2807
01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:24.390
<v Speaker 2>you're not keeping everything on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

2808
01:59:24.690 --> 01:59:26.610
<v Speaker 2>That's rule number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rule number one,</v>

2809
01:59:26.611 --> 01:59:27.060
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep up</v>

2810
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:30.000
<v Speaker 4>even when you have 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything on the table,</v>

2811
01:59:30.001 --> 01:59:33.880
<v Speaker 4>like a positive on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why even bother taking the table away?</v>

2812
01:59:33.881 --> 01:59:35.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if something comes up,</v>

2813
01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.060
<v Speaker 4>it'd be no reason that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2814
01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get married to a,</v>

2815
01:59:39.011 --> 01:59:42.170
<v Speaker 2>an answer a yes or a no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A side of.</v>

2816
01:59:42.230 --> 01:59:43.950
<v Speaker 2>For or against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2817
01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like anything else.</v>

2818
01:59:46.030 --> 01:59:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are very insecure and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2819
01:59:49.211 --> 01:59:53.500
<v Speaker 2>our life inherently is insecure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that I think we try to,</v>

2820
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:58.950
<v Speaker 2>we try to put things in a box so that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can deal with them when they're in a </v>

2821
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.950
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

2822
01:59:58.950 --> 02:00:00.730
<v Speaker 2>We've got labeled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wrapped up.</v>

2823
02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2824
02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:03.220
<v Speaker 2>God is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in that box.</v>

2825
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2826
02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:07.060
<v Speaker 2>do we like windows and mac?</v>

02:00:09.611 --> 02:00:12.310
<v Speaker 2>We're move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas for pc,</v>

2829
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:15.300
<v Speaker 2>getting to this is just for idiots.</v>
